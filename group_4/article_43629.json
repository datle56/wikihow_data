      "content": "A textured fringe is a fringe that's been layered to appear more textural. The hair at the front of the scalp is cut into multiple layers, which creates the illusion of more volume and movement. The bottom edge of the fringe can extend to the middle of the forehead or the brows and is typically snipped vertically with scissors or shaved with a razor blade to produce a choppy, edgy look. [1] X Research source The textured fringe is a popular haircut for young men on TikTok, with tutorials from @ptrck_ho and @pinoyblendz generating millions of views. What face shape suits textured fringe? A textured fringe haircut suits all face shapes and looks great with any hair type (although wavy and curly hair types tend to see the best results). It's also suitable for women as well as men."

      "content": "Ask your stylist or barber for a textured fringe and give them visual inspo. If there's a specific look you're trying to achieve that you saw on social media, show them a picture or a video so they know what to do. The main goal they need to accomplish is cutting layers into the hair on the frontal portion of your scalp while still leaving the hair long enough to hang out over your forehead. Specify the length you want for your fringe. For example, you may want the fringe to skim your eyebrows, or you may like a shorter variation with the edges of the hair extending only to the center of your forehead. Ask your barber or stylist to use a razor to freehand trim small sections of your fringe at a time. This will provide maximum definition and texture and give off that effortlessly messy look that the textured fringe is known for. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Work hair gel into a textured fringe for an edgier look. Squeeze a dime-sized amount of hair gel into your hand. Then move the product around in your hair, pushing the top layers forward and tousling the fringe slightly to lend it more movement. Pinch a few strands of your fringe together here and there to make it look sharper and edgier."

      "content": "Apply mousse to a curly textured fringe to enhance and hold the curls. With your hair still soaking wet, work a small amount of mousse (or your preferred curl product) into your fringe and the rest of the hair on top of your head. Then, says master hairstylist Angela Justice, let it air dry, and you'll have curls in your fringe that will last for a couple of days, \"even after sleeping on them.\""

      "content": "Put texture product in your fringe to make it look intentionally messy. Pour a thin layer of texturizing powder into your hair or scoop a dime-sized amount of texture paste for hair into your palm (you can also use sea salt spray instead). Use your fingers to push the texture into the fringe and tousle the fringe layers with a quick back-and-forth motion. Apply as much or as little texture as you want to achieve your desired level of intentional messiness."

      "title": "Low Taper Textured Fringe",
      "content": "Low Taper Textured Fringe Pair your textured fringe with a precise low taper fade . In this variation, the hair around your head is left the same length until it nears your ears and the nape of your neck, where it's cut shorter. Because it's positioned low on the scalp, it leaves some of your sideburns on either temple intact. You can create a style called a blowout fade by opting for a low taper and then volumizing your long textured fringe."

      "title": "Mid Taper Textured Fringe",
      "content": "Mid Taper Textured Fringe A mid-taper haircut is similar to the low taper fade, except the hair shifts from long to short in the middle of the scalp. It's a good middle ground between a low and a high taper or a high fade , which involves cutting or shaving a lot of the hair around your head. Whichever you choose, it will look sleek and clean, especially when paired with a short fringe."

      "title": "Messy Textured Fringe",
      "content": "Messy Textured Fringe Leave your fringe medium to long (skimming the tops or bottoms of your eyebrows) and trim the hair around your head to roughly the same length or slightly shorter. Then work texture product into your hair and move the layers around, until your look gives \"I just woke up this way\" vibes."

      "title": "Curly Textured Fringe",
      "content": "Curly Textured Fringe If you have natural curls, define them by applying mousse to your hair while it's still wet and then letting your hair dry. If your hair is merely wavy or straight, apply a heat protectant to your fringe and then use a curling iron to achieve the spirals you desire."

      "title": "Straight Textured Fringe",
      "content": "Straight Textured Fringe For those whose hair is naturally straight, apply a texture product to bring more movement into your textured fringe. Alternatively, work hair gel through your hair to make your style appear sleeker and more modern."
