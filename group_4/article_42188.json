      "content": "Give him a boost of encouragement to help him get through his day. Licensed clinical psychologist Kim Chronister adds, “You can also encourage them by asking if they want you to just let them vent or if they actually want advice. Try not to assume what they need and actually ask them.” And don’t forget to tell them you believe in them with one of the statements below: I’m proud of you and proud to be yours! I appreciate all that you have done to set us up for success. Wake up and be awesome! It’s another day for you to dominate. I love you! Your strength in the face of challenges inspires me. I’ll always have faith in you. There’s no one I trust more than you. Thank you for always going the extra mile. You’re the blueprint, and everyone else is just a rough draft.

      "content": "Let him know you feel lucky he’s yours with appreciative words. “One of the ways to engage in a random act of kindness is to simply tell them you are grateful for their presence or energy, or their words. People are rarely reinforced and crave to be seen in many cases,” recommends Chronister. Use one of these sweet comments to show your husband how much you appreciate him: Five years and you’re still the finest man I’ve met. I’m in awe of your strength and resilience. If “effortlessly cool” was a person, it’d be you. Thank you for being my rock and biggest supporter, my love. It means the world to me! You inspire me to be the best version of myself. Looking back, I’m grateful for every change, decision, and fork in the road that led me to you. You’re so funny and interesting. I don’t think I could ever get tired of being around you. Thank you for everything, my love: the adventures, the late-night conversations, the way you hold me, and so much more. I don’t think you realize how good-looking you are. You have superior taste in music. Thank you for loving me unconditionally. You listen to me, value me, and make me feel cherished every single day. Wow… you, in that suit? I’ll never get that picture out of my head. Words can’t express how thankful I am for you. Having you at my side gives me the courage to do anything. I always feel like I won the husband lottery. I’m forever grateful for you and the way you make me feel desired and wanted. Your love always brings light to my life, even on cloudy days. Thank you for showing me what it means to love someone unconditionally. You have a heart of gold. Words can’t describe how grateful I am to have you in my life. You always know what to say when things are going wrong. You’re always so supportive. My life wouldn’t be the same without you."

      "title": "Say something so nice she can’t help falling in love all over again.",
      "content": "Say something so nice she can’t help falling in love all over again. “Sometimes we can be guarded and come off as less sincere with others when we have experienced disappointment and/or rejection by others,” Chronister cautions. But if you’ve been going through a rough patch, saying something nice can help you bridge the gap. Here are a few examples of nice things you can say to your wife any time: Everyone I know loves having you around! I love every inch of you. It’s like you were made for me. Being around you feels like a lucky streak I never want to end. Today was another one of those days that made me so glad I married you. You’re the most captivating person I’ve ever met. The worst part of hugging you is letting you go. You’re the kind of woman who can make a man forget his own name. If there’s one thing I like about you, it’s that I like more than just one thing about you. Marrying you is my biggest flex. You’re too good to be true! You make my life a dream! Every time we touch, I get this feeling. This feeling warms my soul and strengthens my heart. Brains…check. Beauty…check. Great sense of humor…check. It’s official, you’re the total package. Your laughter is my favorite sound. You’re my favorite person to do absolutely nothing with. You’re the best part of my day, my week, my year. You’re the best husband ever! Everything sounds beautiful when it comes out of your lips. If I didn’t already know you, I’d be bugging everyone to introduce us. I hope you know CPR, because you take my breath away. My friends are jealous of how perfect you are!"

      "content": "Tell her you think she’s beautiful both inside and out. Showing your wife affection can be through words or with physical touch…or both! Take her hand or kiss her gently and share a beautiful message, like the ones below: Everyone’s jealous of me because I get to be with you. You are more than just my wife…you’re the heartbeat of my life, the love in my soul, and the beauty in my world. My whole life changed for the better the day I met you. I don’t need a reason to love you…everything about you is the reason. The stars could never compete with the way your eyes light up my world. Marrying you was the easiest and best decision I’ve ever made. You are my forever and always, my best decision, and my happiest thought. I feel like the secrets of the universe are locked behind your eyes. You’ve helped me see the world in a better light. You make the world more beautiful just by being in it. Your love completes me in a way I never knew I needed. No masterpiece in any museum could ever compare to your beauty. Your smile could power an entire city. You have a heart so rare and beautiful, and that makes you truly special to me. Before I met you, I didn’t know how to live. I was just surviving. Every star in the sky, every sunset, and every long song remind me of you. I never thought I would fall in love. Then, I met you, and my world changed. Every love song reminds me of you. The way you carry yourself with such grace and elegance makes you even more beautiful in my eyes. You’re the type of woman people write love songs about."

      "title": "Write them a love letter.",
      "content": "Write them a love letter. You don’t have to be a poet or professional writer to write a love letter . Dating coach Cher Gopman recommends saying something like, “I’m so happy to be with you,” “I love you,” and “I want to be there for you.” Those are words you should always be happy to say to someone you love. Try opening with a warm and loving greeting, like “My dearest love,” or “My one and only.” If you have a pet name for them, go ahead and use it if you like. Remind them of a romantic memory of a special moment you’ve shared. Tell them what you love about them. Be as specific as possible to show them you really know and appreciate them. Close the letter with a simple but heartfelt message like, “Forever and always,” “Yours always,” or “With all my love.”"

      "content": "Pay them a sweet compliment. “In order to make a compliment stand out and be more unique, highlight something you’ve recently learned about their skill set or psychology,” Chronister suggests. No matter what you compliment them on, just make sure you’re being genuine and sincere in your appreciation. Compliment them on something they value about themselves. For example, if they love volunteering their time, tell them you admire their generosity and kindness. Give them a unique compliment they probably won’t hear from someone else, like “You’re so patient with me when I’m having trouble making a decision. It helps me focus on making the right choice.” Complimenting them on their appearance is nice, but make sure to sprinkle in compliments about their character and achievements."

      "title": "Just say “I love you.”",
      "content": "Just say “I love you.” Marriage and family therapist Moshe Ratson explains, “There is no precise formula for when to say ‘I love you.’ You should say it whenever you feel that way without making too many calculations about timing.” Sometimes saying it out of the blue can make the moment even more special. Ratson adds, “In an ideal situation, express your love sincerely and without expectation. To be in such a position, you have to have the self-confidence that allows you to provide such unconditional love.” Try to tell your spouse you love them every day. Just take their hand, look deeply into their eyes, and say the words."
