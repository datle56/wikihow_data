      "content": "XD is an older emoticon that means “laughing out loud.” Nowadays, we tap on emojis like 😂 (face with tears of joy emoji), 😆 (grinning squinting face emoji), and 🤣 (rolling on the floor laughing emoji) when we find something funny or are trying to lighten the mood. Back in the 2000s, though, this wide selection of emojis was nonexistent—so, netizens would improvise by sending an XD emoticon that resembled a laughing face with squinting eyes rotated to the left, like the 😆 (grinning squinting face emoji). Think of it like as a digital synonym for slang like LOL , hehe , and haha . [1] X Research source “I think I passed my first grade teacher in Walmart XD” “That’s so funny!! I still can’t believe you did that XD” Some netizens choose to use variations of the emoticon, like xD or xd. Both of these still mean the same thing! Did you know? XD means the same thing across all digital platforms. In most cases, XD is just another way to add a light-hearted vibe to a message, whether it’s over email, text, or social media. It even means the same thing on gaming platforms like Roblox —users use XD as a way to react to something funny."

Emojis and emoticons definitely aren’t for everyone, but some people like to add an extra “oomph” of friendliness and cheer to their messages. If you’re worried that message might come across as a bit stale or cold, add an XD into the mix to the let the other person know that everything is good.

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to replying to messages with XD in them—it really depends on what was sent originally (and if you feel like replying in the first place). Feel free to drop an LOL, XD, or other cheerful emoji in response, or reply in whatever way feels most comfortable and authentic to you. Them: “How can you stand working 12-hour shifts? I would be bouncing off the walls XD” You: “I’m just built different I guess 😂” Them: “Are you still bringing some of your mom’s guac to my party tomorrow? XD” You: “I know you’d give me the silent treatment if I didn’t. XD”"

      "content": "I Love You XD really planted its roots in the emo community in 2004 when a digital artist posted a cartoon dinosaur named OMG RAWR XD” and captioned it with “Rawr! It means “I love you!” in dinosaur.” This lingo became especially prominent within meme culture in the mid-2010s, when social media users began roasting “Rawr XD” as cringy way that emo individuals said “I love you” (based on stereotypes). [4] X Research source Person 1: “Rawr XD” Person 2: “You did not just send me that LOL” This meaning of the emoticon is more ironic than anything else. If someone says “Rawr XD” in this day and age, they’re probably referencing this meme."

Nowadays, though, people are much likely to just send a 😘 (face blowing a kiss emoji), 💋 (kiss mark emoji), 😗 (kissing face emoji), and 💏 (kiss emoji) if they’re trying to share any kiss-worthy sentiments. “I totally XD him last night” XD also rarely stands for “crossed,” with X representing the cross and “D” representing the “ed” ending of the word."
