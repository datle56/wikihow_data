      "content": "Keep it simple. Warmed-up canned spinach has a wonderfully simple, refreshing taste that is complemented well with one to two tablespoons of lemon juice or red wine vinegar per can and a sprinkling of bacon (or bacon bits, for the less culinarily-inclined). Top with a little melted butter if you would like."

    {
      "title": "Add seasoning.",
      "content": "Add seasoning. Canned spinach on its own is quite yummy, but can easily be enhanced using basic spices and toppings. Popular toppings include garlic powder, dry mustard, chopped tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, crushed red pepper, and bacon bits."
