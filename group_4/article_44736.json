Take off any constricting items on your toes, such as socks or shoes. [1] X Research source Once your toe is exposed, examine it to ensure no bones have broken through your skin. You should look closely to make sure your toe is still pointing in the right direction, despite the break, and does not appear blueish or feel numb to the touch. These are all indications that it is safe to treat the toe at home."

      "content": "Tape the pinky toe to its neighbor. After 24 hours, the swelling should start to go down if you properly elevate and ice the toe. You can then buddy tape your broken pinky toe to its neighboring toe to help stabilize it. [5] X Research source Place a cotton ball between your pinky toe and the toe next to it. Wrap the pinky toe with medical tape and then wrap the pinky toe to the neighboring toe. Make sure the tape is snug around your toes but is not cutting off blood circulation to your toes. It just needs to be tight enough to provide some support to the broken toe. You should change the cotton ball once a day and re-wrap the toes together so the area stays clean and stable."
