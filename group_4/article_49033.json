      "content": "“Ramadan Kareem” means “Have a generous Ramadan.” This phrase often gets used as an alternative for “Ramadan Mubarak.” It expresses your wish for your friend’s Ramadan to be filled with opportunities for reflection, growth, and family time. [2] X Research source An appropriate response to “Ramadan Kareem” is “Allahu Akram” (al-AH-hoo ak-RAM), which means “God is much more generous.” For many Muslims, the generosity of Ramadan is reflected in fasting. Muslims practice self-control in order to bring themselves closer to spiritual riches. During Ramadan, many Muslims donate food and money. This reflects another sense in which this month is one of generosity."

      "content": "Many Muslims use “Eid Mubarak” on the last day of Ramadan. This expression literally translates to “Have a blessed Eid al-Fitr.” Often simply known as Eid, Eid al-Fitr is the holiday that signifies the end of Ramadan. During this holiday, Muslims thank Allah for giving them the strength to fast and for bringing the Muslim community together. [3] X Research source The date of Eid changes every year, since it is based on the lunar calendar. If someone wishes you Eid Mubarak, it's customary to reply “Khair Mubarak,” or, “You as well.” A less common alternative for “Eid Mubarak” is “Eid Kareem” (eed kah-REEM), or “Have a generous Eid.” Eid al-Fitr translates to “The Festival of the Breaking of the Fast,” and is among the holiest of all days in Islam."

      "content": "Being open to learning can bring you closer to Muslims in your life. Ramadan is a month of goodwill and charity, and many Muslims would be very happy to share this special tradition with you. You may even get an invitation to join a Muslim for their iftar meal—an opportunity you should not pass up. Although you should ask questions if you’re curious about any aspects of Ramadan, try to keep these etiquette tips in mind: Be respectful of your friend’s fast. They’ll appreciate an invitation to the coffee shop, but if they don’t drink anything, don’t pressure them. If your friend isn’t fasting, avoid asking why. Fasting is a private matter, and asking your friend a question like this can be pretty invasive. Stay away from talking about fasting as a way to lose weight. Remember that this is a very spiritual activity. Try not to talk about fasting as a way to get slim for the summer."
