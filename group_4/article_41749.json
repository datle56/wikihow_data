      "content": "Wear the shoes around the house for an hour at a time. One of the easiest ways to stretch out a pair of shoes is just to wear them. Try wearing them for about an hour at a time, but if you can't wear them that long at first, that's okay. If you’d like, you can add a thick pair of socks to cushion your feet and help stretch your shoes even more. [1] X Research source This technique will work for almost any type of shoe, but it’s best if the shoes are only a little too tight. Keep in mind that if the shoes pinch or rub your feet, you might get blisters if you aren’t wearing socks! As your shoes stretch, gradually increase the amount of time you wear them. Once they’re comfortable enough to wear for several hours at a time, they’re ready to take out of the house!"

      "content": "Wear thick socks and heat the shoes with a hair dryer for a fast stretch. Put on thick cotton socks, then slip your feet into your shoes. Set your hair dryer to medium heat and blast each shoe for about 30 seconds, moving the nozzle around as you do so. As the shoe is heating, wiggle your toes and bend your foot to help stretch the shoe. Then, continue wearing the shoes as they cool down. [2] X Research source The heat will soften the shoe, helping it form to your foot. If you need to, heat the shoes again after they’ve cooled completely. Heat can soften the glue used on some shoes, causing the uppers to separate from the sole, so don’t leave the hair dryer nozzle in any one place for too long. Do not heat plastic or PVC shoes—they won’t stretch and you could release toxic fumes into the air."

      "content": "Spray the shoes with rubbing alcohol for a custom fit. Put on the shoes you want to stretch, then fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol and saturate the outside of the shoes. Wear the shoes as the alcohol dries, and they should stretch out to fit the shape of your foot. [3] X Research source You can also soak a thick pair of socks with rubbing alcohol, then put on the socks and shoes and wear them until the alcohol evaporates. This is a great option for canvas or athletic shoes. However, it may not work as well for dress shoes made from stiff materials. Because the alcohol dries quickly, it shouldn't damage the shoe. However, it’s best to test the alcohol on an inconspicuous spot first if your shoe is made from a material that shouldn’t get wet, like leather or suede. If you’re not sure, try a different technique."

      "title": "Try a shoe-stretching spray while you’re wearing leather shoes.",
      "content": "Try a shoe-stretching spray while you’re wearing leather shoes. If you want to stretch leather shoes, put them on, then spritz the leather according to the package directions. Wear the shoe while the spray dries, and the leather will stretch out around your foot. Shoe-stretching sprays are made to loosen the fibers of leather, allowing the material of the shoe upper to spread slightly. They may also work on suede, but be sure to read the product label carefully."

      "content": "Fill a resealable bag halfway with water and place it in the shoe. Stretch your shoes overnight by filling them with water, then freezing them . The easiest way to do that is to place a resealable plastic bag that’s about halfway full of water into the shoe. Make sure the bag is sealed tightly so you don’t spill any water in the inside of the shoe, as this could damage the insole. [4] X Research source If you're concerned the bag might break, use 2 bags instead, placing one inside the other. [5] X Research source You can try this with any type of shoe, but it might work better for open-toe, peep-toe, or athletic styles. If the toe box on your shoes is very narrow, it might be hard to arrange the bag so it reaches all the way down into the shoe, and it might not stretch evenly. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the shoes onto a tray and place the tray in the freezer. Leave the shoes in the freezer for several hours or overnight. Give the shoes enough time to make sure the water is frozen completely solid. [7] X Research source Putting your shoes on a tray or a baking sheet will keep the bottom of your shoes from touching a surface your food might come in contact with. You can also place them into a large bag or on a sheet or parchment paper. However, you can just put them directly into the freezer, if you want."

      "content": "Leave the shoes at room temperature for 15-30 minutes, then remove the bag. Once the ice is completely frozen, take the shoes out of the freezer. Leave them in a warm, dry place for about 15-30 minutes, or until the ice starts to melt. Then, wiggle the bag back and forth until you can remove it from the shoe. [8] X Research source It’s better not to let the ice thaw out all the way. If there are any holes in the bag, the water could leak into the shoe and damage it."

      "title": "Use a shoe stretcher to gradually widen leather shoes.",
      "content": "Use a shoe stretcher to gradually widen leather shoes . A shoe stretcher is a device that’s made to wedge down into a shoe. Typically, they have a knob or a lever that you turn to gradually widen and lengthen the shoe stretcher. Over time, this will help relax and widen the shoe, making them up to a half-size larger. [9] X Research source You can buy a shoe stretcher at most high-end shoe stores. Try this in conjunction with a shoe-stretching spray for the best results. Dampen the shoes with the spray, then insert the shoe stretcher. Repeat this as needed until your shoes reach the size you need."

      "title": "Roll up socks and stuff them into the toes of the shoes for a gentle stretch.",
      "content": "Roll up socks and stuff them into the toes of the shoes for a gentle stretch. Take a sock and roll it up tightly from the toes all the way to the top, then stick it down into the toe box of the shoe. Continue doing this until you’ve filled both shoes completely with as many socks as you can fit. Then, store the shoes overnight or until you’re ready to wear them again. While this method might not work as quickly as using heat, alcohol, or ice, it will gently stretch your shoes over time, making it an ideal option for leather, vintage, or otherwise delicate shoes. This may not work as well for shoes with a stiff upper, like dress shoes. Also, shoes that are made from a flexible material, like mesh, might require direct heat or a method that saturates the shoe in order to stretch out the fibers."

      "content": "Place wet newspaper into the shoes for more stretching power. Dampen a few sheets of newspaper, then ball them up and stuff them into the toe box of the shoe. Continue adding balls of wet newspaper until the shoe is full. As the paper dries, it will expand and harden, stretching out the shoe. [10] X Research source Because this technique will form the shoe as it stretches, be sure to arrange the paper so it preserves the shape of your shoe. Do not saturate the paper, or it could damage the inside of your shoe. Also, avoid using this technique on leather shoes."

      "content": "Stretch the shoe with wet oats, grains, or rice for an old-fashioned approach. Fill a plastic bag with oatmeal, rice, or any other grain that will swell up when it gets wet. Add just enough water to cover the grains, then seal the bag and place it into the shoe, working it down into the toe box. Leave the bag in place overnight, then remove it and try your shoes on! As the oats expand, the pressure will help stretch the material of the shoe. Want tips for stretching your shoes without causing damage?
