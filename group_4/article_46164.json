Laptop computers run on batteries that can deplete rapidly, especially if you're using your laptop intensively. Unless you're somewhere remote or foreign where you absolutely have to go without, it's better to leave your laptop plugged in. [1] X Research source"

They're called \"laptops\" because they can go on your lap, but that doesn't mean that it's always the best or right place. Try to find a comfortable angle for your wrists and hands - this might mean moving the laptop around until you find the best position for you. [2] X Research source Don't place your laptop on soft, fuzzy, or shaggy surfaces that can block its vents. Most laptops have fan vents located on the sides and bottom that should be left unblocked for the laptop to run."

      "content": "Lift the lid to open up until the screen looks comfortable for you. Most laptops have some type of clasp or latch which allows the screen to open. If the laptop won't open, don't try to force it! Look for a latch instead. You shouldn't have to force the screen open. Do not pull back the lid too far. A 45-degree obtuse angle is the most the laptop should be open to. The lid or hinge mechanism may be damaged or broken if pulled back any further."

      "title": "Use the laptop's pointing device.",
      "content": "Use the laptop's pointing device. On most computers, this is a flat, touch-sensitive area called a touchpad which will allow you to use your finger as your mouse. Simply slide one finger on the touchpad area to move the cursor. [4] X Research source Many touchpads are multi-touch - using multiple fingers will produce different user interface actions than using just one. Experiment with your laptop by dragging one, two or three fingers across it and trying different 'gestures' or movements with your fingers. Lenovo laptops may use a small, red joystick-like button called a \"trackpoint\" located in the middle of the keyboard between the 'G' and 'H' keys. Use it just like a very sensitive joystick for just your finger. Some older laptops may have a trackball. Rolling the ball on a trackball will cause the mouse pointer to move around. Some laptops are equipped with a pen interface. A pen will be attached to the laptop in these cases. Hover the pen over the screen to move the pointer and press the pen to the screen to click. Do you find laptop pointing devices tiny and difficult to use? You can always attach a mouse to a laptop. Locate the laptop's USB port and attach a mouse if you'd like to use one. The laptop will automatically recognize the mouse and make it ready for you to use."

      "content": "Locate your laptop's optical drive if it has any. If your laptop is not a 'netbook' it probably has an optical drive which you can use to install software or play music. The optical drive is usually located on the right or left side of the laptop. In Windows and Mac OS, you can open the optical drive by pushing the small button on it, or by right clicking the optical drive icon in your operating system and selecting \"Eject\". On older Mac computers, such as 2012 Mac computers, you don't need to open the optical drive at all."
