If you’re looking for other ways to style your favorite ankle boots in the winter, try adding a trench coat, some gloves, and even a beret. Fashion expert Candace Hanna stresses the importance of accessorizing during winter: “Accessories are a really easy way to have fun in the winter especially because, if you're in a full-length coat—which a lot of people are—you’re going to need accessories.” She recommends wearing a scarf for some extra color and a stylish hat."
