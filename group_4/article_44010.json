      "title": "Leave the wide end longer than the narrow end.",
      "content": "Leave the wide end longer than the narrow end. Drape your tie so the wide end hangs over your right shoulder. Adjust the length of the tie so the narrower end sits just above your ribcage and the wide end is by your belly button. [1] X Research source If you’re left-handed, start with the wide end over your left shoulder instead. Be sure to coordinate your tie with the color or pattern of your outfit so you can look your best."

      "content": "Crossing the ends forms a loop around your neck. Hold the narrow end of the tie in place with your left hand. Try to keep the point where your tie overlaps close to your collar so the knot stays tight. The wide end is now on your left side and the narrow end is on your right. [2] X Research source Leave a little bit of slack when you first tie your tie , or else it might get too tight and make it difficult to breathe or swallow."

      "title": "Looping the tie through forms one half of the Windsor knot.",
      "content": "Looping the tie through forms one half of the Windsor knot. Pull the wide end up through the bottom of the neck loop right where the tie overlaps at your collar. Drape the wide end back down over the top of the neck loop to form one side of the knot. The wide end will be right-side up. Practice tying your tie in front of a mirror since it’ll be a lot easier to see what you’re doing."

      "title": "Wrapping the tie around the knot makes it more secure.",
      "content": "Wrapping the tie around the knot makes it more secure. Take the wide on the left side of your chest, and bring it behind the knot in the center. Use your left hand to hold the tie against the back of the knot so it stays in place. The wide end should be upside-down on your right side and underneath the knot and narrow end. [3] X Research source Make sure you pull the tie as tight as you comfortably can so the knot looks clean when you’re done."

      "title": "Feeding the tie through the neck loop finishes the base of the knot.",
      "content": "Feeding the tie through the neck loop finishes the base of the knot. Pull the wide end over the right side of the neck loop and feed it through the top. Pull the wide end down through the neck loop so it’s upside-down and on your right side when you’re finished. The knot near your collar now has a symmetrical cone shape on each side. [4] X Research source If the shapes are not symmetrical, undo your tie and try starting over so your knot doesn’t look messy."

      "content": "Smooth out your tie to give the front of the knot a clean, classy look. Bring the wide end from right to left across the front of the knot. Pull your tie tight so the knot doesn’t have any wrinkles or creases. Hold the tie in place with your left hand so it doesn’t get loose. [5] X Research source Straighten out your tie so it lays flat and doesn’t hang backward or crooked when you finish tying it."

      "content": "Pulling the tie through the knot lets you tighten and resize it. Grab the wide end of the tie and make sure it’s facing right-side up. Push the wind end through the space between the knot and part of the tie wrapped around the front of it. Hold the narrow end with one hand and pull the knot up toward your collar until it’s comfortable to tighten and adjust the length. [7] X Research source Fit your tie so the wide end reaches your waistband when you’re finished tying a Windsor knot. If the tie is too short, undo your tie and shorten the narrow end before trying again. If your tie was too long, shorten the wide end."
