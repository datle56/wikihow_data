      "content": "Redeem a reset code. Blox Fruits developers release game codes that’ll let you unlock buffs and rewards for free, and several are currently active. Note that codes are not active forever, so if you try one and it doesn’t work, check the developer Gamer Robot Inc.’s social media accounts on X and Discord for new codes. The active stat reset codes are KITT_RESET and Sub2UncleKizaru . [1] X Research source To redeem a Blox Fruits code: Open Blox Fruits and connect to the game’s server. Find the blue X (Twitter) icon on the left side of the screen and click on it. Go to the “Reward codes” mini menu. Type (or paste) an active code into the text box labeled “Enter code here”. Click the “Redeem” button. This will redeem the code and give you the free stat reset! Important: These codes are case-sensitive! If you’re not sure you typed it correctly, you can always copy and paste the codes directly from this page."

      "content": "Buy a stat reset from Plokster. Get stat resets by visiting the shop NPC Plokster and buying them for 2,500 Fragments (in-game currency) each. You can find Plokster on the bridge between the Kingdom of Rose and the Green Zone (in the Second Sea region). Plokster can also be found in a building with a blue roof at the Castle on the Sea (in the Third Sea region). [2] X Research source Earn Fragments by completing normal Raids and Ship Raids. You can also get them from defeating the Sea Beast and Darkbeard. You can buy stat resets from Plokster as many times as you like. If you have at least 2,500 Fragments, Plokster’s dialogue will read, “I can refund your stat points if you hand over 2,500 Fragments. Deal?” If you don’t have enough Fragments, Plokster’s dialogue will simply read, “The weather is nice today.”"

      "content": "Purchase a stat reset from the shop with Robux. If you’d rather use Robux to buy a stat reset, go to the in-game Blox Fruits shop (accessible through the GUI Menu). You can purchase stat resets for 75 Robux apiece. Once again, you can buy as many stat resets as you like, as long as you have the funds for it. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that you can’t trade stat refund game passes. They have to be gifted or redeemed with a code."

      "content": "Buy a stat reset during special-event NPCs. This method is a bit less reliable since specific events aren’t necessarily guaranteed each year. However, Blox Fruits typically hosts yearly events with unique trader NPCs; you can get stat resets from the Death King NPC during a Ghost Event (a Halloween event in October) and the Magic Elf NPC during a Christmas event in December. [4] X Research source The Death King will trade 150 bones for one stat reset. The Magic Elf will trade 75 candies for one stat reset."

      "content": "There are five character stats in Blox Fruits. Stats are the main mechanic used to increase your Blox Fruits avatar’s abilities and overall power as you play. They determine which skills you’re especially adept at and what your combat capabilities are. The five stats are Melee, Defense, Sword, Gun, and Blox Fruit. [5] X Research source Melee - This stat increases the damage you do with Fighting Styles and Energy. Defense - This stat increases your character’s health. Sword - This stat increases your damage with Swords. Gun - This stat increases your damage with Guns. Blox Fruit - This stat increases the damage you do with Blox Fruits."

      "content": "Stats can be improved when you level up. You’ll get 3 stat points per level up and can spend them on any of the available stats. However, only three of the five stats can be increased to the maximum level (currently 2,650), so choose your stats carefully! You can also gain max stats by triggering any Race Awakening—upgrading your Race from V3 to V4. [6] X Research source Stats with the maximum amount of points (2,650) are 88.4 times stronger than stats with no points at all."

      "content": "Melee and Defense stats are usually considered essential. You can specialize in any stats you like in Blox Fruits—but if you’re unsure which stats to focus on, here are a couple of hints! Without Melee and Defense, any battle might very well end up harder than it has to be, so it’s a good idea to work on maxing out both stats. Then, choose one other stat to max out as well. [7] X Research source If there’s a particular weapon type you tend to use as a primary source of damage (Sword, Gun, or Blox Fruit), consider focusing on that stat, too."
