      "title": "Use antifungal ear drops.",
      "content": "Use antifungal ear drops. 1% clotrimazole is the most popular antifungal medicine doctors prescribe to treat fungal ear infections. It kills both Candida and Aspergillus strains of fungal bacteria by inhibiting the enzyme that converts ergosterol, which the fungus needs to grow—infection be gone! Side effects include irritation, burning, or discomfort. Use clotrimazole by doing the following: [1] X Research source Wash your hands with running water and mild soap. Then, clean the ear with warm water and a cotton swab until any visible secretions are gone, and gently pat the ear dry with a clean cloth. Lie down or tilt your head sideways to expose the ear canal and pull your earlobe downward, then backward. Apply 3 drops of clotrimazole into your ear, keeping your ear tilted for 2-3 minutes to allow the solution to reach the infected area. Then, tip your head, pouring out the medicine into a napkin. Store the medication away from children in a cool, dry place. [2] X Research source If clotrimazole doesn’t get rid of your ear infection, your doctor may prescribe a different antifungal agent, such as miconazole. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Be sure not to use antibacterial ear drops, says Dr. Daneshrad. “You want to use antifungal ear drops to kill the fungus and let the bacteria that’s supposed to be there come back.” [4] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020."

      "content": "Get a prescription for fluconazole (Diflucan). Your doctor may prescribe fluconazole if your fungal ear infection is severe. Fluconazole works similarly to clotrimazole, inhibiting the fungus from growing further. The most common side effects are a headache, nausea, dizziness, change in taste, loose stools, abdominal pain, skin rash, and elevation of liver enzymes. [5] X Research source Fluconazole is taken in tablet form. Doctors normally prescribe 1 dose of 200mg once daily, then 100mg daily for 3-5 days."

Plus, antibiotics can make the infection worse by killing the good bacteria residing in the ear or other parts of the body, which your immune system needs to help fight the infection off.

If you’re experiencing intense pain, losing your ability to hear, have a fever, or drainage from the ear, seek professional help.

[12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Consult a doctor before using hydrogen peroxide to treat your fungal ear infection. According to Dr. Daneshrad, physicians tend to “avoid using peroxide because it can damage the skin of the ear canal,” so you should only use it with the guidance of a medical professional.

Turn your hairdryer to the lowest setting possible and place its end at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) away from the infected ear. This method may help to dry out any moisture in the ear canal and hinder fungus growth. [14] X Research source However, note that this method is unlikely to cure a fungal ear infection. However, it may prevent new fungus from growing or spreading. Be careful not to burn yourself, and turn the dryer off if you feel discomfort."

Then, place the washcloth over the infected ear and wait until it cools down. A warm compress can help to relieve pain and inflammation without taking pain-relieving drugs. Plus, it can increase blood flow to the infected area, which leads to faster recovery—yes, please!

Let the drops sit in your ear for 10 minutes, and tilt your head to let it drain. Re-apply this mixture every 4 hours for up to 2 weeks. [18] X Research source Rubbing alcohol is a disinfectant and a drying agent that may help to remove the moisture in the ear canal that’s causing your fungal infection. “It helps clean the ear,” explains Dr. Daneshrad, “and, because the alcohol evaporates quickly, it cools the ear canal to give some additional comfort.” [19] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. The acidity of the apple cider vinegar slows the growth of the fungus, as Candida and Aspergillus fungus strains prefer a \"basic\" environment for optimal growth. [20] X Research source Dr. Daneshrad warns that, while this mixture “will help somewhat with the discomfort…, a physician visit is [still] going to be necessary.” [21] X Expert Source Payam Daneshrad, MD Board Certified Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020."
