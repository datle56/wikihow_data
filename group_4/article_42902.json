      "content": "Begin with the alphabet. The alphabet is where reading begins. The 26 letters that make up the English alphabet are used to form all of the words in the English language, so this is the place to start. There are several ways to get familiar with the alphabet; pick the one that suits you and your learning style. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Sing the alphabet.",
      "content": "Sing the alphabet. It may seem silly, but there's a reason so many people have learned the alphabet by singing the “alphabet song”--it works. The melody aids in memorization and the song as a whole gives learners a picture of the entire alphabet and the relationship between letters. You can listen to the alphabet song online or get someone you know to sing and record it for you so that you can listen to it over and over again as you learn it."

      "title": "Use sandpaper letters.",
      "content": "Use sandpaper letters. Pick up some sandpaper letters if you're a hands-on learner. Look at one of the sandpaper letters and then close your eyes. Trace your fingers over the letter and repeat the name of the letter and its sound. When you're ready, pick your finger up off the sandpaper and write the letter in the air."

      "content": "Practice with alphabet magnets. Pick up a set of alphabet magnets as a way of learning the individual letters as well as the way they're sequenced in the alphabet. Later, you can reuse these letters to practice forming words."

      "title": "Distinguish vowels from consonants.",
      "content": "Distinguish vowels from consonants. There are five vowels in the alphabet: a, e, i, o, u; the rest of the letters are called consonants. [2] X Research source You make vowel sounds in your throat with the help of your tongue and mouth while you form consonants by using your tongue and mouth to control the flow of your breath. Vowels can be spoken alone, but consonants can't. For example, the letter A is simply \"a\" but B is actually \"bee,\" C is \"see,\" D is \"dee\" and so on."

      "content": "Use phonics . Phonics is all about relationships, specifically the relationships between letters and sounds in a language. [3] X Expert Source Soren Rosier, PhD Education Researcher Expert Interview. 1 May 2019. For example, when you learn that the letter C sounds like \"sa\" or \"ka\" or that “tion” sounds like \"shun\", you're learning phonics. Find an approach that makes sense to you. Phonics is typically taught in one of two ways: by what's called a see-and-say approach in which you learn to read whole words or a syllable approach in which you learn how to sound out different letter combinations and put them together to form words. To learn phonics, you must hear the sounds of the syllables and/or words. To do that, you need to find an online program, purchase or borrow a DVD from your local library or work with a family member, friend, tutor or instructor who can help you learn the sounds created by various letter combinations and what those look like written out."

      "content": "Recognize punctuation marks. It's important to know what common punctuation marks indicate when you're reading because they can offer information about sentence meanings. [4] X Research source Comma (,) . When you see a comma, you're meant to pause or slightly hesitate when you're reading. Period (.) . A period indicates the end of a sentence. When you reach a period, come to a complete stop and take a deep breath before continuing to read. Question mark (?) . When you ask a question, your voice goes up. When you see ? at the end of sentence, a question is being asked, so make sure your voice rises when you're reading. Exclamation point (!). This mark is used to emphasize an important point or to grab attention. When you read a sentence that ends with !, be sure to sound excited or to strongly emphasize the words."

      "title": "\"Attack\" the words.",
      "content": "\"Attack\" the words. Word-attack strategies can help you figure out the meaning and pronunciation of unfamiliar words by taking on those words piece by piece and coming at them from different angles. Look for picture clues . Check out the photos, illustrations or other visuals on the page. Explore what's in them (people, places, objects, actions) that might make sense in the sentence. Sound out the word . Starting with the first letter, say each letter-sound out loud slowly. Then repeat the sounds, blending them together to form the word and considering if the word makes sense in the sentence. Chunk it up . Look at the word and see if you can pick out any sound/symbols, prefixes, suffixes, endings or base words that you already know. Read each \"chunk\" by itself and then try blending the chunks together and sound out the word. For example, if you know that \"pre\" means \"before\" and \"view\" means \"to look at,\" you could figure out that \"preview\" means \"to look at ahead of time\" if you approached the word by breaking it up into those two chunks. Look for connections . Consider whether the unfamiliar word bears any resemblance to a word you might already know. Ask yourself if it's a chunk or a form of the unfamiliar word. You could also try using the known word in the sentence to see if it makes sense; it could be that the meanings of the two words are close enough for understanding."

Once you've finished a paragraph, article, short story or chapter, sum up in your own words what it was about. Hearing yourself say it out loud and discovering if the person on the receiving end has questions you can or can't answer can point out any gaps in your understanding and what you might need to reread for greater clarity."
