This is just one example of how to use RemindMeBot. There are other ways to input the time other than tomorrow. Try One Year , August 27th, 2018 , at 6pm , EOY (end of year), and 15 minutes . You can also use RemindMeBot to remind yourself of certain days in history, such as the anniversary of a particular Reddit thread, or on a post about a Redditor’s birthday. Don't forget to use quotes \" around the message. Also, adding the quoted message is optional. Replace RemindMe! with RemindMeRepeat! to get a recurring message. The time needs to be a set period rather than a date. For example, “1 day” or “Tuesday.” [5] X Research source"
