      "content": "Shampoo your hair to remove the excess conditioner. All you really need to do to get rid of the over-conditioned feeling is to wash your hair. Shampoos contain detergents that can remove product and oil buildup on your hair and scalp. Apply a coin-sized amount of shampoo to your palm, then massage it into your hair and scalp. Rinse out the shampoo in warm water. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use a daily clarifying shampoo if you have one, since it will remove excess product buildup.

      "content": "Spray the greasy spots with dry shampoo if you’re short on time. It’s best to use a regular wet shampoo to remove the excess product buildup. However, you might not have time to wash your hair. Instead, spray dry shampoo onto just the areas that look oily, then massage the product into your scalp. Comb out any excess dry shampoo before styling your hair. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Choose a dry shampoo that’s made for your hair color.

      "content": "Use a protein treatment to improve the look of limp hair. Protein treatments add proteins to your hair to hopefully make it stronger. This typically makes your hair strands stiffer, which can add volume to limp, lifeless hair. Follow the directions on your protein treatment and apply it to your hair. Then, rinse the treatment out as directed. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Protein treatments are often combined with conditioners. You can apply these products after you wash your hair and shouldn’t have to worry about your hair looking greasy again. Protein treatments may damage your hair if you use them too often. Always check the label to find out how often you can use your protein treatment. Generally, you'll do a treatment every 4 to 6 weeks, but you can use some protein treatments as often as once a week. You can find protein treatments at a beauty supply store, a drug store, or online."

      "content": "Apply a light coating of conditioner to the lower part of your hair only. Since your hair was over-conditioned, you don’t need to use much conditioner after you wash out the excess buildup. If your hair is straight or wavy, just coat your ends with conditioner. If you have curly or textured hair, apply a thin layer of conditioner from mid-shaft to your ends. Don’t apply any conditioner to the top of your head, especially your roots. [6] X Research source If you apply conditioner over all of your hair, it’ll likely look greasy again."

      "content": "Notice if your hair looks greasy. Conditioner is supposed to make your hair sleek, shiny, and manageable. You may also be using leave-in or styling products that add moisture to your hair to help control tangles and frizz. However, these products can build up on your hair, especially if you don’t shampoo every day. To see if your hair is greasy, check for oil slicks, extra shine, and texture that feels wet. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because your hair is so greasy, it might slide out of a hair clip or hair pin.

      "content": "Check if your hair looks limp and lacks volume. Because of product buildup, over-conditioned hair usually just hangs there, even if you try to style it. Examine your hair in the mirror to see if it looks lifeless and seems to cling to your scalp. This might be a sign that your hair has too much conditioner left on it. [8] X Research source You might also notice that your hair holds the style for a short period of time but loses its pizzazz faster than usual. For instance, you might curl your hair only to have it fall flat soon after."

      "content": "Feel your hair to see if it’s much too soft and heavier than usual. While soft hair is normally a goal, it can also be a sign your hair is over-conditioned. In this case, your hair might be so soft that you can’t get it to hold a style. At the same time, your hair might feel abnormally heavy when you try to gather it, since there’s so much product buildup on it. Play with your hair to see if it feels abnormally soft or heavy.

      "content": "Style your hair to see if it holds or if your hair is unmanageable. One of the main problems caused by over-conditioning your hair is unmanageability. While your hair might be limp, shiny, and soft, it simply won’t hold a hairstyle. Try curling your hair, putting it up into a bun, or twisting it up with a hair clip. If you’re having trouble getting the style to stay in place, your hair is likely over-conditioned. [10] X Research source Choose a style you can normally do with your hair. For instance, if a top knot is your go-to lazy day hairstyle, it’s probably the best test to see if your hair is over-conditioned."

      "title": "Apply your conditioner from the mid-length of your hair to the ends.",
      "content": "Apply your conditioner from the mid-length of your hair to the ends. Your scalp produces natural oils that coat your hair to moisturize and protect it. Generally, these oils easily coat your roots, so you don’t need to apply conditioner there. Instead, only coat your hair with conditioner from the mid-length down to the ends. Otherwise, the upper part of your hair might start looking greasy. [14] X Research source It’s okay to lightly spritz your leave-in product near your roots if you have trouble detangling your hair after you wash it. However, apply a tiny amount at a time so you don’t accidentally apply too much."

Wash and condition your hair at the beginning of your shower. Then, continue bathing for 5 minutes while the conditioner sits on your hair. Finally, rinse out the conditioner in cool water.
