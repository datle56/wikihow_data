Every purchase earns you more Stars, eventually leading to free drinks, food, and more. [1] X Research source You’ll earn 1 Star for every dollar. Once you earn 25 Stars, you can start cashing in those freebies! The Starbucks app occasionally has seasonal games and sweepstakes that can help you earn extra Stars, so keep an eye out for those. Forget to use the app to make your purchase? No worries! Scan your Starbucks receipt in the app to make sure you get your Stars."

      "content": "Use your Starbucks account to get free refills. You may be eligible for unlimited free refills if you order a brewed coffee or tea in-store. Simply order your beverage, drink it at your leisure in-store, and then head back to the counter and ask the barista for a refill (just be prepared to show them your rewards account). [3] X Research source This hack only works for plain drip coffees and teas. It doesn’t apply to iced tea lemonades, cold brews, or blended beverages (like Frappuccinos). Try this hack the next time you visit a Starbucks inside a Target. Do your shopping, and then get a free drink refill on your way out! Keep in mind that refills aren’t offered in every store. Similarly, you can order French press coffee (if your location offers it) and drink it in-store."

      "content": "Save $0.10 and get bonus rewards with a cup of your choice. Starbucks encourages their customers to bring their own cups to fill up. Why?

      "title": "Get more coffee for your buck with less ice.",
      "content": "Get more coffee for your buck with less ice. More often than not, Starbucks likes to fill their cups over halfway with ice. This means you’re typically getting more ice than beverage in iced drinks. To avoid this, ask for light ice while ordering in-store or with the app. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Split a coffee with a friend and save $1.",
      "content": "Split a coffee with a friend and save $1. A 24-ounce venti latte costs around $4.95; a 12-ounce tall latte costs around $3.95. To save money, order a venti drink of your choice and ask the barista to split it into 2 tall cups. This way, you’ll have 2 12-ounce drinks for the price of 1 drink. [6] X Research source This hack can only be done in-store, as the app doesn’t give you the option to split a drink.

      "content": "Order a second tea bag for free. When you order a hot tea at Starbucks, the barista typically gives you 1 tea bag; however, you can ask for a second one to make a stronger brew. Request the same tea bag twice, or try mixing 2 tea flavors to make your own delicious concoction. Consider asking for the second tea bag on the side. This way, you can steep a second cup later."

      "content": "Get a small discount by swapping cold foam with whipped cream. While cold foam is delicious, it can get rather expensive. Starbucks charges around $2 for additional cold foam, whereas whipped cream is free. Consider ditching the foam for whip. After all, they’re both tasty and have similar consistencies!

      "title": "Avoid diluted tea by ordering iced tea without water.",
      "content": "Avoid diluted tea by ordering iced tea without water. Starbucks pre-makes their teas, diluting them with water once ordered. For a stronger tea and more bang for your buck, ask for an iced tea with no water. This way, you’ll get the original premade tea rather than the watered-down version."

      "title": "Ditch bottled water for a cup of ice water.",
      "content": "Ditch bottled water for a cup of ice water. Water bottles can cost up to $3 at Starbucks, whereas a cup of ice water is completely free. So, the next time you need some H2O, ditch the plastic bottle and ask the barista for some ice water. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Save $2 by ordering a simple Chai Tea over a Latte. There are 2 types of chai available at Starbucks: Chai Tea and Chai Lattes. Chai Tea Lattes cost around $6 and are made with milk and concentrate; meanwhile, Chai Teas are around $4 and are made with water and tea bags.

      "content": "Save $1 with a dupe drink. A Blended Iced Mocha and Mocha Frappuccino are almost the same thing. The only difference between them? How fine the ice is. Frappuccinos have finer ice and cost around $6, while blended iced drinks are about $5. If you don’t mind a slushier consistency, consider ordering a blended drink over a Frappuccino to save a buck."
