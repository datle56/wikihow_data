The Sunni sect prohibits tattoos based on a scripture in the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammed, the founder of Islam. Yet the Shia sect doesn't prohibit tattoos, and certain groups of Muslims, like the Kurds, have a historical tradition of tattooing. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Temporary tattoos and henna tattoos are permissible for men and women. That's because they don't permanently alter or harm the body, nor do they mix with the blood. [2] X Research source When getting any tattoo, it's important for men and women not to apply tattoos to any area of the body they're commanded to cover up in front of strangers, like on the skin from the belly button to the knees for men and everywhere except the face and hands for women.

      "title": "The Quran doesn't prohibit tattoos, but it does prohibit unnecessary body alterations.",
      "content": "The Quran doesn't prohibit tattoos, but it does prohibit unnecessary body alterations. The scripture in question, an-Nisa 4:119, reads, \"I will certainly mislead them and delude them with empty hopes. Also, I will order them and they will slit the ears of cattle and alter Allah’s creation.\" Many scholars infer from this verse that the Quran condemns permanently altering any of Allah's creations (except for medical reasons), including the human body. [4] X Research source Body modifications are permitted when they're deemed medically necessary to repair or restore bodily function. For example, reconstructive plastic surgeries that improve the body's function are halal , but cosmetic plastic surgeries for improving one's appearance are haram . Tattoos fall into the latter category. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "The Prophet Muhammad cursed those who receive and give tattoos. He grouped women who do this with those who remove hair from their faces and create artificial gaps between their teeth to beautify themselves, as all these practices alter Allah's creation. [6] X Research source Many Sunni Muslim scholars interpret these hadith (recorded sayings of The Prophet) to mean that neither men nor women should get tattoos, nor should they become tattoo artists."

      "content": "The Prophet may have only prohibited pagan tattoos and brands. In this interpretation, normal tattoos that don't use pagan imagery, such as deities or idols, are permissible. Furthermore, historians record some individuals associated with the Prophet, like Asma bint Umais, as having tattoos, yet the Prophet didn't admonish them for it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Tattoos make the person who has them impure. According to a fatwa (or religious opinion) in the Shafi'i school of law from the Sunni sect of Islam, the reason tattooing is evil is it involves mixing ink with blood. This act renders the person who got the tattoo najas , or filthy. [8] X Research source Modern tattooing methods no longer mix ink with blood. Thus, based on this teaching alone, some Muslims may find tattoos acceptable. However, the Shafi'i school still prohibits all forms of this body art, whether it contaminates the blood or not."

      "title": "Tattooing is vanity and causes needless pain.",

This opinion is based on the scripture in the Quran regarding tattoos, as well as verse 2:195 which reads, \"...do not contribute to your destruction with your own hands, but do good, for God loves those who do good.\" It's also reinforced by the Prophet Muhammad's teachings. [9] X Research source In modern times, tattooing is no longer as painful, and tattoo artists generally use sterile, safer practices to ensure the person they're tattooing doesn't get an infection. For this reason, some Muslims may argue against the tattoo prohibition. [10] X Research source"

Their philosophy on this matter is rooted in their belief that the hadith texts of the Prophet Muhammad that the Sunni follow – including the ones in which the Prophet curses those with tattoos – are invalid. [11] X Research source They also adhere to a \"principle of permissibility,\" which states that anything is permissible in Islam unless it's specifically prohibited in the Quran."

Their reasons for tattooing vary from protecting the person who has one from \"the evil eye\" to signifying a transition to a new phase of life (i.e., from childhood to adulthood), and imbuing specific strengths or characteristics to the body part that's been tattooed.

Its ink comes from the henna plant and is applied topically to the skin, not underneath it. It's traditionally placed on the hands, which are one of the areas of the body considered halal for women to leave bare in public. [13] X Research source Henna is characterized by swirling, intricate designs that wrap around the wrist, hand, and fingers. Some Muslim brides use henna to paint barakah, or Islamic blessings, on their hands for their wedding ceremonies."

They last up to a week before they start rubbing off, and they won't leave a permanent mark or mix with the blood. [14] X Research source Avoid getting a temporary tattoo of an animal or a person, as that's considered idolatry in Islam. Images of trees or other plants and Arabic script are acceptable."

This ruling is a fatwa rendered by a former president of the Islamic Society of North America, Dr. Muzammil Siddiqi. Siddiqi also says, if a Muslim convert was tattooed before their conversion, they're forgiven because, according to The Prophet Muhammad, \"Islam takes away the sins done before it\" (Ahmad 17159).

[16] X Research source Piercings are closed to men because of a hadith by the Prophet Muhammad, in which he says to \"Expel [effeminate men and women who imitate men] from your houses.\" (al-Bukhari 5885).
