      "content": "Wear a snapback classically. Wearing a hat with the brim facing forward is the most classic way to wear a snapback, but it doesn't have to be boring. Typically hats are worn like this at sporting events with team names, numbers, or logos on the front of the hat, but you can also wear a snapback like this as a fashion statement. [1] X Research source For a girl, the classic look to follow this snapback is wearing your hair in a ponytail or a braid. This style helps achieve a cute, sporty look that complements your outfit, but you can also wear your hair down, or in any other style if you desire. For a guy with long hair, your hair can be worn down or pulled back into a ponytail or a bun. Clothes that complement this look are t-shirts, sports polos, or outfits that look pretty casual."

      "content": "Look hip with an urban style. Snapbacks are often popular to wear in this kind of style, helping to create a hip-hop, urban look that portrays confidence and attitude. Some people wear snapbacks facing backwards, but others might consider that outdated or a fashion no-no. You can wear your hat similarly to that of a classic snapback, but your style that goes along with it is really what gives you that urban look. Try throwing on a pair of sunglasses and a casual, but hip jacket. The look you want to achieve here is cool and casual, but still fashionable. You generally also want to aim for a very flat-brimmed hat, as this well help you achieve the best urban look. Another, less common, option for an urban look is to where your snapback facing forward, but with a slight tilt. For girls, achieving an urban look plays a lot into your style and the type of hat you choose. Pick a hat that's somewhat edgy with a wild print, bright color, or embellishments, and wear your hair in a loose braid or down. Guys should also choose a hat that's somewhat edgy with a brand logo or a bright color. You can pair this with a white t-shirt and some bling, or you can go for a more relaxed look with a vintage T denim jacket, and dark shades."

      "content": "Achieve a European look. Snapbacks are popular in European cultures, where the style is very chic and simplistic. Choose a hat with bright colors and wear it facing forward, but with the brim pointed upwards, where the hat is resting on your head at an angle. Then, pair with skinny jeans, a stylish hair cut, and some hip European style sneakers. If it's a cold month, consider throwing on a scarf or sweater. The key to achieving this look is really the hair and clothes. If you wear the hat like this but pair it with a t-shirt and shorts, people won't know what look you are trying to achieve. Europeans often wear muted colors with little pattern, and usually pair outfits with a nice jacket (like leather) and some stylish shoes. Also, the majority of stylish men in Europe have fashionable haircuts, with the hair on the top of the head longer and usually gelled to one side, and the sides cut short. Styling your hair to look European can also help improve your European look. [2] X Research source Girls can follow this similar style, by wearing their hair down with tightly fitted jeans and a jacket, and can throw in some stylish jewelry."

      "content": "Figure out your desired look. Snapbacks come in all different styles, so before you choose a snapback, you'll want to figure out what look you are trying to achieve. Snapbacks can be worn to support sports teams, as fashion statements, or to represent a certain brand (like Vans). Whatever look you're going for, make sure you choose a snapback that represents you. Snapbacks have made a comeback due to their appearance in hip hop culture, and because of that they have a certain edginess. This gives you flexibility on what kind of snapback to choose, meaning you don't need to fit in a box when wearing a snapback. If a hat pops out to you, but it's not your typical style, buy it anyways! Snapbacks can help represent individuality, so throw caution to the wind and defy those stereotypical norms."

      "content": "Look at the color and style. Because snapbacks come in all different colors and styles, it can be challenging to choose a snapback that will fit many outfits. However, the great thing about snapbacks is it's really more about the way you wear them, and not necessarily the color of the snapback that complements your outfit. You may still want to choose a snapback that goes with your general style: if your usual look is more sporty, then choose a snapback with your favorite team, or if you tend to dress edgy or have an urban style, choose a snapback with embellishments or even a fun, bright color."

Most snapbacks come in a one size fits all, because they have adjustable snaps on the back, but different brands may fit differently on your head, so find a snapback that feels comfortable and fits well.

      "title": "Wear clothes that complement your snapback.",
      "content": "Wear clothes that complement your snapback. As previously mentioned in going for a specific look, the key to great style with a snapback is wearing an outfit that complements your snapback, or wearing a snapback that complements your outfit. These are some tips, but know that there is always flexibility in your style: For guys and girls, snapbacks can be worn with casual clothes. Whether you are wearing a t-shirt and jeans, a sports jersey, flannel, or a stylish jacket, a snapback can be paired with may different outfits to help the outfit come together. For a more urban look, you might consider wearing a graphic tee and a snapback that has a logo on it. Try color coordinating but not too much. Your outfit can really come together if you have a hat that goes well with the colors in your outfit, but you don't want to be too matchy-matchy. Use a bright colored hat to compliment neutral colors in your outfit, or wear a hat that matches the color of your jewelry, shoes, or another accessory. Never wear all of the same color, and try to match your hat with the style of your outfit: you probably don't want to wear an embellished, super colorful hat while wearing a t-shirt for your favorite sports team. Play up different hairstyles. For a girl there are a lot of different options for snapbacks, like wearing your hair down, throwing it in a pony tail and looping it through the back of your snapback, or wearing it in a braid. For a guy with short hair there obviously aren't many options, but a guy with long hair can wear his hair down, or throw it in a bun (which is a popular style today for longer hair) or in a ponytail. Wear a great pair of sneakers. Stylish sneakers really go well with any snapback, so choose a colorful pair or a subdued pair, and wear them frequently with your snapback. Closed toe shoes look the best with snapback hats, so you might avoid wearing sandals or open toed heels -- it doesn't really produce the same look."

      "content": "Remember your age. Unfortunately not all fashion accessories can be worn at all ages, the snapback being one of them. In some countries, like Europe, boys and men often share the same style, but in countries like the United States, wearing a snapback at an older age can make it seem like you are stuck in the past or don't know how to best dress for your age. You can still be quite stylish at an older age, and you can definitely still wear hats, but wearing a snapback is generally common among teens and young adults, so you might try sticking to styles that complement your age instead of making it look like you are trying to look much younger. If you really want to wear a snapback, you definitely can. Some people want to stand out and don't want to fit in with societal norms, which is totally fine, but just remember that others may not consider it the best style option."

      "content": "Consider the outing. Snapbacks are great fashion accessories that can really boost your style, but should only be worn at appropriate times. If you are attending a formal event, or going to a job interview, avoid wearing a hat as this can often be too casual. There are other ways to show your style and uniqueness, so before you throw on your snapback, think about the place you are going and the people that will be there."

      "content": "Be who you are, not someone you aren't. Before you wear a snapback, make sure you are wearing it for the right reasons. You want to feel comfortable in your snapback and it should complement your personality. If you're going to feel insecure in the snapback you have chosen or feel like a poser then maybe it's best to save the style change for a later time or choose a snapback that better fits you. The point is, snapbacks require confidence, and if you don't feel confident in one then it will likely be noticeable. Wear it because it fits you, not because you are trying to fit into a certain group of people."
