      "content": "Stop Eliquis 1- 2 days before medical procedures. Generally, you need to get off this medication a day before most medical procedures, including surgeries and dental work. However, you should call your healthcare provider before you stop taking this medication. Your healthcare provider can advise you on what to do before the procedure. Talk to your surgeon first, but it's also a good idea to talk to your regular doctor, as well. [2] X Research source If the procedure has a higher risk of bleeding, you may need to stop it 2 days before. [3] X Research source Examples of surgeries with a higher risk of bleeding include kidney biopsies and coronary artery bypass surgery. Also, any surgery that's expected to be over 45 minutes falls into this category. Examples of lower risk surgeries include carpal tunnel repair, abdominal hysterectomy, and cholecystectomy.

      "content": "Stop Eliquis earlier if you have higher serum creatinine levels. If your serum creatinine levels are higher than 1.5 milligrams/dL, you'll need to stop 2 days ahead for a procedure with standard risk for bleeding. You'll need to stop 3 days ahead for procedures that are high risk for bleeding. [5] X Research source Your serum creatinine levels can be determined by a blood test, which your healthcare provider can perform. Generally, you'll only need this test if you are having kidney problems, too, who will likely be monitoring these levels regularly, anyway."

You generally shouldn't need another medication or device to help with anti-coagulation between when you stop Eliquis and when you have your procedure. However, talk to your healthcare provider to determine if that's correct for you. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Start Eliquis again after the procedure. Once the procedure is done, you can start taking Eliquis again. However, you must wait until any bleeding has stopped and your blood is clotting properly before beginning the medication again. Your surgeon or healthcare provider should give you the go ahead.

      "content": "Switch to an alternative medication or device as needed. If you can't be on Eliquis for some reason, you'll likely need to be on an alternative. Alternatives like the drug warfarin or a device known as the Watchman may be solutions. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try the Watchman if blood thinners aren't working for you.",
      "content": "Try the Watchman if blood thinners aren't working for you. This medical device fits into your left atrial appendage, where blood clots tend to form. It stops blood clots from escaping this area by closing it off. However, because medical procedures can be risky, you should stay on blood thinners like Eliquis if they are currently working for you instead of switching. [9] X Research source The Watchman is a catheter threaded through a vein in the leg. It goes all the way to your heart. It's been proven to be as effective as warfarin at preventing blood clots. Typically, you'll stop your blood thinner just for the procedure, and then you'll be on it again for a month and a half after the Watchman is inserted. That's how long it takes for the procedure to fully close off the area that has the potential to release blood clots."

      "content": "Consider warfarin. Warfarin is an older drug than Eliquis, but it does work well for some people. When switching to warfarin, you'll start taking warfarin, and then on the third day after you begin taking warfarin, you'll stop taking Eliquis. Warfarin can have similar side effects to Eliquis, including severe bleeding, bloody urine or stools, bruising, dizziness, weakness, joint pain, and bloody vomit.

      "title": "Look for signs of internal bleeding.",
      "content": "Look for signs of internal bleeding. Because Eliquis is a blood thinner, 1 of the side effects can be internal bleeding. For instance, you may notice red or especially dark urine, vomit, or feces, all of which indicate blood. Similarly, if you get a cut and can't stop bleeding within 10 minutes, that's also a noteworthy side effect. Visit the emergency room if you have one of these symptoms. Heavier periods and unexplained bruising can also be side effects, though they aren't quite as serious. They don't warrant a visit to the ER, but you should call your healthcare provider."
