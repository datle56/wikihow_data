      "content": "Stop overusing the tendons until you’re completely pain-free. This can take several days to a couple of months. Identify what motions are creating the problem (such as running) and take a break from that activity as best you can. If the tendonitis flares up at work, see if your employer will let you switch to a different activity. [7] X Research source Since this injury usually occurs from overuse, trying to resume your previous level of activity even when your pain seems lessened can worsen your injury and increase the time it needs to fully heal. Resume activities gradually and under the guidance of a health professional. [8] X Research source If your tendonitis becomes chronic, it can lead to tendinosis, which is a non-inflammatory degeneration of the tendon that takes 3–9 months to heal.
