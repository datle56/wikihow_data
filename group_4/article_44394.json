      "content": "Arrive at either of the two Terminals - A (East or West) or F. Get through the TSA checkpoints or arrive via your original connecting flight, depending on where you are coming from originally. Terminal A contains long-range flights (international and coast-to-coast flights) containing big jumbo-jets. In contrast, Terminal F contains shorter more-regional (American Eagle) flights that don't last very long and aren't very big. There's still an occasional US Airways plane that is still on-site that won't leave, and some older paint schemed American planes still have the US Airways logo to some minimal locations departing Terminal F."

      "content": "Locate both ends of the shuttle stop on the map. The connection point for Terminal A's shuttle is just east of the A-East - between A-East and B just to the west of the American Credit Union/UPS Store/Minute Suite Travelex Currency Exchange station along the main interior walkway connecting all of the terminals. At Terminal F, you'll find that you'll have to walk outside the doors near the \"mall\" section connecting the two separately-directed gates."

      "content": "Walk to one of these entrances. However, the shuttle entrance is easily accessible from two points. You may need to walk down the main corridor, not exiting out to the unticketed side at any point, then taking the escalator down (Terminal A location) or opening the doors and walking in (Terminal F location). If you need help getting down the shuttle entrance near Terminal A and have handicapped accessibility issues, ask a terminal attendant, and they should be able to help assist you in the best way possible. Sometimes, a golfcart-like vehicle travels the airport to pick up and drop-off disabled passengers on the ticketed side on an on-call basis if directed by airline employees. Passengers at the farthest end of Terminal A-West (terminals A17-A26, may want to consider alternate forms of movement to propel them to the shuttle stop closest to them"

      "title": "Find out what time the shuttle leaves.",
      "content": "Find out what time the shuttle leaves. Although shuttles leave about every 20 minutes from each location, if there's bad weather in the area, this may either be increased to every 30 minutes or canceled until the bad weather passes - leaving you with walking between the terminals. American Airlines representatives (this is a regional hub airport for them) may be approached for schedule times and might know where the shuttle is when you are at a gate inside one of these terminals."

      "title": "Exit out the door.",
      "content": "Exit out the door. It might be guarded with an American Airlines associate, but talking with them about how you have to board a flight in the opposite terminal may be your only hope, and they will be more than happy to let you out once it arrives or is very close to arriving. Latecomers will often be denied exit until the next shuttle bus arrives - making some other passengers late to their connecting flight."

      "title": "Get on the bus.",
      "content": "Get on the bus. Assuming the bus-doors are open, exit into the back entrance with your carry-ons and personal belongings. Although this shuttle is often not too packed and you may be able to keep your carry-ons next to you on the floor, sometimes the shuttle driver may ask that you move your belongings to a specially-designed area at the back of the \"van.\" There are a few seats, but the majority of the space is standing room spots, and unless there aren't many people, you may be forced to stand. The bus stands a few inches off the ground, but explaining the problems to the driver, for those handicapped, you may end up showing them you need help from them (or the bus) to get on."

      "content": "Let the shuttle take you to the opposite terminal. Although you'll pass underneath terminals B, C, D, and E on your way to F or A, the ride isn't too fabulous but gets you where you need to go quicker than walking. It contains less bumpiness than most people assume, but it may make some passengers rather annoyed because it travels \"too close for comfort\" near the other terminals. Approximate travel time is about five minutes but could take longer if bad weather (snow, rain, lightning) is encountered. [2] X Research source"

A path connects each terminal, but other differences are described in this article as necessary. This article's details are written as taken from Terminal F to Terminal A - seems to be the easiest route and most beneficial. For those coming from Terminal A, you might want to read the description from bottom to top and reverse directions left with right and right with left."

For those in gates F24 and F26-F39, your gates form a part of the revised-L formation where you need to walk down the main walkway and take a right out of the mall-like plaza. For those not in any of those, take a right and make your way towards Baggage Claim (since all these gates are on the same side). Don't walk past the TSA exit to Baggage Claim, though. You are not exiting out to Baggage Claim to get to Terminal A, and you must follow directions here to a T. You are only to walk the direction of the Baggage Claim signs. The walkway path you need is still on the Gates side of the TSA, and you will need a ticket to get there. The mall-like plaza contains a conference room, a coat, and luggage room (for temporary storage), a workroom, a bar, and a set of bathrooms."

If you need help traversing the stairs, ask a gate-attendant for help at the first available gate near this escalator or near gate F1, F3, F5 (gates along this route are labeled in odd-numbered increments). The map on the American Airlines app looks a bit confusing in this respect. Escalators aren't marked in the app but only exist in Terminal F near the exit onto the main walkway concourse. Terminal F sits lower into the ground than other terminals, though viewing it from afar looks deceiving. If there are no escalators/stairs, things do change regularly, and they might have been removed with other forms of transport to get you to the main concourse walkway."

If you walk down the pathway leading towards the United Club location (or could be marked on signage now), you should be going in the right direction. The main concept is walking in the direction of Terminals A-C as marked on signage, and you must follow these signs. For those walking from Terminal A-East or A-West, you'll want to look for the path leading to gates D-F by reading signs and following the arrows."

Travel in the direction of \"Time to Fly\" or \"Brooks Brothers\" as designated by the signs on each shop along the concourse. You will find your first charging station (if necessary) right outside of Brooks Brothers and Tumi with another one near Soma and the all-caps Mac."

There are several gates along the concourse route with A14-A17, picking up with A18-A26 inside A-West. You must walk around several obstacles taking right and left turns (some gates you have to travel around International departures and Customs gate agent desks), and you'll want to be aware of their area."

Still, if you have a gate in A-West, although it's a bit curvy at first, it has another slightly larger nub at the end that seems to curve into a slight V-shape, and to get to a few gates (A24 in particular), you'll need to turn right and walk towards that boarding gate. Most other A gates are self-explanatory, with those few A14-A17 existing along the main pathway."
