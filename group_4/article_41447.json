      "title": "Adjust the dog's position.",
      "content": "Adjust the dog's position. Move your sleeping dog so it is lying on its belly with its head and paws straight. If your dog insists on sleeping on its side, put a pillow under its head so its neck is straight. This may increase air flow. A round bed may encourage a curled position, which should also help.

      "title": "Clean the bedding.",
      "content": "Clean the bedding. Wash the bedding once or twice a week to clear away dust and other allergens. Vacuum carpet and curtains regularly. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add moisture to the air.",
      "content": "Add moisture to the air. Dry air can irritate the nose and throat and increase the amount or severity of snoring. If you live in an arid climate, run a humidifier in the room where your dog sleeps. Alternatively, increase the humidity by hanging damp laundry to dry, or leaving open containers of water in the room, with plenty of surface area."

    {
      "title": "Minimize allergens.",
      "content": "Minimize allergens. Keep your dog and your dog's bedding away from sources of smoke and dust. If the dog frequently sneezes or has a stuffy nose, try walking it on routes away from heavy traffic. Track pollen count in your area online or in the newspaper, and avoid morning walks on days when the pollen count is high. Pollen count is usually highest from 5am to 10am, and at its lowest in the early afternoon. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Be cautious about other treatments.",
      "content": "Be cautious about other treatments. Veterinary, scientist, and government organizations discourage the use of homeopathic treatments instead of vet-recommended treatments. More concentrated, herbal treatments should not be used on your dog without a vet's advice, especially if the treatment is designed for humans. Dogs can react badly to substances that are harmless to humans."

    {
      "title": "Exercise overweight dogs.",
      "content": "Exercise overweight dogs. Fat buildup around the throat area can constrict airflow and cause snoring. This is one of the most common causes of snoring, especially if it increased as the dog aged, or if the dog stops breathing for a few seconds, then gasps. [4] X Research source Make sure your dog gets enough exercise for its age and breed: [5] X Research source Young or young adult dogs of active breeds (such as retrievers or Jack Russell terriers) need at least 30â€“60 minutes of active exercise every day. Even \"indoor\" breeds and toy breeds need regular exercise beyond a short walk. Play an indoor game long enough to tire them out. Even old dogs should be walked daily, but not to the point of limping or exhaustion. Playing at the dog park is usually better for the dog than sustained jogging or running. For best results, look up recommendations for your dog's breed."

      "title": "Take short-nosed dogs to a vet.",
      "content": "Take short-nosed dogs to a vet. Dog breeds with short noses often have breathing problems that can cause snoring. Even if your dog has been this way its whole life, this can still be a serious health problem. If your dog has any of these breeds in its ancestry, take it to a vet. Common short-nosed dog breeds include bulldogs, Boston terriers, pugs, boxers, chihuahuas, Pekingese, Shar Pei, and shih tzus. If you're not sure about your dog's breed, search for the breed name and \"brachycephalic syndrome.\" The vet may recommend surgery to fix more serious problems, such as gagging or choking. [6] X Research source In one study, 74% of dogs who underwent surgery still snored, but more serious symptoms typically improved.

      "title": "Watch for signs of infection.",
      "content": "Watch for signs of infection. If your dog recently started snoring, it may have a cold, or allergies to spring pollen. This is especially true if the dog is sneezing, or dribbling liquid from its nose. Visit a vet if the symptoms don't go away within a few days, or if the nasal discharge becomes bloody or full of mucus."

      "title": "Check the dog's teeth.",
      "content": "Check the dog's teeth. An untreated tooth infection can lead to an abscess that limits air flow. Check the dog's mouth for loose teeth, inflamed gums, blood, or lumps on gums or under the tongue. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Take the dog to a vet if you notice any of these problems. Even if you don't see these problems, keep the dog's teeth clean with a doggie toothbrush and chew toys."

      "title": "Visit a veterinarian.",
      "content": "Visit a veterinarian. If you still aren't sure what's causing the snoring, visit the vet. Fungal infections, tumors, or other health problems take a professional to detect. The snoring may not be a sign of anything serious, but you don't want to take that risk."
