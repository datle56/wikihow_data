      "content": "Attach the 1.2 in barrel for small curls. The Airwrap comes with 2 curling barrels. The 1.2 in barrel is for smaller curls, so choose this barrel if this is the look you're going for. [1] X Research source The curling barrels, along with all the other attachments, click simply onto the Airwrap. Press all attachments into the top of the handle and turn it clockwise to lock it in place."

      "content": "Use the 1.6 in barrel for larger curls. If you're going for large, flowing curls, then the 1.6 in barrel is a better choice. Click it onto the Airwrap and turn it counterclockwise to lock it into place. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Apply any styling products that you use.",
      "content": "Apply any styling products that you use. If you usually use any prodcuts before styling your hair, then apply it now, before curling. This helps your hair retain its curls. [3] X Research source Mousse is a common choice for prepping your hair before curling. Squeeze out a handful, then rub it all over your hair to protect it and lock in your curls. Setting spray is another good pre-curling choice. If you want to set your curls in more firmly, then spritz your hair with some setting spray before curling. You could also curl without any products. Your curls may not last as long or stay in place as well, though."

      "title": "Pull a section of hair 1–3 in (2.5–7.6 cm) thick in front of your head.",
      "content": "Pull a section of hair 1–3 in (2.5–7.6 cm) thick in front of your head. Separate your hair into sections roughly as large as you want the curls to be. If you have thick hair, aim for roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) sections. With thinner hair, you can use a section closer to 3 in (7.6 cm) if you want to. Grab a section and pull it in front of you. [4] X Research source In general for smaller curls, pull a thinner section of hair. If you’d like larger curls, then grab a larger section. Since curling is so easy with the Airwrap, you can experiment with differently-sized hair sections to see what you like best."

    {
      "title": "Set the Airwrap to the high heat and high power positions.",
      "content": "Set the Airwrap to the high heat and high power positions. On the Airflow handle there are 2 knobs, one for heat setting and the other for power. Set both of these to high before you start curling. [5] X Research source You don’t have to wait for the Airwrap to warm up like a regular curling iron, so don’t turn it on until you’re ready to use it. The Airwrap doesn’t damage or burn your hair like other curling irons can because it only uses air."

      "title": "Wrap the curling barrel around your hair and hold it for 15 seconds.",
      "content": "Wrap the curling barrel around your hair and hold it for 15 seconds. Touch the barrel to the tips of your hair. The air automatically wraps your hair around the barrel, so you don’t have to twist it. Slowly bring the curler towards your scalp and let it wrap up your hair. Leave it in place for 15 seconds to dry your hair. [6] X Research source If you want a looser curl, then wrap your hair around the barrel by hand instead of letting the air wrap it up. This gives you a more subtle style. [7] X Research source If you don't know which way to hold the curler, look for the arrows on the barrel. Make sure they're pointing away from you.

You could brush all your hair this way, or just the sections that you want to have more volume. This is an especially good trick to add volume to thinner or straighter hair types."
