Note the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) on the calendar with a number 1. Always note the first day in this way and then count forward from that day on the calendar. [1] X Research source For example, if the first day of your LMP was May 15th, then write or type a number 1 on that day on the calendar. Day one of your cycle is always the first day of flow, not the first day of spotting.

Starting with the first day of your LMP, count forward until you get to the last day of your cycle. This will be the day before your next period starts. [4] X Research source For example, if your period started on May 15, and your next period started on June 13th, then you would count from May 15th through June 12th to identify a cycle length of 29 days. If you’re using an app, it will track the days for you, so you won’t need to count forward on a calendar to find your cycle length."

Once you have done this, look back over the history to find the longest and shortest cycles in your history. Then, determine the average cycle length by adding all of the total days together and dividing by 6. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For example, if at the end of 6 months, you had cycles ranging from 26 days to 31 days, then 26 would be your shortest cycle and 31 would be your longest. If the cycles were 26, 28, 28, 26, 28, and 31, then the average cycle length would be 27.8, which you would round up to 28. This means your average cycle length would be 28 days."

Once you know when your fertile days are, you can make sure to have intercourse on these days to increase your chances of becoming pregnant. If possible, have intercourse daily, but even having intercourse every other day may be enough to get pregnant since sperm can survive for up to 5 days in the vaginal canal and an egg is viable for 12 to 24 hours after it is released. [11] X Research source For example, if you are most fertile between days 9 and 21 of your cycle, then have intercourse daily or every other day during this window."

While using a fertility calendar can be enough to pinpoint your fertile days and achieve pregnancy, you may need to factor in other signs. Some additional signs you may use to determine when you are at peak fertility include: [13] X Research source Basal Body Temperature . A spike in basal body temperature usually indicates that you are about to ovulate. Cervical mucus. Cervical mucus takes on an egg white consistency when you are at your most fertile. Cervical position . Your cervix will feel low and soft when you are at your most fertile."

If your goal is to avoid becoming pregnant and you are not using birth control, then you will need to take special precautions during your fertile window. Either abstain from sex during your fertile window or use a form of barrier contraception, such as a condom or diaphragm. [14] X Research source Keep in mind that using a fertility calendar to prevent pregnancy is not a good choice in some situations. For example, if you have an irregular cycle, recently gave birth, recently stopped using birth control, have PCOS, or are approaching menopause, then your cycles may be unpredictable."
