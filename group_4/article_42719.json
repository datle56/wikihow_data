      "content": "Identify the nature of your problem. To help a school counselor advise you on a problem, you need to first make sure you are clear about what’s causing the problem you're facing. Although a counselor's job consists of a broad range of issues in a student's life, their main areas of advice are academic, college-related, and social/personal problems. You should first determine which category your issue belongs to. Academic problems include having a hard time focusing in class or studying, while college-related issues relate to the application process or what classes you need to take to get into your top school. A social or personal issue would include being bullied or having challenges at home that get in the way of your studies. Keep in mind that sometimes problems can affect more than one area of your life. For example, you might have trouble getting your homework done on time. Ask yourself whether this is due to poor organizational skills, difficulty in understanding what’s being asked of you, or other personal reasons that get in the way of your studies, like family-related issues or lack of confidence."

      "content": "Plan what you're going to say. Having a few questions prepared will make it much easier for a counselor to address your problem more accurately and help you develop strategies to cope with it. You can make a list of the problems and turn them into questions that you can ask your counselor. For instance, if you listed \"my teacher dislikes me\" as one of your problems, rephrase it into a question like \"How can I improve my communication with teachers?\" or \"How can I better explain to teachers my problems with schoolwork?\""

      "title": "Schedule an appointment with your counselor.",
      "content": "Schedule an appointment with your counselor. School counseling is typically offered either one-to-one or as group sessions. Setting an appointment will ensure your counselor has the time and resources to fully help you work through your problem. Book an appointment as soon as possible, or check whether your school allows you to just stop by the counselor's office without an appointment. [1] X Research source It's always better to start with a one-to-one meeting to get acquainted with your counselor and help them get to know you better. The counselor can determine whether you need individual or group counseling after meeting you in person. If you don't know who your counselor is or how to contact them, ask your teacher or an adult you trust at school—they will direct you to the right person. You don't have to get into the details of your problem if you don't feel like it, but if you do, make sure they'll keep it confidential. If you're nervous about talking to your counselor, send them an email first. “Email them ahead of time, so that you're not catching them off guard. That way, you can really sit down and speak together at a time that's convenient for both of you to have a meaningful conversation,” notes Styzek.

      "content": "Prepare any material you might need for the meeting. If you go to the meeting without being prepared, it might give the impression that you're uninterested or make it much more difficult for a counselor to target your problem and find a solution for it. Being prepared can also help you feel more confident and less anxious about meeting with your school counselor. [3] X Research source If you're seeing the counselor to discuss preparing for college , it could be helpful for them to see your prospective college's application guidelines or highlight specific steps in the application process you haven't understood. If you’re stressed about how well you get along in classes or getting in trouble, list some of your concerns so the student counselor can help you worry less about school overall."

      "title": "Explain your problem clearly and honestly.",
      "content": "Explain your problem clearly and honestly. Don't hold out on information that could help your counselor. The counselor will listen and offer either individual counseling, group counseling, or a combination of the two. If you don't know whether your problem is related to school, family, or personal issues, give your counselor a bigger picture of your life so they can help you figure out where your problem is rooted. [4] X Research source If you're unsure whether a piece of information could be useful or related to your problem, it's always best to mention it. The more you tell your counselor, the easier it will be for them to help you find a solution. Don't feel guilty if you don't open up about everything during the first appointment. However, remember that the objective is to establish a relationship with your counselor based on mutual trust. A counselor will speak to you frankly and expect you to be just as upfront in expressing all of your concerns."

      "title": "Listen to your counselor's advice.",
      "content": "Listen to your counselor's advice. Depending on what your questions are, it may be helpful for you to take notes during the discussion. For example, a college application can be a very elaborate process, and you want to make sure you don't miss or forget any point or step you need to take. If you disagree with your counselor over something, don't hold it back. Respectfully tell your counselor you don't think their suggestion could work and explain why. Feel free to suggest other courses of action and discuss them. Saying yes to your counselor just to please them, only to then disregard their advice, won't be of any help! Oglesby notes that a great school counselor “is a wonderful listener, and someone who can listen without judgment. They have to be able to skillfully and knowledgeably switch very quickly, and effortlessly, between many different tabs.” This way, counselors can be “compassionate for students, their families, where they're coming from, and what they're dealing with.” [5] X Expert Source Alicia Oglesby Professional School Counselor Expert Interview. 29 October 2020."

      "title": "Be prepared for complex solutions.",
      "content": "Be prepared for complex solutions. Counselors are not magicians who can solve any problem with the touch of a wand. Their job is to listen to you carefully, help you cope with a problem, and hopefully find a solution, not give you ready-made answers. This won't always be easy and will require your cooperation and active involvement. [6] X Research source For example, if someone bullies you, your counselor won't make this person magically disappear from your life. They’ll discuss the problem with you and suggest some strategies on how to deal with this person. They may also decide to speak directly to the bully, to a teacher, or even to your parents if they think it would help."

      "content": "Thank your counselor after each session. Although helping you is the counselor's job, it's polite to show appreciation for their time and advice. Expressing your gratitude will build a stronger bond between you and your counselor. Being nice to your counselor can also help you with your long-term goals. For example, a counselor will play a large role in your college application process—having a relationship based on trust and respect will make it go more smoothly."

      "content": "They also assist with the college application process. Consider whether you need help applying to a college or school program. A school counselor’s original purpose was to advise students on how to best deal with admission procedures so they could help increase their chances of success. Although their area of expertise is now much broader, helping with college applications is still one of their main roles. Some additional topics related to the college application process are as follows: [8] X Research source The classes you should take to get into the college of your choice. Preparing for and taking college admission tests. Using the right college handbooks to choose the best schools . Get advice from former students who now attend colleges you’re interested in. Additional preparations you can take to get into college successfully.

      "content": "School counselors can also advise students experiencing personal issues. Remember that school-related or career-related problems, like not succeeding or having no idea what to do at college, could also be linked to personal problems and can be better solved if you address them at the source. Working out these problems can help you relax more, so you can actually enjoy school . Social or personal problems that your counselor can advise you on include the following: [9] X Research source Being bullied by a schoolmate. Having trouble making friends in a new school . Lacking confidence . Family issues affecting your school life (ex., your parents' divorce). Being concerned that a friend is being abused . If your problem involves a family member , the counselor may ask you if you'd like the family member to join the discussion as well. Styzek adds, “that a key part of being a school counselor is being an advocate for students. We're here to support them, and we want to see students succeed in school and life. School counselors will never judge students; it's our job to make students feel heard and empower them.” [10] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 28 October 2020."

      "content": "They can also recommend additional professional help. School counselors will do their best to help you with a wide range of issues. However, sometimes it's best to consult someone outside school; talk to a therapist , doctor, or social worker when your problem isn’t related to school or could be better solved by someone else. [11] X Research source You can still make an appointment with your counselor and ask them whether they think you should seek external help. They can advise you about what the best next steps are. Sometimes, seeing a psychologi st can be combined with talking to your school counselor. For example, if you're going through a difficult time because of your parents' divorce and have trouble concentrating at school because of it, you can regularly see both your counselor and a therapist at the same time. The counselor will help you with any related issues, like your academic performance, while the therapist will focus on your well-being and advise you on coping with your feelings about the situation."

      "content": "Whether you need help applying to college, doing better at school academically, or dealing with personal issues, counselors can help more when they know exactly what you need. If you have questions that include more than one of these topics, group them so you can ask about one area at a time.

Here are 25 top questions you may want to pose to your school counselor: [12] X Research source What classes do I have to take to enter college?
