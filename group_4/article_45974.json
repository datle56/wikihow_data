      "content": "Purchase a crucifix for $30 before the game starts. If you’re at least level 8 in Phasmophobia , buy 1-2 crucifixes from the in-game shop. From levels 8 to 37, you can only buy a Tier 1 crucifix; from levels 37 to 89 you can buy a Tier 2 crucifix; and from level 90 onward you can buy a Tier 3 crucifix. The higher the Tier, the more powerful and long-lasting the crucifix is. [1] X Research source All Tiers of the crucifix cost $30. The crucifix is available in all versions of Phasmophobia , even if you’re playing it on the Oculus Quest 2 ."

      "content": "Press E to pick up the crucifix and F to put it down. When you’re in the truck, press E to add the crucifix to your inventory. Then, try to locate the ghost room (the room the ghost hangs out in) as soon as you can; typically, the room on the map with the lowest temperature is your best bet. If the room is on the small side, stick the item in the very center by pressing F . If the room is on the larger side, place it around the section you’re spending the most time in—it’ll help keep you safe as you deduce which ghost you’re dealing with . The crucifix does work if you have it equipped in your hand, but it’s a lot easier (and simpler) to place it on the ground as a means of protection. If the crucifix gets triggered while you’re holding it, it’ll fall on the ground immediately. Press and hold F to preview the crucifix’s range before putting it down. The F key shows an outline of the crucifix’s protective radius. Against most ghosts, a Tier 1 crucifix covers a 3-meter radius, a Tier 2 crucifix covers a 4-meter radius, and a Tier 3 crucifix covers a 5-meter radius. If the ghost is a Demon, the Tier 1, 2, and 3 crucifixes cover a 4.5-, 6-, and 7.5-meter protective radius, respectively."

      "content": "Check the crucifix periodically to see if it was triggered. If a ghost tries to start a hunt near a crucifix, the item will glow before decaying. Tier 2 and 3 crucifixes can protect against 2 attempted attacks, while a Tier 1 crucifix can only safeguard against 1. Once the item appears completely burnt up and decayed, it will no longer protect you from hunts. If only one arm of the crucifix is missing (on a Tier 2 or 3 item), it still has 1 protective charge left. Tip: There’s no need to panic if you notice the crucifix getting triggered. It takes at least 25 seconds for a ghost to initiate a new attack (or 20 seconds, if it’s a Demon)."

      "title": "Put the crucifix down as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Put the crucifix down as soon as possible. Certain types of aggressive ghosts (like the Thaye and Demon) can attack while your sanity level is still pretty high (75% or 70%, respectively). With this in mind, it’s important to identify the ghost room and put down a crucifix as soon as possible so you can be protected. The crucifix only works if it’s put down before a hunt starts. The crucifix is useless if a ghost has already started hunting you. Crucifixes can only protect you against normal ghost-initiated hunts. If you trigger a cursed hunt (by interacting with a cursed possession, like the Haunted Mirror or Tarot Cards ), the crucifix won’t provide any safeguards."
