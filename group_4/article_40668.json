      "content": "Build on their answer with follow-up questions. “How are you doing?” is a classic small-talk question. But it becomes a lot more meaningful if you ask it sincerely. No matter how they respond, ask a follow-up question to show that you’re really interested. [2] X Research source For instance, if they say, “Pretty good, I’m glad to be back in school,” follow up with something like, “Me too! What’s your favorite class so far?” You could also try phrasing it another way to make it a little more specific or meaningful. For instance, say something like, “How’s work been going?” or “Have you started any new art projects lately?”"

For instance, say something like, “That’s a beautiful necklace. Does it have a special meaning for you?” or, “I love your St. Louis Zoo shirt. What’s your favorite animal there?” [4] X Research source If they’re not wearing anything special, look for other items you can comment on, like a book they’re carrying.

      "content": "Talking about things you have in common can deepen your connection. It could be something like a movie you both like, a mutual friend, or a class you’re taking together. If you notice any connection, no matter how slight, bring it up! [6] X Research source For instance, you might say something like, “I heard you saying to Natalie earlier that you’re into Lil Nas X. I love him! What’s your favorite of his songs?” If you have absolutely no clue what you have in common, talk about the experience you’re sharing right now. For example, “Wow, the décor in this coffee shop is wild. What do you think of that painting?”"

But try to steer clear of questions that only require a “yes” or “no” answer. Instead, ask about things that will get you both thinking and help you get to know each other better. You could even turn it into a game where you take turns asking each other questions. [8] X Research source For example, ask each other things like: [9] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good in Action An initiative by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center promoting science-based practices for a meaningful life Go to source “If you could eat dinner with anyone in the world, alive or dead, who would it be?” “What would you consider a perfect day?” “What’s your favorite place in the world?” “If you could magically wake up with one new skill or ability, what would it be?”"

But your conversation will feel deeper and more fulfilling if you’re willing to take a little risk! Get out of your comfort zone and say something that feels a little difficult or awkward to talk about. [10] X Research source For instance, if they ask you how school is going, don’t just say, “Good.” Instead, you could say something like, “I’m excited to be back, but it’s actually a little overwhelming. I’m not used to being around so many people anymore.” Or, try sharing something you feel about them. You don’t have to confess your crush—just say something sincere, like, “You know, I really admire how creative you are,” or, “It’s so much fun spending time with you.” [11] X Expert Source Imad Jbara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2020."

      "content": "If your crush is an expert in something, ask about it. For instance, maybe they’re a math whiz, they love to draw, or they know everything there is to know about crafting armor in Minecraft. Whatever it is, ask them to tell you about it—or, even better, ask them to show you how to do it. [12] X Research source For example, say something like, “The way you draw hair blows my mind. How do you make the shading so realistic? Can you show me?” Not only will you have an interesting conversation, but your crush will probably be pretty flattered that you noticed their special skill!"

Try sharing news about something funny or exciting that happened to you recently, or bring up something unusual that happened to you in the past. You could even build the suspense by saying something like, “Something totally crazy happened to me yesterday. Meet me after class, and I’ll tell you all about it!” [13] X Research source You might start by saying something like, “You’ll never guess who I ran into this morning,” or “Did I tell you about the time I accidentally dyed my hair green?” If you can’t think of anything to share, encourage them to tell a story. Say something like, “So, tell me about a time something really weird happened to you,” or, “I heard you adopted a new puppy!

Ask your crush about the best book they’ve ever read, and tell them about some of your favorites. If they recommend a book you’ve never read, give it a try—then, tell your crush what you thought of it the next time you see them.

Ask your crush about their favorite piece of art or music, or talk to them about their favorite artist. For instance, you might ask something like, “What’s a song that never fails to make you cry?” or “What’s the first work of art you can remember seeing that really took your breath away?” If one or both of you is creative, talk about that. For example, you might ask to see a painting they’re working on, or tell them about a piece of music you’ve been practicing."

Just be yourself and be honest. [16] X Research source For instance, don’t say you’re into their favorite hobby if you’re not. Instead, you might say something like, “I’ve never done that before, but it seems interesting. I’d like to learn more about it.” If they ask you a question, try to give them an honest answer. If you don’t want to answer at all, be honest about that, too. Say something like, “I don’t really feel comfortable talking about that.” Don’t be afraid to share opinions that conflict with theirs, but do it in a kind way. For instance, “I don’t really agree that the Beatles were the greatest band of all time, but I totally see why you feel that way. They were so innovative!”"

Don’t fiddle with your phone, interrupt, or plan what you’re going to say next. Instead, try to really hear and understand what they’re saying. You’ll get more out of the conversation that way, plus they’ll be more likely to want to keep talking to you! [17] X Research source Let them know you’re listening by making eye contact and nodding. If you’re chatting over text, you can make brief comments to let them know you’re still there and paying attention, like, “Wow,” or “Seriously? OMG!” When they’re done talking, follow up with a question. For instance, say something like, “That sounds like an amazing trip. Do you have any plans to go back?”"

If they open up and say something meaningful or emotional, take a moment to process it—don’t just jump in with your own story. They’ll feel more comfortable having a deep discussion with you if they don’t feel pressured or worried that they’re boring you. [18] X Research source For example, if they tell you about a tough situation that they’re dealing with, say something like, “Oh wow, that sounds like it must have been so difficult.” Then, stop and wait for a moment to see if they have anything else to say. If you feel tempted to fill every silent moment with chatter, force yourself to stop and take a breath. Take a minute to think about what you want to say next before you say it."

If something embarrassing happens during the conversation, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that it’s not the end of the world. Awkward moments are a completely normal part of life, and they happen to everyone. You could even crack a joke about it—then quickly move on. [19] X Research source For instance, if you forget something they said earlier, don’t beat yourself up. You could say something like, “Whoops—that’s me, Captain Amnesia!” Then, go on with the conversation. If you say something that offends them, don’t make a big deal out of it. Just say, “Sorry, that was a little insensitive. It won’t happen again.”"
