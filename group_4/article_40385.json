      "content": "Compare the size and weight of the gold to known gold items. Gold is one of the densest metals, so it’s heavier than it looks. If you have a piece of gold jewelry or gold piece you know is real, compare the size and weight to the piece you’re questioning. Fake gold pieces may have a heavier weight but also be too large for the weight to match the weight of real gold. Use a jeweler’s scale to determine the exact weight of the gold items. [1] X Research source Gold bars, coins, and pieces often have their weight inscribed on them. Make sure the actual weight matches this inscription. Check the diameter and thickness of any gold coins you are considering buying. Find the specifications for collectible coins in numismatic guides or online. Gold bars are sold in many different sizes, but the size of a standard gold bar is 7”x 3 ⅝” x 1 ¾” and weighs 400 ounces or 27.5 pounds."

For example, if you own the purest gold, the hallmark “999” or “24K” engraving appears somewhere on the jewelry item.” [2] X Expert Source Jerry Ehrenwald Former President, International Gemological Institute & Graduate Gemologist Expert Interview. 12 August 2019. Gold is stamped with karat weight or purity as well as the manufacturer’s name, Young advises. [3] X Expert Source Kennon Young Certified Jeweler Expert Interview. 11 September 2019. The stamp will typically be on the clasps of jewelry. [4] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source Typical karat markings are 10K, 14K, and 24K. Some counterfeit gold will have a karat stamp but rarely has a manufacturer’s name. Gold may also be marked with GP (gold plated), GF (gold filled), or GV (gold vermeil). These are not solid gold pieces. Gold-plated pieces have the thinnest layer of gold over a base metal. Gold-plated pieces have a thicker layer of gold over a base metal. Gold vermeil is a thick layer of gold over sterling silver. So, if an item is stamped 10K GF, it’s not solid gold, says Young.

If the item sticks to the magnet, it may be fake or not 100% gold.” [7] X Expert Source Jerry Ehrenwald Former President, International Gemological Institute & Graduate Gemologist Expert Interview. 12 August 2019. Gold is not magnetic. However, many metals used to make fake gold have magnetic properties. Hold the magnet slightly above the gold piece. If the gold is attracted to the magnet or the magnet picks it up, it’s not pure gold. For the clearest results, use a magnet that is stronger than a typical refrigerator magnet to perform this test."

Real gold is dense and will sink to the bottom of a container of water, but many pieces of fake gold will float. Test it by dropping the gold into a glass large enough to fit the piece of gold and fill it with water. If the gold floats, it’s not real."

      "content": "Calculate the density of your gold. Density is a measurement of mass per volume. Once you know the weight of the gold and its volume, calculate density by dividing the mass by the volume. Determine the actual volume of irregular objects, such as rings, by placing them in a graduated cylinder accurate to .1 milliliters(mLs). Place 20mLs of water in the cylinder and add the object you wish to test. Record the difference in water level. 1 cubic centimeter is equal to 1 mL. [10] X Research source 24-karat gold has a density of 19.3 grams per cubic centimeter. 18-karat gold has a density of 15.6 grams per cubic centimeter. 14-karat gold has a density of 13.1 grams per cubic centimeter.

[12] X Expert Source Jerry Ehrenwald Former President, International Gemological Institute & Graduate Gemologist Expert Interview. 12 August 2019. This is a good test to use on scrap gold but not recommended for jewelry you plan to wear or resell because it causes damage to the piece. Use a gold testing kit with different concentrations of nitric acid to see if the gold has a chemical reaction with it. Your kit will contain a number of needles with karat value markings. Each needle has a colored gold sample at the tip. Use the yellow needle for yellow gold and the white needle for white gold. [13] X Trustworthy Source Gemological Institute of America Nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards Go to source It’s also possible to use nitric acid to test jewelry that has a hidden area to scratch or notch the gold without affecting its general appearance. Always wear protective goggles when working with acid. Make a light, small scratch on the gold with an engraving tool or nail file. The goal is to expose the deeper layers of the metal. Use an eyedropper to apply one drop of nitric acid to the scratch on the gold. If the liquid turns greenish, the item is probably mostly another metal like zinc and plated with gold. If the liquid turns a milky color, the item most likely is mostly sterling silver and plated with gold. If you're nervous about using nitric acid, try a vinegar test instead. While slightly less accurate than nitric acid, vinegar is a milder acid that will produce similar results."

      "content": "Ask for the gold item’s melt value. Some people melt gold jewelry and coins to extract the metal from the piece. The melt value is the value of the gold based on its weight and the current spot price of gold. [14] X Research source Calculate the value of scrap gold by determinant the purity and weight and multiplying the weight by the spot price per gram. If you are told that the melt value exceeds the weight of the item, be wary of the purchase because it may be a gold-plated or counterfeit piece. The spot price of gold refers to the current market price for immediate delivery. This price fluctuates based on market conditions like supply and demand, economic data, and geopolitical events."
