      "content": "Take note of the signs between squares. In the 6th column, there is an equals sign between the two remaining squares and the column only has one sun, so these squares must contain suns. In this case, the column already contained three moons so the remaining squares could have also been deduced to be suns without the sign."

      "content": "Consider how the placement of symbols in certain squares might affect the board. In this case, placing a sun in any of the highlighted circles will force three moons to be together, so these circles must instead all contain moons."

      "content": "Repeat until solved. Repeating the steps in order will allow you to reach a completely solved board. As a reminder, the steps to solving involve: Placing a different symbol in between or on either side of pairs of the same symbols. Filling squares with remaining symbols to maintain balance in columns and rows. Utilizing the signs between squares. Considering how placements will force other placements to prevent 3-in-a-row."
