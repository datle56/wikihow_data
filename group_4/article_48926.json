      "title": "Pick a song that’s appropriate for your range and abilities.",
      "content": "Pick a song that’s appropriate for your range and abilities. Choose a song that plays into your strengths and downplays your weaknesses. If you have an incredibly powerful voice, pick a bold, loud song. If you’ve got a killer range, pick a song that shows it off. [1] X Research source You’re better off choosing a simpler song that you can sing comfortably than a challenging song."

      "title": "Practice breath control.",
      "content": "Practice breath control. Breath control is one of the most important skills a singer can have. Practice exhaling slowly from your diaphragm, which is the muscle under your ribs, alternating between “ooh” and “ahh” sounds. Notice how you can use your diaphragm to create different amounts of tension in your breath. Your lower abdomen should expand as you inhale and contract as you exhale."
    },
    {
      "title": "Perfect your pitch.",
      "content": "Perfect your pitch. Play notes on an instrument, like a piano or guitar. Try to match the notes with your voice. If you don’t have an instrument on hand, try using an online keyboard."

[5] X Research source You should always begin your warm up with breath activation exercises, like hissing or trills. Then, do some scales that stretch your range.

[6] X Research source When you’re working on your song, start by learning the rhythm, melody, and lyrics.

    {
      "title": "Record your performance and critique it.",
      "content": "Record your performance and critique it. Sing in front of your webcam, or take a recording on your phone. Then, listen and watch carefully.

    {
      "title": "Increase your practicing volume two weeks before the competition.",
      "content": "Increase your practicing volume two weeks before the competition. Your voice is like a muscle, so you need to make sure it’s nice and strong before the competition.

[9] X Research source Remember, it’s better to do a little practicing every day than one huge practice session once a week. [10] X Research source"
