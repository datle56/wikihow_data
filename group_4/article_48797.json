      "content": "Remove and reinsert your SIM card correctly into your phone. The SIM card is pretty much the backbone of your phone, and it needs to be installed correctly for your phone to work properly. [1] X Research source You can typically find your SIM card in either a side tray or near the battery pack on the back of your phone. Here are some tips on how to remove and replace your card: [2] X Research source Tray: Stick the pointed end of a paper clip or earring post into the small hole along the side of your phone’s battery tray. Then, slide out the tray and take out the SIM card. Place the SIM card back in its slot, making sure that the notched edge of the card lines up correctly with the tray’s outline. [3] X Research source Battery Pack: Pull off the back cover of your phone and remove the battery to find the SIM card slot. Slide out the SIM card from its compartment. Then, double-check the reference image etched on or near the SIM card slot to make sure your card is lined up properly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Call your phone carrier for a brand new SIM card. Remove the old SIM and insert the new one in its place. Check if your phone still shows the “emergency calls only” warning—if so, drop your phone off at a repair shop. If a new SIM card isn’t doing the trick, there might be deeper hardware damage at play. [5] X Research source Your phone carrier should send you a new SIM card for free. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Check with your carrier to see if there’s a service outage. Service outages can mess with your phone’s connectivity, making it impossible to place a call. [7] X Research source Visit your wireless carrier’s website to see if there are any service issues happening that could be messing with your phone. You can also check a third-party site like DownDetector to see if your wireless carrier is up and running."

      "title": "Turn off automatic network selection in your phone settings.",
      "content": "Turn off automatic network selection in your phone settings. Your phone might not be connecting to the best possible network on its own, which could be causing your connectivity problems. Open “Settings” and select “Connections” and “Mobile networks.” Tap on the “Network operators” option at the end of the menu and switch off the toggle for “Select automatically”. A short list of mobile carriers should pop up—select whichever one has the best, most consistent service. [8] X Research source This might involve a bit of trial and error. Test out each carrier and see if any of them get rid of the “emergency calls only” notice."

      "content": "Put your phone in Aircraft Mode for 5 seconds. Pull down the notification menu from the top of the screen and look for the airplane icon. Tap on this, which should disconnect your phone from both Wi-Fi networks and your mobile network. Stay in Aircraft Mode for at least 5 seconds before hitting the icon again. Hopefully, this soft reset will get rid of the “emergency calls only” warning on your screen. [10] X Research source You can also access Aircraft Mode in “Settings.” Select “Connections” from the main menu. In between the “Bluetooth” and “Mobile networks” buttons, you should see a “Flight mode” option—toggle this on to reset your phone’s network connection. On some phones, this might be called “Flight Mode”. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Move to a less crowded area and try using your phone there. Cell service isn’t very consistent when lots of people are using the same cell towers at once. If the “emergency calls only” message pops up randomly, you might need to move to a less congested area. [12] X Research source For instance, your phone might not work if you’re driving through a really congested part of the city."
