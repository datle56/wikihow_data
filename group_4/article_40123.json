      "content": "Write the equation in standard form. A linear equation is one that has no exponents greater than 1 on any variables. To solve a linear equation in this style, you need to begin by writing it in what is called “standard form.” The standard form of a linear equation looks like A x + B y = C {\\displaystyle Ax+By=C} , where A , B {\\displaystyle A,B} and C {\\displaystyle C} are integers. [1] X Research source If the equation is not already in standard form, you need to use the basic rules of algebra to rearrange or combine the terms to create the standard form. For example, if you begin with 23 x + 4 y − 7 x = − 3 y + 15 {\\displaystyle 23x+4y-7x=-3y+15} , you can combine similar terms to reduce the equation to 16 x + 7 y = 15 {\\displaystyle 16x+7y=15} ."

If there is a common factor in all three terms, then reduce the equation by dividing all terms by that factor. If you reduce evenly across all three terms, then any solution you find for the reduced equation will also be a solution for the original equation. [2] X Research source For example, if all three terms are even, you can at least divide by 2, as follows: 42 x + 36 y = 48 {\\displaystyle 42x+36y=48} (all terms are divisible by 2) 21 x + 18 y = 24 {\\displaystyle 21x+18y=24} (all terms now are divisible by 3) 7 x + 6 y = 8 {\\displaystyle 7x+6y=8} (this equation is as reduced as possible)"

[3] X Research source For example, if both A {\\displaystyle A} and B {\\displaystyle B} are even, then the sum of the left side of the equation would have to be even. But if C {\\displaystyle C} is odd, then there will be no integer solution to the problem. 2 x + 4 y = 21 {\\displaystyle 2x+4y=21} will have no integer solution. 5 x + 10 y = 17 {\\displaystyle 5x+10y=17} can have no integer solution, because the left side of the equation is divisible by 5, but the right side is not."

Note the new remainder (16). 20 = 1 ∗ 16 + 4 {\\displaystyle 20=1*16+4} ....Repeat. Divide the previous divisor (20) by the previous remainder (16). Note the new remainder (4). 16 = 4 ∗ 4 + 0 {\\displaystyle 16=4*4+0} ....Repeat. Divide the previous divisor (16) by the previous remainder (4).

[7] X Research source For example, the sample problem 87 x − 64 y = 3 {\\displaystyle 87x-64y=3} will have an integral solution, since the GCF of 1 can be evenly divided into 3. Suppose, for example, that the GCF had worked out to be 5. The divisor 5 cannot go evenly into 3. In that case, the equation would have no integral solutions.
