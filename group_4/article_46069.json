Use a garlic press to get 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of garlic juice from these cloves. If you don't get enough juice from these cloves, juice more cloves until you do. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish the salve. Once the tea is done, take the honey and garlic mixture out of the fridge. Mix one egg yolk into the mixture.

      "content": "Use the salve. Once all the ingredients are combined, go to a place where you can easily apply it to your hair without making a mess. Gently massage the mixture into your scalp, not all of your hair. Since the hair grows from the scalp, you want to concentrate the garlic salve here. After it is all on your scalp, wrap a clean, cotton towel around your head. Leave the mixture on your scalp for 20 minutes. [6] X Research source"

Next, take a second egg yolk and massage that into your scalp. Rinse this off with warm water. Make sure you get all the egg yolk out of your hair. Do not wash it again, just keep rinsing the yolk out. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use other garlic remedies. You can use pure garlic oil as a treatment for hair loss. Massage the garlic oil into your scalp before you shampoo your hair. To make it easier and more comfortable on your scalp, pre-warm the garlic oil before you use it. Repeat this two to three times a week until hair re-growth begins or shedding stops. Once it starts working, repeat the treatment twice a month. Puritan’s Pride, Boyajian, and the Eclectic Institute sell pure garlic oil. You can also buy garlic infused hair products. You can also just add pure garlic to a mild shampoo you use. Chop two to three cloves of garlic and drop them into a very mild shampoo. Use this shampoo two to three times a week. While there is no direct evidence that eating garlic or taking it as a supplement can help with hair loss, it is reasonable to think that it may. Add garlic to as many foods as you want or take garlic as a supplement to help with hair loss. There have been some studies that looked at combining a garlic gel with steroid treatment of extreme hair loss and found that the garlic significantly improved hair growth.
