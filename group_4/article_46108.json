      "content": "Wash the area with soap and water before applying the cream. This will ensure you don't have any lotions, perfumes, or antiperspirants on your skin that might interfere with the hair removal cream. Make sure your skin is dry afterwards, as most depilatory creams need to be applied to dry skin. Use warm water, not hot water, as higher temperatures can dry out your skin and may increase chances of irritation. Soaking in warm water can also soften your hair, which may make it easier to break down. This is especially helpful for very coarse hair, like pubic hair."

Make sure to apply the cream in an even layer! Uneven application means your hair could come off in patches, leaving you with spots of hair, which is probably not the look you're going for. Never apply a hair removal cream to your nostrils, ears, the skin around your eyes (including your eyebrows), genitals, anus, or nipples. The cream may irritate sensitive areas of your skin, so it’s best to steer clear of them.

Most directions also recommend checking a small area about halfway through the process to see if the hair is already coming off. If it is, you can likely wash the depilatory cream off early—the shorter the amount of time it’s in contact with your skin, the less likely you are to develop redness or irritation. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Because you can easily irritate your skin if you leave the cream on too long, make sure to set a timer for the exact amount of time listed on the product instructions.

Depending on your reaction, you may want to call your doctor for advice on how to treat your skin.

That being said, there are a few things to note as you shop,\" says board-certified dermatologist Mohiba Tareen, M.D. “Many hair-removal creams tend to be runny and lightweight, which can cause your skin to be dry and scaly. Look for products with urea, glycerin, almond oil, and shea butter to moisturize your skin while the other hair-removal ingredients work,\" she says. [11] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 4 April 2023. If you plan to use the cream in a sensitive area, Dr. Tareen also recommends reading the product description carefully before purchasing it. “While most creams will do the job, there are some that are specifically made for sensitive places like your face and bikini area, so be sure to pay close attention to the over-the-counter labels,” Dr. Tareen says.

You use a retinol cream, take acne medication, or other medication that increases your skin's sensitivity. You have a skin condition such as eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea."

Even if you've never had a reaction to hair removal cream before, your skin's chemistry may have changed slightly, which could cause you to react. In fact, some people use depilatory creams for months or years before ever having a reaction, then they develop one out of the blue. Because of this, it’s best to always do a patch test first.

Follow the directions, leaving the cream on for the advised amount of time and removing it properly.

For example, if you want the longest lasting results, hair removal cream may be the better choice. The cream penetrates to remove your hair at the follicle level, while shaving cuts the hair off at the surface level. This means your skin will feel smoother for longer when you use a hair removal cream, and it will take more time for pesky stubble to grow back. [21] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Hair removal cream is also a good alternative for people who tend to get razor bumps or ingrown hairs from shaving, since these things are less of an issue with this method. [22] X Research source On the flip side, hair removal creams do have a stronger scent that some people may not like. They can also cause allergic reactions or irritation, especially for those with sensitive skin. [23] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source For these people, shaving may be the better option. The bottom line? The best choice varies from person to person, and it ultimately depends on your hair removal goals and preferences. Go with whatever feels best to you!"
