      "content": "Bring two sides of the paper together over the burger. Grasp the center of 2 opposite edges of the paper and bring them together over the top of the burger. Pull the wrapper until it's taut, then line up the two sides so they're even. [2] X Research source Make sure that the edges are completely even all the way across for a neatly folded paper or foil wrap. Don’t overlap the paper across the top of the burger. The edges should reach up vertically above the sandwich. If one side of the paper is longer than the other, the burger isn't centered properly. Unfold the paper and adjust the burger, then try again."

      "content": "Fold the top edge of the paper down until it's against the burger. Fold over the top edges of the paper or foil. Crease the paper, then continue folding the wrapper down in the same direction until the paper is right against the burger. [3] X Research source Make sure the burger is right-side up and you’re folding the paper towards the top bun. You want the wrapper to be secure, but don't fold it too tightly or you might squish the burger."

Rinse the lettuce thoroughly with cold running water. Then, shake the lettuce off over a sink to remove the excess water. Tear off 2 large leaves from the outside of the head of lettuce. [7] X Research source Another option is to cut the lettuce into bun-sized pieces and then stack your burger between them. If you want to do this, tear off 2 large leaves and use a knife to cut the leaves into circular shapes that are about the same size as the burger. [8] X Research source"

For a fajita style burger, add grilled onions and peppers, guacamole , and lime.
