      "content": "Load plates onto the machine’s bars. If the hip thrust machine you’re using doesn’t have attached weights, you’ll need to use free weights like the ones you’d put on a barbell. Find 2 plates that are the same weight to keep the machine balanced. Slide one of your weights onto the metal bar that looks like the end of a barbell found on the side of the machine. Then load the second weight onto the other bar on the opposite side of the machine. [1] X Research source Only use as much weight as you’re comfortable lifting so you don’t overexert yourself. You can add more plates to each bar if you want to increase the weight. Just be sure to use the same amount on each side of the machine for the most balanced workout. If you’re a beginner, try lifting about ⅓ or ½ of your body weight. If you’re more experienced, you can try lifting weights that are heavier than your body weight. [2] X Research source It will take a little time to find the right weight to complete your reps, so choose whatever you’re most comfortable with."

Your machine will either have a padded metal bar or a strap with a buckle near your hips so you’re able to lift the weight. If there’s a strap, pull it tight over the front of your hips and buckle it in. Pull on the strap’s loose end to tighten it. [3] X Research source If the machine has a padded bar, then swing it over your hips so the end fits in the latch. Secure the latch so the bar sits just over your lap. [4] X Research source If you’re only doing bodyweight hip thrusts, then you don’t need to use the padded bar or strap since you aren’t lifting weights."

Make solid contact with the support using the bottom of your shoulder blades and your lower back so you don’t practice bad form. Make sure your back doesn’t arch off of the support, or else you’re more likely to get hurt. [5] X Research source The size of the back support may vary depending on the machine you’re using. If the support isn’t long enough to reach your lower back, then only but your shoulder blades against it. Just be extra mindful to keep your back straight throughout the exercise."

Squeeze your glutes together to bring your hips off of the seat. You will be lifting the weights to get into position, so it may feel a little heavy at first. Push up until your upper legs and upper body form a straight line. [7] X Research source If you’re struggling to lift your hips up, you may have too much weight on the bar.

Push the locking bar forward or pull the lever to turn off the safety. That way, you can lower your hips and the weight even further so you get a more even workout. [8] X Research source Once you disengage the safety, you’ll be supporting the weight on your own and it could drop. Have someone nearby to spot you so you don’t get injured."

Now that you turned the safety off, the weight will drop lower than it did before so you can feel get a deeper workout. Once you reach the bottom of the motion, hold your position for 1 count.

Bring the foot rest down to one of the lower positions and make sure it clicks or locks into place. Since your feet will be lower and you’ll have to extend further during the exercise, you’ll feel more of a burn in the fronts of your legs and glutes with each rep.

Place your feet flat against the middle of the foot rest so your toes point forward. Press firmly into the foot rest with your heels so you get the most support. [19] X Research source In this position, your hips, knees, and ankles should all be bent at 90-degree angles. You can try moving your feet lower on the foot rest if you want to work your glutes and quads more.

Once your upper legs and back form a 90-degree angle, hold the position for a count. [22] X Research source Make sure your feet stay flat against the foot rest, or else you won’t work your muscles as efficiently. Some machines will have handles you can hold onto, while others will not. If your machine doesn’t have any handles, keep your arms out at your side or behind your head.

[26] X Research source Since you’re squeezing the handle, you won’t be lifting the weight stack anymore so you don’t need to lower or adjust the weight. You can do a hip thrust exercise with a dumbbell. Get into the hip thrust position where you are lying down, your legs are bent, and your feet are flat on the floor. Instead of putting a barbell on your hips, put either one or two dumbbells. You may not be able to go as heavy with dumbbells as you would with a barbell, and it might be awkward and a little uncomfortable. Put them on top of your hips, with the hip thrust position, and perform the movement."
