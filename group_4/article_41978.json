      "title": "Read the syllabus at the beginning of the semester.",
      "content": "Read the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. The syllabus for a class is like a contract between you and your professor or teacher. It outlines your professor or teacher’s expectations. Read through the syllabus when you receive it and ask questions if anything is unclear. [1] X Research source If anything is unclear, ask your professor or teacher for clarification. This is especially important if your question pertains to an assignment. If your professor or teacher uses an electronic syllabus, they may update it at any time. Even though they may announce any changes, be sure to check the syllabus often for updates. Note any important dates or information you want to easily access later."

      "title": "Attend every class.",
      "content": "Attend every class. It is normal to miss class once or twice during a semester, but missing too many classes is a sure way to fail English. Be sure to attend class and arrive on time. This will help to ensure that you do not miss out on the lessons. [2] X Research source Be aware that some professors will mark you absent if you arrive late. Make sure you arrive on time to avoid losing points for tardiness.

      "title": "Introduce yourself to your professor or teacher on the first day of class.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself to your professor or teacher on the first day of class. You might feel like your professor or teacher knows who you are since they called your name in roll call. However, professors and teachers have many students and it will take a while to get to know everyone’s name. Introduce yourself so the professor or teacher has an easier time of remembering who you are. Try saying something like, “Hello, Mrs. Jones! My name is Jon Smith. I just wanted to say hi and tell you I am looking forward to your class.” Introducing yourself to your professor is a good time to ask questions. Ask them your questions about the class, required texts, and assignments. Visit your teacher or professor during office hours early in the semester to develop a working relationship with them."

      "title": "Track important due dates in a planner.",
      "content": "Track important due dates in a planner. Start off the semester by getting organized. You will have lots of due dates to keep track of, so get yourself a day planner or use an app on your phone. Record important due dates for your English class with the app or planner. [3] X Research source For example, if you have a paper due on February 15th, add an entry to your planner or app, such as “Paper #1 due today.”"

      "title": "Start working on assignments well before when they are due.",
      "content": "Start working on assignments well before when they are due. You will be very busy trying to complete your coursework, so it is best to start on your assignments ahead of time. Start when your English professor or teacher provides guidelines! [4] X Research source For example, if your professor or teacher gives you the assignment sheet for the final paper a month in advance, don’t wait. Start on the final paper right away. You can brainstorm, do research, take notes, create an outline, and meet with your professor during office hours."

    {
      "title": "Complete the assigned readings on time.",
      "content": "Complete the assigned readings on time. Your professor or teacher should provide a course calendar for the readings. Make sure to complete the required readings before each class. Reading for an English class will take time and concentration, so set aside a few hours to read thoroughly and carefully so you’re prepared for discussion or tests. [5] X Research source Choose a quiet place that is free from distractions to read. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Break up longer readings to improve your comprehension.",
      "content": "Break up longer readings to improve your comprehension . If you have trouble concentrating for long stretches, then break the reading into sections. Read a small section each day and this should help you to comprehend more of what you read. For example, if you have a 60-page reading to complete over the next 3 days, break it up into 3 sections and read 20 pages per day."

      "content": "Look up any words in the readings that you don’t understand. The texts you will be reading for your college-level English course may include words you have never seen before. Write these words down in your notebook and look up their definitions. Write out the definitions so that you will remember them for the next time you encounter those words.

      "content": "Take notes while you read. As you read, keep a pen or pencil handy and underline, circle, and star words, phrases, or entire sections that seem important to you. You can also write comments and questions in the margins of the text as you read. [7] X Research source For example, you can look for the main idea in each paragraph, and underline it. If you come across a paragraph that is confusing, you might write a question to indicate what you find confusing about it in the margin."

That is why it is important to read the instructions before you work on any papers for the class. Ask your professor if anything is unclear before you get started. For example, your old English teacher might have required you to submit an outline before writing a paper, but your new teacher or professor might want you to complete a different type of prewriting activity."

      "content": "Revise your work and then make adjustments. After you have a draft, you can revise it. Revising is not the same as proofreading. When you revise, your focus should be on improving the content of your paper. You can do this by reading through your paper and looking for areas to add more detail, improve the organization, or cut passages that are clunky or irrelevant. [10] X Research source For example, when reading through your draft, your description of a key person’s appearance may seem brief and underdeveloped. You could expand this and add more detail as part of your revision. Keep in mind that you may need to revise several times. Writing is a cyclical process, so it is normal to do this."

[11] X Research source Read your paper out loud during the proofreading phase. Underline or highlight any errors you spot as you read.
