To do this stretch: Lie down on your back on a yoga mat or another supportive surface. Your bum should be as close to the wall as possible. Bring your legs up at a 90-degree angle so that they are perpendicular to the floor. Your hips and legs can rest against the wall. Your arms should be stretched out at the shoulders. Draw your toes down toward you, keeping your legs straight. Try to push your toes back down toward your body. As you do this, you should start to feel the stretch. Hold this position for as long as you can without strain or cramping, or for no more than about 60 seconds. Don't overextend yourself. Slowly, you'll build up your flexibility and stamina."
