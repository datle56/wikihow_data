      "title": "Separate the socks by color.",
      "content": "Separate the socks by color. Before washing your socks, you’ll want to separate them into two loads: whites and colors. This keeps your socks looking vibrant and prevents any unwanted bleeding. If you’re washing both dress socks and athletic socks, consider separating those as well. For example, you might have a load of colored dress socks, colored athletic socks, white dress socks, and white athletic socks. You may also wish to separate socks by material. For instance, consider washing wool socks separately from cotton and cotton-blend socks. If you only have a few pairs of white athletic socks to wash, throw them into the washing machine with any white towels that you have."
