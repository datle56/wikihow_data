      "content": "Wait it out to see if your feelings are real . Cool your heels for a bit first. Feelings aren’t facts, and sometimes they come and go. Before you take an irreversible step, be sure that your feelings for your best friend are actually of a romantic nature. [1] X Research source First, consider whether or not you strongly care for or love your friend simply because she’s a great person or is always there for you.

      "title": "Consider her availability.",
      "content": "Consider her availability. Before you tell your friend how you feel, think about whether or not she will or can be receptive to your romantic feelings. Is she currently in a happy relationship in which she’ll feel blindsided by your news? If she's in a relationship, you might try to figure out if she's happy in that relationship. If so, back off and wait until she's single again. Even if she's in an unhappy relationship, giving her some time could ensure that the two of you have a healthy start rather than you being a rebound."

      "title": "Question if she might be interested.",
      "content": "Question if she might be interested . Reflect on your interactions with your best friend. Has she ever sent any signals that she might be interested in you, too? For instance, maybe she once said she'd date you if you weren't friends. If you’re a female, too, has she shown any indication that she’s interested in same-gender relationships?"

      "title": "Get advice from a third party.",
      "content": "Get advice from a third party. Seek out additional opinions from people who care about you. Tell people who know the two of you how you’re feeling and see if they think she feels the same way or if it's worth jeopardizing your friendship. Only get input from solid, trustworthy people and be sure you think can look at the situation objectively."

      "title": "Know the possible consequences.",
      "content": "Know the possible consequences. Exploring a romantic relationship with a friend can be the absolute best thing ever, or the worst thing. If she’s into you as well, this may open up a brand new door that makes your existing relationship even more satisfying. If she’s not into you, this could change the dynamic of your friendship moving forward. [2] X Research source But, if you really like her, these possible consequences shouldn't change anything. If it doesn't work out, you might need time apart for awhile, but at least you will have taken a bold step towards something you wanted!"

      "title": "Hint around first to gauge her reaction.",
      "content": "Hint around first to gauge her reaction. Introduce the idea of you and her as a couple by casually dropping a hint. You might say something like, “If you and I were a couple, I bet we’d spend so much time fighting about restaurants, huh?” or “Do you believe two people can be friends without ever catching feelings for each other?\" Pay attention to her facial expression and body language in addition to her verbal response. If she seems to shut down or dismiss the idea, this may indicate she’s not interested."

      "content": "Think about what you will say in advance. If you’re still thinking about sharing your feelings with your best friend, go over exactly what you’ll say.

      "title": "Be direct during the conversation.",
      "content": "Be direct during the conversation. Sharing your romantic intentions for a friend can feel messy enough as it is, so try not to beat around the bush. Explain why you asked to meet with her and exactly how you’re feeling. Be as specific as possible. For example, if you’re simply physically attracted to your best friend and would like to bring sex to the table, say that. If you are “in love” with her and would like to be in a romantic relationship, be clear about that ."
