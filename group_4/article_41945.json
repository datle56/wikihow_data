      "content": "Transform your short dress into a long, flowing top. You don’t have to stow away your short dresses once chillier weather hits! Instead, adapt your outfits to the cooler temperatures with a bit of mixing and matching. Stay warm by slipping on your favorite pair of pants or leggings, and then layer your dress overtop. [1] X Research source For example, you can pair a short dress over a pair of slacks for a work-ready outfit. You can layer your dress over a pair of jeans for a more relaxed outfit."

      "content": "Pick out a long cardigan that’s a little longer than your dress. Your cardigan can help keep you comfortable and warm without overwhelming the rest of your outfit. You can use this in place of a coat or jacket, if you’d like. [2] X Research source Long cardigans are a great pairing with mini dresses. To add a bit of contrast, pick a cardigan that’s a different color than your dress."

      "title": "Balance out your ensemble with long boots.",
      "content": "Balance out your ensemble with long boots. These shoes are a great option for cooler weather, and help keep your legs insulated and warm in the cooler months. You can try a knee-high variety, or keep your legs covered with thigh-high boots instead. If you don’t have any long boots, opt for a pair of ankle boots instead—these can be a fun, casual addition to your dress without taking away from the rest of your outfit. [3] X Research source For example, you might pair some ankle boots with your favorite midi dress. Long boots go great with short, thigh-length dresses."

      "title": "Pick a handbag that matches with some element of your dress.",
      "content": "Pick a handbag that matches with some element of your dress. Take a look at your outfit’s color scheme—is your dress a solid color, is there a pattern or accent that you can play around with? Search through your closet for a handbag that matches part of your dress’s color scheme, which will help your outfit look really striking and dynamic. [4] X Research source For instance, if you’re wearing a gray dress with red accents, you might grab a red clutch to match. If you don’t have any matching accessories, pick out something neutral-toned instead, like a black clutch."

      "content": "Don’t be afraid to dress your outfit down. There’s no right or wrong way to style a short dress, especially when it comes to sneakers! Slip on a pair of sneakers, tennis shoes, or Converse—anything lying around your closet will do. [5] X Research source For instance, you can slip into a pair of white tennis shoes for a sleek, minimalist look. You also jazz up your outfit with your favorite pair of Converse.

      "content": "Complement your outfit with a relaxed pair of shoes. Boots and sneakers are all well and good, but they don’t offer you a lot of breathing room when the weather gets hot. Pick out your favorite pair of sandals—it doesn’t matter if they’re fancy or casual. Take a look through your closet and see what your options are! [7] X Research source For instance, you can wear a simple pair of slide-on sandals with your short dress. You might spruce your outfit up with a pair of lace-up sandals."

      "content": "Wear your dress over a turtleneck to stay cozy. Short dresses are light and fun, but they can leave your arms feeling pretty chilly when the cool weather hits. There’s no need to fear—slip on a turtleneck before getting into your dress. [8] X Research source You can pick out a turtleneck that matches your dress, or pick out a patterned shirt to go beneath."

      "content": "Prepare for chillier weather by layering your dress over a long-sleeved shirt. You can play around with neutral tones, or pick a top that matches your dress—the choice is yours! [9] X Research source For instance, you might pair a neutral-toned dress with a light-colored long-sleeved shirt. You might pick out a neutral-toned shirt that goes well with just about any short dress."

      "title": "Mix and match different materials when styling a short dress.",
      "content": "Mix and match different materials when styling a short dress. Pick out a pair of shoes that are made with a different material than the rest of your dress. Then, grab a jacket or cardigan that’s made from something different than your shoes and coat. This is a great way to dress up for chilly weather, or just add a little extra dimension to your look. [10] X Research source For example, you might pair a cotton dress with a pair of leather boots, along with a wool coat. You can pair a quilted jacket with a faux leather dress and some suede shoes."

      "content": "Keep your legs warm without distracting from your dress. Leggings and pants are a great way to stay warm, but they can distract away from your dress. Instead, slip on a pair of tights, which are a bit thinner and more subtle. [11] X Research source Tights are a great option if you’re planning on dressing up for the occasion. If your dress is patterned, it's best to stick to solid-colored tights. If your dress is a solid color, though, you can play around with bolder patterns, like polka dots.

      "content": "Pick out a short dress with a low neckline. Slip on a long necklace that falls beneath your collarbone, so your jewelry can be the focal point of your outfit. Feel free to play around with neutral tones—this will complement just about any outfit. [14] X Research source For example, you might pick out a long crystal or diamond necklace to go with your short dress. Square-cut dresses look great with long necklaces."
