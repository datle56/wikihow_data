      "title": "Pose your arms.",
      "content": "Pose your arms. Keep your arms away from your body to make them look slimmer. For a feminine pose, put the hand closest to the camera on your hip and point your elbow behind you. This will elongate your arm and help it look toned. You could also put a hand in their pocket, holding the arm away from their body. Next, hide your other arm behind your body or gently rest it on a chest-high surface. If you have to face the camera directly and want your waist to look smaller, put both of your hands on your hips. Hold purses or bags slightly away from your body or over a self-conscious area."

      "title": "Accentuate your jaw.",
      "content": "Accentuate your jaw. A well-defined jaw will make you look slimmer in photographs. Bring your head towards the camera by extending your neck. However, don’t simply point your chin at the camera as this looks unnatural. Angle your head slightly as you pose by tilting it to the left or right. [5] X Research source Remember to keep your back straight while you pose. Otherwise, you may look like a turtle with your head stretched out."

      "title": "Pose with a partner.",
      "content": "Pose with a partner. Turn your body away from the camera towards your picture partner. Balance your weight on your back foot and drop your hips, relaxing your front leg.

      "title": "Pose with a group.",
      "content": "Pose with a group. Never be the closest person to the camera. This will make you appear larger than anyone else in the photo. [7] X Research source Next, either put your hands on your hips or around the shoulders of your picture partners. If you can choose who you stand between, choose people with similar body types to your own. This will reduce a contrast between body types in photos. If you’re especially self-conscious about your arms simply put them around your picture partners’ waists. They won’t be seen in the picture at all. If you want to, you can cross their legs one in front of the other to appear slimmer."

      "title": "Take an overhead photo.",
      "content": "Take an overhead photo. Photos taken at this angle generally make their subjects look slimmer. Lift the camera so that it’s about a foot taller than eye level. Look at the camera and take a practice photo. Raise and lower the camera while taking practice photos to find your perfect angle. [8] X Research source For a masculine look, push your chins out while taking photos from an overhead angle. This will make the jaw appear stronger.

      "content": "Choose a good selfie location. Find a spot that has light coming in from behind you. The light will filter around you and give you a soft glow. [10] X Research source If you’re wearing dark clothing, pose against a light background for a slimming effect. If you’re wearing light clothing, pose against a slightly darker or lighter background. If the background is too dark, it will make you appear bulky. Find natural sources of light. Avoid fluorescent lights at all costs. [11] X Research source If you’re posting the selfies on the internet don’t use the same location for every selfie. Keep it interesting!"

      "title": "Crop your selfie.",
      "content": "Crop your selfie. Once you’ve taken a selfie you like, crop anything unwanted out of the picture. For example, if you like the way your face looks but you feel like your arm looks bulky, crop your arm out. Similarly, if you took your selfie in a bathroom, make sure you crop out the toilet or any beauty product clutter on the sink. [12] X Research source Download a selfie app to help you crop photos more easily. These apps will also include filters that you can use on your selfie before you post them.

      "content": "Dress to flatter a feminine body type. Wear fitted tops that flare around the hips to slim your waist. Similarly, wear shirts that cinch in just below your bust or wear a belt your waist. If you’re wearing a jacket, button a few buttons in the middle.
