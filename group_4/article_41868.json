      "content": "Make a study schedule . Time management is key to studying for a test or tests. If you plan out your time, you'll feel less rushed and hurried. You'd be able to avoid a Sunday night, 3 AM cram session. Analyse how many things you have to study and try to calculate how much you have to study each day/week to cover everything. You can quickly test how long it takes you to study one page and calculate the amount of time you need to study everything afterward. Try to study over the course of a week, not just one night. Revisiting the information moves it from short-term memory (the kind that disappears almost immediately) to long-term memory, where you can retrieve it for later. [1] X Research source Ideally, take a look at the content a little bit every day."

      "content": "Start as soon as possible. If you start on top of things, you'll never have to worry about catching up. Read the textbook assignments, do the homework, and go to class. The studying you do on your own time will then be that much easier. Organize a notebook and folder for the class. Keep all your papers together when you need to pull them out three months later. Keep your syllabus accessible to use it as a rough outline for the class. Don't forget to keep up the studying on a daily basis, don't leave it for the last minute!"

      "title": "Get some sleep",
      "content": "Get some sleep . Alright, so we already covered how you should sleep instead of changing your normal routine to wake up early to study because it can ruin your REM cycles. [2] X Research source Get as close to 8 hours as possible. Your grades (and parents) will thank you for it. Before you go to bed, hit the hardest concepts. Then when you do hit the hay, your brain has hours and hours to let it sink in. The fluff can be tackled mid-afternoon -- let the difficult stuff stew overnight for maximum retention.

    {
      "title": "Make time for breakfast",
      "content": "Make time for breakfast . Studies show that students who eat breakfast before a test do better consistently. But you want to keep it to something light and healthy -- focusing on that lump of eggs, bacon, and cheese in your stomach won't do you any favors. Stick to fruits, veggies, whole grains, and light dairy products. In fact, research says that your diet the week before the test matters, too! Students that were placed on a high-fat, high-carb diet did worse than those loading up on fruits, veggies, and complex, whole grains. Do yourself, your body, and your mind a favor by eating right. By eating right, you can get the right nutrients that your body needs, and you will be able to retain information better. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid the last minute cram session . Studying the night before the test will make it even more difficult -- you'll be sleep deprived, groggy, and your mind will not be firing on all pistons. You don't want to gather heaps of information in one night; it's impossible to absorb that much info at once. [3] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Founder, Great Expectations College Prep Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. If you don't see the logic, believe the science. Studies show that late-night crammers get average grades. [4] X Research source If you're looking for a C, cram away . But if you're looking for something a bit better, avoid it."

      "title": "Study right after waking and just before bed.",
      "content": "Study right after waking and just before bed. In the morning, your mind is fresh and clear. Though you wouldn't think it works this way (so simple!), your mind seems to have more room to absorb information right when you wake up. [5] X Research source At night, your brain secretes chemicals to cement the information into your memory, so studying right before bed (and when you wake up) is a safe bet. When you know the patterns of your brain, you can take advantage of them! Research shows that the closer the information is taken in relative to sleep, the more it'll stay in. So review right before bed! What's more, it also shows that getting a good night's rest leads to greater levels of retention. Remember how we said don't cram? There you go.

      "title": "Assemble a study group.",
      "content": "Assemble a study group . According to Duke University, the most effective study groups have 3 or 4 people. One of them should be deemed the leader, or representative -- they'll keep the group on track. Bring some snacks , some music, and agree on content beforehand. Talking about the content makes you read it, see it, hear it, and speak it -- way better for memory. [7] X Research source It's a good idea to spend the first part of your session working on concepts. These often get ignored. Have a discussion on the concepts of that week's material or the major points on the test. When you have a discussion about it, it'll be that much more interesting (and memorable). Then, work on specific problems. When you've covered the concepts, the problems will be more likely to fall into place."

      "title": "Choose a few different places to study.",
      "content": "Choose a few different places to study. Recent research has shown that your memory improves if you take in information in multiple environments. Scientists aren't exactly sure why, but it has something to do with enriching the information and making associations with multiple sets of stimuli (encoding the information deeper). [8] X Research source At home, at the library, it's all good! If you can study where you take the test, do so. If you've heard of context-dependent memory, you know what this is about. Your brain is more likely to remember information in the environment it learned it in. [9] X Research source So if you can bring your study group into the classroom, do it! Avoid getting distracted by your environment and use background noise to block out distracting noises."

[10] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Founder, Great Expectations College Prep Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Get a drink of water or walk or grab a snack. But be sure your break is only a few minutes, about 5-10. Don't make it too long, or you'll set off task and won't study! Remember, you're only taking a break because your brain needs to set the information it's already ingested. Your attention will improve, and your recall will be much, much better. You're not slacking -- you're simply studying the best way for your brain. [11] X Research source Use your breaks to stand up and go for a walk. Go out and get some fresh air, your brain needs oxygen in order to perform best."

      "content": "Go for power foods. Choose something healthy that will also give you energy, like chocolate covered almonds, a granola bar, or a piece of fruit. Coffee and tea -- a little bit of caffeine -- doesn't hurt either. [7] X Research source Staying energized is a big part of absorbing information. Just don't go overboard and crash a few hours later! Fish, nuts, and olive oil (all things high in Omega-3s) are also brain super foods. Have the meal before your test high in these and your brain will be ready and raring to go. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Make studying fun and interactive. [12] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Founder, Great Expectations College Prep Expert Interview. 8 November 2019. Write the information on note cards and then decorate them. Make sure the cards do not have a whole essay of information or they'll be impossible to decipher. You can quiz yourself, others, and work with them as you're waiting for the bus, walking to class, or just killing time. You're also more likely to remember something if you associate it with a crazy story. [13] X Research source Trying to remember that the only war that took place during one president's term was WWI and it was Woodrow Wilson? Well, Woody's initials are WW, so imagine him on top of the world with one of those giant foam fingers. Or one giant Wilson volleyball, painted to look like the Earth, bouncing between the US and Germany. You know, whichever. Graphs and pictures are much easier to remember than boring, drawn-out sentences. If you can make it more interactive and visually pleasing, do so. It'll pay off. Use mnemonic devices too! Your brain can only remember so many things (the magic number is 7, it seems), so if you can lump a whole bunch of information into one word (think Roy G. Biv), you'll be able to maximize your memory. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Separate the content into parts.",
      "content": "Separate the content into parts. The easiest way to do this will be with your handy highlighters. Use yellow for vocab terms, pink for dates, blue for stats, etc. When you're studying, take time to hit all the different types of information, so your brain doesn't saturate with numbers, dates, or hard-to-process information. You wouldn't practice basketball by shooting lay-ups all day, would you? That way, when you study, it should be fairly easy to see the larger concepts versus the finer details. When you're scanning, just focus on the big stuff. When you're really getting into it, delve into the details. Studying different types of material in one session has shown to leave a deeper, longer-lasting impression on the brain. It's the same reason musicians do scales, pieces, and rhythmic work and athletes do strength, speed, and skill drills. So in one afternoon, attack all those colors! [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Take a pre-test.",
      "content": "Take a pre-test. This is useful for two reasons: A) You'll be less nervous when the actual test rolls around (which can be rather detrimental to your grade) and B) you'll do better. A recent study at UC Berkeley showed that students who were tested on information they just learned actually did better than those who were asked to document what they were learning. [14] X Research source So write up a pre-test and have your friend do the same! Then you can grade it for each other and reap the benefits. And if you can get your study group in on it, all the better. The more real it feels, the more prepared you'll feel and be when test day arrives."

      "title": "Review that morning -- if it calms your nerves.",
      "content": "Review that morning -- if it calms your nerves. This is good for the exact same two reasons as stated in the previous step. You want to be as calm and relaxed as possible, and reviewing right before the test will do that. What's more, you'll retain the information (remember how the brain is clearer right when you wake up?). So on your way to class, whip out those flashcards for the last time. Only hit up the simple stuff (only revise simple concepts). Trying to wrap your brain around the large, difficult concepts when you have ten minutes on your walk won't do you any favors. You'll end up psyching yourself out -- the opposite effect of what you want! Just prime your brain for the content."

      "content": "Get in the zone before class. Some people go so far as to meditate before class. Yoga helps, too! Anything that relaxes your breathing and gets you in the zone will be helpful. What would get you in the right place? Consider listening to classical music. Though it doesn't directly make you smarter, it can improve your memory. If you want to get super specific, listen to music that's 60 BPM. That's when the benefits will be highest. [15] X Research source Natural background noise generators that let you play rain, wind, water or a calm fire crackling have the same beneficial effect and help you get in the zone."

    {
      "title": "Do the easy questions first.",
      "content": "Do the easy questions first. An easy way to get stressed out and lose your cool is to focus on questions you don't know the answers to. You start worrying about the clock and thinking about how you didn't study enough. Don't fall into the trap -- move on to what you do know. Then you can hit the hard stuff dead on. The more time you spend on a question, the more time you risk second-guessing yourself. Most of the time, your first answer will be the right one, so trust your intuition."
