      "content": "Understand that Italian vowels are different from English ones. In Italian, each letter stands distinctly as one sound, whereas in English, letters can make different sounds depending on the word. [1] X Research source It may sound complicated, but it isn't. A sounds like the ä in \"Father\" E is pronounced like è in \"Vendor\" I like ï in \"Naive\" U is ù as in \"Goo\"."

      "title": "Italians often have difficulty pronouncing the English “th.”",
      "content": "Italians often have difficulty pronouncing the English “th.” Instead of pronouncing it how you normally would, pronounce it as either “t” (“think\" would become “tink”), or \"d\" (“the” would become “de.”), respectively. [2] X Research source Additionally, Italians often drop the “h” from the beginning of words. [3] X Research source Some other common sound mistakes include GL as LL (as in “Million”) and GN as ñ (as in “Canyon”). Be careful not to mistake certain sounds too often, as it will make you sound pretentious!"

      "content": "Pronounce double consonants twice as long as single consonants. [4] X Research source In Italian, words such as “Azzurro,” “Pollo,” and others feature prominent double consonants, so try to draw the sound out when you speak. For example, it would be “Bet-ter” rather than “bedder.”"

      "content": "Capture the everyday vocabulary of Italians. This is an optional step, and obviously not done every time. The Italian language uses it, and thus, Italians are familiar with it. Example: “You are going later, no?”"
