If you are trying to transfer files from Mac to Windows, this method won't work. When you turn on AirDrop, select Contacts Only or Everyone so you can transfer images between the devices. If you have a lot of files to share, this is not the most practical method. Instead, use an external storage device, like a USB flash drive or external hard drive."

Companies like Dropbox, Google Drive and many others offer cloud storage for your most important files and can also act as an effective file transfer method between laptops. You'll need an account with one of these providers (initial membership and some storage space are typically free). [4] X Research source The limitations to this method will be storage space, upload time, and potential cost - however if you need to move smaller files on a more frequently basis this may be a great solution for you. According to Kats, using OneDrive is a preferred method if you already have a Microsoft 360 account since it integrates seamlessly with the subscription service.

Depending on the computers you're transferring between you may need to reformat to a more universal formatting option (FAT32) before attempting the transfer. Using a storage device is one of the slowest methods for file transfer but may be the simplest to execute if you're feeling intimidated by the more technical methods. If the storage device is recognized and the files are accessible on both computers, you can proceed. If reformatting is necessary you can find more information at Format FAT32 The limitation of this method is typically speed, as numerous large files will take a significant amount of time to transfer in this fashion."

Files can replicate inaccurately, causing the new files to become corrupted. In this case, the file will be lost if you try dragging and dropping it to a new location. Avoid this trouble by copying the files instead of moving them. If they become corrupted, you can return to your original computer to try the copy again."

FTP is generally best if you feel you need recurring access between your two laptops. On a Mac, go to System Settings->Sharing->Services and check \"FTP Access\". Next, click \"Start\" and wait for the change to apply. Note that this path may be slightly different in different versions of OSX. In Windows, go to Control Panel->Programs->Programs and Features->Turn Windows features on or off.

In Windows, open your internet browser and type the server computer's IP address into the address bar directly. Go to File->Login As. Enter the username and password to log in.
