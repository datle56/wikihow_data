Whenever you feel your symptoms flaring up, just rub a dollop of the coconut oil into your skin. This will help your skin retain moisture, and it should soothe any obnoxious symptoms you’re experiencing. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Regular coconut oil is made by steaming and heating the coconut ingredients to bleach and filter them. Virgin coconut oil is made straight out of dry coconuts, so it’s actually the purer and “more natural” product. [2] X Research source Since all of the studies on eczema have pointed to the efficacy of virgin coconut oil, you’re better off picking that fancy stuff up instead of using regular coconut oil.

If you’re looking for a totally holistic treatment, pick up some manuka honey from your local organic grocer or farmer’s market.

Your lesions should go away much faster than they would otherwise, and you may get some relief from the scratching.

If you’ve been scratching a lot, wait for your skin to heal a bit before applying aloe vera. The minty sensation combined with scratched skin may actually make you feel worse."

The hydrocortisone you find in medical creams is often made synthetically, but it’s identical to the hormone your body produces. The ingredient in your cream may not technically be natural, but it’s a naturally-occurring compound. [19] X Research source"
