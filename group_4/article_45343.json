      "title": "Interactive Personalities",
      "content": "Interactive Personalities This category includes any ghost that can interact with the living world. They’re intelligent and self-aware and can appear physically, audibly, or telepathically. They may be able to touch people or objects and create smells that were associated with them, like perfume or tobacco. [1] X Research source Frequently, these are a deceased friend or family member, though they may occasionally be a stranger. When seen by a loved one, these sightings are typically a farewell or an attempt to console the grieving. Historical ghosts are also a type of interactive personality. These are historical figures who must be identifiable to the observer, like Abraham Lincoln, for example. These ghosts are usually tied to a specific location and have been seen numerous times by different people over the years. It’s also possible for an interactive personality to remain anonymous. A common example is seeing an unknown soldier on a battlefield. Usually, these spirits are angry, confused, or scared when encountering the living. Encounters with interactive personalities can be positive or negative, depending on the ghost’s demeanor. They can be loving and warm or angry and frightened. Pro tip: If you want to communicate with ghosts via Ouija board, it’s important to stay safe. Paranormal expert Jennifer McVey says to close off your energy. “If you ask your higher self to be the guide,” she says, “then the spirit doesn’t actually have to get in your body. It can be outside of your body and energy field, and it can communicate with you.”"

      "title": "Poltergeists",
      "content": "Poltergeists The term “poltergeist” comes from the German word for “noisy ghost.” Unlike other types of ghosts, poltergeists often throw and move objects, make repetitive noises, and cause havoc and mischief for the person or place they’re haunting. In general, poltergeists are relatively harmless—just inconvenient. [2] X Research source Usually, a poltergeist attaches itself to one person and follows them to different locations. Typically, they feed off of the energy and emotions of children and teenagers. While poltergeists are generally nothing more than an annoyance, there have occasionally been reports of them attacking people. Some people believe that the person being haunted is actually using telekinesis unconsciously, and the “haunting” is a result of their abilities rather than an actual ghost."

      "title": "Residual Ghosts",
      "content": "Residual Ghosts Residual ghosts are tied to a specific location, usually associated with a traumatic event or emotional experience. These ghosts replay that particular moment from their life over and over. [3] X Research source According to the Stone Tape Theory, these ghosts are like tape recordings. They’re mental impressions from the traumatic event that are projected onto objects in the form of energy to be replayed in certain conditions. Residual ghosts are sometimes called imprints, as well, because they’re imprinted to a specific place and pattern of behavior. Sometimes, these ghosts may only appear on the anniversary of a significant event, like their death. These are called cyclic ghosts. Pro tip: To overcome your fear of ghosts , ask yourself where the fear comes from. Paranormal expert Jennifer McVey says, “Sometimes when you’re terrified of ghosts, you actually might be picking up on the ghost’s feelings more than your own.”"

      "content": "Living Ghosts While extremely rare, living ghosts are manifestations of a living person who is currently in a different location. Sometimes, the living person is in danger and their spirit returned to a safe space or came to warn a loved one of danger. Since these events are rare and non-recurring, they cannot be thoroughly studied. [7] X Research source Another type of living ghost is the “moment of death” ghost. The spirit of a dying person may appear to a loved one before they officially pass on, and the loved one will realize it was at the moment of their death when they receive the news that the person has passed away."

Some common sightings include the ghostly appearance of old ships and trains that no longer exist. Usually, these vehicles met a tragic end. These phenomena are usually rare and non-recurring. [8] X Research source Some other common inanimate object ghosts include weapons, jewelry, dolls, and any item that moves or acts on its own, like a television turning itself on. However, some argue that these hauntings could be the result of a poltergeist. [9] X Research source"

[12] X Research source In Buddhism, preta are not seen as frightening. Instead, Buddhists pity them and try to help them move on by performing rituals and providing offerings. To end their karmic cycle, the preta’s living family must perform a series of funerary rites over the course of a year or the spirit will remain cursed for eternity. While invisible to the human eye, preta are described as having sunken, mummified skin, narrow limbs and necks, and an enormous stomach."

Every time one went missing, the students could hear Madam Koi Koi walking. Similar legends can be found in other African countries, like Madam Moke in Ghana and Miss Konkoko in Tanzania."
