      "content": "Do a self scan. Whenever you feel hungry or have the desire to eat, take a pause for a minute or two and do a quick self scan. This will help you determine what the best action is for your feelings. Many times you may feel hungry when you’re actually not physically hungry at all. You might be bored, thirsty, upset, stressed, or just in the mood to eat a tasty snack. [1] X Research source Since there are a variety of reasons outside of true physical hunger that can cue you to eat, a quick self scan can help you out. Take a minute to think: “Is my stomach growling? Does my stomach feel empty? When was my last meal or snack? Do I feel stressed, anxious or upset? Am I bored?” Asking yourself these questions can help you determine whether or not you're truly hungry. If you are physically hungry, have a planned snack or wait until your next meal to eat. You can also apply some tricks to help calm your hunger down. If you're not truly hungry, find another activity to distract yourself with until your craving or desire to eat goes away."
