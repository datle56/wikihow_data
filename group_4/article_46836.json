      "content": "Plug your subwoofer into a nearby electrical outlet. The power cords on most newer speakers come fitted with standard 2- or 3-prong connectors, so you shouldn’t have any trouble getting the plug to fit. [1] X Research source A power strip can come in handy if you already have a lot of other devices hooked up in the area where you want to put your subwoofer. Keep a little slack in your power cord or consider using a separate extension cord. You’re most likely going to want to move your subwoofer around a little later on to get its placement just right.

      "title": "Use a subwoofer cable to connect your receiver to the LFE input on your subwoofer.",
      "content": "Use a subwoofer cable to connect your receiver to the LFE input on your subwoofer. LFE, short for “low-frequency effects,” is a special auxiliary audio channel sometimes used to lend a particular bass track a little more oomph. Double-check that the cable is running from the \"output\" hub on your receiver, or the device responsible for generating the audio, to the \"input\" hub on your subwoofer. [3] X Research source A new speaker should come with its own subwoofer cable. If yours didn’t, you can pick one up for around $20-30 at any electronics store or audio equipment supply shop. Most types of media receivers feature subwoofer output ports specifically for this purpose. Examples of common AV receivers include things like radios, stereos, DVD/Blu-ray players, and gaming consoles. Most movies and video games are engineered with LFE capability, while other forms of entertainment, including professionally mastered music, rely on several different channels to create a full spectrum of sound. A useful way to think of LFE is as a bonus layer of bass rather than its primary source. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Connect your subwoofer directly to your main speakers if LFE isn’t enabled.",
      "content": "Connect your subwoofer directly to your main speakers if LFE isn’t enabled. Connect the output of your amplifier/receiver to the subwoofer first. Then, connect the sub to the speakers. It's important to connect to the subwoofer first, especially if the sub has a crossover built-in. [5] X Research source A crossover splits the signal so the sub only plays the low frequencies and the speakers play the higher frequencies. Use a crossover if your subwoofer has one because this will improve audio quality. If you don’t hear any bass coming from your subwoofer upon finalizing your installation, connect your receiver’s left and right line outputs to the indicated input ports on your subwoofer instead to make it compatible with a multi-channel setup."

      "title": "Set the size of your front left and right speakers to “small” if it has options.",
      "content": "Set the size of your front left and right speakers to “small” if it has options. Head to your receiver’s settings menu and select “speakers” under the “audio settings” submenu. There, you should see the option to change your recognized speaker size. By setting your speaker size to “small,” you’ll be routing more low-frequency sounds to your subwoofer. [6] X Research source This is a good trick for optimizing your sound’s low-range texture, even if you’re working with large standing speakers. [7] X Research source If you plan on using your subwoofer with multiple receivers, keep in mind that you’ll need to adjust the speaker size setting on each of them individually. Note that not all speakers have this option."

      "title": "Set your subwoofer’s crossover point to 10 Hz above the lowest frequency it can produce cleanly.",
      "content": "Set your subwoofer’s crossover point to 10 Hz above the lowest frequency it can produce cleanly. Put on some music and turn the frequency as low as it can go. Then, raise the frequency until the music sounds clean and not distorted. Raise the crossover point 10 Hz above this level for optimum sound. [8] X Research source The term “crossover point” describes the frequency at which lower-pitched sounds are split from the front left and right speakers to the subwoofer, which is better built to handle them. [9] X Research source In most cases, a new subwoofer will come pre-set to a crossover point optimized for the speaker’s size. Avoid messing with it unless you’re specifically asked to configure this setting."

      "title": "Adjust the phase to whichever setting offers superior clarity and depth.",
      "content": "Adjust the phase to whichever setting offers superior clarity and depth. Look for the phase switch somewhere on the back or side of your speaker or a dial on the digital interface. The phase range is between 0 and 180. To determine what setting you should go with, put on some media with plenty of bass and flip back and forth between the two settings or rotate the dial a few times before settling on what sounds best. [10] X Research source The sound quality, as influenced by the phase, depends partly on where the speaker is in the room, so let your ears guide you, and don’t worry too much about making the “right” choice."

      "title": "Turn the volume up to your preferred level.",
      "content": "Turn the volume up to your preferred level. Most large and midsized subwoofers have onboard volume controls, allowing you to decide how much bass you want to hear in a particular audio track. Simply turn the corresponding knob to the right to increase the volume or to the left to decrease it. You may need to tweak the volume on a movie-to-movie or game-to-game basis since different soundtracks are mastered with different levels."

      "title": "Keep smaller subwoofers within 3–4 ft (0.91–1.22 m) of your main speakers.",
      "content": "Keep smaller subwoofers within 3–4 ft (0.91–1.22 m) of your main speakers. If space permits, place your sub (or subs) somewhere near your front-facing left and right speakers. Grouping your speakers in this way will help to ensure that you’re treated to one cohesive wave of sound rather than a disjointed mess. [11] X Research source If you get your audio from a soundbar, try to find a home for your subwoofer on either side of it to keep both components close together. If you situate your front speakers and subwoofer too far apart, it may sound as if the bass is coming from somewhere else entirely. This can make for a somewhat chaotic listening experience. Placement isn't as important for larger subwoofers. Just don't put them in a cabinet or other area where they're totally enclosed."

      "title": "Place your subwoofer about a third of the way into the room from the outer walls.",
      "content": "Place your subwoofer about a third of the way into the room from the outer walls. When it comes to figuring out where to put subwoofers and other audio equipment, it can be helpful to follow the “Rule of Thirds.” That is, stow your speaker in the sweet spot that lies roughly a third of the way between the center of the room and its outer walls. This zone will generally offer the best balance between acoustics and practicality. [12] X Research source Positioning a speaker right next to a wall invites irritating vibration or distortion, but installing one smack dab in the center of the room tends to result in a dull, unfocused sound. Avoid placing a sub in a corner, as this could distort the sound."

      "title": "Put the subwoofer where you sit and move around the room to find the best placement.",
      "content": "Put the subwoofer where you sit and move around the room to find the best placement. Stick your sub on your couch or another area where you'll be spending time listening to music or movies. Turn on your sound system and crank the volume. Then, get down on your hands and knees and slowly make your way to different parts of the room, noting any alterations to the character of the sound as you go. When you find a position you like, move your sub as close to that spot as possible without interfering with the room’s layout. [13] X Research source It will be much easier for you to simply take a few steps here and there than it will be to keep moving your subwoofer over and over again. “Crawling” for bass can be a useful solution if you’ve already tried out a few different placements and none of them have stood out to you.

      "content": "Perch your subwoofer on a sound-dampening platform to minimize vibration. These nifty accessories do exactly what their name suggests—absorb environmental sound that might otherwise threaten to disrupt your enjoyment of whatever you’re listening to. If you’ve got hard flooring in the room you’ve designated for your home entertainment setup, having some type of base for your bass is a must. [15] X Research source A decent speaker platform will typically cost you somewhere between $50-80. You’ll find these accessories at the same shop where you bought your subwoofer. If you don’t want to shell out for a proper platform, you can try improvising one by setting your subwoofer on a throw rug, a folded towel, or a small stack of newspapers. You could also try rigging up your own elevated platform using items like a low-end table or wooden frame and an anti-vibration foam pad cut to size. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a good place to put your subwoofer unit. Most mobile audio enthusiasts prefer to tuck their subwoofers away in the trunk or rear compartment, where they typically have plenty of room to sit comfortably. If your trunk or hatch is a no-go, however, you could also stash your unit somewhere inside the cab, like under the front passenger-side seat, between the back seats, or inside the back shelf just below the rear windshield. Active subwoofers generate a lot of heat while in use, so make it a point to choose a spot that will offer adequate ventilation. Never cover your unit with blankets, clothing, or any other flammable materials. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Disconnect the negative terminal of your vehicle’s battery to power. Turn off your vehicle completely and remove your keys from the ignition. Then, pop the hood and use an appropriately sized wrench to loosen the bolt, locking the battery’s negative terminal head in place. Lift the terminal off its post and pull it safely to one side. [18] X Research source The negative terminal will be marked with the “-” symbol. Automobile battery terminals are almost always secured with 10mm bolts, which can be good to know if you’re having trouble selecting the right wrench. [19] X Research source This step is crucial for ensuring that there’s no electric current being directed to any part of your vehicle while you’re figuring out the wiring for your subwoofer."

      "content": "Connect your subwoofer to your vehicle’s battery and stereo system. To connect your subwoofer , first, run the main power cable from the battery to the unit’s fuse holder. Splice the turn-on wire and signal cable into your stereo’s internal wiring harness and route them through the cabin of your vehicle in such a way that they remain hidden and protected from damage. Then, fasten the unit’s ground wire to a suitable spot on your vehicle’s chassis to guarantee a safe, stable connection. [20] X Research source Hooking up a subwoofer is a somewhat complicated project requiring a fair amount of technical expertise. Unless you’re sure you know what you’re doing, it’s strongly recommended you hire a qualified audio expert to make sure the job gets done right and avoid costly mistakes. Don’t forget to reconnect the negative terminal of your vehicle's battery when you’re done putting in your new subwoofer."

      "content": "Adjust your sub’s settings to the levels that sound best in your vehicle. Settings like gain, frequency, crossover, and bass boost play a role in determining the overall character of the sound emitted by your subwoofer. Generally speaking, you want your bass to be focused enough to clearly hear those bumping, booming low tones, but not so loud that it opens the door for irritating audio defects like rattling, buzzing, or distortion. [21] X Research source Turn the built-in amp’s gains all the way down before giving your sub a test run. That way, you can tweak them individually as you listen until you achieve the precise sound you want. [22] X Research source"
