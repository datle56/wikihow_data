      "content": "Check for a clear quality photo. The picture should be well-lit and shouldn't be blurry - you should clearly be able to see the person's face in it. Ensure that the person in the photo and the person in front of you are the same. [1] X Research source This seems obvious, but many people using fake IDs hope that the person checking them will be too busy to look closely at the photo."

      "title": "Check the printed details.",
      "content": "Check the printed details. One trick of fake IDs is to use another person’s expired ID card or license. Check the card to make sure that it is not expired. Check to see that the type is consistent and hasn’t been tampered with. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Become familiar with various license formats.",
      "content": "Become familiar with various license formats. In many states, driver’s licenses for minors are formatted vertically, while those for people over 21 are horizontal. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for microprint.",
      "content": "Look for microprint. Microprint is a type style that is so small that it appears as a straight line to the naked eye. It is only visible with a special magnifier. Currently, 48 states use microprint as a security feature. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the plastic laminate for signs of splitting.",
      "content": "Check the plastic laminate for signs of splitting. A fake ID is likely to be of poor quality plastic, may show signs of tampering or “splitting,” and is likely to bend or fold more easily than a genuine one. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for the holographic image.",
      "content": "Look for the holographic image. State-issued driver's licenses carry an image that flashes in the light. Fake licenses may attempt to replicate this by printing a dim image in the background with a bright color. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Invest in a 10x magnifier.",
      "content": "Invest in a 10x magnifier. For quick and relatively easy verification, a 10x magnifier can be used to verify the microprint on most current IDs or licenses. The microprint that appears to the naked eye as a solid line will appear as text under a magnifier. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use ultra-violet light.",
      "content": "Use ultra-violet light. Most states’ current driver’s licenses make use of special print or images that only appear under ultra-violet light. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Invest in an ID scanner.",
      "content": "Invest in an ID scanner. For a relatively low cost, compared to the cost of getting caught serving alcohol to minors, for example, it is possible to purchase a scanner that will read a variety of IDs or licenses and verify validity. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source These are often hand-held devices that can be used at the point of admission to verify authenticity."

      "title": "Get a smart phone app.",
      "content": "Get a smart phone app. There are even some available smart phone apps that will scan bar codes on IDs to verify authenticity. [11] X Research source Many of these are free and will turn an iPhone or iPad into a useful scanner."

      "title": "Use published reference materials.",
      "content": "Use published reference materials. The Driver’s License Guide Company has published an I.D. Checking Guide with the most current information about licenses in the U.S. and Canada. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Participate in training. Search for organizations that will offer training in your area or online about identifying security features of driver’s licenses and other ID cards. There are private security companies that offer such classes. Alternatively, you may be able to reach out to a local sheriff’s office, district attorney, or other state agency."
