      "content": "Know when to teach place value. If you are teaching within a pre-set curriculum, then you may already have an idea of how place value will fit into the larger scope of your course. If you are tutoring or homeschooling, you are likely working within a more flexible structure. Plan to teach place value shortly after students have learned to count by ones and perform simple addition and subtraction operations – generally around first or second grade. [1] X Research source An understanding of place value will lay the foundation for these kids to dive into more complex mathematical concepts."

      "content": "Introduce the concept of group counting. Most young students have only learned to count numbers by ones: one... two... three... four. This is sufficient for basic addition and subtraction, but it is too basic to give students a strong foundation for understanding more complex functions. Before you teach the kids how to break down large numbers into place values, it may be helpful to teach them how to chunk groups of small numbers together into big numbers. [2] X Research source Teach your class how to skip-count by twos, threes, fives, and tens. This is an essential concept for students to understand before they learn place value. [3] X Research source Especially try to establish a strong \"sense of ten.\" Modern western mathematics uses the number ten as a base, so it will be much easier for kids to learn more complex systems if they are used to thinking in this way. Teach your pupils to group numbers instinctively into sets of ten. [4] X Research source"

Place value, simply put, is the idea that the value of a digit (0-9) depends on its \"place\" or position in a number. [5] X Research source"

We combine these digits to form every single other number. A digit can be a number (e.g. the number 7), but only if it is not grouped with another digit. When two or more digits are grouped together, the order of those digits form a larger number. [6] X Research source Demonstrate that on their own, \"1\" is the number one and \"7\" is the number seven. When you put them together, as \"17,\" they form the number seventeen. Similarly, \"3\" and 5\" together make the number thirty-five. Draw several other examples to bring the point home."

Show your students how the numbers from 0 to 9 interact with the numbers from 10 to 100. Explain that every number from 10 to 99 is really made up of two numbers, with one number in the \"ones\" place and a modifying number in the \"tens\" place. Show how the number \"4\" signifies \"four\" when it is in the \"ones\" place, but acts as a prefix for the set of \"40\" when it is located in the \"tens\" place. [9] X Research source Illustrate the \"ones\" place. Direct the class mark or cover up every number that has a \"3\" in the \"ones\" place: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93. Explain the \"tens\" place. Have the class point out every number with a \"2\" in the \"tens\" place: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Explain that the \"3\" in \"23\" is stacked on top of the \"20\" that is signified by the \"2.\" Teach your kids to read the \"tens\" place as a trigger."

You can explain place value using increments of money, which students have likely already learned to associate with scaled numerical values. For a fun and interactive exercise, try using the students themselves as the \"groups\" of values. Memory is predominantly visual, and the concept of place value can be abstract until you put it into visual terms. [10] X Research source For that matter, numerical symbols themselves can be abstract for young kids! Look for ways to frame group counting and place value so that they come across as simple, tangible, and intuitive."

Give them a number (e.g. 7) and place a white chip on the right side of your work table. [12] X Research source Say another number – for instance, 30. Lay down three blue chips to represent the 3 (in the \"tens\" place) and zero white chips to represent the 0 (in the \"ones\" place.) You don't strictly need to use poker chips. You can use almost set of objects to represent the three basic value \"places,\" as long as each group (color of chips, etc.) is standard, homogeneous, and easy to recognize."
