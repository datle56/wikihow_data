      "content": "Comb your mohawk to one side for a relaxed look. Keep your hair to the side if you don’t feel like putting it up. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair and style your hair in the direction it naturally goes. That way, the hair on one side of your head will look longer than the other.

      "content": "Slick back your mohawk with gel to keep it in place. Take all of the hair in your mohawk and comb it toward the back of your head. Put a coin-sized amount of gel in your hand and work it into your fingers to warm it up. Run your fingers through your hair toward the back of your head to work the gel in. Use your comb to smooth your hair to give it a slicked back look. [2] X Research source You don’t have to use gel, but it will help hold your hair in place. A firm gel is recommended."

      "title": "Pull your hair back into a ponytail to keep it out of your face.",
      "content": "Pull your hair back into a ponytail to keep it out of your face. Comb your mohawk toward the back of your head, and grab the hair to secure it in a tight ponytail with a hair elastic. If the hair from the front of your head doesn’t reach back far enough, then use a bobby pin to hold it in place so it doesn’t fall down. [3] X Research source Put the hair elastic around your wrist so you can easily transfer it onto your hair."

      "title": "Braid",
      "content": "Braid your mohawk to add a fun style to your hair. Comb your hair backward and place a bobby pin to secure it to the top of your head. Then split the hair on the back of your head into 3 equal sections. Bring the left section of hair over the middle section and pull it tight. Then pull the right section over the center to start your braid. Keep alternating which side you bring to the center until you finish your braid. Secure your hair in place with an elastic. [4] X Research source Fold your braid up and secure it with a hair clip if you want to add a fun accessory to your hair."

      "title": "Wash",
      "content": "Wash and dry your hair before styling it. Be sure to use a shampoo that removes all of the grease and oil from your hair so it’s easier to style. Lather the shampoo into your scalp and work toward the ends of your hair. Rinse the shampoo out of your hair completely before you start styling it. [5] X Research source You can also condition your hair after you shampoo it to help prevent damage. Be sure to towel dry your hair before you start styling it."

      "title": "Pull a section of hair straight up with a comb.",
      "content": "Pull a section of hair straight up with a comb. Grab a section of hair that goes 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) back from your forehead. Use a wide-toothed comb to pull your hair straight up. Just before you reach the ends of your hair, pinch it between the fingers of your nondominant hand and pull it tight. [6] X Research source Straighten your hair if it’s curly or wavy so it sticks straight up when you fan it."

      "content": "Apply strong hair spray to the sides of your hair. Make sure the can of hair spray is labeled “strong” or “extra strong” to keep your mohawk from falling down. Hold the can of hair spray with your dominant hand about 5–6 in (13–15 cm) from your hair. Start spraying near the scalp and work your way towards your ends with a continuous spray. Use more spray near your scalp since it will support the weight of your hair the most. [7] X Research source Be sure to spray both sides of your mohawk so it doesn’t fall down."

Start heating the hair closest to your scalp first and work toward the ends of your hair. Switch sides that you’re drying to harden the hair spray. Let go of your hair to see if it holds in place. [8] X Research source You may need to reapply hair spray and use your hair dryer multiple times to ensure the hair stays in place."

      "content": "Shape the hair with your hands so it sticks straight up. Once your hair stays up on its own, use your hands to flatten the ends of your hair so they look a spread-out fan. If you need to, spray a little more hair spray onto the ends of your hair and work it in with your hands. Follow up with a blow dryer to hold it in place. [9] X Research source Check in a mirror to make your hair line up in the center of your head. That way, your hair will look perfectly symmetrical on each side."

Keep shaping your mohawk so it has a consistent line running from the front to the back of your head. [10] X Research source"

Make sure the dryer is on a warm setting and heat the hair spray so it stiffens up. Work from the base of your hair up toward the ends to solidify the spike. Try letting go of your hair once you’ve finished drying it. [15] X Research source Be sure to dry both sides of your mohawk so it doesn’t fall down."
