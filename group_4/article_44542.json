      "content": "Look for small red dots, flea dirt, and flea eggs on your dog’s skin. One of the most conspicuous signs of fleas are what they leave on your dog. Take a close look at your dog’s skin to see if they have any small, red, raised bite marks. Additionally, fleas often leave behind “flea dirt,” which will look like small, dark grains of sand, as well as small white eggs that resemble tiny grains of rice. [1] X Research source If your dog has an allergic reaction to the bite, the red area may be larger. If your dog has dark fur, run a flea comb once through its fur to check for signs of fleas. Then, tap the comb on a white paper towel to see if any flea dirt or eggs fall off."

      "content": "Use a flea shampoo to kill fleas. Flea shampoo is a fast-acting way to kill fleas on your dog. It’s a first line of defense, though, and will only last for about a week, so take your dog to the vet for a more permanent oral medication as well. Read over the packaging to make sure you apply the correct amount to the correct areas on your dog. Repeat the bath as recommended by the packaging or your vet.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Too much topical flea treatment can be irritating and potentially dangerous for your dog. Be careful about using the right amount for your dog’s size and age. Use your flea comb to brush out your dog after they dry to help remove any residual flea eggs. Applying the flea shampoo correctly should leave very little residue on your dog’s fur, but still be sure to rinse well afterwards."

      "content": "Apply a flea and tick prevention medication to your dog’s fur. The same medication that you use to keep fleas and ticks off your dog can be used to help kill a flea infestation. This treatment is more gradual, so it is most effective when combined with a fast-acting treatment such as a flea shampoo. [7] X Research source Topical treatments such as Advantage and flea collars can both help manage a flea infestation. Flea collars only target adult fleas. You’ll still need to treat your dog with a medication that targets the eggs and fleas in developmental stages, in case any were left over after the bath."

Vacuum in the areas where your pet regularly rests, and use flea spray or flea traps around your home. This is especially important if your dog has had a previous flea infestation. The right solution for your home will depend on your particular environment. If your dog has suffered from repeated flea infestations, opting for something like a flea bomb can help you get rid of a lot of pests quickly. Flea traps work well as a safety measure in homes where infestations are already controlled."

      "content": "Isolate any infested pets. Keep fleas from spreading from pet to pet by keeping any infested pets secure in their own space. This could include keeping a dog with a minor infestation in a room with a closed door to make sure no other pets can enter. If you have a more significant infestation around your house, you may want to take non-impacted pets to a stay with a friend or at a boarding facility until the fleas clear up. [12] X Research source Isolation should not seem like a punishment. Make sure your dog has access to plenty of food and fresh water, as well as comfort items like blankets, beds, and toys. Spend ample time with them every day. The point is to keep the fleas from spreading, not to ignore them or make them feel bad. Always wash your hands and change your clothes after you have interacted with a flea infested pet before you allow any other animals to come in contact with you."
