      "content": "Start by standing upright in a shoulder-width stance (meaning your feet are aligned with your shoulders) and your upper arms by your sides. For this exercise, you’ll need two dumbbells; hold them in each hand so they’re directly underneath your shoulders. Then, do the following: [1] X Research source 1. Inhale deeply and curl the dumbbells up toward your shoulders, holding them with a supinated grip so your palms face up. 2. Raise the dumbbells until they’re shoulder-level and can’t be raised further. 3. Exhale, rotate your forearms to a pronated position (so your forearms and palms are facing down) and slowly lower the dumbbells back into the starting position. 4. Repeat this exercise as many times as desired. If you need a starting number, try 8 to 10 reps!"

      "content": "Use weights you can control for the entire exercise. It’s recommended you use weights 10 to 15 pounds less than you’d usually use for a curl because this exercise mainly works your forearms (rather than your entire upper body). You need to be able to keep control of the dumbbells the entire time you lift and lower them—so pick dumbbells that are slightly lighter than you’re used to. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go through each step of the exercise slowly.",
      "content": "Go through each step of the exercise slowly. Try not to rush through any movements; moving too fast can cause you to miss out on some of the exercise’s benefits. Lift slowly, squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement, rotate your forearms slowly, and lower them. Counting to 3 may help as you raise and lower your forearms! [3] X Research source Lowering your forearms slowly can improve the tension as well as your mind-muscle connection. If you’re having trouble controlling your forearms as you lower the dumbbells, don’t just let them drop. Instead, switch them out for lighter weights that you can control. Rotating your forearms too fast can also cause problems for your wrists or elbows (another reason to do this exercise slowly)."

      "title": "Hold your elbows on either side of your body.",
      "content": "Hold your elbows on either side of your body. Avoid letting them swing behind you as you do your Zottman curls. If you swing your elbows, the momentum will shift your shoulders forward and put more pressure on them (while taking focus away from your biceps). You won’t get as much of a workout—so focus on keeping still, with your forearms being the only parts moving. Lift with your arms, not your legs or back! [4] X Research source Additionally, don’t let the dumbbells touch your body while doing each curl."

      "content": "Keep your elbows bent slightly at the bottom of the movement. Don’t straighten them out entirely when lowering your forearms; the Zottman curl is designed to strengthen your biceps, and letting your forearms hang straight down removes all the tension from the exercise. You’ll maintain the tension through your biceps with your elbows slightly bent."

      "title": "The Zottman curl can target more than just your biceps.",
      "content": "The Zottman curl can target more than just your biceps. Unlike other strength exercises that work your biceps, the Zottman curl also includes forearm training (which can sometimes be overlooked in workouts). The lowering part of the exercise, in particular (where you bring the dumbbells from shoulder height back to your sides), is great for giving your forearms a workout. [5] X Research source The Zottman curl is also a good example of an isolation exercise—an exercise targeting a single muscle group, often done by moving a single joint. In other words, Zottman curls help you pay special attention to your biceps and forearms while also helping you develop a stronger grip."

      "title": "The Zottman curl works your biceps and forearms.",
      "content": "The Zottman curl works your biceps and forearms. As mentioned above, the Zottman curl focuses explicitly on building strength in your biceps and forearms. It particularly strengthens your brachioradialis muscle. That’s the large muscle in your forearm that flexes your forearm at the elbow and assists with turning your forearm palms up or palms down.

      "content": "Dumbbell curl This is actually the exercise that the Zottman curl is based on—so the Zottman curl is technically the variant! Nonetheless, here’s how to do a dumbbell curl: [7] X Research source 1. Stand upright with a dumbbell in each hand and your palms facing inward. 2. Raise the dumbbells up toward your shoulders with your forearms, keeping your upper arms by your sides. 3. When your arms are fully flexed and can’t raise the dumbbells further, lower them back down and into the starting position."

      "content": "Zottman preacher curl This exercise combines the Zottman and preacher curl exercises; thus, it requires dumbbells and a preacher curl bench. To do the Zottman preacher curl: [8] X Research source 1. Sit while pressing your elbows into the preacher bench pad, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an underhanded grip. 2. Curl the dumbbells up toward your shoulders, bending your arms while keeping your elbows on the pad. 3. Lift the dumbbells until they’re level with your shoulders, then rotate your arms so they’re now facing away from you. 4. Lower your arms until they’re fully extended, then rotate them back into the starting position."

Stand upright, holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. 2. Raise the dumbbells with your forearms, keeping your upper arms by your sides. 3. Keep lifting the dumbbells until they can’t be raised further. Then, slowly lower them back to the starting position."

Stand upright, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing inward (toward your body) and the outsides of your hands facing outward. 2. Raise the dumbbells with your forearms, keeping your upper arms by your sides. 3. When you can’t raise the dumbbells further, slowly lower them back to the starting position."
