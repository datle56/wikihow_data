      "title": "Find out why they hate you through a friend.",
      "content": "Find out why they hate you through a friend. Seek out a mutual friend to better understand why your crush might hate you. Sometimes your crush doesn't hate you at all, and your perception is wrong. You could ask a friend by saying, “I'd really like to get to know John better, but I think he hates me. Do you know if there's any truth to that?”"

      "title": "Address any misunderstandings.",
      "content": "Address any misunderstandings. Your crush might hate you because of a misunderstanding. Clearing this up can bring you two closer together. Let's say you found out from your friend that your crush saw you in their open locker, and this is the reason they hate you. You could approach your crush and try to clear things up. [1] X Research source For example, you could say, “Hey, I think you may dislike me because you believe I stole something out of your locker. I wanted to let you know that the reason I was in your locker at all was because the school administrator thought no one was using it. She opened it for me with a master key. It was purely an accident.” You could say, “I totally understand why you might think that was a strange thing to see. If I were you I'd probably think so too.”"

That was not right and I won't do it again\". Another apology could go, “I'm sorry I participated in that mean prank we pulled on you. I really regret doing it. I promise I won't do it again\"."
