[7] X Research source https//www.mindbodygreen.com/0-10237/how-to-say-no-to-a-second-date-and-still-make-everyone-feel-great.html Avoid saying things like \"maybe\" or \"I don't think so\" or anything that suggests you might change your mind or could be persuaded to go out with them again. Remember the compliment sandwich: Start with a positive, tell them you're not interested, then end on a positive note. Something like: \"You're a great person, but I don't feel a romantic connection with you. I know you'll be really happy with the right person.\""

      "content": "Avoid lying or passive rejection. While it may seem easier and maybe even kinder in the moment to fib about why you don't want to go on a second date, making something up has the potential to seriously backfire. You may also be tempted to ghost the person — never contact them again and stop responding to their texts and calls, but this is unfair and can be more hurtful than just telling the person you're not interested. Saying \"no\" should be enough without having to make up an excuse. Don't say \"yes\" and then pretend you're busy whenever the person calls you, or promise yo call and follow up and then ignore them. If you make up an excuse, it's very possible you might get caught in your lie. Pretending to be sick, that you're getting serious with someone else, that you have to work, etc. — all of these excuses may seem appealing, but the other person could easily find out that you are lying, especially if you have mutual friends."

      "content": "Try to tell them in person or over the phone. Email and texting are convenient and might make it a little easier to turn someone down since they are not right there in front of you, but it's also very difficult to convey your tone. It can be very easy for the other person to misinterpret what you are saying if they can't hear your voice or see your face and body language. If the question comes up at the end of the fist date, this is a good time to tell them in person. Or if they ask you face-to-face for a second date. You don't necessarily have to set up a special time to meet up just to tell them \"no.\" If the person texts or emails you about a second date, you might write back, \"Can I call you?\" and let them down over the phone."

      "content": "Be assertive . If you're worried you can't say \"no\" to a second date, you may need to do some work on being more assertive. This doesn't mean being aggressive or nasty — it means you can comfortably state your opinion and how you feel while being respectful of the other person. Remember that it's okay to say \"no\" — it's your right to turn someone down and you don't need to apologize or even explain yourself. This can be very difficult for some people to do, because they worry this means they are not nice or they are afraid of confrontation. Working on becoming more assertive can help you see that it's okay to say \"No thanks.\" Remember that being assertive is a skill and that you can develop it with practice. Try developing a mantra to combat guilt. If you find yourself thinking \"I'm a jerk because this person really likes me and I'm going to hurt their feelings,\" say instead, \"I deserve to go out with someone I like, and they deserve to go out with someone who likes them. I'm not going to waste their time and lead them on.\""

Of course, you can't completely control your body language, but make sure you aren't smirking and try to look the person in the eye as you tell them.

You may need to say it more loudly, block their number if they're trying to call, or block them on social media if they keep trying to contact you. Remember that your safety is the most important thing, and if someone is making you feel threatened, it's more important to protect yourself than try to be polite or tactful. You could say \"I may not have made this clear in my last message, but I am not interested in a second date. Don't contact me again.\" If you find that someone is making you feel unsafe, talk to security or call the police. If someone is coming by your house when you've asked them not to, definitely call the police. Reader Poll: We asked 1296 wikiHow readers, and 62% agreed that if a person reacts negatively to your rejection of them, it’s 100% okay to be firm in your decision and move on from the situation.
