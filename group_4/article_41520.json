      "content": "Keep batteries in the original packaging if possible. Storing batteries sealed in their packaging ensures that they remain protected from environmental factors such as humidity. It also ensures that you do not confuse new, fully charged batteries with older ones, and it prevents the terminals from coming into contact with other metals. If you don't have the original packaging, keep your batteries in a plastic container.

      "content": "Separate batteries by make and age. Batteries of different types or from different manufacturers can react with each other, causing leakage or other damage. If you are storing disposable (non-rechargeable) batteries, avoid storing new and used batteries together. [2] X Research source Separate containers are ideal. If you plan to use one container, place each type of battery in its own plastic bag."

      "content": "Check the charge levels on rechargeable batteries. Many rechargeable batteries will permanently damage themselves if kept in a discharged state. The ideal level of charge depends on the technology: Lead Acid Store at full charge to avoid sulfation, which lowers capacity. Lithium Ion (Li-ion) For best results, store at 30–50% maximum charge. If you will be unable to recharge within a few months, store at full charge instead. [3] X Research source Nickel-based (NiMH, NiZn, NiCd) Can be stored at any state of charge."

      "content": "Store your batteries at room temperature or below. In most cases, any cool room away from direct sun is fine—just avoid storing your batteries in high temperatures. [4] X Expert Source Ricardo Mitchell Electrician & Construction Professional, CN Coterie Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Even at relatively warm temperatures of 77ºF (25ºC), a typical battery only loses a few percent of its charge capacity each year. Storing batteries in the refrigerator (or anywhere between 34–60ºF / 1–15ºC) causes minor improvements in this area, but is not necessary unless you have no good alternative or maximum performance is vital. For most consumers, the refrigerator is not worth the risk of water damage and the inconvenience of waiting for batteries to warm up before use. Do not put a battery in a freezer unless the manufacturer recommends it. Traditional nickel-based batteries lose their charge quickly even at low temperatures. They recharge faster at cool temperatures, but not below 50ºF (10°C) for consumer-grade chargers. More recent LSD (Low Self-Discharge) NiMH batteries are designed to maintain their charge at room temperature."

Alkaline batteries can be safely stored in moderately humid conditions (35 to 65% relative humidity). [5] X Research source Most other batteries prefer drier environments.

      "title": "Prevent electrical conduction.",
      "content": "Prevent electrical conduction. Your batteries may start conducting electricity if they come into contact with metal. This will drain your batteries quickly, and create heat. Take steps to prevent this problem and reduce fire risk: [8] X Research source Do not store batteries in a metal container. Use a sealed plastic container or a specialized battery storage box. Do not store coins or other metal objects in the same container. Align batteries so the positive terminals cannot contact the negative terminals of other batteries. Cover the terminals with masking tape or plastic caps if you cannot guarantee this."

      "title": "Recharge lead acid and lithium-ion batteries periodically.",
      "content": "Recharge lead acid and lithium-ion batteries periodically. Storing a lead-acid battery at a very low charge state can cause permanent crystal formation (sulfation) that reduces capacity. Lithium-ion batteries at low charge can develop copper structures that short the battery, making it dangerous to use. [9] X Research source The exact recharge instructions depend on the battery design. Follow these guidelines if you do not have access to manufacturer instructions: Lead Acid Recharge to full whenever voltage drops below 2.07 volts / cell (12.42V for a 12V battery). Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Recharge to 30–50% capacity whenever voltage drops below 2.5 V/cell. Do not recharge if voltage drops to 1.5V/cell. One charge every few months is typical."

      "content": "Restore discharged batteries. If your rechargeable batteries drop to low charge levels for more than a few days, they will likely require special treatment before you can use them again: Lead Acid The battery will usually recharge, but with permanently reduced capacity. If a small lead acid battery fails to recharge, apply a very low amount of current at a high voltage (~5V) for two hours. Anti-sulfation devices are not recommended without an experienced operator. Lithium Ion (Li-ion) The battery may enter \"sleep mode\" and fail to recharge. Use a charger with a \"boost\" feature, taking care to apply the voltage with the correct polarity. Never boost a battery that falls below 1.5V/cell for a week or more, as it is permanently damaged and dangerous to use. Nickel-based (NiMH, NiZn, NiCd) No major issues. Some types may require charging and fully discharging a couple times to return to full capacity. For large scale use, consider a battery analyzer that can \"recondition\" the battery.
