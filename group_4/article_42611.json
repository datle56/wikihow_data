      "content": "Takuaches are young Mexican-Americanmen into modifying pickup trucks. Takuaches are primarily in their 20s and 30s and their social lives revolve primarily around modifying and customizing pickup trucks. Takuaches are active participants in the trokiando (Spanglish for \"trucking\") subculture, the Texas truck equivalent of Southern California's Chicano lowrider subculture. [1] X Research source The word takuache itself is derived from tlacuache , which is the Spanish word for the animal known in English as an opossum or simply possum. For the most part, the term takuache is a neutral label used to describe the aesthetic and subculture, as well as the people who take part in it. Folks who aren't fans of the takuache subculture might use the word in more of a negative light, such as to imply that the person is low-class, criminal, or rowdy. It's important to remember that many different people are drawn to a particular aesthetic for many different reasons. While they may have a lot in common on the surface, they aren't all the same."

      "content": "Chevy Silverados are the most common takuache trucks. Pickup trucks from US manufacturers are the default. Chevy Silverados tend to require less of an investment and are easier to modify, making them a popular choice. Takuaches also drive GMC Sierras and Ford F-150s. As long as it looks slick and can burn rubber, it'll fit in with the scene. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Takuache trucks are dropped and lifted. Known as mamalonas , the takuache trucks are the centerpiece of all that is takuache and trokiando culture. The truck itself is lifted to make room for massive wheels, then the body is dropped for a low-slung profile. The stance of takuache trucks calls back to the lowriders that were first associated with Mexican-American car culture, particularly in California and the Southwest. [3] X Research source Like lowriders, some takuache trucks are equipped with hydraulic systems that allow them to bounce and hop."

      "content": "Takuache trucks feature smooth detailing and bright, bold paint jobs. For takuaches, trokiando is very much a DIY effort and the clean, sharp detailing showcases their pride. Takuache trucks are painted to stand out and often feature custom paint as well. For some the paint color is a signature while others repaint their trucks more frequently. A lot of design trends overlap with trends in car culture generally. Takuaches also borrow freely from popular local styles, such as slab (slow, loud, and banging) culture in Houston.

      "content": "Takuache trucks advertise brands and groups the owner is affiliated with. Takuache trucks are made to be seen—not necessarily seen out of. The windows are often covered in stickers and decals that can tell you a lot about the love and dedication that went into creating each truck. [5] X Research source Modified trucks can be expensive endeavors, and some of the best get sponsorship opportunities from parts manufacturers and other truck-adjacent brands. Scripting stickers on the front and rear windows can be used to list any shows or awards the truck has won. If the owner is a member of a crew, they'll typically have decals or emblems to represent their crew on their truck as well."

      "content": "Most takuaches do their own work on their trucks. Doing all of your work yourself is a hallmark of any car enthusiast subculture. Trucks are typically bought used, then worked on and modified in a garage or driveway. Many takuaches are so passionate about trucks that they become professional mechanics. [6] X Research source At truck meets, takuaches often exchange tips with each other and troubleshoot issues they've been having. Crews often get together to work on their trucks while they talk, eat, and drink."

      "content": "Bootcut jeans A takuache typically wears cowboy boots, which makes bootcut jeans a necessity. But not just any bootcut jeans—a takuache is looking for sharp, bold jeans, preferably by a Mexican designer brand. Some standout embroidery or even rhinestones on the pockets doesn't hurt either."

      "content": "Square-toed cowboy boots The boot of choice for a rancher as well as a takuache, who embodies a sort of urbanized ranchero style. A takuache's boots are typically well-made and expensive—they can be nearly as much a point of pride as the truck. While boots are a signature piece of takuache style, some takuaches wear trendy sneakers, especially in more urban areas, such as Houston."

Some truck meets create belt buckles as prizes for winners of various competitions. For some takuaches the belt buckle is merely an accessory while for others it's a symbol of success."

The Edgar haircut itself is broadly popular among young Mexican-American men, particularly in Texas and the Southwest. [8] X Research source Because the Edgar has such broad popularity, there's a lot of overlap of different subcultures. Just because a guy has an Edgar haircut doesn't mean he's a takuache—he might not even own a truck!"

Mexican music has always had a strong influence on both sides of the US-Mexican border and takuache culture embraces Mexican heritage. Takuache trucks blast Sinaloan banda and norteño music, even though many takuaches only speak limited Spanish. Takuaches favor music from northern regions in Mexico, close to the US border. [11] X Research source Corridos, which tell stories through song, are particularly popular with takuaches. [12] X Research source Popular music artists with takuaches include Grupo Firme, Eslabón Armado, and Natanael Cano. [13] X Research source"

At the same time, many of them have never been to Mexico and don't speak much Spanish. Takuaches take what they like about all of their influences to create a look and lifestyle entirely their own. [14] X Research source Takuache culture is somewhat adjacent to cholo culture. While cholo is often used as a blanket term for an urban working-class Mexican-American, it does have negative connotations. Many people associate cholos with street gangs, drugs, and violent crime.

      "content": "Takuache slang incorporates Spanish elements but isn't itself Spanish. Many words and phrases popular with takuaches come from Mexican-American culture in the Southwestern states along the border with Mexico. While many of these words and phrases are derived from Spanish words, they may also be combined with English words or simply made up. Here are some examples: [16] X Research source Cuh : shortened form of the English word \"cousin,\" used similarly to the English slang word \"bro\" No quema cuh : literally \"can't burn, cousin,\" this is a sort of taunting phrase used to say that your truck can't do a burnout Si quema cuh: the response to \"no quema cuh,\" when you want to say \"it can burn, cousin\" (usually just before you prove it) Toxico/a: just the word \"toxic,\" made to sound Spanish and used to describe both people and the things they do Puro V8: puro is the same in Spanish as \"pure\" in English, but in slang it means something closer to \"really\" or \"very.\" Typically, this is a reaction to the sound of a truck revving. Takuachita: a female takuache, usually the girlfriend of a takuache (although she might also have her own truck) Clika: Spanglish version of the English word \"clique,\" used to refer to a takuache's friend group (or his trokiando crew)"

The memes help familiarize people with the takuache aesthetic and lifestyle as well as some good natured ribbing related to takuache and Mexican-American stereotypes. For example, there are \"takuache starter pack\" memes that include the truck, bootcut jeans, cowboy boots, and a snapback hat. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Takuache culture revolves around truck meets. Because takuache trucks are so heavily modified, they're not really meant to be daily drivers—they're made for showing off at truck meets and doing burnouts—spinning the wheels to leave marks on the road—or donuts. When you're not behind the wheel, you can chat about the latest mods you've done or the ones you've got lined up in the future. Truck meets often take place in the parking lot of a neighborhood big box store. They can start in the afternoon on a Saturday or Sunday and last well into the evening. Truck meets are often family affairs, although they can get a little rowdier after the sun goes down and the drinking picks up. Takuaches often form crews of 5-8 guys with their trucks. The crews pool resources, work on their trucks together, and go to meets together. They often have separate social media accounts for the crew. [18] X Research source"
