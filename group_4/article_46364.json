      "content": "Sweet oil can also improve your skin tone and clear up acne. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Sweet oil can be used as a substitute for a myriad of skin and beauty products, reducing the number of containers you have on your counter. Instead of using a store-bought makeup remover, add a few drops of sweet oil to a cotton ball and gently wipe away your makeup. [3] X Research source Most makeup products are oil-based, which is why they can be hard to remove with gentle cleansers or soap and water. Luckily, oils can dissolve other oils, which is why sweet oil works so well to take off makeup. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a hot oil treatment to your weekly routine for soft and shiny hair. Carefully warm up about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sweet oil in a small microwave-safe bowl for 15-30 seconds. Let it cool down so it’s warm to the touch but not super hot, then gently comb it through damp hair. Clip your hair up out of the way and let the sweet oil work its magic for about 15 minutes before shampooing and conditioning your hair as usual. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "The oil and sugar help remove and soften dead skin. In a small bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons (25 grams) of sugar and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sweet oil. Gently rub the exfoliator over your skin, focusing on areas that are especially dry or rough. When you’re done, rinse the scrub away with warm water. [8] X Research source If you want to make a bigger batch of scrub to keep in your bathroom, simply use a 2:1 sugar to oil ratio. Store the scrub in an airtight container and mix it before each use. Be careful using this exfoliator on your face! It can be more abrasive because the sugar doesn’t dissolve in the oil at all. If your skin is uber-sensitive, you may want to use it primarily for your body and skip your face. Blend sweet oil with coconut oil or almond oil to help make it more moisturizing for your skin."

      "content": "Sweet oil moisturizes your skin and gives you a smoother shave. For your face or smaller areas, like your bikini line, just 2-3 drops should be enough. For your legs, you may need to reapply or add more oil as you go to make sure you don’t shave dry skin, which could cause irritation. The sweet oil ends up costing less than shaving cream because of how long it lasts. [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source This helps keep your nails looking nice and also prevents them from getting dry and cracking."

If you’re looking for relief, you may want to talk to your dermatologist about getting a prescription for hyaluronic acid or tretinoin.
