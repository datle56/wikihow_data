Show a Scorpio that you know how to stimulate him intellectually, and you'll score major points. Ask him thoughtful questions about psychology, academics, or art. Then, wait for his clever, well-structured response to arrive. [1] X Research source \"What do you think is the key to happiness?

      "content": "\"You know, that reminds me of my favorite Aristotle quote... 🤔 \" Scorpio is a clever sign, so a text that shows off your intelligence will impress him. Throw in a couple of references to philosophers or psychologists, and you’ll have him completely hooked on you. [3] X Research source If your Scorpio crush mentions having a difficult exam, send an ironic joke: \"Hmmm...It's almost like a professor's JOB is to challenge you to learn. 😘\" If he mentions something intellectual, send a text back that proves you know what he's talking about (between us, you can totally do a quick Google search!)."

      "title": "\"Honestly, I've been feeling a little sad today...",
      "content": "\"Honestly, I've been feeling a little sad today... 😥 \" Scorpios are emotionally intuitive, so he'll love receiving a text that proves you're the same way. He seeks emotional intensity in his relationships, so if he’s worried that you’re not comfortable with your own profound, deep feelings, he’ll lose interest. In additions astrologer Angel Eyedealism shares, Scorpio can be a little \"paranoid because [he] senses and sees too much in people.\" So identifying your feelings can help relax this part of him by demonstrating that you're in tune with yourself and trustworthy. Find opportunities to share your feelings over text, and he’ll be thrilled. When you can, describe complex emotions in detail. Identify a feeling that you're experiencing and share that: \"I don't know. I guess I've been feeling sort of unmotivated today.\" Reflect on why you may be feeling that way and explain: \"It may sound silly, but I think the weather really affects my mood. It could be the rain.\" Finally, try to tie the feeling to a pattern in your behavior: \"It's hard for me to have a good day when I'm feeling sluggish. Working makes me feel fulfilled, so when I'm struggling at work, I don't feel as happy.\""

      "title": "\"So, how have you been feeling lately?",
      "content": "\"So, how have you been feeling lately? 😌 \" Scorpio is a water sign, so he'll appreciate a text that shows off your emotional sensitivity. To impress a Scorpio, gently question him about his emotional wellbeing. If you sense a shift in his mood, mention it. Show him that you're emotionally intuitive and comfortable holding emotional conversations, and he'll find that totally crushworthy. Check in on how he's feeling: \"Hey, Tyler. Just wanted to ask—are you doing okay?\" Mention the change you noticed: \"I feel like you were a little bit less chatty this morning.\" Offer him help and an empathetic ear if he wants it: \"I don't mean to pry. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here for you if you need it. 🤗\""

      "title": "\"I'm going to leave you in suspense for now...",
      "content": "\"I'm going to leave you in suspense for now... 😏 \" He’s intuitive, observant, and super curious about the people around him, so an elusive, ambiguous message like this will be attractive to him. To a Scorpio, discovering what makes you tick is an absolute thrill. When you're still getting to know each other, send vague, mysterious messages and shift the convo's focus away from you and onto him. [4] X Research source Strategically deflect his questions: \"Hmmm...I'm not positive that I want to answer that just yet. I'm getting sleepy. Talk tomorrow? 🥱\" Offer vague answers to his specific questions: \"What was my childhood like? Oh, I don't know. Pretty average I suppose 😌\" Turn the conversation's focus back onto him: \"I'll answer that question after you answer three of mine. Deal? 😝\""

      "content": "\"I haven't told anyone else this yet, but I guess I'll tell you... 🤫 \" By sharing a secret with him, you'll show that you have depth—which an intense, enigmatic Scorpio will love. Your go-to should still be to keep an air of mystery. But to keep him hooked, offer him occasional glimpses of what lies beneath the surface with you. Share an exciting, confidential fact about yourself but refrain from offering lots of detail. [5] X Research source Explain that your secret is for his ears only. Scorpios love feeling like they're special to their crush: \"You can't tell anyone this, okay? I don't like talking about it, but...\" Tell him your secret but don't offer specifics: \"I haven't returned to my hometown in ten years. It's sort of a long story though... 😔😔\" When he asks follow-up questions, tell him he'll have to wait: \"That's all I want to share for now. Maybe down the line I'll tell you more...\""

      "content": "\"I'm not sure if I can hang out Friday, I'll have to check my schedule... \" Scorpios love being in control, so texts that force him to chase you will be super appealing to him. Tease him and then reel back your interest. When you two are still getting to know each other, ensure that he's always texting you first. Be difficult to pin down and every once in a while, take a long time to respond. He finds mind games totally thrilling, so he'll love it if you're willing to play along with him. When he invites you to hang out, don't give a solid answer right away: \"Hmm...maybe. Can I let you know the day of? 😚\" Every few messages, make him wait before you respond. You don't want him to lose interest completely, though. Go for around 3x your normal response time. Wait for him to text you.
