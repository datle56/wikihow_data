Your dog may have a medical condition like arthritis, elbow or hip dysplasia, disc disease, or muscular weakness that can make it difficult for him to handle the extreme angles of climbing stairs. If you suspect your dog is in pain or has medical reason to fear stairs, you may want to talk with the vet before you begin retraining."

      "content": "Physically support your dog. Your dog may fear using the stairs if he's fallen down them in the past. To help him, consider making a sling out of a towel to provide physical support. It can also make him feel safer, since you can catch him if he slips. This is especially helpful if your dog fell because of issues with arthritis or another condition. To make the sling, simply fold a towel length-wise and slide it under your dog's belly. Hold the two towel ends together at the top. This will gently support your dog to help him up and down the stairs. [3] X Research source Another option is to take a sturdy, reusable shopping bag and cut it down the sides so that it lays flat, with a handle on each end. Slip this under your dog's belly and hold onto the handles to support him. [4] X Research source Practice using the sling on non-slippery steps and a small staircase."

[5] X Research source Fortunately, if he wasn't, your adult dog can be introduced to the stairs in the same way as a puppy. Look at your dog's size and decide on an appropriate start. For example, if you have a large breed dog, take him over to a regular house stair. If you have a miniature or toy dog, stack up two or three books to make shallow steps.

Have your dog practice going up and down the first step over several training sessions. Eventually, your dog should go up and down the first step confidently. At that point, start working on the second step. If your dog is hesitant to go back down, you might want to make the drop from the step to the ground shallower. For example, set several books on the ground and place the treat on top of them."
