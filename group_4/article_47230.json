      "title": "Walkaway wife syndrome is when a wife leaves her husband suddenly.",
      "content": "Walkaway wife syndrome is when a wife leaves her husband suddenly. It typically leads to a lot of questions: why was she unhappy? Why didn’t she try to work things out? What was her breaking point? Walkaway wife syndrome is slightly more specific than divorce, because there’s no buildup to it. Oftentimes, husbands and family members are left feeling confused and upset. [2] X Research source While the divorce typically seems sudden from the outside, it’s usually not as sudden for the wife herself. That’s why there are actually some signs you can watch for that will let you know if your wife is unhappy enough to leave you. Walkaway wife syndrome is also called “neglected wife syndrome” or “sudden divorce syndrome.” Despite its name, walkaway wife syndrome is not an actual syndrome or diagnosis."

      "title": "She stays silent around you.",
      "content": "She stays silent around you. When you walk into a room, you might notice that your wife clams up or doesn’t ask you any questions. Instead of making jokes or laughing with each other, you pass each other by like irritated roommates. This shows a lack of emotional connection in the relationship, which could indicate that your wife is getting ready to leave. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "She stops bringing up issues.",
      "content": "She stops bringing up issues. It might sound like a good thing, but when your wife no longer complains, it could mean she’s giving up on the marriage. If someone no longer brings up issues and instead just accepts them, it shows that they are too tired or burnt out to put effort into the relationship anymore. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "She doesn’t want to have sex with you anymore.",
      "content": "She doesn’t want to have sex with you anymore. It’s normal for your sex life to ebb and flow during a marriage. But if your wife used to be all over you and now she rejects you all the time, it could be a sign that she’s planning on leaving soon. [5] X Research source A lack of sex often indicates larger problems within the marriage. It’s possible that your wife doesn’t feel comfortable having sex with you because of your marital issues that haven’t been addressed. Reader Poll: We asked 2177 wikiHow readers, and 76% of them agreed that the biggest sign their wife isn't attracted to them is if she's not interested in physical intimacy or sex . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "She seems less excited about sex and intimacy.",
      "content": "She seems less excited about sex and intimacy. Maybe your wife agrees to have sex, but she just doesn’t seem that into it. Or, you take her out on a date, but she looks like she’d rather be anywhere else the entire time. She may be going through the motions to avoid a fight or just so you won’t ask her any questions.

      "title": "She doesn’t do nice things for you anymore.",
      "content": "She doesn’t do nice things for you anymore. In a marriage, it’s normal for partners to do sweet things for each other: buy each other coffee, take each other out to dinner, or send each other thoughtful texts. If that has stopped completely, your wife may be feeling burnt out or exhausted, unable to reciprocate any affection. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "She becomes withdrawn or distant. Maybe she doesn’t seem interested in you or your marriage anymore. She might sit far away from you on the couch, avoid you when you try to kiss her, or insist that “she’s fine” when you can tell she’s not. She could be focused more on the process of leaving you than she is on making the marriage work. [8] X Research source"

Or, she might spend more time on her own doing fun things that she likes without you. Not including you in her plans could mean that she’s preparing for the near future when you two are no longer together. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "She doesn’t want to work on the marriage. Perhaps you bring up issues and she doesn’t seem to care. Or you suggest going to couple’s counseling and she says no. If she’s no longer willing to work on the marriage, then unfortunately, she may already have one foot out the door. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "She seems tense around you. Sometimes you can’t quite put your finger on what’s wrong. Maybe you walk into a room and the air feels heavy or you can sense your wife stiffen at the sound of your voice. If your wife just seems off and she won’t share why, she may be planning to leave.

Maybe she pays careful attention to her hair and makeup, whereas before she was fine running errands without doing much at all. Or, maybe she’s spending lots of time at the gym or purchasing new clothes. These could indicate that she’s getting ready for her new life without you."

      "content": "Give your wife some space. While your first instinct might be to spend more time with your wife, that could push her away even further. Instead, if you notice your wife pulling away, communicate with her and give her the alone time that she needs. Not only will this show that you’re respectful of her boundaries, but it will give her some much-needed time to think about your relationship. [12] X Research source Give her space, but don’t give her the silent treatment. Let her know that you’re here and ready to talk whenever she is. “I can tell you need some space, and that’s fine.

Let your wife know that you understand she needs more communication from you, and offer up solutions as to how you can fix the problem. [13] X Research source “I know I’ve been closed off lately, and that’s probably been frustrating for you. I tend to shut down when I’m stressed, but I promise to work on being more open and forthcoming.” “I haven’t been listening to you like I should, and I’m sorry for that.

If you’ve neglected her emotionally or taken advantage of her, apologize sincerely to her.

I know how hard it’s been for you, and I want to apologize for ignoring your needs in favor of my own.” “You do so much for this family, and I don’t appreciate it enough.

[16] X Research source If you’re the wife in this situation who’s considering divorce, take your husband up on his offer to go to counseling. Even if you do ultimately decide to leave the marriage, it’s a good sign that your husband is putting in the effort now."
