If you don't have your contact lens case (or worse, have neither a case nor solution) with you and you need to take out your contacts, the best thing you can do is throw away your contact lenses. While there are temporary alternatives you can try, they will not keep your lenses as clean as they should be, and could lead to infection. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Keep a pair of eyeglasses with you just in case you need to take out your contacts and don't have a case or solution with you. Eyeglasses also come in handy if your contacts are irritating you and you need to take them out, but still need to see properly."

      "content": "Wash and dry two drinking glasses. Before you put your contacts into anything, including a contact lens case, the surface should be clean. This doesn't require any special cleaners or chemicals, you can simply wash them thoroughly with warm soapy water. [3] X Research source Smaller glasses are generally better than larger glasses because you'll have to be able to reach down inside them to get your lenses out. If you have access to a pair of shot glasses, those might be the best to use. You could also try short juice glasses. Pat the surface dry inside and out with a paper towel. Don't allow any water to get in contact with your contacts. Label the glasses \"L\" and \"R\" so you'll know which lens is which. You can write the letters on a piece of tape you stick to the glasses or write them on whatever you plan to use to cover them with. Just make sure the letters are large enough that you can read them without your contacts in."

      "content": "Put contact lens solution in the disinfected glasses. The contact lens solution recommended by your eye care professional is the best thing to soak your contacts in. If you happen to be without that as well, a basic saline solution, such as lens rewetting drops, will work. However, a basic saline solution will not disinfect your lenses the way a contact lens solution would. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Never soak your contact lenses in water, even bottled or distilled water. It contains bacteria that can contaminate your lenses and cause eye infections. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In addition to the risk of bacterial infection, some contact lenses are made from a hydrophilic material that absorbs water. These contacts will swell if soaked in water, making it impossible for you to put them back in your eyes comfortably. Even though this is a less-than-ideal alternative, it's still better than simply sleeping in your lenses. This causes your eyes to be deprived of oxygen and makes them more vulnerable to inflammation and infection.

Placing some sort of cover over the tops of the glasses keeps the contact lens solution from evaporating as well as keeping airborne bacteria from contaminating the solution and your contacts.

Your temporary storage solution doesn't keep your contacts as clean as they need to be and they're still vulnerable to bacteria. Use a hydrogen-peroxide based contact lens cleaner to thoroughly disinfect them, then rinse them off with a saline solution to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide before putting them back in your eyes.

Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, then dry them thoroughly with a paper towel. [12] X Research source If you touch anything during the process of putting in or taking out your lenses, wash your hands again. For example, if you take out one lens and then scratch an itch on your arm, you need to wash your hands before taking out the other lens.
