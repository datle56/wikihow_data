Click on the “Dating” section to begin setting up your profile. Facebook will guide you through the next few steps, but the only information carried over from your Facebook account will be your name and age. It will ask you to fill out your own gender and the genders you are interested in (this information will not show up on your profile). After that, Facebook will ask for your location and for a photo of yourself. Once you click confirm, you’ll have a profile!"

An example ice-breaker question might be: \"What’s the best book you’ve ever read?\" Reader Poll: We asked 473 wikiHow readers who've used Facebook for dating, and only 6% of them agreed that the best profile picture is one of you hanging out with friends. [Take Poll] It’s great to let potential matches know you’re social, but for at least your first photo, stick with one of you alone so they know what you look like."

Fifteen minutes before your date happens, that person will receive a notification reminder and access to your live location, but they will only be able to see your location for a limited amount of time, compared to something like Apple’s Find My Friend feature.
