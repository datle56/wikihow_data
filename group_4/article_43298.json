      "content": "Candle an egg to look inside for embryonic development. If a you or a hen has been incubating an egg for a few days, you can candle an egg to see if it is fertile or not. Hold your egg up to a candle or strong light like an incubator light and observe what you see inside: [1] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. [2] X Research source A fertile egg will have clear signs of development such as networks of blood vessels present, an opaque shape of an embryo at the larger end of the egg, and even movement within the egg. A fertile egg with an embryo that has stopped developing will have a blood ring or blood streaks observable in the egg. Since the embryo is no longer viable, the blood vessels that once supported it have pulled away from it. An infertile egg or yolker will look fairly clear, with no blood streaks, rings, or vessels."

      "title": "Observe if your eggs float.",
      "content": "Observe if your eggs float . Floating eggs are often infertile as the volume inside of the egg is not large enough for it to sink. As embryos form, eggs become heavier. Check for floating eggs: [3] X Research source Wait until your bird eggs are a few days old and all possible embryos have developed. In practice, it is best to only move possibly fertile eggs every once in a while and never too often. Taking an egg from its incubator too early can stunt development and taking an egg too late in its development can hurt the chick inside. Get a bowl of warm water. Be sure to use warm water in case your bird egg is fertile. Carefully place the eggs in the water. Be gentle, as some eggs are very fragile. Observe if your eggs float or sink. Return your fertile eggs back to the incubator as soon as possible."

      "title": "Crack open an egg to check for fertility.",
      "content": "Crack open an egg to check for fertility. The most accurate way to see if an egg is fertile or not in its early stages is to crack the egg open. When cracked, look for the blastodisc to see if it has turned into a blastoderm. For obvious reasons, cracking open an egg means you are not planning to breed or incubate chicks. If you're are cracking eggs for consumption, infertile eggs and fertile eggs have no taste difference. [4] X Research source Fertile eggs will have a blastoderm that looks like a white bullseye or circle. The white colour of the blastoderm will be quite opaque and its edges solid and pronounced. A lighter, almost transparent, outer later will surround the denser spot. Infertile eggs will have a blastodisc that will have an irregular shape and its white colour is very faint and foggy. All eggs will have a white spot or blastodisc whether or not it is fertile."

      "title": "Separate your female birds from your male birds.",
      "content": "Separate your female birds from your male birds. In order for an egg to be fertile, a female bird must mate with a male to produce an egg with both male and female genetic material to create an embryo inside the egg. If you only own female birds, then all eggs laid by them will be infertile. [5] X Research source An unfertilized egg or an egg only containing female genetic material is called a blastodisc. In fertile eggs or eggs that contain both female and male genetic material, the blastodisc is then term a blastoderm. The blastoderm is also called the first stage of embryonic development."

      "title": "Observe eggs for 14 to 21 days.",
      "content": "Observe eggs for 14 to 21 days. The time it takes for a chick to hatch in incubation varies between different species of birds. Most lovebird eggs hatch in 2 weeks while chickens take up to 21 days to hatch. [6] X Research source If nothing happens to the egg past this period, the egg was most likely infertile or the embryo died and stopped its development. This method is not recommended for consumption if you are checking chicken eggs. If your egg has been in an incubator for 21 days or left out in room temperature for more than 7 to 10 days, the egg will have most likely gone bad or is beginning to rot."
