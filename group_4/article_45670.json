Don't tap any of the messages just yet—if you were to tap one of these unread messages, the \"seen\" status would be applied, making it obvious to the sender that you've read it.

The only way to read a message without the sender knowing is to read the message without an internet connection and then log out of your Instagram account before reconnecting. This process can be a little finicky, so it's important that you follow these steps precisely. If you skip a step, the sender will know you've seen the message!"
