This will only weed out the sales calls. [2] X Research source It can take up to 31 days for the sales calls to stop once you’ve registered. Don’t worry if the calls don’t stop the next day. Unfortunately, scammers do not care about the Do Not Call Registry, so you may still get some annoying calls from time to time. At least you know they aren’t legitimate companies calling, so stay away!"

Some scammers spoof their phone number so it appears as a different number every time. If you’re getting scam calls from the same area code over and over again, this probably won’t solve the problem."

You shouldn’t pick up a telemarketing or scam call in the first place but if you have important calls you’re waiting on, you may end up answering a telemarketing call on accident. Don’t fret, argue, or yell; just ask them to put you on their do not call list and hang up. [4] X Research source Telemarketers can be obnoxiously persistent, so the longer you’re on the line with them, the more likely they are to keep pushing your buttons. Just ask them to stop and hang up. If the telemarketer is calling from a legitimate company, this should put an end to the calls. Most companies have an internal “do not call” list, and it’s illegal in most states to keep calling you after you’ve asked them to stop.

Some carriers allow you to call *77 to turn on anonymous call blocking, but double-check first. In some areas, calling *77 will contact the police. [7] X Research source For some carriers, there’s a small charge associated with anonymous call blocking. This may be worth it for you depending on how often you’re getting calls from anonymous numbers. Some phones have an anonymous call blocking function you can turn on in the “settings” menu. This will only block numbers that pop up as “anonymous” on your caller ID. It will not block standard numbers or company calls. Luckily, you can just block those numbers manually, though."
