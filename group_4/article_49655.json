      "title": "Come up with a title for your proposal.",
      "content": "Come up with a title for your proposal. Your title will vary based on the type of research you’re doing, but in general, you’ll want it to be concise and descriptive. After reading your title, your readers should know what to expect from the proposal and be interested enough to read on. You’ll also want it to be clear and accurate enough that your proposal when come up during searches for your research topic. [1] X Research source For example, try a short, informative title like, “Medieval Plagues and the Movement Towards Humanism,” or “The Negative Impact of Alcohol on Liver Function.” Avoid phrases like “An Investigation of…” or “A Review of the…”"

      "title": "Create a title page.",
      "content": "Create a title page. A title page introduces the title of your proposal, your name, and the primary institution you are connected to. Each sponsoring agency may specify a format for the title page. If an agency does not, apply the APA style. [2] X Research source Include a \"running head\" in the upper left corner. The running head will appear on all pages of the document and should be a shortened version of the title. Include the page number in the upper right corner. The page number should appear on all pages of the proposal. Center the full title of your research proposal roughly 1/3 of the way down the page. Double space it, and immediately below the title, insert your name. Below your name, list the institution you are affiliated with and the names and affiliations of any co-investigators you’re working with. In some styles, you may include their contact information as well."

[4] X Research source For example, if your proposal is about heart diseases, you might use phrases like circulatory system, blood, heart attack, etc. Your keywords can be single words, or phrases of 2-4 words."

      "title": "Include a table of contents.",
      "content": "Include a table of contents. Longer research proposals often include a table of contents on the third page, listing each major section of your paper. Brief proposals that only span a few pages do not often need a table of contents. Leaving out a table of contents is common, but depends on the type of research you’re doing and the institution you’re submitting the proposal to. Especially long proposals may also need a list of illustrations, figures, or tables. List all major parts and divisions of the proposal."

Include a quick note about the topic being discussed and a definition of the theory from which your proposed research will be based. Write \"Statement of Problem\" before moving into a paragraph detailing the problem. When writing this part of the introduction, seek to answer the question: why does this research need to be conducted and what new issues does this research raise? Type \"Purpose of Study\" before writing this section of the introduction. Identify the goal of the study in one precise terms.

[6] X Research source If desired, you can break this section into multiple subsections. Under a header reading \"Research Question\" or \"Research Hypothesis,\" describe the relationship between variables in the research or predict the relationship between variables. This essentially identifies the research problem. Under a header reading \"Definition of Terms,\" define the central ideas that will be utilized in the proposed research. Also provide evidence supporting your competence or expertise in the field."

You’ll give credit to other researchers who have laid the groundwork, evaluate and synthesize their work, and differentiate your own research. [7] X Research source Don’t turn this section into a list or a bland summary.

Address the explanation to experts in the field rather than laymen. The set up and information in this section will depend on whether your research is qualitative and quantitative. You’ll likely have subsections like \"Research Design,\" \"Instrumentation,\" \"Data Collection and Analysis Procedures.\" You may include information about what you will do to protect the rights of human subjects, if necessary, under a section called \"Protection of Human Rights.” Other possible subsections might include “Rigor,” “Neutrality,” “Consistency,” and “Applicability.” You should also demonstrate your knowledge of alternative methods, while making the case that your approach is the most effective way to tackle your research question. Be realistic about what you hope to accomplish, clear about your focus, and explicit about everything the research relies on. The description should also include a detailed schedule of the proposed work and thorough about all groundwork and materials needed. Also include information about sample size and target populations, if applicable."
