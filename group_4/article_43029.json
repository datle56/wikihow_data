If you’re out at a school event or having a family night in the living room, be sure to carve out some time for you and your mom to have a one-on-one chat. Don’t freak yourself out! Remember, she’s your mom; she’s been in your position, too. Approach the topic any way you like. You can start by saying you feel a little uncomfortable, but you need to talk to her. Here are some starting points to help you get started!

      "content": "Bring it up casually when you’re hanging out. Opt for a casual environment if you’re intimidated by a formal sit-down conversation. You could bring it up after seeing a tampon ad on TV, or you can mention it on your way to school. Choose a time and place where neither of you feels rushed, and you can have an open and honest conversation about it. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Try to segue into the topic by asking her how old she was when she got her period if you don’t feel comfortable coming out and saying it. Work it into a conversation about something completely non-related if you need to. That will give you time to talk and relax. Then you can slip it in when you feel comfortable. For instance, ask, “Did anything interesting happen at work today?”"

      "content": "Go shopping and stop in the feminine hygiene aisle with her. If you don’t know how to bring it up, let the environment do the work for you! Steer her towards the feminine hygiene products in the grocery or drug store, and tell her you need to pick up some period supplies to make a period kit for school . This is a great time to ask her for recommendations and pain-relief tips so she picks up on what you’re really telling her. For instance, she may recommend an electric heating pad to help alleviate cramp pain. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask your mom any questions you have. Getting your period means your body is going through many changes, which can be overwhelming. Try to think of it as an opportunity for you to form a deeper bond with your mom by opening up and asking questions. You can ask her about her experience, what her cravings are, and how she manages her symptoms. If you’re comfortable bringing it up, you can also use this time to discuss sexual health, too."

      "content": "Write your mom a note. If you don’t feel confident telling your mom in person, that’s okay! Leave her a note instead. That way, she can initiate the conversation the next time you’re alone together. Leave the note somewhere private where she’ll find it, like her purse or wallet. Notes can be long and complicated or short and sweet, like: “Hey Mom, I got my period today! Maybe we can get supplies at the drugstore later? I love you.” “I got my period. Could you please bring home some pads/tampons? Thanks!”"

This is ideal if you’re stuck at school and need fresh clothes or supplies so she can come to the rescue. You could say something like: ”Hey mom, I’m in the nurse's office, and I got my period. Do you think you could come get me?” ”I’ll be home in an hour, and maybe we can talk for a few minutes because I got my period.” ”Hey, I’ll be home a little late because I have to make a stop for some tampons.” “Can we have chocolate cake for dessert? I’ve really been craving it since I got my period!”"

You can use similar phrasing as if you were writing her a more personal letter, such as saying: “Just wanted to let you know I got my period. See you at home later!” “Can we talk later? I've started my period.” “Are you going shopping soon? I got my period and need some supplies.”"

      "content": "The menstrual cycle is the monthly shedding of your uterine lining. At the start of your cycle, your body creates more estrogen, which causes the uterine lining to thicken with blood and mucous. At the same time, the ovaries release unfertilized eggs expelled by your body along with excess uterine lining, which comes out as your monthly period.

Give yourself the chance to progress the changes happening in your body. Take a bath with Epson salt to soothe your cramps, practice meditation, or watch a comfort show to relax. You can also use this time to jot down your thoughts in a journal. Try writing down key points or questions you want to address to your mom. If you aren’t ready to tell your mom, ask a school nurse, doctor, teacher, or another trusted adult for help. You want to ask someone who has gone through it before so they can offer you guidance.
