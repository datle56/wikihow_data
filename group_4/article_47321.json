You can even use shampoo in a pinch! Add the soap directly to the sink of lukewarm water. [3] X Research source Use a bar of soap if you can't find liquid detergent or soap. To use it, get the socks wet and rub the bar against the sock. Then, use your hands to work the soap into a lather on the sock. If you're only washing a couple of socks, use just a few drops of soap."

This makes them easier to clean and they'll dry faster if they aren't wadded up. Press down so the socks absorb the soapy water. [5] X Research source Wash as many socks as you need to, but don't overcrowd the sink, especially if it's small. If you have a lot of socks to wash or they're really dirty, wash them in batches."

If they're lightly soiled and you're just freshening them up, soak the socks for just a minute. If your socks are really smelly or dirty, soak them for as long as you can.

Wringing or twisting the socks can pull and damage the fibers, so use a gentle squeezing motion to get the water out."

Keep in mind that the drying time for your socks depends on what they're made of. Synthetics or synthetic blends dry faster than wool or all-cotton. Your socks may take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to dry. [12] X Research source If you have access to a dryer, toss them in and turn on the machine. If you're just drying a few socks, check them after about 5 minutes to see if they're thoroughly dry. Turn on a fan in the room or hang the socks outside if the weather is hot and dry. These can speed up the drying time."
