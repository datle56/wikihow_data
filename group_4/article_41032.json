      "content": "Take a moment to think. If you're bullying other people because you have a temper problem, practice thinking before you act. For example, if someone says something that might usually set you off, take a deep breath and pause before responding. Realize that with every action you are making a decision to behave in a certain way. Your words and behaviors are under your control. Rate your anger or strong feelings on a level from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest. When you feel yourself at an 8, 9, or 10 on the scale, step away and don't try to engage with others. Take a moment for yourself to calm down. [1] X Expert Source Hyungbum Kang, MA, MSW, LCSW, MAC Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 22 July 2021."

If you hurt other people as a way to gain status in a group, that group is having a negative influence on you. Chances are you don't actually want to be hurting others, but you feel you have to for \"survival\" purposes. Remove yourself immediately and halt your bullying behavior. If the group threatens you into bullying someone else, tell someone you trust that you need help handling the situation."

Ask yourself, how would you feel if someone were hurting you this way? [2] X Research source Spend time with people and get to know them on a deeper level. Understand that everyone is equal: you are not better than other people, and they are not better than you. Appreciate what makes each person unique, instead of judging them for their differences."

      "title": "Change outlook on things.",
      "content": "Change outlook on things. Based on the reason for bullying, change the way you feel about victims or potential victims. Look for positive things in others instead of negatives and reasons to bully. For example, if you are bullying because you want to \"seem cool\" and in-power, then think about how you could be even more popular as someone who was kind to others. Turn into a game of \"finding the best\" in every person you meet––did you know that can actually get through to even the prickliest of people when you work out their good features and highlight those rather than picking on their worst? It's a much more effective way of dealing with others than being mean or offensive. It may even gain you lifelong allies, if not friends."

There can be many reasons, but here are a few: Is it to feel superior because you had been bullied in the past? Is it because you have been in an environment in which bullying is common? Is it because you envy someone or want something from them? Is it because you are trying to \"fit in\" or \"seem cool?\""

Are you bullying to show off for others? Perhaps you're trying to stay afloat in a harsh group situation by putting on a display of power. Do you tease someone else about something you dislike about yourself? Bullying someone else who shares an unwanted trait is also common. Are you hurting other people because you're unhappy with your life? Some people act out against others when they feel powerless to change something about their own circumstances. Consider taking a personality test like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), or the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire to gain a better understanding of your personality.

Start by thinking through the entire part you have played in the upset; then, offering a sincere apology to those you have hurt. Be vulnerable and courageous. Keep the focus on what you have done/said. Then, let the person know what you can be counted on for in the future and be wedded to the words coming out of your mouth. If you admit that it was wrong to start bullying the victim, then the victim will have less reason to dislike or fear you. You may even become friends with the person, which helps to make the relationship between you less abrasive. [12] X Research source Don't apologize until you sincerely mean it. People will be able to sense if your words are not genuine. If you've hurt someone deeply over time, they may not want to talk to you.
