      "content": "Opt for a nursery if you need cash faster. While tree farms can be profitable, you likely need cash in the interim while your trees are growing. A nursery is a good option because you can start with seeds or seedlings, and in 2-5 years, you can sell the young trees to garden stores or the public. Choose trees that are native to your area and popular. Look around a local garden store to see what they're selling."

      "content": "Pick a hardy tree native to your area for a Christmas tree farm. Check with local nurseries to see what grows best in your area, as those trees will do better. Opt for a popular variety for the best chance of being commercially successful. [2] X Research source For instance, try Douglas fir, blue spruce, or white spruce. You can also grow more than one variety. Also, look for a variety that states it has \"late-breaking buds.\" That means the buds will break later in the spring. If they break too early, they could be hit by frost, halting growth that year. [3] X Research source You can buy plugs or bare root trees. Bare root trees are grown in fields, and the soil is removed before they come to you. Plugs are container-grown, and they arrive with soil. Plugs will last longer before you need to plant them, and you can plant them later in the year if you need to."

They grow relatively quickly, and you can sell them for lumber once they reach maturity. This tree is native to 15 southeastern states in the U.S., meaning it grows well without much effort. [4] X Research source It grows at a rate of 2 feet (0.61 m) per year and usually reaches heights of 60 to 90 feet (18 to 27 m), though it can get as tall as 110 feet (34 m)."

If it's sloped too much, that will be difficult. Always check what type of conditions your particular tree likes to grow in.

The auger helps with planting, while the shearing knife and chainsaw are good for pruning, shearing, and cutting trees down for the customers.

Christmas trees can take 5-10 years to grow, so if you don't plan, and if you're growing for lumber, it can take 30-50 years. It's hard to fix your mistakes later. Aiming for 6 feet (1.8 m) of space around each tree on all sides for Christmas trees will allow space for 1,200 trees in 1 acre (4,067 sq m). [8] X Research source By the time the trees are full grown, they will be nearly touching at this spacing. For other types of trees, check the canopy spacing to determine how far you need to plant them apart. Include access roads every couple of rows. Spacing trees out is important, as you will need to get between them to care for the trees and give them extra air circulation."

Add distilled water until it makes a filled, muddy pool. Insert the probe that came with the kit to test the water. It will give you a reading between 0 and 14. [11] X Research source It's important to use distilled water because the pH is neutral. Check more than one spot in your field, as pH can vary widely. Numbers below 7 mean your soil is acidic. \"7\" is neutral, and numbers above it mean your soil is alkaline. Check the specifications for your particular tree to see what pH level it likes."

Lift it into a clean container, and then take 5-10 more samples in the same area. Mix them all together, and then take out 2 cups of soil for your sample. You'll send this sample back in using the kit. Order this test from your local farm extension. Clear the plants from the top before you dig.

You can cut other types of trees through the summer and fall. Never cut pine tree limbs back to old growth, as they won't produce buds from this area.
