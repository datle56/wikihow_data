      "title": "Reduce stress",
      "content": "Reduce stress . According to the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD), there's a link between stress and your dental health. People under stress have a compromised immune system that makes it harder for them to fight off the bacteria that causes periodontal disease and makes them more prone to gum infection, but also general problems such as diabetes or heart disease. Researchers have also learned that not all stress is created equal. In studies done at three different U.S. universities, participants experiencing financial worries were at greatest risk for periodontal disease."

      "content": "Make a sea salt solution. Dissolve a small amount of sea salt in a cup of warm water. Swish a sip of the solution in your mouth for 30 seconds and spit it out. [3] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. Repeat several times. Salt water will reduce swollen gums, gum bleeding and will also decrease the swelling caused by infection. However, if the infection has advanced to an abscess, then you will need antibiotics.

      "content": "Apply tea bags. Steep a tea bag in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, remove it, and allow it to cool until you can handle it comfortably. Hold the cooled tea bag on the affected area of your gums and keep it there for about five minutes. The tannic acid in the tea bag can work effectively to relieve gum infection. Directly applying the tea bag to your gums is more effective than simply drinking the beverage. Plus, drinking too much tea has a dental downside: discolored, tea-stained teeth. Your teeth may change in color from yellow to brown and the stains are hard to remove, even after a professional cleaning"

Be especially careful to avoid putting honey on any teeth that may have cavities, as this will lead to tooth pain."

Older adults should particularly take note of this vitamin. According to the National Institutes of Health, higher blood levels of vitamin D seem to be linked to a reduced risk of gum disease in people age 50 and older. Get your vitamin D fix by soaking up the sun at least 15 to 20 minutes twice a week and eating D-rich foods such as salmon, whole eggs, sunflower seeds, and cod liver oil."
