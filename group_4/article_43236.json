      "content": "Ask yourself why their sexuality matters to you. It’s completely normal to be curious about your friend’s sexuality. However, Berasi says “Before talking with someone about their sexuality, ask yourself why you want to know this, and why it matters to you. Are you coming from an open or judgemental place?” [1] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021. Berasi says “If you are inquiring due to a desire to find [a] connection or from a place of empathy or support, these are good indicators that your question is more likely to be well received and possibly helpful as opposed to harmful or hurtful.” [2] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021."

      "content": "Explore your best friend’s comfort level with LGBTQ+ topics. How do they react to fictional and real-life same-gender couples? Do they support gay rights? If they seem accepting, this doesn't mean they’re a lesbian—but they may be more likely to be understanding if you ask them if they are. If they react to the topic with revulsion, they’re probably not openly LGBTQ+. One way to bring this up is to mention that you're thinking of attending a Gay Straight Alliance event, which only \"outs\" you as a straight ally. Some people raised in homophobic environments express negative views on LGBTQ+ issues even if they’re queer. If your friend seems defensive or is sending mixed signals, they may need more time to work out their sexuality."

      "content": "Ask about their past relationships or crushes. The next time you’re dishing about your newest relationship or talking about the celebrities you find attractive, pay attention to who they mention. You can also say something like, “I’ve been single forever, what about you?” [3] X Research source If your friend doesn’t talk about liking women or if they’ve dated men in the past, they could still be LGBTQ+. They may just not be comfortable coming out yet. If you identify as LGBTQ+ and you feel ready to come out, you could even talk about a queer or lesbian celebrity you find attractive and see how they react."

      "content": "Come out to them and see how they react. If you identify as LGBTQ+, you already have a good way to test the waters. If you’re ready, and you trust your best friend completely, consider talking to them about your sexuality. That way, they know it’s safe to come out to you if they’re ready. [4] X Research source If you have a crush on your best friend, Berasi recommends having “general discussions with them about sexuality… This way, they will become aware that you are interested in same-sex relationships and/or sexual activity, and hopefully, you can get a better sense of their own interest.” [5] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021. However, this doesn’t mean you have to come out. If you’re not sure you can trust them or there’s a risk you could be harmed or thrown out of the house, it may be safer not to share.

      "content": "Ask them politely if they identify as LGBTQ+. Although you can try and guess if your BFF is queer based on context clues, it’s often better to just ask how they identify. Just make sure you do it in a place where you’re not around other people. If they trust you and are already out to themselves, they might share their sexuality with you. [7] X Research source Say something like, “So, do you date guys, girls, or both?” or “Hey, I’m curious if you identify as LGBTQ+?” You can even ask directly, “Are you gay?” Create a comfortable environment beforehand by showing support for LGBTQ+ issues. If they do come out to you, thank them for having the courage to tell you and offer to support them if they decide to come out to others. [8] X Research source"

Your best friend's sexuality is their own business, and it’s not your information to share. In some situations, it may even be dangerous for them to come out. [9] X Research source If your friend does open up about their sexuality to you, ask if they’ve come out to anyone else yet. That way, you’ll know who is safe to talk to and who isn’t."

      "content": "Look for signs that your best friend has feelings for you. Depending on what your relationship is like, it can be difficult to tell if your BFF likes you as a friend or something more. For example, your friend might just be super touchy. However, if they’re showing multiple signs, it may indicate that they do have feelings for you. [10] X Research source They send you more texts or messages than you send them. They regularly ask you if you have a crush on anyone. They seem to never approve of anyone you like or are dating. They always invite you to hang out one-on-one. They give you super intense or detailed compliments. They find excuses to touch you. You catch them staring at you a lot. They remember the little things (like the show you’re watching or your hobbies)."

When the moment is right, tell them that you’ve gotten hints that they might have feelings for you and that you don’t feel the same way. [11] X Research source You might say something like, “I’ve been noticing that you’ve been paying a lot of attention to me lately, and I just want to be honest and say I’m not interested you in that way. I think you’re amazing, though, and I still want to be friends!” If your friend tells you they like you directly, Berasi says, “Tell them you’re flattered but you’re straight! There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.” [12] X Expert Source Kateri Berasi, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021. You can also try dropping hints that you wouldn’t be interested in her, like \"I really want to keep you as a best friend. Can we stay that way?” If it turns out that your BFF doesn’t like you that way after all, try to laugh it off and make a joke out of it so they don’t feel too awkward."

If you are not interested in dating your friend, these behaviors might confuse them.

Try not to contact them for a while so they can heal and sort out their feelings. [14] X Research source When you both feel ready, ease back into the friendship with short, low-pressure meetups, like a half-hour lunch in a public place. If your friend is questioning their sexuality, this may be a very difficult time for them. Try offering them LGBTQ+ support resources, or encourage them to talk to a counselor."

If your best friend is LGBTQ+ and has come out to you, it may be best to talk to someone who doesn’t know them personally so you don’t risk outing them to others.
