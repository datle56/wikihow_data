The default is the All tab, which is a mix of results based on what you search. For example, searching \"pictures of cats in hats\" will result in more images appearing in the All tab while \"voter turnout\" will result in more blog or news articles than images. Images show a list of images that correspond to your search. If your search result matches a lot of images, the most popular ones will be displayed as a search result in the All tab. Maps show your search result on a map. Usually, when you enter a location into the search, a map will appear in the All tab. The shopping tab will show products available in your area or online that relate to your search. Blogs will show any blog posts that relate to your search.
