      "title": "Randonautica is an app that sends users on randomized adventures.",
      "content": "Randonautica is an app that sends users on randomized adventures. The app generates geographical (GPS) coordinates to random locations in each user’s area, but unlike other geocaching apps, it claims to combine technology with quantum physics. Essentially, Randonautica promises to provide users with coordinates based on their thoughts and intentions. [1] X Research source Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. To pick adventures randomly, Randonautica uses quantum number generators. Among users, “Randonauting” is a term that describes going on adventures with the app, and a Randonaut is someone who uses the app."

      "content": "The idea behind Randonautica is to explore the world mindfully. Randonautica’s creators claim that the MMI, or Mind Matter Interaction, enables users to influence the app’s generated locations and basically think their ideal journeys into existence. It’s intended to encourage users to explore their area and discover unexpected spots that they may not have ever visited otherwise. [2] X Research source Most users are brought to mundane locations—but a few have ended up in unexpected and occasionally dangerous areas because the app’s coordinates are totally randomized. Some users have reported spooky discoveries while using the app, which helped it gain notoriety on TikTok and Reddit."

      "content": "Download the app and enable your phone’s GPS. Randonautica is a free app usable on both iOS and Android mobile devices. Once downloaded, open up the app; it’ll prompt you to share your location settings as part of the introduction. Simply click “enable” when prompted to allow location sharing in the app and proceed. [3] X Research source Look for the app on either the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store ."

      "title": "Set the maximum radius that you’re willing to explore.",
      "content": "Set the maximum radius that you’re willing to explore. The Radonautica app takes you to totally random destinations, so it’s up to you to tell the app how far you want to go. Pinch zoom on the app’s map to set your desired radius and show the app the area you’d like to stay within. Randonaut trips can be short walks down the street or long drives miles away. [4] X Research source The app will also ask you whether or not you’re willing to explore water spots; give the app your answer when prompted."

    {
      "title": "Choose the type of GPS point you want the app to generate.",
      "content": "Choose the type of GPS point you want the app to generate. In the Randonautica app, there are 3 kinds of GPS points: attractors , voids , and anomalies . Attractors are spots that have the highest concentration of quantum points, according to the app, while voids are spots with the least quantum points. Anomalies (also called “Power” in the app) are the strongest points on the map. [5] X Research source Attractors are considered highly significant by the app, though that doesn’t make voids a bad thing; because they’re sparse in quantum points, they’re thought to have a higher chance of being relevant to your intention. Anomalies, also known as “intention-driven anomalies,” are said to be fully influenced by your intentions. When you select “Power,” the app uses quantum number dates to pick the strongest attractor or void anomaly available."

    {
      "title": "Set an intention or theme for your Randonaut trip.",
      "content": "Set an intention or theme for your Randonaut trip. As you choose the type of GPS point you want to explore, think about the purpose of your adventure. What are you hoping to get out of the experience? Set an intention before continuing to set up your adventure in the app so your intention coincides with the chosen destination. [6] X Research source For example, if you’ve been feeling uncreative lately, your intention may be “inspiration.” If you want to de-stress, your intention might be “peace.” If you just want to see a cute animal, your intention might be “dog.” You don’t have to pick an intention. If you’d rather have a completely randomized experience, go with the flow and let the app decide on its own."

    {
      "title": "Select “ANU” to designate an entropy source.",
      "content": "Select “ANU” to designate an entropy source. Before generating a GPS point, the app will ask you to choose your entropy source, or where to generate the random coordinates from. The easiest way to do this is simply to select the “ANU” option in the app, which is an abbreviation for “Australia National University”—the facility that hosts the quantum random number generator used by the app. [7] X Research source Once you set the app’s entropy source, it’ll fetch a geographical coordinate for you. Open that coordinate in Google Maps and get started on your adventure! If Randonautica ever glitches or stops working, try a few different fixes. Restart the app and see if it works; if not, either switch your phone off and then on again or uninstall and reinstall the app."

      "title": "TikTok users share Randonauting horror stories in their videos.",
      "content": "TikTok users share Randonauting horror stories in their videos. After launching in 2020, TikTok and Reddit users began posting about their Randonautica experiences. However, users most often report spooky things happening on their adventures—like coordinates leading to sketchy areas, creepy people, or even crime scenes. Despite users often telling others not to use the app, more people tend to flock to it to see if it’s really that scary. [8] X Research source For example, the #randonauting and #randonautinggonewrong hashtags on TikTok are filled with videos about the app bringing people to areas that made them feel creeped out. In one video, for example, users explore a deserted beach before noticing that a boat out on the ocean is moving directly toward them. In another, the user finds a creepy abandoned mall and walks through it."

      "title": "Teenage TikTok users once found human remains through the app.",
      "content": "Teenage TikTok users once found human remains through the app. One of the most infamous Randonauting incidents happened in 2020 when a group of teenagers went exploring with the app. Their coordinates led them to the shoreline in Seattle, where they found a suitcase containing human remains inside. Though it was a coincidence that Randonautica led the teens there, the incident added to the app’s spooky reputation. [9] X Research source In the past, Randonautica has also received allegations that it’s being used for human trafficking, though creators denied the accusation, stating that all data collected in the app is anonymous."

      "title": "Despite many uncanny coincidences, the app’s science is unproven.",
      "content": "Despite many uncanny coincidences, the app’s science is unproven. Lots of strange things have been reported by users on the app, but ultimately, the app’s claims of combining quantum entropy with user intentions can’t be supported scientifically. Similarly, users’ claims of their intentions leading to spooky things are most likely total coincidences, no matter how strange their stories might be. In addition, most user stories are from TikTok and Reddit, where claims aren’t verified—so it’s possible for some users to make up stories for views. Some Randonautica stories have been debunked entirely or proven to be exaggerated. However, others (like the story of teens finding human remains while using the app) are absolutely true. It’s also important to remember that not all Randonautica stories are spooky! Some users find lighthearted things—for example, a silly kite, a cute puppy, or a field with flowers in it."

      "content": "Adventure during the daytime. Exploring locations at night might seem fun and thrilling, but it’s safer and easier to avoid getting lost when you go Randonauting during the day. It can also be more nerve-racking to explore a totally unfamiliar, randomly-chosen place at night, so avoid it, especially when you’re alone. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Charge your phone fully before leaving. Even if you’re planning to go on a short Randonauting adventure, you never know if you might need your phone for something—and using GPS can drain phone batteries fast. Being stranded in an unknown location without your phone definitely isn’t ideal, so if you plan on using the app, charge your phone first. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Travel with friends whenever possible. Remember, there’s safety in numbers! Just in case, try to bring at least 1 friend with you when you go on Randonautica trips, or more if you can. Exploring unfamiliar locations alone can be a little risky, so don’t go alone. Plus, adventuring with friends can be fun—you’ve got buddies to chat with and help you navigate. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Steer clear of private property no matter what. Sometimes the app may send you to a randomized location that ends up being a private residence, privately-owned land, or a closed-off location. Don’t risk getting into legal trouble; never enter private property, even if the app’s coordinates are telling you to. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Use your best judgment and don’t go into dangerous-looking areas. Basically, if an area looks unsafe, go with your gut and steer clear of it. The app doesn’t know where it’s sending you, so coordinates aren’t evaluated for safety. You’re responsible for your safety while using the app, so if it asks you to go somewhere dangerous, turn back or generate a new GPS point. [14] X Research source For example, don’t go near train tracks, electrical power zones, or old, neglected buildings that might be structurally unsound."

      "content": "Know your physical limitations. Sometimes the Randonautica app may send you a GPS point that can't be reached without strenuous activity like climbing or hiking. Even if you decide to continue with the adventure, use your common sense and know when enough is enough. Don’t overextend yourself! [15] X Research source If you know you’ll be doing strenuous exercise to get to the GPS point, hydrate beforehand to ensure your body is as ready for the trip as it can be. Bring water with you as well!"
