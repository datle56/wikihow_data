      "content": "Disabling Chrome won't negatively affect your mobile or how you use it. Really, the only effect that you will notice is that all the app updates for Chrome will be removed when the app is disabled. This frees up some room and helps your Android process things a little faster. You can always re-enable or re-install Chrome whenever you want. Make sure Android System WebView is active, however. It's powered by Chrome, so don't accidentally disable it when you're disabling the web browser. WebView is responsible for opening a mini web view of a link that you tap within the app you're using instead of opening an entire browser window."

      "title": "Uninstalling Chrome is only possible with an Android root or ADB.",
      "content": "Uninstalling Chrome is only possible with an Android root or ADB. Using an Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is the most straightforward way to get rid of Chrome, but doing so may cause damage to your device or prevent it from working properly. Completely uninstalling Chrome will also get rid of files that, even in a disabled state, help your phone or tablet to function. So uninstalling the app and getting rid of those files will make your phone or tablet buggy and not work correctly. If you still want to uninstall Chrome and potentially damage your phone, read How to Delete Apps on Android to use a rooted phone/tablet to delete system apps."
