Live culture yogurt is full of L. acidophilus , a bacteria that keeps Candida in check. Snacking on yogurt helps boost your good bacteria and control your vagina’s pH balance, so yeast infections are harder to get. Try swapping your morning cereal with a yogurt bowl or picking up a yogurt cup instead of a pudding as your evening snack. Now, yogurt won’t necessarily cure your yeast infection, but it can help prevent it from returning. Some women put plain, live culture yogurt on their vagina like a cream to ease yeast infection symptoms; however, doctors strongly advise against this as it could worsen symptoms.
