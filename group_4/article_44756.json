      "content": "Listen to your Chihuahua’s cough. One of the most common signs of a collapsing trachea is a ‘goose honk’ cough. The cough is dry and usually comes after a dog has been active, excited, or quickly drinking water. [3] X Research source If your Chihuahua starts to sound like a goose on occasion, he probably has a collapsing trachea. Hot weather can worsen your Chihuahua’s coughing."

      "title": "Observe your Chihuahua’s breathing.",
      "content": "Observe your Chihuahua’s breathing. Difficulty breathing is another common sign of a collapsing trachea. When tracheal rings become weak and collapse down into the trachea, air either gets trapped in the lungs or can’t get to the lungs. Your Chihuahua may breathe more rapidly and have abnormal breathing sounds. [4] X Research source In addition,his abdominal muscles may become tense from the extra effort he makes to breathe. [5] X Research source Abnormal breathing sounds include clicking when breathing out and wheezing when breathing in. [6] X Research source Difficulty breathing can lead to cyanosis, which occurs when the skin or mucus membranes don’t get enough oxygen and turn blue."

      "title": "Monitor your Chihuahua’s activity.",
      "content": "Monitor your Chihuahua’s activity. If your Chihuahua becomes less active, he may have a collapsing trachea. [7] X Research source Without the ability to breathe very well, your Chihuahua would not be able to exercise for long periods of time, if at all. In addition, since being active and excited can worsen the signs of a collapsing trachea, your Chihuahua may simply decide to stay still instead."

      "title": "Take your Chihuahua to your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Take your Chihuahua to your veterinarian. Although a goose honk cough is a clear sign of a collapsing trachea, your Chihuahua will need a thorough workup by your veterinarian. He or she will analyze your Chihuahua’s blood to assess his overall health, and take chest x-rays. Chest x-rays do not always show a collapsed trachea, but can help rule out other causes of breathing problems. [8] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source During the physical exam, your veterinarian will probably touch your Chihuahua’s trachea to stimulate a cough. [9] X Research source This is necessary to help determine whether your Chihuahua can be treated without surgery . In addition to x-rays, your veterinarian may want to use other visual diagnostic methods (e.g., fluoroscopy, endoscopy, bronchoscopy) to get a closer look at your Chihuahua’s airways and determine if his airway is infected with bacteria.

      "title": "Discuss medical treatment options with your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Discuss medical treatment options with your veterinarian. Collapsing trachea treatment is either medical (non-surgical) or surgical. Generally, medical management involves weight management and using various medications to treat the airway and other related conditions. Medical management works in most dogs with a collapsing trachea; however, since a collapsing trachea usually worsens over time, surgical treatment may eventually be needed. [11] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source It is best to start with medical management, then consider surgery if the condition worsens. Your veterinarian will go through each of the medications with you and indicate which ones will likely work best for your Chihuahua."

      "content": "Hospitalize your Chihuahua, if necessary. Collapsing tracheas can range in severity. If your Chihuahua’s tracheal collapse is severe (trachea is 75‒100% collapsed), your veterinarian will probably want to hospitalize him and give him intensive care. Intensive care includes extra oxygen and heavy sedation. The sedation will calm your Chihuahua and keep him from fighting against his breathing troubles and other treatments. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source The length of hospitalization will depend on how long it takes your veterinarian to stabilize your Chihuahua and get him well enough for home care."

      "title": "Treat your Chihuahua’s airways.",
      "content": "Treat your Chihuahua’s airways. If your Chihuahua’s tracheal collapse is mild to moderate, you can treat him at home. Treating his airways has several goals: reducing inflammation and bronchial spasms, relaxing the airways, suppressing coughing, and eliminating excessive secretions. [14] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source Your veterinarian will prescribe the medications, describe how they work, and explain how to administer them. The strain of coughing could damage the sensitive lining of your Chihuahua’s airways. Anti-inflammatory medications will reduce the damage and inflammation. The bronchi are the two main branches of the trachea that bring air into the lungs. Bronchial spasms cause the bronchi to become narrow. [15] X Research source Medications to relax the airways and relieve the spasms are called bronchodilators. They open up the bronchial airways and relax the lung muscles. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your veterinarian found a respiratory infection, he or she will prescribe antibiotics. [17] X Research source The medications may take a few days to start working. Once they start working, you will start to see definite improvement in your Chihuahua’s breathing."

      "title": "Limit your Chihuahua’s activity.",
      "content": "Limit your Chihuahua’s activity. Since activity can worsen a collapsing trachea, you will need to limit your Chihuahua’s activity until his condition is more stable. For example, shorten his walks and walk him more slowly. Rather than playing an active game with him, consider spending quality quiet time with him. Your veterinarian will let you know when you can start increasing his activity level (if at all)."

      "content": "Find a veterinary surgeon. When medical management of your Chihuahua’s collapsing trachea is no longer working well, he will need to have surgery. Surgical correction of a collapsing trachea is very complicated, and might be beyond the surgical abilities of your own veterinarian. Therefore, you should work with a board-certified veterinary surgeon. [21] X Research source Veterinary surgeons at veterinary teaching hospitals and specialized veterinary surgery clinics are board certified. Consider asking your veterinarian for recommendations on veterinary surgeons."

      "content": "Learn about surgical treatment options. Two surgical treatments are available for collapsing tracheas. The first is the surgical placement of plastic rings or spirals on the outside of the trachea. The second option is placing a stent (spring-like device) in the trachea to keep it open. An advantage of stents is that their placement does not require a surgical incision. [22] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care.
