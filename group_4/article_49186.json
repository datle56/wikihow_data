      "title": "Roll up the ACE bandage.",
      "content": "Roll up the ACE bandage. If your bandage does not come in a tight roll, take the time to roll it up. Having the bandage in a roll rather than loose will make applying it easier and quicker in the long run. [1] X Research source If your bandage comes with hook-and-loop fastener at one end, start rolling up from that end. You want the hook-and-loop fastener to end up on the end of the bandage after wrapping. ACE bandages can be purchased at almost any pharmacy, big box store, or grocery store. They can also be found through online retailers."

      "title": "Position your foot so it's at a 90-degree angle from your ankle.",
      "content": "Position your foot so it's at a 90-degree angle from your ankle. Keep it at this angle during the whole process of wrapping so that the bandage doesn't slip or move accidentally. Wrapping your foot in this position will be best for circulation and comfort. [2] X Research source Once the ankle is wrapped, the foot will be able to move a bit, so don't worry that your foot will be kept at an uncomfortable angle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Begin wrapping the bandage around the ball of your foot.",
      "content": "Begin wrapping the bandage around the ball of your foot. Place the end of the bandage on the top of your foot next to the toes. Hold the end with one hand while you wrap the bandage down around the ball of the foot. Once the bandage is back around the top of the foot, you can tug it a little to keep it taut and to keep the end in place. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue wrapping to the back of the arch of your foot.",
      "content": "Continue wrapping to the back of the arch of your foot. It typically takes about 3 or 4 wraps to cover this area. This area gets a lot of movement when you walk or put pressure on your foot, so be sure to wrap it completely. [4] X Research source If you don't cover an area on the first pass, feel free to wrap back and forth a few times until you can no longer see any skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transition from your foot to your ankle.",
      "content": "Transition from your foot to your ankle. Start moving your wraps from the back of the arch, over the heel, and to the bottom of the Achilles tendon. Go back and forth over this area a couple of times to help secure the bandage in this area. [5] X Research source It's hard to keep the bandage from slipping off the heel. It typically likes to move up or down. This is actually OK to some extent, as a bit of exposed skin at the back of the heel won't prevent the bandage from giving stability and proper compression."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep wrapping up past the ankle bone.",
      "content": "Keep wrapping up past the ankle bone. You want the wrap to end about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above your ankle bone if your injury is right at the ankle. Do a couple of wraps right at the top to anchor the ACE bandage. This will ensure that the bandage keeps light pressure on the injured area and stays in place. [6] X Research source It may take a couple tries to get your wrap to end in the right spot. How many turns you do over the foot and ankle depends on how long your ACE bandage is and how tightly you wrap. Double check that you aren't wrapping it too tightly. You may need to adjust the wrap to loosen or tighten it, depending on how much compression feels comfortable."

    {
      "title": "Overlap the layers halfway across each other.",
      "content": "Overlap the layers halfway across each other. As you work your way around your foot and ankle, make sure that the elastic overlaps the last layer you made. This will help ensure that there is the right amount of compression applied to your injury and that the bandage stays in place. The only area of skin that you should intentionally keep exposed is the toes. However, it's fine if some of the heel becomes exposed due to movement at the ankle. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the bandage so that it's tight but not constricting.",
      "content": "Wrap the bandage so that it's tight but not constricting. An elastic bandage should be wrapped tight enough to put a small amount of compression on the ankle, but it shouldn't cause numbness, tingling, or additional pain. If you experience any of these things, loosen the bandaging you have done and continue with a looser wrap. [8] X Research source The bandage can get overly tight over time if your injury causes swelling. If you start to feel tingling or numbness, take off the bandage and re-wrap the area.

      "content": "Use an ACE bandage for a minor sprain or injury. ACE bandages are great tools for helping minor injuries to muscles and tendons heal. They give some gentle support while not completely immobilizing the area. For instance, if you have lightly twisted your ankle but you are sure you have not broken anything, then wrapping it in an ACE bandage will help you."

      "title": "Use an ACE bandage on a major sprain after getting medical care.",
      "content": "Use an ACE bandage on a major sprain after getting medical care. Major sprains, such as those that swell, bruise, or are extremely painful right away, should be assessed by a medical professional. Simply wrapping the injured area and waiting for it to heal may lead to a serious injury healing incorrectly or not healing at all. [10] X Research source A doctor will able to assess whether you have a break or sprain, and what type of treatment will help you heal most successfully. Even if you have a mild fracture, your doctor may suggest wrapping the area in an ace bandage until you can get a cast put on it."

      "title": "Keep the wrap on for at least 4 days after a sprain.",
      "content": "Keep the wrap on for at least 4 days after a sprain. If you are using a compression bandage because you have actually sprained your ankle, it's important to give it a lot of time to heal before you stop wrapping it. Minor sprains can benefit from the support the bandage gives and having it on will help remind you to treat it gently as you start using it again. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While you should keep wrapping the injured area for at least 4 days, it doesn't mean that it needs to be wrapped every moment. Letting the skin breath for a few minutes every day will give you time to clean the area and moisturize the skin if you need to. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Start gently using your ankle after a few days.",
      "content": "Start gently using your ankle after a few days. When you sprain your ankle it's important to start using it again as soon as possible, so that you don't start to lose strength and flexibility. Start by flexing it to get it moving. If that doesn't hurt, go further and put a small amount of weight on it. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This doesn't mean that you should put your whole weight on it or do strenuous activities, it simply means that the ankle needs to be moved to make sure it maintains strength as it heals. Your ankle will likely not be fully healed at this time. It may take months to recover completely."

      "title": "Rest your ankle as much as you can.",
      "content": "Rest your ankle as much as you can. While wrapping your ankle gives it a little bit of support, it's not enough support to keep it from moving and being further stressed if you use it too strenuously. Because of this, it's important to stay off the ankle while it heals. [14] X Research source If you need to move around for more than a brief moment, consider using crutches."

      "title": "Elevate your ankle whenever possible for several days.",
      "content": "Elevate your ankle whenever possible for several days. If you are lying down or sitting down relaxing, elevate your ankles above your heart. This can usually be easily done by propping your ankle up under several pillows. Do this for at least 2 days after you injure your ankle to promote circulation, although doing it whenever you are relaxing during the entire healing process can be helpful. [15] X Research source Elevating the ankle reduces swelling because it prevents fluids from pooling down at the ankle."

    {
      "title": "Ice",
      "content": "Ice your ankle for 15 minutes once every 2-3 hours. Icing your ankle will reduce swelling and pain because it limits blood blow and inflammation. Put a towel on your ankle and apply a cold pack on top of it. You can use a pre-made ice pack, a bag of ice, or a bag of frozen vegetables. [16] X Research source It's important to keep the ice from getting the skin too cold, as this can cause skin damage. While the ace bandage will create some barrier to the cold, it's a good idea to add an additional barrier."

      "title": "Take an over-the-counter pain reliever if necessary.",
      "content": "Take an over-the-counter pain reliever if necessary. If your ankle continues to hurt or you have some swelling, a pain reliever can help. In particular, ibuprofen and naproxen (Advil, Motrin, and Aleve), are good at reducing swelling at the same time as relieving pain. [17] X Research source Follow the dosing directions that come with your medication. If you need more pain relief than is recommended, talk to your doctor about alternative pain relievers or dosing."

      "content": "Seek out medical care, if necessary. If your ankle is discolored, very swollen, or is very painful right after you injure it, you should get emergency medical care. If you have been wrapping your ankle for more than 2 days and it has not improved at all, contact your doctor and have it looked at. [18] X Research source"
