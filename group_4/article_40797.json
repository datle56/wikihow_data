Your words should introduce the quotation, usually coming before the quote (though after may be okay). Several options for introducing the quotation are available to you: [6] X Research source Use the quote as a sentence predicate. The subject of the sentence will be the person who said the quote, and the verb will most likely be a synonym of “said.” For example, \"Jane Smith said, 'blah blah blah.'\" Preview the content of the quote. Use your own (grammatically correct) sentence to preview or paraphrase what the quote will say, then insert a colon or comma, then the (grammatically correct) sentence-length quotation. For example: \"Once Jane Smith said something completely awesome: 'the awesome thing she said.'\" Begin with the quote. If you begin with the quote, be sure to place a comma after the quote and then provide a verb and attribute the quotation to the source. For example: \"'Blah blah blah,' said Jane Smith.\""

In American usage, end punctuation should be placed inside the quotation marks. For example, “this is the quote.” Paraphrased material (someone else’s idea put into your own words) need not have quotation marks around it, but should be attributed to the original speaker. If you introduce the quote with the speaker’s name and a verb, provide a comma before the beginning of the quotation. For example: \"Jane Smith said, 'blah blah blah.'\""
