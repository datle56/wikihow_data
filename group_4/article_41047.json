      "content": "Some biters find it helpful to keep one finger \"safe\" at a time. Choose the finger you're most likely to bite. Consciously focus on not biting that finger. You're allowed to bite the others, but that one is safe. After a week or two, you'll see what a difference it makes to leave one finger alone. Your safe finger will not be swollen, bloody or otherwise damaged. It will look healthy in comparison to the rest. Seeing this difference can be motivation to stop biting all of your fingers.

You can put down your finger before you bite. Try to figure out why you bite your nails, too. Are you doing it because it feels good, because it's distracting you, or because of some other reason? You may have developed a nail-biting habit to help cope with something anxiety- or stress-inducing. [7] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021.
