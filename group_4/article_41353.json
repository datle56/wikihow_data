      "content": "Get a dental exam. When you go to the dentist, your dentist will do an exam. At first, the dentist will perform a complete exam and possibly take x-rays to look for new cavities, cracked or broken tooth enamel, or broken teeth. They will also check old fillings to see whether they need to be replaced, or if there's any recurrent decay under the filling. [5] X Research source Tu Anh Vu, DMD. Dentist. Personal interview. 7 May 2020. Your dentist will also check your gums for any signs of inflammation, bleeding, or a need for a deep cleaning. Your dentist will also check for any abscesses, impacted wisdom teeth, and any signs of bruxism, clenching or grinding of the teeth usually done while you sleep. If none of these seem to be a problem, your dentist will check your sinuses as well as your TMJ. If you have any cracked, broken, or impacted teeth, bonding or tooth extraction might be needed if the tooth cannot be saved. If an abscess is causing your tooth pain, it may be necessary to perform a root canal, after your dentist removes the infection through a small cut in your gum and you go through a course of antibiotics. In a root canal, a hole is drilled into the tooth and the infection is physically removed. The area within the tooth is then cleaned and the tooth is repaired with a filling."

Sometimes, anti-depressants and/or muscle relaxing agents are prescribed for TMJ. These are often used as a short-term approach to TMJ. Mouth guards can be used to treat TMJ, especially if you are grinding or clenching your teeth. Physical therapy exercises can be done to relax the masseter muscles. Counseling may be considered to reduce stress and to teach various relaxation techniques. Surgery may be needed in severe cases of tooth pain due to TMJ.
