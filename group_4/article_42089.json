      "content": "Center the pad in the middle part (the crotch) of your underpants, or the part that goes between your legs. The wider or bigger side of the pad should go to the back of your panties, towards your buttocks. Make sure the adhesive is stuck firmly to the fabric of your underwear. If your pad has wings, remove the backing and fold them around the middle part of your underwear, so it looks like the pad is hugging your underwear. Make sure the pad isn't too far forward or too far back; it should be centered in your underwear. If you are using a reusable pad, simply secure the pad by using the popper on the wings."

You should change your pad every 4-6 hours (or sooner if you have a really heavy flow). Changing your pad will help keep it from leaking and keep you feeling fresh."

      "content": "Dispose of the used pad by rolling it up and putting it in the wrapper. If you threw out the wrapper, just wrap the pad in some toilet paper. If you're in a public place, look for a small trashcan on the floor or attached to the wall of the stall. Discard the soiled pad in the trash—never, ever throw it in the toilet, even if the packaging says it is okay to do so. It can clog the plumbing. If you are using a reusable pad, just put it in the washing. If you are at home and you have pets, you may want to throw the used pad into a trashcan with a lid or even the trash bin that the garbage collectors collect. Cats and dogs especially can be attracted to the smell of the blood on your pad. Your dog eating your tampon or pad is not only embarrassing, but it can be life-threatening to your pet."

Your first period will probably be very light, and may not even look like blood. It may appear as bright red drops in your underwear, or it could be brownish and sticky. Don't worry that you will be gushing blood, either; during an average period, a person will only lose about 1 oz. (30 ml) of blood. That's about the same amount of liquid as two bottles of nail polish. When your period comes, you may notice a feeling of wetness in your underwear. You may even feel liquid flowing out of your vagina, or you may not notice anything at all."

      "content": "Buy supplies. The drugstore or grocery store usually has an entire aisle dedicated to period products (pads, tampons, pantyliners). Don't be overwhelmed by all the choices; as you get to know your flow, you'll have a better idea of which product works best for you. To start out, look for pads that aren't too bulky and has light or medium absorbency. Pads are probably the easiest thing to start out with; you'll have enough to think about without worrying about how to insert a tampon. Practice putting a pad in your underwear before you have your period. If you notice discharge in your underwear, use that to figure out where the middle of the pad should be. Some websites offer coupons or even free samples or period \"starter kits\" for you to keep on-hand. If you'd rather use a tampon or a menstrual cup during your first period, that's completely fine. It's important that you are comfortable with whichever product you choose, and products come with varying levels of absorbency.

If you're embarrassed about buying pads, just go up to the register with a few other items, and busy yourself looking at candy while the cashier rings you up. Remember that the cashier really doesn't care what you are buying and it's nothing new or shocking to them."

With all the time you spend at school, playing sports, going to friend's houses, and doing other activities, it's possible, even likely, you will get your period while you are away from home. It may give you peace of mind to know you always have a product with you wherever you are, just in case. If you're worried about someone going through your book bag and finding your stash or things falling out, get a makeup bag or pencil case to store your period supplies. You may want to keep a pair of underwear and a resealable plastic bag in your locker in case you get your period at school and need to change your panties. You can rinse the soiled pair in cold water and put them in the bag to take home. You may also want to keep a little bottle of ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain medication in your locker, just in case you get cramps. Just make sure your school policy allows this so you don't get in trouble."

[6] X Research source Until you can get a pad, wrap several layers of toilet paper around the crotch of your underwear. This will absorb the blood and act as a temporary liner until you can get a pad. Ask a trusted friend if they can give you a pad. If there is anyone else in the restroom, don't be shy about asking them! They've all probably been in your position before and will be happy to help."

Still, it does happen sometimes, but it's not a big deal. Cover your buttocks with a sweater, hoodie, or long-sleeved shirt you can tie around your waist if you don't want people to see. If you're at school, go to the nurse or office and ask if you can call your parents for a change of clothes. If worst comes to worst, you can always change into the shorts of your gym uniform. If you change your pants and someone asks you about it, either tell them the truth or just say you spilled something all over your pants and had to get a change of clothes. No big deal."

Not everyone will experience cramps, and some will only have mild discomfort, but it's possible you will feel intense cramping in your lower abdomen. The nurse can give you pain medicine, a heating pad, and a place to rest until you feel better. Exercise can actually relieve cramps. Even if you don't feel like moving, try not to skip gym class. It might help you feel better. Try a few yoga poses. Start with child's pose. Sit on your knees so your buttocks is resting on your heels. Stretch the upper half of your body forward, arms extended, until your stomach is resting on your thighs. Breathe slowly and relax, closing your eyes.

They love and care about you and your health is important to them. If your parent doesn't get periods, don't keep them in the dark. They know you're going to get your period eventually. Even if they don't have all the answers, they can help you get supplies and may put you in touch with an someone who does have periods you can talk to.

While your period will probably be very irregular at first; it may last two days or nine, it may come every 28 days or twice a month; it's important you start to track it.

You can use one of many smart phone apps to track your period. Tracking your period will make it less likely you are caught unaware. You can wear a pantyliner when you know you're getting near the time of your period. Knowing when you can expect your period can come in handy when making plans (you might want to postpone that beach trip for the week after your period)."
