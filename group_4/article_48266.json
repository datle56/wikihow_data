      "content": "The \"F\" button in FaceTime adds a depth-of-field effect to your call. When you tap the \"F\" button, the background of your video will turn blurry while anything in the foreground (including yourself) will remain sharp. You may see this referred to as aperture, or f-stop (as the button has an \"F\" like the \"F\" in f-stop), which are both terms used in photography. Adjusting the aperture/f-stop of a camera lens is what causes the depth-of-field effect. On the iPhone, this effect is simulated, so the \"F\" button doesn't actually have anything to do with apertures and f-stop ."

With iOS 17, you can now leave video messages when someone doesn't pick up your call. Contact posters. The contact poster feature also works with FaceTime, and will show a custom poster when you make a FaceTime call. Silence callers you don't know. You can now automatically decline FaceTime calls from people who aren't in your Contacts. Reactions and gestures. You can now make fun effects happen on screen by tapping on a reaction or using a gestureâ€”for example, if you make a thumbs up in a FaceTime call, you'll see a fun effect on the screen when you do so."
