[1] X Research source The inch is the basic unit in U.S. standard measurement. There are 12 inches in a foot. Most rulers are 12 inches long. Longer rulers, which are 3 feet long (or 36 inches long, equal to one yard) are called yardsticks. Most countries don't use this unit of measurement any longer, preferring the metric system."

[2] X Research source The distance between one of these larger lines and the next is one inch. Most student rulers can measure up to 12 inches at a time. You will want to measure accurately, so you will have to know more than just where the inch markers are."

      "content": "Find the fraction of an inch markers. These delineate different fractions of an inch to help you measure as accurately as possible. [3] X Research source The smallest lines in between inch markers on a ruler represent 1/16 of an inch. The next largest lines represent 1/8 of an inch. The next largest lines show 1/4 inches. The longest line between inch markers shows 1/2 an inch. You will want to measure as closely an accurately to a fraction of an inch to get a true measurement of an object."

      "content": "Understand what a ruler is. A ruler is a measuring stick marked with units for measuring along its edge. [4] X Research source These can be made of plastic, cardboard, metal, or fabric. marked units for measuring length along its edge. These can be for either English (inches) or metric (millimeters or centimeters) units of measurement. In the U.S. and the UK, a student's rule is from 12 to 36 inches (30.48 to 91.44 cm), or from one to three feet long. Some typical fractions of inches used to make measurements more accurate are halves and quarters. Some typical fractions of centimeters are thin marks for every tenth of a centimeter (every one millimeter), and thick marks for every half centimeter (every five millimeters)."

[5] X Research source This can be wrapped around a person's torso, to measure chest, waist, neck, and other sizes for sewing clothing. It may be used for measuring length, such as inseams and sleeves of garments. Using these to measure 3-dimensional objects that are curved is best."

[6] X Research source Carpenters rulers used internationally are usually 2 meters long. These are also called \"stick rules\". They are often scaled in both metric units (mm, cm and m) and foot and inch measures.. Typically, the inch segments are made up of 8 inches, and fractions are marked to 1/16 inch."

They are also rolled on a spool in lengths of 100 meters (or 330 feet) and longer. Most measuring tapes have one side for U.S. Customary and one side for metric units, or both on the same side."

For example \"1 inch equals 1 foot\" (1:12 ratio), \"1 mm equals 1 cm\" (1:10) or \"1 cm equals 1 meter\" (1:100). These are used for drawing precisely scaled blueprints and building plans."

[9] X Research source The base unit of measurement in the metric system is the meter. This is close in size, but not exactly, a yard, with one yard being 0.9144 meters. The main units of measurement in the metric system are millimeters and centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, or 1000 millimeters."

This can be a length of wood, string, or cloth, or a line on a sheet of paper. Rulers and yardsticks are better to use on hard flat surfaces. If you are measuring a person for clothing it is best to use a flexible tool like a seamstress' tape. Long distances can be measured using a measuring tape."

[13] X Research source Read the last number on your ruler that is alongside the object. This will indicate the \"whole unit\" length of the object, example: 8 inches. Count the number of fraction marks (dashes) the object you are measuring goes beyond the last whole number. If your ruler is marked in 1/8 inch increments, and you are 5 marks past the last whole unit number, you will be 5/8 inches beyond the 8, and your length will be read \"8 and 5/8 inches'. Simplify fractions if you are able. For example, 4/16 of an inch is the same as 1/4 inch."

[14] X Research source Read the larger hashmarks as centimeters. Go to the nearest centimeter line. That will indicate the \"whole unit\" length. For example, 10 centimeters. In the case of a metric rule marked in centimeters (cm), read the intermediate marks as millimeters (mm). Read how many intermediate marks go past your whole unit measurement to the edge of the object. For example, if you measured an object that was 10cm plus 8mm, your measurement would be 10.8cm."

Slide the zero end of the tape against one wall, or have a helper hold it, then pull out enough tape to reach the opposite wall. Here, you should have two sizes of numbers, the larger for feet (or meters), the smaller, for inches (or centimeters). Read the feet (or meters) first, inches (or cm), then fractions thereof. Example, a distance may read \"12 feet, 5 and 1/2 inches\"."

Lay it down on the surface you are drawing on, and lay your pencil point along the edge of the rule. Use your ruler as a guide for a straight edge. Keep holding the ruler steady to get the straightest line possible."
