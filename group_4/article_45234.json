      "content": "Fog lights on a car cut through hazy weather to increase your visibility. Front fog lights are usually located just under your standard headlights, while rear fog lights are either below or next to your tail lights. When you have reduced visibility due to fog, rain, or any other severe weather, the fog lights cut through the haze to illuminate the road in front of you. The fog lights also help other vehicles see you more easily. [2] X Research source Rear fog lights aren’t standard for every vehicle, so you may not have them."

Look near the headlight controls for the fog light symbol, which has 3 parallel horizontal lines going through a vertical wavy line. If the control is a button, press it down to turn on the fog lights. If the control has a switch or dial, turn it until it points at the fog light symbol. The symbol will also illuminate on your dashboard so you can easily tell if your fog lights are still on. [3] X Research source If the vertical line is to the left of the light symbol, then it turns on the front fog lights. If the wavy line is on the right side of the symbol, then it turns on the rear fog lights."

      "content": "Switch on your fog lights if there’s less than 100 m (110 yd) of visibility. When there’s fog, rain, dust, or any other weather and you struggle to see other cars ahead of you, flip on your fog lights to make the road more visible. Other drivers will also have an easier time seeing you on the road so you’re less likely to get into an accident. [4] X Research source Drive defensively during severe weather and when there’s low visibility. Stay aware of your surroundings and leave more space between you and other vehicles. When you’re stopped in the fog, keep your foot firmly on the brakes to ensure your brake lights are lit up and visible to other traffic."
