      "title": "Pour water onto the part of the pants you want to stretch.",
      "content": "Pour water onto the part of the pants you want to stretch. Using lukewarm water and a gentle detergent is usually the best idea. For example, if your pants are too tight at the waist, pour water on the waistband. If the thighs are too tight, put water on the thighs. You can pour water from a cup or using a spritzer bottle. [1] X Research source You can do this while wearing your pants or with the pants in the sink. The best idea, though, is to let it soak for 30 minutes."

      "title": "Stretch out your pants by hand and put them on.",
      "content": "Stretch out your pants by hand and put them on. With your hands, pull on the parts of the pants that you want to stretch. For example, if you’re trying to stretch the waistband, put one hand on each side and pull it apart. Stretch the wet pants until they are big enough for you to get them on. [2] X Research source Putting on wet pants can be uncomfortable, but it’ll be worth it. Be cautious not to pull too hard as it may damage the fabric."

      "title": "Do some squats and lunges in the pants.",
      "content": "Do some squats and lunges in the pants. Move around in the wet pants to help them stretch out, by doing some stretches, squats, and lunges. Squatting helps make sure that pants are loose enough so that you can sit down comfortably, while lunging will allow you to walk comfortably. [3] X Research source To make it fun, play some music and dance around your room."

      "title": "Wait for the pants to dry while wearing them.",
      "content": "Wait for the pants to dry while wearing them. Depending on the fabric, how humid it is, and the temperature, it could take a few hours or more for them to completely dry. If you want to sit down while your pants are drying, you might want to put down a towel so you don’t get the chair or couch damp. [4] X Research source To make them dry quicker, you can walk around outside in the sunlight, so long as you don’t mind people seeing you in wet pants."

    {
      "title": "Wash your pants in cold water and air dry them in the future.",
      "content": "Wash your pants in cold water and air dry them in the future. Once your pants are stretched out to the right size, don’t shrink them again. The next time you need to wash them, use a cold setting on the washing machine and don’t put the pants in the dryer. Instead, let them air dry. [5] X Research source Air drying your pants will take longer, but it will save you the effort of having to stretch out your pants again."

    {
      "title": "Put on your pants.",
      "content": "Put on your pants. Try lying down while you put them on if you’re having trouble. It’s okay if you can’t button or zip them up, because you’ll be stretching them out. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that it will take some time to stretch out your pants, so if you need something to wear immediately, you should save this project for another time. If you can’t fit into the pants at all, stretch them out with water."

    {
      "title": "Do some squats in your pants.",
      "content": "Do some squats in your pants. This will help loosen up the back of your pants and make it easier to sit down comfortably. Plant your feet on the ground and bend your knees, with your back straight. Come back up and then do it a few more times. [7] X Research source Even though these squats are for stretching your pants, not for exercise, it’s still important to use good form so that you don’t hurt yourself."

      "title": "Fit 2 small objects into your waistband on each side.",
      "content": "Fit 2 small objects into your waistband on each side. Choose two small objects you have lying around, like a stick of deodorant, a bottle of liquid soap or perfume, a hairbrush handle, or even your cell phone. Slide them into your waistband, so that sit between your skin and the pants. They should fit very snugly. [8] X Research source If you can’t squeeze the object in, try finding a smaller one."

    {
      "title": "Take out the objects after 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Take out the objects after 15 minutes. You can do what you would normally do around the house with the objects in your waistband. You could even go outside, but people might give you some odd looks. After about 15 minutes, take out the objects, and enjoy your looser waistband. [9] X Research source"
