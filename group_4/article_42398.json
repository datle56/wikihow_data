This way, you can immediately train and socialize your puppy once you bring him home. If you get your puppy from a good breeder, the breeder might have started socializing your pitbull. This way, your puppy is already exposed to new situations, sounds, people, and animals.

This way, when you notice your puppy engaging in bad behavior, you can immediately redirect his attention. For example, if you notice your puppy running up and jumping on someone, you can quickly command him to \"come.\" He should stop jumping up on the person and come to you instead.

      "content": "Teach your puppy to stop biting. Many puppies will mouth or nip when playing. They need to learn bite inhibition, especially when playing so they know it's never okay to bite. There are several ways you can teach bite inhibition. But, often just saying “ouch” firmly and then stopping puppy play signals to your puppy that biting is not acceptable. [5] X Research source www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/13_6/features/Bite-Inhibition_16232-1.html Instead of letting your puppy play with your hands, offer toys that you can teach your pitbull to release. You can also place your puppy in time out immediately after nipping. This will help him settle down and tell him that biting is inappropriate."

      "content": "Use positive reinforcement. When you're training, never get mad at your pitbull. Animals don't understand punishment and will instead learn to fear you. Puppies will make mistakes when learning new things, so be patient. You should always look for a reason to praise your puppy, even if only for small steps or achievements. For example, give your puppy a treat when he's calm instead of punishing him when he's being hyper."

      "title": "Let your puppy know you're in control.",
      "content": "Let your puppy know you're in control. You may want to make your puppy repeat certain actions or commands, especially if he didn't obey. This signals to your pitbull that he didn't do something correctly and needs to keep trying until he succeeds. Let him rest once he gets close to completing the command. Give your pitbull plenty of chances to follow your commands. Your puppy should get used to you handling his feet, ears, tail, and body. This signals that you're in control and will make it easier to groom your puppy, administer medications, and clip his nails."

      "content": "Microchip and place a collar on your puppy. Get an identifying microchip inserted below your pitbulls skin and put a collar with an identification tag around his neck. These will make it easier to locate your puppy if he gets lost. Pitbulls are good at escaping their yards, so microchipping is important. Consider asking humane societies to microchip, since some offer low-cost microchipping. Make sure your yard is secure, ideally with at least a six foot solid fence. Chain link fences can be climbed and they are not a visual deterrent to other animals or humans bothering your pet."

You'll want to walk him at least twice a day, even as a puppy. Exercise is important to keep him healthy, burn energy, and make him happy and engaged. If you can, let your puppy exercise in an area with lots of space. This gives him the freedom to run around. Playing fetch is a great way to interact with your puppy while he gets some exercise.

During this time, your puppy easily learns and absorbs new information which can make him confident later in life. Give your pitbull treats as a reward for greeting people. You can let others feed your puppy the treats so that he associates people with good things. Treats can also keep your puppy's attention around loud or possibly frightening situations like traffic, skateboards and bicycles."

[16] X Research source www.thedodo.com/community/MarcBekoff/theres-nothing-simple-about-do-768002870.html Once you stop the fighting and the puppies calm down, reward them and let them play again. To easily interrupt fighting, keep both puppies on six-foot leashes. Or, keep blast horns and squirt bottles around to quickly interrupt fighting. If your puppy doesn't often fight with other puppies, you can practice commands. For example, call your puppy to you and reward him when he obeys."
