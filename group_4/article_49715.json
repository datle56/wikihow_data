      "content": "Search for forms or templates. Most government departments and agencies have forms you can use for your statutory declaration. Visit the website of the department or agency that requested the declaration to see if a form is available. [2] X Research source The website of your country's attorney general may also have generic forms that you can use if no specific form is available. However, most agencies have specific forms that are preferred. If you received a written notice requesting a statutory declaration, a form may have been included with that notice."

      "content": "List your full name, address, and occupation. If no forms were available, start your statement by listing your full legal name. On the following lines, provide the address where you live. Then on the next line, state what you do for a living. [3] X Research source If you were able to find a form, there typically will be blanks for you to enter this information. Make sure you enter the same information that is on your government identification. Include other information if there is a blank for it on the form."

      "title": "Open with a statement that you \"do solemnly and sincerely declare.\"",
      "content": "Open with a statement that you \"do solemnly and sincerely declare.\" This statement opens a statutory declaration.

    {
      "title": "State each of the facts you're declaring in separate paragraphs.",
      "content": "State each of the facts you're declaring in separate paragraphs. Most statutory declarations are written in numbered paragraphs. Only include a single fact in each numbered paragraph. Write all statements in first-person format. [5] X Research source For example, the fact that you were asked to send something to someone else would be one fact. Your response would be a second fact in a second paragraph. Only write statements that you personally know to be true, not something you heard from someone else. Stick to the facts that are relevant to the reason you're writing the affidavit."

      "content": "Create a signature block at the end of your declaration. Once you've finished your declaration, you'll need space for both you and the person who witnesses your signature to sign and date the document. Leave at least 4 lines for each signature, as well as a space for the date. [6] X Research source Your signature blocks shouldn't be a separate page. If you're drafting your own document from scratch, insert a page break, if necessary, to ensure that at least one or two lines of your declaration continue over to the page with the signature blocks."

      "content": "Include any documents mentioned in your declaration.

Typically, a justice of the peace, solicitor, or notary public is authorized. In some countries, additional professionals may be authorized. [7] X Research source For example, in Australia, you may also have your statutory declaration witnessed by a police officer, bank manager, medical practitioner, or dentist. [8] X Research source A full list will typically be available on the website of the organization or government agency that requested the statutory declaration. You may have to do some searching locally beyond that to find someone who is authorized to witness your declaration. Keep in mind that you'll typically have to pay a fee to the professional who witnesses your statutory declaration. This fee may be governed by statute, but will likely vary among professionals."

In most countries, your witness must also sign each page. This verifies that you've sworn to each page and that the declaration is complete. [9] X Research source Signing each page prevents pages from later being added that include facts you didn't state or agree to. If you've attached documents to your declaration, you may also have to sign a certificate identifying that document as an \"exhibit\" to your declaration."
