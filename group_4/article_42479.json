      "title": "Open the charge port door on the bottom of the phone or tablet.",
      "content": "Open the charge port door on the bottom of the phone or tablet. Some lifeproof cases will have a charger port that opens at a hinge at the bottom of the phone. Use your fingernail to open the charge port door. [1] X Research source Non-waterproof cases may not have a charge port door. If your phone doesn’t, you can skip this step."

      "title": "Locate the small slot next to the charger port.",
      "content": "Locate the small slot next to the charger port. This is a thin slot about 2 cm thick. It is most likely located on the right side of the charger part when your phone is facing up. This slot is where you can put the case key. That will allow for easy removal. [2] X Research source Some phones may have two slots, one on each side on the bottom."

      "title": "Insert the case key in the slot to separate the case.",
      "content": "Insert the case key in the slot to separate the case. Your lifeproof phone case came with a small thin piece of plastic used to separate the front and back of the case. The slot is located on the bottom right corner. Insert the case key into the slot and twist it to begin separating the case. Then, slide it up the side of the phone to further separate the top and bottom of the case. [3] X Research source Continue to do this very gently until you hear a click. This click indicates the back and front portions of the case have separated. If your phone has two slots, repeat this step on the other slot. If you do not have the case key, you can use any coin to put in the slot."

    {
      "title": "Insert your thumb between the case to completely separate it.",
      "content": "Insert your thumb between the case to completely separate it. Once you have used your case key or coin to separate the case, put your thumb between the gap. Then you can carefully move it around the case until the back is completely removed. [4] X Research source You should hear another click when the other side of the latch opens."

      "title": "Put your phone on a soft surface.",
      "content": "Put your phone on a soft surface. When you remove your phone from the case, it may fall when it pops out. It’s best to play it safe and complete the next steps on a soft area, such as a bed or couch. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply pressure to the front of the case with your thumbs.",
      "content": "Apply pressure to the front of the case with your thumbs. Turn your phone so that the screen is facing up. Use the surface of your thumbs to gently press on the screen. Try to do this in the middle of the case. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the sides of the case up until it clicks.",
      "content": "Pull the sides of the case up until it clicks. While your thumbs are on the screen, use your other fingers to pull the sides of the case up. When you hear a click, that means your phone is separated from the case. At this point, your phone should easily pop out of the case. [7] X Research source"
