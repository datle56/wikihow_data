However, it’s important to be conscious of the family’s culture if you're offering condolences, as white flowers have different meanings in different places, explains floral designer Pilar Zuniga. “If you're familiar with certain cultures, certain colors can represent negative emotion. White can represent death, so some cultures actually don't want white for a funeral service,” says Zuniga. Additionally, in many Asian cultures, white flowers are strongly associated with death and mourning, so it’s considered unlucky to give white flowers to someone for any occasion other than a funeral. In these cultures, it would be considered wrong to send white flowers for a wedding, new birth, or as a “get well soon” gift when someone’s sick, for example."
