      "title": "Check for the hemi-penal bulge.",
      "content": "Check for the hemi-penal bulge. Many species of chameleon exhibit some slight indication of genitalia. This is a small bulge on the underside of the male chameleon, right at the base of the tail. It may not develop until the male chameleon is several months old. Female chameleons will be smooth at the base of the tail."

      "title": "Observe the color.",
      "content": "Observe the color. Chameleon coloration varies widely by species, but it is not unusual for male chameleons to be more brightly colored. In many common species, it is only the male who develops striking coloration. If you buy a baby chameleon, its colors may not have developed. Depending on the species, it may be several months before your chameleon's color comes in. Female chameleons may exhibit fascinating colors when in heat, and startling patterns when gravid, carrying eggs."

      "title": "Check size.",
      "content": "Check size. In most species of chameleon, males tend to be larger. This difference can be inconspicuous or striking, with the male growing to twice the size of the female. Size, however, varies hugely depending on species and care. Some species do have larger females, and others have no size difference at all."

      "title": "Learn your chameleon's species.",
      "content": "Learn your chameleon's species. If you know the species, look up the sex characteristics and determine whether yours is male or female. If you do not yet know the species of chameleon, visit a library or go online and read about the different species. Do an image search and see what species look similar to your chameleon. There are more than 180 types of chameleon classified in the world, but only a few that are common household pets. [1] X Research source Ask the dealer. If you didn't learn the sex or species of your chameleon when you bought it, contact the person you bought it from. This is information relevant to your chameleon's care, and they should provide you with it. If you caught your chameleon in the wild, research the kind of chameleons local to your area. However, know that capturing wild chameleons is ill-advised and may be illegal."

      "content": "Identify the sex of a veiled chameleon. Check for tarsal spurs. The males of this species are born with small bumps on the backs of their hind legs. If your veiled chameleon has no tarsal spur, she is female. Males also begin to exhibit a hemi-penal bulge, or small lump at the base of the tail, when they are several months old. If you have several veiled chameleons, you may notice a contrast in the sizes and coloration of different sexes. Male chameleons have a bigger casque, are larger, and are more brightly colored than females. The \"casque,\" or spur on the head, can grow to an excess of 3 inches in male chameleons."
