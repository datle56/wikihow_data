      "content": "Wrap your pashmina loosely around your neck. Unfold your scarf so that all of the material is exposed. Then, wrap the scarf around your neck once. Tighten the loop around your neck, or leave it loose and hanging near your bust. You can choose to have the tails hanging in either the front or around your back. Make this a casual and trendy outfit by pairing it with a fitted t-shirt and jeans. [1] X Research source You can also fold the pashmina in half or thirds longways if you want it to be narrower.

      "title": "Tie a knot in your pashmina.",
      "content": "Tie a knot in your pashmina. Wrap the scarf around your neck so that both the tail ends are hanging in the front. Then, simply tie a knot like you would to tie your shoes. You can tighten this knot to sit at the base of your throat or you can leave it looser for a more relaxed look. Knotting your pashmina during the winter will keep your neck especially warm. You can also try a more complicated knot such as a hacking, twisted, or chain link knot."

      "content": "Create a faux-infinity scarf with your pashmina. Tie the two ends of your pashmina together to create a loop. If your pashmina has fringe, use a few pieces of fringe to make a double knot. If not, use the corners of the rectangle to tie two knots at the two places where the corners meet. Then, place this large loop around your neck so that the knots rest on the back of your neck. Double the loop around to create a large circular scarf with no ends hanging down."

      "title": "Make your pashmina resemble a neck tie.",
      "content": "Make your pashmina resemble a neck tie. Wrap the scarf around your neck so that the two tails are in the front, with the right tail hanging a little longer than the left tail. Take the right tail and wrap it over and around the left tail, so that it is back on the right side. Wrap it again over and under the left tail, but when you get to the underside, pull it up through the loop, around your neck, and down through the smaller loop you just made on the left tail. For a fun, trendy look, pick a vibrantly colored or patterned pashmina to wear like this. Pair it with an asymmetrical skirt or a pair of high-waisted jeans. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Tie your pashmina into a bow.",
      "content": "Tie your pashmina into a bow. Wrap your scarf around your neck and tie it in a loose knot similarly to how you tie your shoelaces. Create two half-loops or “bunny ears” out of the tails of the scarf. Cross these to form an “x,” and then wrap one under and between the two loops. You should be left with a large bow, which you can twist and adjust to your liking. Wear a pair of matching chandelier earrings to create a graceful, elegant outfit."

      "title": "Use your pashmina to create a loose head scarf.",
      "content": "Use your pashmina to create a loose head scarf. Place the middle of the pashmina horizontally flat across the top of your head. Either knot the tails at the nape of your neck or just make an “x” with them. Either way, the tails of the pashmina should drape over your shoulders and fall forward onto your chest.

      "title": "Tie your hair back with your pashmina.",
      "content": "Tie your hair back with your pashmina. Fold your scarf up so that the fabric is a bit thicker and not very wide. Wrap the scarf along your hairline above your forehead and let the ends hang down your back. Then tie the scarf in a double-knot at the nape of your neck so that it will not slide off. Leave the ends trailing down your back, or sweep them forward over your shoulder to hang down your front."

Wrap it around your back and around your shoulders, so that the ends hang loosely between your arms and your sides. [6] X Expert Source Paul Julch, MA Personal Wardrobe Stylist & Speaker Expert Interview. 16 November 2021. If you want to secure the scarf, tuck the ends back behind you under your armpits and tie it in a double knot or pin it together in the front with a stylish broach.

With each hand, pick up the two corners of this triangle you’ve formed that have the smallest angles. Wrap the pashmina around your waist and tie the corners together a couple inches above your right or left hip bone. If your pashmina sarong is patterned, the clothing that you wear underneath should be solid. [9] X Research source You can also wear your pashmina tied this way over the top of a dress, leggings, or a fitted pair of pants. [10] X Research source"

Leave the ends hanging loose, or wrap it around your waist again and tuck the ends back into the loop. Try out some of the knots used to secure pashminas around the neck as a scarf, but instead secure it around your waist as a belt. [11] X Research source"

Then, hold one end flat to your side and wrap the other around your body 1-2 times until the end meets the first end you are holding to your side. Tie the two together with a double-knot or safety pin them for security."
