      "content": "Fill handheld propane or butane torches with disposable fuel canisters. A handheld torch will have a refill port at the bottom. Flip the torch upside down and insert the nozzle of the gas canister into the port. Press and hold the canister directly on top of the torch for a few seconds before removing it from the port. It only takes a short time to refill a handheld torch, so be sure to remove the gas canister before any gas leaks out. You may hear a hissing sound as you insert the nozzle, but should not hear gas escaping once you have removed the canister. Always use the appropriate gas for your type of blowtorch. Using the wrong gas can cause an explosion!"

      "title": "Connect the gas and oxygen canisters if necessary.",
      "content": "Connect the gas and oxygen canisters if necessary. Propane, MAPP gas and acetylene are often used with oxygen tanks to help the gas burn at a higher temperature and concentrate the flame. Attach a regulator, flashback arrestor, and hose to each tank (in that order) by hand-screwing the connections and then tightening them with a wrench. Make sure the connections are tight and there is no damage or cross-threading, as this may allow flammable gas to escape. Finally, attach your nozzle and ignition to the end of the hose. [1] X Research source If you have both a gas and an oxygen cylinder, use the corresponding tubing and regulator for each, and never mix and match! Check the cylinders for gas leaks and damage before you set up your system. If the cylinder seems damaged or you smell gas, call your dealer for immediate pickup."

      "title": "Turn on your blowtorch by opening the gas valve and lighting the nozzle.",
      "content": "Turn on your blowtorch by opening the gas valve and lighting the nozzle. Open the valve on your gas cylinder just enough to release a small but steady flow of gas. Facing the torch away from your body, click the igniter or light the gas with a sparker. The flame should turn on and blow at a constant rate without sputtering. [2] X Research source Keep your torch fully upright while it’s burning! Don’t turn your gas valve more than a quarter turn to light the torch, as you can release too much gas in the air and create a fire plume."

      "content": "Use the valve to adjust the flame a gap between the flame and the tip. You can create different flame sizes by turning the torch valve. Opening or turning the valve counterclockwise will create a larger flame, while closing or turning the valve clockwise will give you a small flame. No matter the size of your flame, make sure that it looks like it’s still touching the tip of the torch, otherwise, the torch is emitting too much gas. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn off the torch by closing the gas valve completely.",
      "content": "Turn off the torch by closing the gas valve completely. When you want to turn off your torch, close it at the source of the fuel first (the valve of the gas tank). Once the gas valve is completely closed, your torch flame will reduce. Open the valve all the way on the torch to burn off any remaining gas in the tube system. Once the flame is out, the torch will then be safe to dismantle. [4] X Research source Don’t forget that the torch tip will still be extremely hot even after the flame has gone out! Dismantle your torch immediately after you have finished using it."

      "content": "Choose a butane torch for smaller indoor projects requiring low heat. Butane torches are the smallest type of blowtorch and are also known as micro torches or crème brûlée torches. Micro torches can be set up easily as they simply require the torch and a compatible fuel canister to fill it. Butane does not burn at temperatures hot enough for metal-cutting, hard soldering, or welding. [5] X Research source You can add a pencil tip for precision when soldering small items. Because of its low toxicity, a butane torch can be used and stored safely indoors with proper ventilation."

      "content": "Opt for propane for soldering pipes and general DIY projects. Propane is the most common fuel for household blowtorches, as it is versatile and burns hotter than butane. Typically, a handheld propane blowtorch is the right tool for soldering copper pipes and removing or adding sealant, as well as various other DIY projects. Propane is also cheap and can be purchased in tanks. [6] X Research source You can use a propane and oxygen setup to create a very hot flame. Propane torches can also come in handheld varieties."

      "content": "Use MAPP gas or acetylene for projects that require high temperatures. MAPP gas, or the combination of liquefied petroleum and methylacetylene-propadine, is the gas to use when you need a hot but precise flame, as it burns at a higher temperature than propane and butane. Acetylene can also be used for high-temperature projects such as cutting and welding but is less popular due to its explosive nature and dirty emissions. You may need a certification to use MAPP gas due to its high temperature. Acetylene is used with a gas tank and a separate oxygen tank. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Strip paint with a propane blowtorch. You can use heat to strip paint by melting it off a surface. Hold the flame over the paint until it starts to bubble and melt, then scrape it off the surface with a paint scraper. Be sure to keep the flame far enough that it doesn’t scorch and discolor the material underneath. This is especially important with wood. If the paint is thirty years or older, don’t use a blowtorch to remove it! It may contain lead and will create toxic fumes when burned."

      "content": "Turn on the blowtorch facing away from the food and adjust the flame. Aiming a blowtorch at anything before you ignite it can be dangerous, and lighting a blowtorch onto food is a recipe for disaster. Torched food can develop a “torch taste” of unpleasant fuel if the fuel leaks without burning. You can avoid this by turning the fuel on until you hear a hissing sound, lighting the ignition, and adjusting the flame until it is blue. [14] X Research source Make sure the torch nozzle is clear of any food particles before you ignite it as this can damage your torch and is a fire hazard."

      "content": "Use a sweeping motion to scorch the food. Slowly and carefully sweep the blue flame across the food without holding it in place for too long. The important thing to remember is that the torch alone may not cook your food all the way, and lingering over one area for too long can burn it. Some recipes, such as torching steak, will require a slower sweep. Others, such as toasting marshmallows, require very brief contact with the heat. [15] X Research source Do not torch the food in circular motions as this will cause the food to cook unevenly. Use broad strokes over the entire surface. You may not need to use the sweeping motion if you are blistering vegetables or removing pepper skins."

      "content": "Use propane for small jobs and a high-heat torch for large metal pieces. When it comes to soldering metals, the right torch makes a big difference. A propane torch is suitable for most soft-solder jobs where the solder “sweats” or liquifies and connects the metals. You will need a MAPP gas torch or oxy-acetylene torch system to hard solder metals and for larger soldering projects. [17] X Research source Hard soldering is similar to welding, as the metal pieces melt and are fused to the solder. Soft solder melts to join metals, but the metals themselves do not melt. Some MAPP gas torches may require certification for you to use them, and there are laws that will restrict you from using and storing oxy-acetylene torches in apartments."

      "content": "Use a MAPP gas or acetylene torch for silver soldering and fusing. Silver soldering is also known as hard soldering or brazing when it applies to jewelry. The solder melts at a much higher temperature than soft solder, and the bond that is formed is stronger. Fusing is a term for welding jewelry by melting and joining the actual metal pieces, sometimes with a solder made of the same metal. Both of these processes require high-heat torches. Silver, gold, brass, and bronze can all be joined with a hard solder. You may need to have specific certifications to use MAPP gas torches, so check to be sure you can use one. Hard soldering and fusing require some expertise. When using a high-heat torch such as MAPP gas or acetylene, take extra precautions to protect your body from the flame or molten metal drops!"

It will also protect the jewelry pieces from being scorched by the flame, an effect called firescale. Use a flux designed for jewelry, as it will contain different chemicals than an electrical flux. Make sure your jewelry pieces are flush against each other so that the solder can flow into the seam. [27] X Research source Firescale is an undesirable oxidation effect that can appear on metal when it’s scorched, and a thicker coating of flux can help to prevent it."
