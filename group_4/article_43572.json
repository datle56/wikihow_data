      "content": "Make an appointment for a glucose screening test in the morning. In this test, you have to fast for six hours beforehand – in other words, don't eat breakfast before your appointment and just fast while you're asleep. That way, you can avoid being hungry. Don't eat anything after around midnight if your test is early the next morning. This ensures that your sample will be true to your natural blood sugar levels and no food or drink will elicit abnormal results."

      "title": "Keep to a healthy, balanced diet in the days before the test.",
      "content": "Keep to a healthy, balanced diet in the days before the test. Make sure you get a good, balanced, healthy diet for the few days before the test to make sure your blood sugar levels are looking good. In other words, avoid excessive sugar and simple carbs. That means no cookies, cakes, chocolate, candy, or sweet breads. Drink plenty of water, too. The more water you drink, the easier it will be for the technician to draw your blood. It will lead to fewer pricks and therefore less pain."

      "title": "Visit your doctor for a screening test.",
      "content": "Visit your doctor for a screening test. The testing of gestational diabetes can be done using a screening test for glucose at your first prenatal visit and if you're between 24 and 28 weeks. [1] X Research source Beckmann, C. R. B., &amp; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. (2010). Obstetrics and gynecology. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. It's the first of the two tests you may be required to take. The glucose screening test is not a definitive test for gestational diabetes, rather it is a tool designed to determine whether or not you, the expectant mother, have abnormal blood sugar levels requiring several tests to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. If the result is too high, the physician will request for further diagnostic work-up – the glucose tolerance test, which we'll discuss in the next section. Wear a short-sleeved top, like a t-shirt or blouse. This makes it easier to have blood drawn by the laboratory technician."

      "content": "To start the test, take 50 grams (1.8 oz) of glucose mixed with water. This test is done to measure the processing of sugar by your body. You will be given a solution of sugar where 50 grams of glucose is mixed with water and instructed to drink the solution in five minutes. This glucose mixture usually comes in different flavors that include lime, orange or cola; you will be given your preferred flavor."

      "title": "Get a blood sample taken.",
      "content": "Get a blood sample taken. A blood sample will be taken from your arm and measured for blood sugar levels. That's it! Then you can go home – you'll be told when to come back in for your results. In case you vomit after taking the solution (not unheard of), you will be encouraged to go home and come back on another day for a repeat of the test. Most people usually feel sick after taking the solution and this is because of the sugar that is contained in the solution. Rest for an hour so that the sugar can be allowed into your bloodstream. Read a book or magazine to pass the time. Then you can go about your day as normal."

    {
      "title": "Wait for your results.",
      "content": "Wait for your results. Usually the analysis of the blood takes approximately 2-3 days. Your doctor will likely only call you if the results are normal; if they are abnormal (which doesn't necessarily mean gestational diabetes), you'll likely be called in. When the level of sugar is between 140-200 mg/dl, you will have to take a glucose tolerance test to pinpoint the issue. [1] X Research source Beckmann, C. R. B., &amp; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. (2010). Obstetrics and gynecology. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins."

      "title": "Schedule your appointment in the morning.",
      "content": "Schedule your appointment in the morning. To avoid being hungry, just like in the screening test, schedule your appointment for the morning. This way, you can avoid actually fasting and get the fast over with in your sleep. When you schedule your appointment, discuss what medication you are on. This can help your doctor know how to move forward; he or she may have specific instructions you need to follow to ensure the test works. This is especially important for those on hypertensive and antiretroviral drugs."

      "title": "Avoid eating the day of the test.",
      "content": "Avoid eating the day of the test. You may take a late dinner the day before the test is done, but you should only drink water the day of the test. This is why scheduling the test early in the morning is best. This is a necessary step to take – if you do eat the day of the test, you will have abnormal sugar levels that could lead your doctor to the wrong conclusions. If you accidentally eat, you'll have to reschedule your appointment."

      "title": "Go prepared with a book and a snack.",
      "content": "Go prepared with a book and a snack. It's a good idea to carry a snack to eat for when the procedure is finished. Some people feel a little dizzy or fatigued after giving blood and having a snack handy will get your metabolism back in no time. Try not to bring something too sugary, as you've just ingested glucose. Bring some carrots, cheese, or plain granola to munch on. You'll want something to do, like a book to read, too – you'll be at the doctor's office for at least three hours. To fight the boredom, make sure you come prepared."

      "title": "Get three blood samples taken.",
      "content": "Get three blood samples taken. In this test, you'll have to give a blood sample once every hour for three hours. Your blood will be taken once initially upon \"fasting,\" and then you'll receive another glucose solution to take. Then, two more blood samples will be taken to see how your blood responds over time. Sugar is absorbed by the body very fast. The test shows how the glucose metabolism takes place in the body and how quickly it responds. The laboratory technician should alternate the arms to reduce pain and inflammation on one arm."

      "content": "Get your results. When one of the results is abnormal, you'll be advised to see your doctor later in the pregnancy for the test to be repeated. In the case where two of the readings are abnormal, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is done. You'll be given medicines to help control your blood sugar levels. In the case where the fasting glucose level is 95mg/dl or above the reading is considered abnormal. When the level of sugar is above 180mg/dl after 1 hour, the reading is considered abnormal. When the blood sugar is above 155mg/ dl after 2 hours, the reading is abnormal. When the blood sugar is above 140mg/dl after 3 hours, the reading is abnormal."

      "title": "If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, go for regular checkups.",
      "content": "If you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, go for regular checkups. This is very important especially in the last stages of the pregnancy. The doctor will monitor your blood sugar levels to ensure that they are within a normal range and may adjust the medicines you're taking depending on the results. The doctor will also monitor the progress of the baby to ensure that it is growing well. The risks that are associated with gestational diabetes include giving birth to a very big baby. These babies are at risk of injuries during delivery and they may develop diabetes later as they grow up. Because of this, it's incredibly important to go for regular checkups. Most mothers who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes do not present with any symptoms and that is why it is important to test. The early diagnosis of gestational diabetes will help in control of blood sugar throughout the pregnancy and therefore help to prevent complications of the disease."

      "content": "Keep your nutrition levels balanced. Your dietician (or doctor) will compute your daily caloric requirement based on your height, weight and level of activity. The diabetic diet should have balanced proportions of protein, fats and carbohydrates to ensure that your body gets the proper amount of vitamins, minerals and calories to sustain daily routine activities and keep your baby healthy. The recommended dietary protein requirement is around 100 to 150 grams (4 to 5 oz) a day. Otherwise, don’t take more than 20 percent of calories from protein if you have kidney problem other than gestational diabetes. Choose lean meat, skinless chicken, fish and low-fat milk and dairy products. To get sufficient amount of carbohydrates per day, include 5 to 6 servings of fruits or vegetables every day. Legumes, brown rice, oats and barley are good sources of carbohydrates."

      "content": "Eat regular, healthy meals. To keep your blood sugar levels normal, it’s important to eat complete meals. Do not skip meals and snack between (with healthy snacks) when possible. This will help keep your blood sugar in the right place and help you maintain a healthy weight. Avoid foods very high in sugar like candies, cookies, cakes and soft drinks. These do the opposite to your blood sugar – it will spike and be difficult for your body to handle."

      "content": "Take anti-diabetes medication, if necessary. In cases where diet and exercise is not enough, your physician will likely prescribe anti-diabetes medications. Possible medicines are metformin and glibenclamide tablets or insulin injections. Pregnant women reaching above their blood sugar goals on oral medicine should be given insulin shots. Metformin is given in titrated (controlled) doses. First it is given at 500 mg ½ tablet orally once a day for 7 days. Then, 500mg 1 tablet orally once a day for another 7 days, and then a 500 mg tablet orally twice a day. The initial dose of glibenclamide is 2.5 to 5.0 mg per day then eventually adjusted to 2.5 mg once a day to 7.5 mg twice a day. Doctors will consider medicine titration more quickly if the patient does not experience gastrointestinal issues."

In addition, regular blood tests may be required as part of the pre-natal schedule. Your doctor will likely request for another blood sugar test 6 to 12 weeks after delivery to ensure that blood sugar levels have returned to normal."
