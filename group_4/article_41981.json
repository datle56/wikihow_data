      "content": "Wear a helmet and thick clothing to protect you from injury. Driving a go kart is typically a safe activity, but you may accidentally crash. To reduce your risk of getting injured, always put on your helmet before you drive the go kart. Additionally, wear thicker clothing, like long sleeves and pants. This will help you avoid getting bumps and scrapes. If you're renting a go kart at a commercial track, they'll typically lend you a helmet to protect your head."

      "title": "Sit comfortably with your back against the seat.",
      "content": "Sit comfortably with your back against the seat. Adjust yourself in the seat until you feel like you can comfortably hold the steering wheel and reach the pedals. Press your back against the seat rest and buckle your seat belt. This will keep you securely in the seat. [1] X Research source If you're a child, ask an adult to make sure you're not sliding around in the seat. This will help you stay safe as you're driving the kart."

      "title": "Hold the steering wheel in the same position on each side.",
      "content": "Hold the steering wheel in the same position on each side. You need to hold the steering wheel with both hands because most go karts don’t have power steering, which makes it hard to turn a kart with one hand. The best way to control the kart is to grip the steering wheel in the same spot on each side. Mirror your grip on each side so you can drive the cart safely. [2] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source The ideal grips for driving a go kart are the same as the grip you might use to drive a car. For instance, think of the steering wheel as a clock face and grip the steering wheel at “2 and 10” or “3 and 9.”"

      "title": "Press the accelerator pedal on the right side to make the kart go.",
      "content": "Press the accelerator pedal on the right side to make the kart go. When it’s time to go, push down on the accelerator pedal that’s on the right side of your go kart. Don’t slam down on the pedal, however. Instead, slowly press down to gradually increase your speed. Push down more to increase your speed or let up to decrease your speed without having to brake. [3] X Research source The accelerator may be colored green to help you remember it’s to go. If you’re driving a model that has the pedals next to each other, use the same foot to press either the accelerator or the brake. This makes it harder for you to accidentally press both at the same time."

    {
      "title": "Use the brake pedal on the left side to stop the go kart.",
      "content": "Use the brake pedal on the left side to stop the go kart. When you’re ready to stop the go kart, push down on the brake with your left foot. Press lightly to slow down, or push the brake all the way down to come to a complete stop. [4] X Research source The brake pedal might be red to signal that it’s to stop."

    {
      "title": "Push either the accelerator or the brake, but not both at the same time.",
      "content": "Push either the accelerator or the brake, but not both at the same time. Pushing both pedals at the same time will make the go kart drive erratically and make a weird noise. Additionally, some go kart models will shut down if you push the pedals at the same time. Be careful that you don’t push down on both pedals. [5] X Research source Most go kart models have the pedals split on either side of the go kart, so you’ll likely have to use your right foot for the accelerator pedal and your left foot for the brake."

      "title": "Enter turns slowly and exit them going fast.",
      "content": "Enter turns slowly and exit them going fast. Going through turns is the trickiest part of driving a go kart. Not only can turns slow you down, they can also cause you to spin out if you go into them too fast. Gently press your brake pedal as you approach a turn while you’re still on the straight. Turn the wheel of the go kart in the direction you want to turn. Then, press the accelerator as you come out of the loop to speed back up. [6] X Research source Try to gain distance on the straights, not the curves."

      "title": "Watch the track ahead of you so you don’t have to slow down.",
      "content": "Watch the track ahead of you so you don’t have to slow down. Braking suddenly, accelerating quickly, and navigating around other cars all cost you speed. Being aware of the track can help you plan your moves so you can keep your momentum going. Keep your eyes on the track ahead of you so you can adjust your speed as needed and plan the best route down the track. For instance, you might need to suddenly hit the brakes if you drive up on a packed track. Once you pass the other cars, you might hit your accelerator. This slows you down. Instead, you might see that there’s a traffic jam up ahead and slow down slightly. Then, you might loop around the other cars and return to your previous speed."

    {
      "title": "Stay on a straight path so you can maintain your speed.",
      "content": "Stay on a straight path so you can maintain your speed. A straight path means that you aren’t weaving in and out of the other cars. You can maintain your highest speed when you’re going straight, so pick the lane that’s most empty. It’s okay to change lanes as you go around the track, but do your best to stay on the same path. This means it may be faster to drive in the outer lane sometimes, even though it’s a greater distance."

      "title": "Increase your speed on each lap to slowly build your speed.",
      "content": "Increase your speed on each lap to slowly build your speed. You might be tempted to slam on the accelerator as soon as you get the signal to go, but this usually slows down your time. Instead, accelerate gradually as you enter your first lap. Then, increase your speed with each lap to build and sustain your momentum. This helps you approach the finish line strong. Your go kart won’t hit its highest speeds when you rev the engine. It’s better to gradually build speed. This also helps you slowly pass the other karts instead of having to constantly brake and accelerate as you all start the race."

      "title": "Be careful that you don’t hit curbs, barriers, or other go karts.",
      "content": "Be careful that you don’t hit curbs, barriers, or other go karts. While many go karts have a wide rubber bumper to protect you, bumping into objects slows you down. Keep a distance from curbs and barriers so you don’t scrape or slam against them. Additionally, don’t get too close to other karts, as you might accidentally crash into them. [7] X Research source Some people like to give slower carts that are blocking the track a gentle bump to encourage them to move out of the way. However, this will slow you down. It’s better to just go around them if you can."

      "title": "Go wide on the corners, then cut in toward the inside of the track.",
      "content": "Go wide on the corners, then cut in toward the inside of the track. To take the corners faster, move to the outer lane of the track just before you get to the corner. Then, cross the corner in a straight line from outer corner to outer corner, cutting close to the inside of the track as you pass the curve. [8] X Research source If you dart from outer corner to outer corner, you'll be able to drive across the curve in a straighter line compared to if you hug the curve. You'll still need to turn your go kart, but the angle of the turn won't be as sharp, which allows you to better maintain your speed."

      "content": "Practice go-karting to help you improve your driving. Like with any skill, you’ll get better at driving a go kart with practice. Drive the go kart as often as you can so you can work on your technique and build new skills. Over time, you’ll become a successful go kart driver! Don’t feel bad if you’re not good at driving the go kart when you first get started. This is normal! You’ll get better if you keep doing it."

      "title": "Time your runs so you can track your progress.",
      "content": "Time your runs so you can track your progress. Use a timer to track how long it takes you to complete each lap or to finish a track. Write down your times so you can track your progress. This will help you see how well you’re improving when it comes to your speed. Your laps should steadily get faster as you gain experience. You’ll likely notice that your laps get slower when you first drive on a new track."

      "title": "Learn the track to improve your speeds.",
      "content": "Learn the track to improve your speeds. If you’re racing on a track, familiarizing yourself with the track and its turns may help you drive it better. In addition to practicing on the track, study it from overhead and ask the facility if you can have a map of the track. This may help you become a better driver. [9] X Research source If you’re going to be participating in a race, check out the track ahead of time. If you can’t go in person, ask the race organizer to send a map of the route or pictures of the route."
