      "content": "A slight jiggle in the center The jiggle test is a must when making custard pies like a pecan pie. Pull it out of the oven and give it a gentle shake. If the pie is done, the edges of the filling will be stable and the middle will have a slight jiggle or movement to it (like gelatin). [1] X Research source If the filling is slooshes around or is watery, it’s not done baking. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "A knife comes out clean Believe it or not, a pie can be tested just like a cake! The knife test is a sure fire way to determine whether or not your pecan pie is done baking. Simply insert a knife into the center of the pie. Then, pull the knife out. If the knife comes out clean, the pie’s ready. If the knife has soupy filling stuck to it, the pie needs more time to bake. [6] X Research source Bake the pie for another 5 minutes if the knife comes out dirty. Then, try the test again."

      "content": "Yes, you can overcook a pecan pie. As with any dessert, there’s a fine line between perfectly done and overdone. A pecan pie is likely overcooked or has been in the oven too long if the top turns black or the filling starts to crack. [7] X Research source Overbaking your pie can make it sticky or crunchy, causing the filling to become tough, hard, and difficult to eat. [8] X Research source Similarly, a pecan pie can also crack if the pie is cooled too quickly (such as being put in the fridge right after coming out of the oven)."

While it may be tempting to dig right in, cutting into a piping hot pie won’t give you that beautiful slice you’re looking for. Set the pie on the counter at room temperature and wait for the filling to set. [9] X Research source Your pie is ready to eat once it’s cool to the touch. Speed up the cooling process by placing your pie on top of a cooling rack on the counter. This way, air can circulate under the pie pan as well. [10] X Research source"

Once your pie has cooled, it can be left on the counter for up to 2 hours, which is perfect for gatherings or parties. Cover your fully cooled pie with aluminum foil or plastic wrap after the 2 hours expire and refrigerate it for up to 4 days.

Freeze leftover pecan pie in the freezer so you can eat the leftovers whenever you’d like. Simply place individual slices or the whole pie in an airtight container or bag and slide it into your freezer.
