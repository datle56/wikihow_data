      "content": "Martial law allows the government to use the military to restore order. It's a bit hard to say exactly what martial law is, because different leaders in different places at different times have used it to mean different things. Generally, though, martial law is used to describe a situation in which the military takes over civilian government, particularly for law enforcement. [1] X Research source In democratic countries, martial law is typically used as a temporary measure to restore peace and order after a catastrophe (natural or otherwise). The head of government typically has the power to declare martial law. Your government may have laws that lay out the circumstances under which that can happen."

Make sure all documents for everyone in your family are up to date and that you have both physical and digital copies stored in a safe place. Depending on your circumstances, you'll likely need the following: [2] X Research source Driver's license, state, or national ID Military ID Passports Marriage certificates, divorce decrees, and any other court documents that relate to you or anyone in your family Deeds, titles, registrations, and other property documents Any other licenses or identification documents"

Neighborhoods typically come together and help each other naturally, but if you can put the groundwork in place ahead of time, it'll be a lot easier if and when disaster strikes. [3] X Research source With neighbors you know and trust, make inventories of tools, vehicles, and other materials you all potentially have available. You can use these if you run into problems and need help. [4] X Research source You can even make neighborhood evacuation plans, which would be helpful in cases of natural disaster or conflict where the whole area is in danger. For example, you could all carpool to evacuate, decreasing the number of cars on the road."

      "content": "Stockpile essentials, including food and water. \"There's something that we call the rule of threes,\" explains outdoor skills expert Scott Fitterman. \"You can go 3 minutes without air, you can go 3 hours without shelter in a harsh, inclement environment. You can go 3 days without water, and you can go 3 weeks without food.\" This can take some time and money to build, so just add to your stores gradually, maybe a day at a time. Ideally, you want to have enough supplies to live in your home for 2 weeks without going anywhere. [5] X Research source While you only need about 3 days' worth of supplies if you're planning on leaving, you have no way of knowing in advance if you're going to stay or go, so it's best to plan for both. Remember that food isn't as essential because you can survive longer without it. If you don't have a lot of room in your budget for extensive prep, just buy a little extra of things you always buy anyway. Rotate your stores regularly using the \"first in, first out\" rule so you're not unnecessarily wasting food. Survival and outdoors expert Ky Furneaux recommends that you \"carry a water filter, like a LifeStraw, which is lightweight and effective against bacteria and viruses.\" You can also stick it in a go-bag or even in your pocket and take it with you anywhere. As far as tools, \"multi-tools are great for urban environments,\" Furneaux advises, \"where you might need various tools like screwdrivers or saws.\""

You can do that in all sorts of different rooms,\" Thompson notes, \"and it looks good. So much easier to do that.\" \"Lock your doors with deadbolts, put long screws in the doorframe… in the door jambs and the deadbolts,\" advises Thompson. \"You can use deadly force to protect your home in most states against forcible entry,\" he continues, \"and the easiest way to force entry is a broken door jamb.\" As for personal defense, \"in today's day and age, unless you're a convicted felon, there's no reason not to have a firearm,\" Thompson comments."

Besides, it's a good idea to have supplies stored in a secondary location in case your home is invaded. Self-storage facilities might provide a solution, provided it's somewhere that you would be able to access quickly in the event of a prolonged survival situation. [6] X Research source If you have the time and the resources, you might want to build an underground bunker for increased security. But \"if you're putting a lot of work into something like digging out a bunker,\" Wilderness and survival expert Doug Flinders notes, make sure \"you either own the land or it's a very private and well-thought-out spot. Otherwise, you might end up wasting your effort.\" \"Plan for it to take a while,\" Flinders adds. \"Building an above-ground shelter might only take an afternoon, but for a bunker—digging it out, adding a roof, and building support beams—you'll likely need heavier lumber and a few weeks of work at least.\""

      "content": "Develop a family emergency plan and review it regularly. Practicing what you'll do if martial law is declared (or in the event of any emergency) can make all the difference in keeping yourself and your family safe. Drilling your escape plans ensures that when something happens, no one has to think—you just immediately do what you know you need to do. [7] X Research source Practicing your plan regularly also allows you to update it as circumstances change. For example, if you were originally planning to bug out to your grandparents' house, but they moved far away, you would likely want to change your plan. Look up longitude and latitude coordinates for important locations (also available through most GPS apps), such as your home and the homes of family members. If roads are destroyed, addresses will be useless. Keep emergency numbers and the phone numbers, addresses, and coordinates for close friends and family members in a safe place."

Knowing how to do as many basic things as possible with limited power and technology can make all the difference when it comes to surviving under martial law. At a minimum, it's a great idea to know basic first aid , how to sew, and how to read a map . If you anticipate being out in the wilderness, you should also learn how to build a fire and how to build a shelter . [8] X Research source \"People often ask how to prepare for the mental challenges of survival,\" Furneaux relates, \"and my advice is to practice being uncomfortable. Whether it's taking an ice bath or running a little farther than usual, getting comfortable with discomfort helps you stay mentally sharp in tough situations.\" You also want to make sure you're familiar with and know how to use any survival gear or multi-tools you've bought.

[10] X Research source Use a VPN to keep your home WiFi network safe and secure. Set up firewalls and enable encryption on your electronic devices.

In other words, you have as much of a right to defend your home as a king does their castle. Under martial law, this is likely still true when it comes to other civilians, although you probably no longer have the right to keep law enforcement or military out. Regardless, you're still safest if you stay at home as much as possible. [12] X Research source \"Be mindful of your calorie expenditure,\" Flinders advises, noting that \"people often overestimate what they can handle. Sometimes, it's better to stay still and conserve energy.\" Protect your stores as well.

[13] X Research source Try to wear plain, nondescript clothing without any obvious slogans or graphics when you're out—nothing that could be used to easily identify you. Avoid wearing clothes in camouflage or other colors associated with the military, especially if you're in an active conflict situation.

Having a go-bag (also called a bug-out bag) already packed by the door means you won't have to run around the house trying to find the things you need while soldiers are breathing down your neck to hurry up. Make a go-bag for everyone in your home, even kids! [14] X Research source Keep all of your identification and legal documents in a sealed plastic bag along with any prescriptions and prescription medications. While you don't necessarily need to carry several days' worth of food and water, make sure you have portable snacks, such as granola or protein bars, and bottled water or a portable filter . Include basic hygiene items, a flashlight, and a basic first aid kit. The Red Cross has a full list of other items you might include. \"We advise everyone to carry a 10,000 milliamp charger for their phone,\" notes Fitterman, \"because a lot of people, unfortunately, rely on their phone for their map, for their light, for calling 911, for pretty much everything that they do.\" \"So it makes sense to carry a lightweight battery charger,\" Fitterman continues, \"so that when something goes pear-shaped, you're able to recharge it and use those features.\""

Typically, the usual civilian laws are still considered to be in effect—but the military orders are likely to be strict enough that they won't really matter. You'll likely have to substantially adjust your daily routine to accommodate these orders. [15] X Research source For example, the military might set a civilian curfew for 6 p.m., which means you can't run any errands in the evening, meet your friends for a drink after dinner, or pop out for a snack when you've got the late-night munchies. There will likely be orders that control how you travel anywhere, the places you're allowed to go, how many people you can travel with, and what you can carry with you. Expect any online shopping or delivery services to be unreliable at best (or simply unavailable, depending on travel and movement restrictions). Try to get cash and conduct transactions in cash whenever you can. Electronic transactions may not be available and you might not be able to access your bank account easily. If you're working during this period, talk to other employees and organize solutions to your collective problems.

The government will likely encourage people to believe that they shouldn't be worried about the surveillance because as long as they aren't breaking the law they have nothing to hide. [21] X Research source This can be digital as well as physical. For example, the government might start requiring everyone to carry proof of citizenship with them everywhere they go.

At the federal level, martial law has not been declared since Hawaii after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

Those rights are recognized as inalienable —that means you don't lose them. [28] X Research source But during times of martial law, the government will likely restrict your exercise of those rights. For example, the right to assemble is a right recognized in the First Amendment. While you don't lose that right, during martial law, there will likely be orders in effect that prohibit gatherings in public places. Under the Constitution, only Congress has the power to exchange civil courts for military tribunals, and even then only in a state of wartime (after an official Congressional declaration of war). [29] X Research source This means that you retain the power, in theory, to sue the government for violations of your rights during a period of martial law.
