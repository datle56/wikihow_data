    {
      "title": "Test the pen on a hidden portion of fabric.",
      "content": "Test the pen on a hidden portion of fabric. Make sure the fabric of your garment will not react negatively to the solution in a Tide to Go Pen. Before using it on your food or drink stain, test it out on another small area of fabric that is not easily visible on your garment. To use the pen for a test, take the cap off and press the tip of the pen firmly onto the area you want to test on until a small amount of solution comes out. Rub the stain with the pen tip, then wait several minutes until the solution mostly dries on the fabric to determine its effect. The Tide to Go Pen should be safe for use on most garments labeled as a colorfast machine-washable or dry-cleanable item. However, some fabrics may be more susceptible to change colors or other adverse effects, so it’s important to do this test first. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Remove excess residue from the spill.",
      "content": "Remove excess residue from the spill. Gently dab or wipe at a food stain that has any excess matter, like a thick sauce or crumbly food item. Take care not to spread the stain any wider than it already is while doing so. The best way to remove this excess is typically to lay an absorbent paper towel or napkin directly onto the stain, then lift straight up. Or, scoop the excess off with a spoon or knife. Avoid rubbing or swiping at the stain, which could make it spread and worsen. Note that the Tide to Go Pen works best on spills from food and drink, and will not perform as well or at all on stains from materials like blood, grease, ink, and grass. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Depress the tip of the pen to release solution.",
      "content": "Depress the tip of the pen to release solution. Uncap the pen and press the tip onto the area of fabric where your stain is located, until enough solution comes out to cover the area of your stain. A couple of quick presses with the tip is typically sufficient to release enough of the solution. It doesn’t need to be pressed down continuously. Press the tip straight down, rather than at an angle as if you were writing or beginning to rub the stain with the tip. The tip should actually push into the pen, allowing the solution to be released."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the dispersed solution into the stain.",
      "content": "Rub the dispersed solution into the stain. After pressing the tip down to release solution, rub gently with the pen tip across the area of the stain. The microfiber cloth tip helps to absorb and pick up the stain that the solution pulls out. Rub until you see the stain begin to lighten or disappear altogether. Make sure you are getting solution and rubbing with the tip over all areas of the stain. Add more solution if necessary by depressing the tip again. Each part of the stained fabric should be lightly saturated with solution before rubbing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait and reapply as necessary.",
      "content": "Wait and reapply as necessary. Wait several minutes for the fabric to dry to determine the success of the stain removal. Repeat the process of releasing the solution and rubbing with the pen tip if the stain is still very visible. Note that the Tide to Go Pen is formulated for stains that have recently occurred and is used to pretreat a stain quickly before it can be washed. Further laundering is expected. After treating with the Tide to Go Pen, the stain on your garment may still appear slightly discolored, show faint residue from the solution, or have a slight odor. These will all typically be removed with further laundering."

    {
      "title": "Blot the fabric dry when finished.",
      "content": "Blot the fabric dry when finished. Blot away any excess solution once you’ve treated the stain with the Tide to Go Pen. You can also let it air dry until you can take the garment off and clean it further. Use a dry and clean cloth, napkin, or towel to gently blot at the fabric. There may be some visible residue of the solution after it’s dry, which will go away when you wash it later. You should use a damp cloth or napkin to further remove residue of the solution if the treated area of your garment will be exposed to sunlight. This will prevent any lightening that may occur with sun exposure. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Treat the stain further if needed.",
      "content": "Treat the stain further if needed. Use another pretreatment stain remover product at home if you find that the Tide to Go Pen hasn’t effectively removed the stain. Do this as soon as you are able, and before you machine wash or dry clean your garment. Follow any instructions on your individual stain remover product, as they may vary in their application. Consider the type of food or drink that caused the stain when you treat it further at home. A greasy stain may warrant the use of hot water, for example, while a wine stain needs cool water.

      "title": "Wash the item according to the care tag instructions.",
      "content": "Wash the item according to the care tag instructions. Pay attention to the instructions given on care for your specific garment’s fabric and style. Wash by hand, machine, or dry cleaning as instructed. Look for the care tag along a collar, waist, or side seam of any garment. If you no longer have one, look for the fabric content. Most common natural and synthetic fabrics like cotton or polyester can be machine washed. [5] X Research source Delicate fabrics like silk and cashmere, and items with beaded or embroidered detail, usually require hand washing or dry cleaning. Wash a stained garment as soon as possible for a better chance at getting it out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the garment carefully.",
      "content": "Dry the garment carefully. Follow the care instructions for your clothing after washing it, taking care not to apply heat from a dryer or iron until the stain is out. Hang, lay flat, or machine dry as instructed. After washing your garment, check to see if there is a remaining stain. If there is, treat it again with a stain remover and rewash. Don’t put it in a dryer until the stain is out, otherwise the heat will set it in. [6] X Research source You may want to alter the exact drying instructions on your garment’s care tag if you are concerned about a stubborn stain. Hang up or place an item on a towel away from sunlight, which are gentler drying options that won’t set in any existing stain with heat."

      "title": "Get one from a store with laundry supplies.",
      "content": "Get one from a store with laundry supplies. Find Tide to Go Pens in the cleaning supply section with other laundry and clothing care items. Look for a retail store that sells other Tide products to find this item. Tide to Go Pens are typically found in big-box stores, drugstores, and discount stores in North America. A single Tide to Go Pen retails for about $2.99 USD. Packs of three may be $7.99. Prices vary by store and location."

      "content": "Buy the pen online if you can’t find it in stores. Purchase Tide to Go Pens online if you cannot find them in stores or you don’t live in North America, where they are most commonly sold. Check online stores’ shipping policies for international shipping. Check the Amazon.com site specific to your country to see if they carry Tide to Go Pens that can be shipped to you. eBay and the online store for Target may also ship internationally. See their websites for details. Note that a shipping and handling fee will typically be charged when ordering online. These fees are often higher for shipping to countries outside the country of origin."

      "title": "Use your Tide to Go Pen until it runs out of solution.",
      "content": "Use your Tide to Go Pen until it runs out of solution. Continue to use the same Tide to Go Pen for fresh stain removal until it runs out of solution. You can use the standard Tide to Go Pen size of 10 ml (0.338 fl oz.) for about 10-20 uses. [7] X Research source You can store the Tide to Go Pen anywhere at room temperature. Dispose of the product according to your local guidelines for normal landfill trash. [8] X Research source If you have frequent need for on-the-go stain removal, or several locations you want them on hand (like a purse, car, and office), you might consider buying a pack of the pens. They can be found online and in stores in multi-packs, often at a better value than purchasing them individually."
