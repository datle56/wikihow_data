      "content": "Drink water or other clear fluid. Drinking a bit of water after you throw up can ease the discomfort of a sore throat and help you avoid dehydration. The water also helps to get rid of excess stomach acid that can coat your throat when you throw up. If you still have an upset stomach , drink water slowly—don’t chug or take too many sips at once. In some cases, filling the stomach with too much water or drinking too quickly can cause you to vomit again. To start, drink a small sip or two every 15 minutes to soothe your throat pain and gently rehydrate. You can also suck on ice chips if you’d like.
