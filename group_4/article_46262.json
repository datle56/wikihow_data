If you’re wondering about a particular person or event, ask, “Where is my relationship with Alex going?” “Will I be happy if I move away for college?” or “What will happen if I take this promotion at work?” Try more general questions like, “What’s in store for my love life?” “How will the new year unfold?” or “Will I be successful in my career?” It’s okay to ask more than one question, but do a separate card layout for each."

Finally, restack the deck so it’s ready for the reading. [12] X Research source Keep your question in the front of your mind as you shuffle. If you plan on using your cards for yes/no questions, you might not want to think about a specific question while shuffling. Instead, you might think, \"Give me the answers I seek.\""

Here are some example readings for the question, “Should I switch jobs?” 1-Card Reading with the Ace of Spades: Spades can represent obstacles, loss, planning, and intellect, while the ace represents beginnings. This card might mean that changing jobs will require a lot of planning, but it could be a good idea because you see new beginnings in the cards. The loss could represent your old job. 3-Card Reading with the 3 of Clubs + 4 of Diamonds + 5 of Spades: In this spread, the 3 of clubs represents the past and could mean that you had creativity and connection in your job before. The 4 of diamonds represents the present and could mean you have money and stability now. The 5 of spades represents the future and could mean you’d have change, obstacles, and loss.

For example, let’s say the number “8” has always felt lucky for you. When an “8” comes up in your reading, you might interpret it to mean something positive in your future. Similarly, clubs look like clovers, which might remind you of your childhood playing outdoors. You might decide that clovers represent your inner child and spending time in nature. The key is being consistent. If you assign special meanings to your cards, always interpret them that way."

      "content": "Why would you use a deck of playing cards instead of tarot cards? Playing cards are readily accessible. The tarot is a specialized deck that is less common than playing cards. You probably already have a deck somewhere in your home. So, it may be more convenient to use playing cards to do a quick reading rather than having to purchase a tarot deck . Plus, playing cards have been used for divination for hundreds of years! [17] X Research source Even the tarot started out as playing cards. Additionally, some people may not want others to know they are doing a reading. Using playing cards can make it seem like you’re playing a game of solitaire. Playing cards can also seem less intimidating to people who aren’t used to tarot readings."

The main benefit of using playing cards instead of tarot cards is that playing card decks are easier to find and less complicated to read. Tarot cards feature images rich with symbolism that many tarot readers use to add nuance to their readings. They can also be read reversed, which adds even more options for interpretation. [18] X Research source Playing cards are simpler, using colors, suits, and numbers to symbolize their meanings. There are 78 cards in a standard tarot deck, with 22 making up the Major Arcana and 56 in the Minor Arcana . The Minor Arcana corresponds more closely to a deck of playing cards, with 4 suits, pip cards, and court cards. However, a playing card deck only has kings, queens, and knaves (jacks), while the Minor Arcana tarot has kings, queens, knights, and pages."
