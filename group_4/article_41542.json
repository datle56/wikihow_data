      "title": "Put opened coconut milk in a sealed container.",
      "content": "Put opened coconut milk in a sealed container. The sealed container will help keep the milk fresh for much longer than an open container. If you have a milk jug or a soda bottle, wash it out first and pour your opened coconut milk into it. [1] X Research source Screw the lid of the bottle as tightly shut as you can. If you got your coconut milk straight from the coconut, put it in a container and store the container in the fridge as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the sealed container in the fridge for 7 to 10 days.",
      "content": "Place the sealed container in the fridge for 7 to 10 days. Once you've screwed the lid tightly shut, you can put the coconut milk in your fridge. The fridge will keep the previously opened coconut milk fresh for between 7 to 10 days. After this time has passed, the milk will start to go bad. Generally, thinner coconut milk will start to spoil after 7 days or so. Thicker coconut milk can last closer to 10 days."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store unopened containers of coconut milk in the fridge until the expiration date.",
      "content": "Store unopened containers of coconut milk in the fridge until the expiration date. If you just got home from the store and want to refrigerate your coconut milk to save it for later, put it directly in the fridge. Look at the expiration date first so you know what day you have to throw it out by if you don't open it. You can also store it in any cool, dark place in your house, but the fridge is always the better option."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move strong-smelling items in your fridge away from the milk.",
      "content": "Move strong-smelling items in your fridge away from the milk. Coconut milk will take on the flavors of other nearby foods after a few days. Even though your coconut milk is stored in an airtight container, you should still move strong smelling items to protect the milk. [2] X Research source Items with strong smells are cheese, fish, meat, or yogurt."

    {
      "title": "Pour coconut milk in an ice cube tray for easy access to small amounts.",
      "content": "Pour coconut milk in an ice cube tray for easy access to small amounts. This is a very effective method you can use to freeze small amounts of coconut milk. Get an empty ice cube tray and pour the coconut milk onto the tray. Move the tray to the freezer and place the tray on its shelf. [3] X Research source When you want to have a glass of coconut milk, remove the frozen cubes from the tray and add them to a glass. Wait for them to completely melt before drinking the milk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the coconut milk into an airtight container to store a large amount of it.",
      "content": "Put the coconut milk into an airtight container to store a large amount of it. If you haven't used the coconut milk, pour it straight from the container you bought it in to an airtight container. You can use resealable bags, a plastic container, or a soda bottle to store the milk. [4] X Research source Be careful if you use a resealable bag as it's a lot easier to spill the milk with this item."

    {
      "title": "Place the container of coconut milk into the freezer to store it for 6 months.",
      "content": "Place the container of coconut milk into the freezer to store it for 6 months. The freezer will keep the coconut milk fresh. However, freezing the milk can cause a change in its taste and texture. The milk will still be fresh when you take it out of the freezer but it will taste a bit different. [5] X Research source The milk will become more grainy and it will lose a small bit of its taste."

    {
      "title": "Thaw the coconut milk by putting it in your fridge for 4 to 5 days.",
      "content": "Thaw the coconut milk by putting it in your fridge for 4 to 5 days. Defrosting coconut milk takes longer than most people would expect. If you want to cook with your coconut milk, transport it from the freezer to the fridge a few days in advance. Leave it in the same container and place it in the fridge. [6] X Research source Even after 1 day, the coconut milk will probably still be completely frozen. Check the milk everyday to see how quickly it's thawing."

    {
      "title": "Use a microwave to thaw the milk if you're in a hurry.",
      "content": "Use a microwave to thaw the milk if you're in a hurry. Place the container in the microwave and select the \"defrost\" setting. Turn the microwave on for 15 seconds. Once the time is up, take the container out of the microwave, open it, and stir the milk with a fork or spoon. [7] X Research source You might need to repeat this process a few times to completely thaw the milk. Make sure the container you have the coconut milk in is microwave-safe. This will be indicated on the underside of the container. Wavy lines on the underside means the container is safe to use in a microwave."

      "title": "Check the expiration date on the packaging.",
      "content": "Check the expiration date on the packaging. If you haven't opened the coconut milk, you should check the expiration date before you use it. It doesn't matter how long the milk has been in your fridge, you have to throw it out once the expiration date has passed. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use opened coconut milk within a week to 10 days.",
      "content": "Use opened coconut milk within a week to 10 days. After this time has passed, the milk will start to rapidly turn sour. It will also start to lose most of its taste and flavor. If you've only stored your opened coconut milk in the fridge, you will need to throw it out after 10 days at the most. The same goes for milk that you took straight from the coconut. A week to 10 days is how long it'll stay fresh for."

      "title": "Smell the coconut milk to check if it has gone off.",
      "content": "Smell the coconut milk to check if it has gone off. The smell of spoiled coconut milk is probably the most obvious sign that the milk has gone bad. A foul smell emanating from the coconut milk means it has more than likely turned sour. [9] X Research source The milk might also smell a bit like some of the other items in your fridge. This is another key sign that it has spoiled."

    {
      "title": "Check the milk for chunks and/or pink mold.",
      "content": "Check the milk for chunks and/or pink mold. Unspoiled coconut milk looks like any other type of fresh milk. When the coconut milk goes bad, it will be pretty obvious. It's common for pink mold to start to grow on the surface of spoiled coconut milk. [10] X Research source If you notice any change in the color of the milk, it's likely that it has spoiled. Inspect the milk to see if any chunks are developing in it. If there's any chunks, the milk has spoiled."

      "title": "Taste the coconut milk to find out whether or not it's turned bad.",
      "content": "Taste the coconut milk to find out whether or not it's turned bad. If you've smelled and inspected your coconut milk and you still can't tell if it's gone off, it's time to taste it. Take a sip of the milk to test the flavor. If it tastes fine, then it might not have gone off yet. If the milk has lost its sweet flavor, it has spoiled. [11] X Research source If your coconut milk was in a can, it will start to taste stale when it spoils. Don't swallow the milk. Spit it out after you've tasted it."
