    {
      "title": "Get a general idea of the topic you want to write about.",
      "content": "Get a general idea of the topic you want to write about. If you have a great idea already, then build off of that. Have an idea before you write the song; it will make it a lot easier!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Visit your Bible.",
      "content": "Visit your Bible. Look up verses that resonate most with you. Can you see ways in which these will form a great basis for a song? By focusing on a Biblical passage or verse, you will improve the Christian content of the song and strengthen its value. This will keep it grounded in truth."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to your preacher.",
      "content": "Listen to your preacher. You can listen to the sermon your preacher gives Sundays, and write about the topic he or she put forward. Try putting lines he or she emphasizes as the most important lines in your song. He or she may even be willing to help your song by reading what you've produced and make some suggestions."

    {
      "title": "Consider whether you'll follow a theme or introduce a message in the song.",

    {
      "title": "Think about what you're personally going through right now.",
      "content": "Think about what you're personally going through right now. This will help you to connect best with the audience, by writing about how you are feeling. If you're sad write a slow, steady song. If you're happy write a more upbeat song. Every good songwriter has a mixture. And the audience will connect with that, relating it back to their own experiences."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider what genre you wish to make the music.",
      "content": "Consider what genre you wish to make the music. It should be something that works for you, that you enjoy listening to and that you want to share with others. Any kind of music can be turned into a Christian song, with imagination and will."

    {
      "title": "Consider which artists inspire you.",
      "content": "Consider which artists inspire you. They may be Christian-based or secular; it doesn't really matter as you'll be using them for inspiration, not copying exactly."

      "title": "Have a sequence ready.",
      "content": "Have a sequence ready. Having a general order in which to do things can get your brain working."

    {
      "title": "Use the verses to put the song together.",
      "content": "Use the verses to put the song together. Can you create a bunch of mini-songs which can then be strung together to form the whole content of the song?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Shift things around.",
      "content": "Shift things around. If the verses added prevent the song from making good sense, move them around a bit. Shift in new ones and pull other ones out. Go back constantly to your theme or message decided earlier, to make sure the song is fitting well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice the song.",
      "content": "Practice the song. Sing it or play it out loud, at its most basic. Is it coming across in the way you want it to? This process can be lengthy, so don't rush it. Give it plenty of time and focus on what you want the audience to understand from your song and its message."
