      "content": "Feed your dog quality food. Lhasa apsos, like other dogs, usually eat 1-2 times a day, depending on how you want to space out their meals. Choose a dog food that is low in grains and high in protein, as a dog is naturally carnivorous. Follow the suggestions on the food packaging when determining how much food to feed your Lhasa. This suggestion is usually based on the dog's weight and how old they are. Consult with your veterinarian if you have questions about your dog's diet. They should have good suggestions about appropriate amounts to feed your dog and what brands might fit your dog's particular dietary needs best. A high-quality diet is an important factor of your dog living a long and healthy life."

      "content": "Don't overfeed your pet. It can be hard to resist a cute Lhasa face when it is begging for a little treat. However, for the health of the dog, resist giving it too many calories. If you do want to give your dog treats, reserve the treats for training sessions. That way your dog will get the satisfaction of a treat and a new skill at the same time. Giving your dog a small reward or \"bonus\" increases their desire to learn and listen."

      "content": "Brush your dog. Try using a double sided brush, one with separated pins on one side and the other with nice smooth bristles. This will give you several options for different areas of the coat. Also, remember to brush with the direction of hair growth, so that you don't tangle the coat further. Remember to brush your Lhasa at least weekly or its coat can get terribly tangled."

Lhasa apsos are naturally long haired, but can have short hair, often called a \"puppy cut.\" [2] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Either way, they will need to get a cut on a regular basis, unlike short-haired dogs whose fur falls out. Decide which cut you like best and take your Lhasa to a groomer to get the cut. If you like a challenge, you can groom your dog yourself. However, this takes quite a bit of skill so you may want to do some research and have some practice before you decide to do a full grooming yourself. A \"puppy cut\" is easier to care for and cooler for the dog. Consider getting your dog a \"puppy cut\" if you are having a hard time keeping up with brushing or your dog is getting overheated."

Trim your Lhasa's nails down but do not cut the quick of the nail, where the nail is alive, or this will be painful for the dog and it may bleed. Begin cleaning your dog's ears by looking in them for dirt and debris. If you see it, clean it out with a dry, soft cloth. Also look for infections or mites, which should be treated by a veterinarian."

      "content": "Brush your Lhasa's teeth regularly. Like other dogs, a Lhasa apso's teeth should be brushed with dog toothpaste on a regular basis to avoid tooth decay. In fact, brushing your dog's teeth can be a good training exercise and it will help freshen its breath as well. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source To get your dog used to a tooth brushing, you need to introduce the process gradually. Start with some dog toothpaste and let the dog lick it off your finger. Then, the next day, try sticking the toothpaste on your finger in its mouth. Gradually work up to the toothpaste on a doggie toothbrush and putting it onto the dog's teeth. It can take some time to get a dog acclimated to tooth brushing. So, don't worry if your dog has a hard time with it. Just keep trying. Do not use toothpaste made for humans. It can be toxic for dogs. Instead, you should get toothpaste for dogs, which is available online or at your local pet store."

However, if you are consistent and unwilling to give up, your dog will be more likely to learn to follow your commands. Lhasas often are not motivated to listen to humans or follow their directions. Because of this, make sure you have a small treat to use for training, as this will make the dog more likely to pay attention to you."

Just be sure to give it enough attention so that it doesn't get depressed due to loneliness. However, Lhasa apso are usually ok if you leave them at home while you go to work. They do not usually get separation anxiety like some other breeds do."
