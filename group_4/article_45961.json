AliExpress will advertise when one of these “coins for coupons” events is happening, so keep an eye out so you can swap your coins for coupons you can use on your AliExpress purchases. [4] X Research source At the time of writing this article, AliExpress has not hosted one of these events in a long time. It is unclear if this promotion is discontinued or if the website will host more events in the future. In past promotions, AliExpress has only given out a certain number of coupons per hour on a first come, first served basis."

You must have a sufficient balance of coins in order to exchange them for coupons. Here are the two types of coupons you can choose from: [5] X Research source AliExpress coupons have an exchange rate of 100 coins for a $1 coupon and can be applied to all stores and orders within the AliExpress platform. These coupons typically expire after 7 days. Store coupons have an exchange rate of 50 coins for a $1 coupon and can only be used for the specific store the coupon is from. The terms and conditions of these coupons depend on the seller."

However, because coins are only worth one cent, you won’t get much of a discount if you aren’t actively trying to earn them. They also expire, so if you don’t make purchases frequently, you’ll lose your discount. Some people may think it’s worth it to earn coins on AliExpress while others think it’s a waste of time."
