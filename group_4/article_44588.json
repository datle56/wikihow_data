      "content": "Exfoliate your skin once a week. Use a gentle exfoliant such as a body scrub, wash cloth, or dry brush. Manual exfoliation will scrub away dead skin cells, preventing clogged pores and keratin build-up that can lead to KP. Additionally, it stimulates cell renewal. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Use a rough sponge to shower with to help slough off the dead skin. Avoid using a loofah though, as this may be too harsh. Shower with an exfoliating soap. Many are available that contain small beads that work to rub off skin. Use a sugar scrub. You can purchase these at many drugstores and beauty supply stores, or you can make your own. Mix sugar and honey to form a paste and then apply to your dry skin, rubbing in circles. Rinse with warm water afterwards. You can make your own exfoliant with table salt and olive oil. However, be careful not to slip while using it. Avoid anything too abrasive though, as this can cause damage to your skin in the long run."

Be careful with this, however, as it can damage healthy skin if used too much. Always wash your hands directly after applying, and apply only as much as the directions instruct.

      "content": "Use different oils on your skin. Similar to moisturizers and creams, oils work to soften skin and the keratin in it. Try rubbing a little oil once or twice a day on the affected area of your skin. Try using coconut oil. Although this may be found in the cooking section, it has shown to work wonders on softening skin. Use it in the shower for a few minutes, or dab it onto your dry skin before you to go to bed at night. Rubbing pure vitamin E oil on your dry skin can soften it while supplementing your skin with nutrients it may be lacking. Vitamin E has shown to have a strong connection to healthy skin and gives promising results in cases of keratosis pilaris. Sea Buckthorn is a type of plant that is made an oil used for skin ailments. Look for it at a local pharmacy or drugstore, and use it to rub onto your skin 1-2 times daily."

      "content": "Take oatmeal baths. They will smooth and hydrate itchy skin. Do this at least once a week for maximum benefit. Take 1/3 cup oatmeal and blend in a blender until it's a fine powder. Pour into your warm bath as you run the water, to help mix it thoroughly. After your bath the oatmeal powder may be left in tub, especially if you did not blend enough. Don't worry, this isn't difficult to clean (unless you leave it in for days). Oatmeal baths can be bought in stores too if you would rather nix the extra work of blending it yourself."
