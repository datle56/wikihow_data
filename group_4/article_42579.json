      "content": "Start with clean hands and jewelry. This step is particularly important if you are changing your piercing for the first time. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, making sure to scrub them in warm water for at least 20 seconds. Dry with a clean towel. If you're changing your tragus jewelry out for a new piece, make sure to sterilize the new jewelry. Wash it in soap and water, and then dunk it in rubbing alcohol for a minute or two.

      "content": "Pull your hair back. Your hair will get in the way as you try to change your jewelry. It's best to pin it back out of the way to make the process easier on yourself. Of course, if you have short hair, it won't be a problem for you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Expose the jewelry. When you take your jewelry out of the tragus, it helps to pull the skin away so you can get to the piercing. Place your finger directly in front of the tragus, and gently pull the skin forward. That should show more of the jewelry, giving you room to work. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean the area with alcohol to keep it clean. Wipe the piercing and the area around it with rubbing alcohol to keep the area sterile. This will prevent having germs or bacteria left on your skin from causing an infection while you handle the piercing."

      "title": "Wait until the piercing is completely healed.",
      "content": "Wait until the piercing is completely healed. You should never change any piercing out if it's not healed. Drainage and crustiness indicate it hasn't healed. In addition, it will still be painful if it hasn't healed. Don't rush the process, as it could lead to an infected piercing. Healing can take several months with the tragus. Infected piercings, which may have redness, swelling, and extreme drainage (thick pus), should be checked out by doctor. Don't take out your piercing if you suspect an infection."
