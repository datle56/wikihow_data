      "title": "Provide them a place to live.",
      "content": "Provide them a place to live. Depending on your Pokémon and type, they will live in different habitats, Bulbasaur, for example, lives in a grassland but Charmander lives in the mountains, and Pikachu just likes the forest, or a barn. You want your plush to feel at home, right? Regardless of habitat, you will need a big box (cardboard, plastic, anything as long as it's a box that they will fit and where there is at least 6 inches of room for furniture or décor). You can also design a cozy house, or just a bed. The bed must have a mattress, blanket, and pillow. For grassland, you could use ribbon or green string as grass. For the mountains, Styrofoam can serve as snow. Other methods recommended are things like paint and model magic or other air-dry clay that you could spike or create designs in if you want them to live in a house instead of their natural habitat."

      "title": "Know where to keep them.",
      "content": "Know where to keep them. Your Pokémon's type will tell you where to keep them. For fire types (like Fennekin, Typhlosion, and Litten), keep them by a fireplace or a window where the sun shines through. For ice types (like Vanillite), keep them somewhere cool, like next to the sink filled with water, a bucket of water, or a pool. For water types (like Froakie, Oshawott, or Popplio), similar water places are also ideal. For steel types (like Beldum), keep them in a garage or near lots of steel. an electric socket For electric types, (like Pikachu, Pachirisu, Emolga, Electrike, or Dedenne) keep them near an electric socket or near a window so they can see the thunderstorm with lightning. For fighting types (like Hariyama), bug types (like Caterpie or Parasect), take them to the gym now and then. For grass types (like Snivy or Rowlet), they will enjoy being kept near plants For normal or fairy types, that will depend on what they do. Keep Munchlax in the kitchen, or Jigglypuff next to your karaoke system (because Jigglypuff is excellent at singing)."

      "title": "Provide food.",
      "content": "Provide food. Food is a large matter here, whether you choose real food or just play food for dolls and things it won't matter. For real food, let them have dinner with you, only do this when no one is watching. You can also take things like brown Beados on a spoon and feed them Pokémon food. They might enjoy some Poffins with you. Poffins can be sugar cookies, dinner rolls, etc. Rare candy can be bought at stores in the shape of gumballs or chocolate balls, or you can pretend that you found new rare candy that is a gummy bear or some Smarties. Poké Puffs (found as cake balls, cream puffs, or donut holes) and Pokéblocks (as Jolly Rancher candy) are great, too!"

      "title": "Love your Pokémon.",
      "content": "Love your Pokémon. Love all depends on how you treat them and what kind of trainer you want to be. You can be strict like A.J. in the episode of the anime The Path to the Pokémon League or you can choose to be like Ash, he is friends with his Pokémon but does have his requirements, or yet just completely soft, they don't battle, they are low levels except for friendship, and etc."

Swinub loves the Fairly Odd Parents. Treecko loves Go Diego Go. Squirtle and Chinchou love Franklin (you mean the turtle?). Weedle loves Little Bear. Venonat enjoys Bluey. Aipom loves Ni-Hao, Kai-Lan. Pikachu loves to watch the Pokémon series. Pachirisu loves the Wonder Pets. Goomy loves Team Umizoomi. (Hey, that rhymed!) Bulbasaur loves Paw Patrol."

      "title": "Take them everywhere!",
      "content": "Take them everywhere! Only take them to places where you have no doubt you won't have to put them down, or they might get dirty. They can go in the car but leave them in a shady spot in the car when you leave, only if you have to. If you bring them into a store, check that they don't sell that plush there; otherwise someone might report you for stealing it from that store, and don't ever put them down for a second. Try putting them in a backpack with their head poking out, or in a purse, but always check that they are still there in case they fall out. Only bring it to school on show and tell, and only have it out of your backpack when your teacher says so, you don't want them taken away now do you?"

    {
      "title": "Wash them with care.",
      "content": "Wash them with care. If the plush gets dirty, it is best to wash it by hand, as this is kindest to a plush toy (also, check the care tag first in case it says to avoid wetting it). To hand wash, fill a basin with cool water and add a squirt of liquid detergent to the water, swishing around to distribute it evenly. Dip your plush in, then gently rub the water around the fur fabric to clean. Drain the basin, then rinse the plush under cool running water. Use a clean towel to dab dry, then leave in a sunny windowsill or somewhere warm to dry completely. When it's washed, you can wrap the plush in a towel and give it a nice, long hug to remove excess water before sun drying. Machine washing may be okay sometimes but check the label first. If it has fuzz like Cyndaquil's fire, then it is not a good idea to machine wash. Be sure to ask a parent before washing, as they might have a different suggestion."

      "title": "Put them to bed.",
      "content": "Put them to bed. Make sure you have a big box for them to sleep in. Sing to them if they feel like it, or tell them a story. Or, if you have Teddy Ruxpin and a Teddy Ruxpin Lullabies 1 or 2 cassette (or a 2017 version of him with the apo that contains Teddy Ruxpin Lullabies (said sequel is coming soon), let him sing to them for you!"

      "title": "Have fun.",
      "content": "Have fun. Having fun is the most important step. Without it, your Pokémon will neglect you. Bring them to the store as long as you can carry them and don't put them down and forget them. Take them outside to play, use some rope to take them on a walk, have sleepovers every now and then if you prefer to keep your Pokémon in its habitat at night. Read a book, or watch a Pokémon episode all about that Pokémon. If you get a new Pokémon or stuffed animal that you care more about, then still play with the old Pokémon plush now and then, and if you are done with them forever, give them to another loving family or to a friend to watch them from now on."
