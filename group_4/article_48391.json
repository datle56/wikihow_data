If you can do so safely, take pictures of the area surrounding the accident. Include any road signs or traffic signals, plus any obstructions that might have contributed to the accident. [6] X Research source Also, write down the police report number for your insurance claim (if one was issued). Do not put yourself in a dangerous situation while you’re taking pictures—stay out of the road and away from jagged edges or broken glass.

If you’re a driver, Uber’s insurance starts covering you when you tap “GO” on the Uber app to make yourself available for ride requests. But a different tier of coverage kicks in when you’re driving with a passenger, including when you’re on the way to pick them up. [8] X Research source If you cause an accident while waiting for a ride request: Uber’s insurance will pay for medical bills and property damage resulting from an accident that you caused, up to your coverage limits. These limits can vary depending on where you live—in the U.S., they’re usually $50,000 per person for medical bills (up to $100,000 per accident) and $25,000 for property damage. If you cause an accident while on the way to pick up a passenger or on a trip: Uber’s insurance will pay the passenger for any injuries or damage to their property if you cause an accident. In the U.S., the coverage limit is typically $1,000,000 per passenger. If another driver causes the accident: If the other driver doesn’t have enough insurance to cover the damages, Uber’s insurance will cover medical expenses for you and your passengers, up to your coverage limits. If your vehicle is damaged while you’re driving for Uber: Uber will pay for damage to your car up to its actual cash value after you pay your deductible, regardless of who caused the accident. (The deductible can vary but is usually $1,000 or $2,500)."

If the Uber driver caused the collision, you’ll file a claim with Uber’s insurance.
