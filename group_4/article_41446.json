      "title": "Use a proper collar.",
      "content": "Use a proper collar. Be sure that your dog has a comfortable collar that fits properly. The collar shouldn’t be so tight that it is choking the dog, but should be tight enough so that it does not slide up and down the dog’s neck. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You should be able to slide your hand between the dog’s neck and collar when it is secured in place. Many people choose to use a harness instead of a collar. The harness disperses the pressure to the dog's back rather than their neck. This will allow you to train your dog to walk on a leash without having to rely on the choking feeling the dog gets when pulling at their leash."

      "title": "Stop and stand still.",
      "content": "Stop and stand still. Whenever your dog pulls, stop and stand still (be a tree). No matter how hard your dog pulls, don't let them go in the direction they want to go. The reason for this is that if the dog pulls, and you follow them, the dog learns that pulling is a very effective way to get somewhere. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source It might help to attach the leash to your belt loop using a carabiner. This prevents the dog from getting ahead. It's also far easier to stand still with your hips being pulled rather than your arm."

      "title": "Wait for the dog to respond.",
      "content": "Wait for the dog to respond. Wait until the dog does anything that loosens the leash. The dog might stop pulling by leaning back, sitting, or changing direction. As soon as the leash loosens, you can start walking again.

[8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If the dog does not stop upon your command, do not give them a treat.

      "content": "Use a choke collar. When training your dog, try using a slip or choke collar under the supervision of a trained expert. These collars will tighten around the dog’s neck if they pull on the leash, effectively choking them. Using these collars for training will help your dog associate pulling with being choked. While these collars can effective for training a dog, many experts argue that they are dangerous or unnecessary. It is recommended that you never use a choke collar unless under the direct supervision of a licensed animal behaviorist. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source These collars work by using negative reinforcement. Most dog training experts suggest that your dog will respond better to positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement- so keep that in mind when considering using this training tool. These collars are for training only. Never leave this collar on your dog or use it as a substitute for their regular collar. These collars are controversial, so consider the arguments for or against choke collars before trying this method."

      "content": "Try a halti dog harness. These harnesses attach to the dog's collar with a clip and are fastened across the dog's underbelly. It works through attaching your leash to the front chest strap, which means you will gain more control over your dog. When your dog pulls on their leash, they will be guided back towards you, naturally and gently discouraging them from pulling. The leash attachment at the chest prevents putting any pressure on your dog’s throat and neck, which is especially important as this could cause tracheal damage."
