      "title": "Be comfortable with your sexuality.",
      "content": "Be comfortable with your sexuality. It’s one thing to be certain about your sexuality, and another to be comfortable with it. If you are dealing with feelings of guilt, shame, or confusion, it might be a good idea to wait to tell your parents. It’s necessary to accept yourself for who you are before you can expect others to accept you. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and saying \"I am bisexual.\" If that makes you feel confident and happy, great. If it makes you nervous, keep trying until it feels more comfortable. Try coming out to a friend first. This will help you get used to talking about being bisexual. Coming out can take up a lot of emotional energy. Make sure you feel confident in who you are before you decide to have a potentially tough talk."

      "content": "Build your support system. Coming out to anyone can be hard. If you are unsure about how your parents will react, it can feel especially scary. Make sure to have people you can lean on. A support system can help you feel more comfortable having the talk, and can also reassure that you’ll have a shoulder to lean on no matter what. If you are out to another relative, give them a heads up that you are going to talk to your parents. They might have some helpful advice on how to handle the discussion. Consider asking someone in your support system to be there with you for backup and support when you come out to your parents."

      "title": "Write down your motives.",
      "content": "Write down your motives. It’s important to figure out why you want to come out to your parents. A good reason would be because you love them and don’t want to keep secrets from them. You probably don't want to tell them you are bisexual because you’re having an argument and you want to use your sexuality to hurt them. Take a minute to jot down your reasons. They might be “I’m proud of who I am” or “I am ready to live openly”."

      "title": "Pick a time when your parents are calm.",
      "content": "Pick a time when your parents are calm. This conversation has the potential to become tense and emotional. To help ensure that it is constructive, consider what else is going on at home. Are your parents stressed about money? This is probably not a good time for a serious conversation. Did your grandmother recently become ill? It’s probably a good idea to wait until things are a little more stable. If possible, choose a time when the emotional climate at home is pretty calm. You want your parents to be able to focus on you. Try asking if you can talk after dinner. A weekend might also be a good time for this important conversation."

      "content": "Make a safety plan. Pay attention to how your parents seem to view LGBT people. Have you ever heard them make angry comments about bisexuals or bisexuality? If you have any sense that your parents will react very badly, you need to have a safety plan in place. Make sure you have ways to keep yourself safe if the situation turns scary or even violent. If you aren’t sure how your parents view bisexuality, watch some TV shows or movies that feature bisexual situations or people. Ask your parents about their opinions on what you are watching to help gauge their views before you come out. Let a close friend know when you will be having the conversation. If you think it’s necessary, say something like “I’m not sure how this talk will go. Can I stay at your house if I need to?” [2] X Expert Source Lauren Urban, LCSW Licensed Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 3 September 2018.

      "content": "Provide resources. Your parents might be really confused about what being bisexual actually means. For instance, they might wonder if that means you like boys 50% and girls 50%, or if you have a scale. It's important to let them know that it's not a black and white issue. Explain that you are attracted to different people for different reasons. It will be helpful for you to answer their questions. It’s also a good idea for you to help them understand by giving them additional information. Overall LGBT resources will be useful, but you can also ask your local support center to give you some information that helps to explain bisexuality more specifically. Gather some pamphlets from your local LGBT community center. You can also ask for some informational material from your campus LGBT center if you are a student. Provide them with some good websites to check out. They’re more likely to be supportive if they are better informed."
