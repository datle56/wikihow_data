Full-grown dogs usually eat just twice per day. Fresh, clean water should be provided at all times, so your dog can drink whenever it gets thirsty. [1] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Pick out the right kind of food for your dog's size, age, and breed. Different types of dogs have different nutritional needs. Most dog food packages detail how much food should be given daily depending on the size of the dog. Make sure to buy food with high quality ingredients. Dogs have sensitive digestive systems and can become ill if they aren't fed high quality food. Don't feed dogs human food, especially junk food that's high in salt and sugar. A good rule of thumb is to look at the first ingredient on the dog food package. If it is a meat - not cornmeal -- this food will be higher in those essential proteins your dog needs daily. Consult with your veterinarian about how often your puppy or dog should be fed to meet its metabolic needs.

Dogs may be distantly related to wolves, but they're domesticated creatures who enjoy the creature-comforts of home as much as we humans do. Your dog needs a clean, dry, and warm place to sleep at night. Whether your dog sleeps indoors or outside, make sure it has a space that's sheltered from the elements with a regulated temperature. If your dog spends a lot of time outside, it needs a place to take shelter when it rains, snows, or gets too hot or cold. Do not leave your dog outside in inclement weather. Many dogs enjoy sleeping in kennels lined with comfy blankets with a few toys. Others prefer to sleep on a dog bed in their masters' bedroom, or in a special spot somewhere in the house.
