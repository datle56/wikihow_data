      "content": "Develop your business and marketing plans, regardless of whether you are opening your own convenience store or a franchise. Though it may be slightly different for a franchise in that you don't need your own marketing ideas and you have business practices outlined for you, these documents will typically help you secure funding if you need to take out a loan. If you don't have them at all, you may run into difficulty securing the required capital. Create a business plan by listing the name and business structure (sole proprietorship, limited partnership, etc.) of your store. You can then continue by listing the items and services you plan to offer and the estimated startup costs for those items and services.

      "content": "Determine a budget for startup costs. This will largely depend on the cost of real estate in your area and what service and items you plan to offer. The startup costs for a convenience store can range from as low as $10,000 to well over $1 Million, so do your research and consider the costs of business in your area to determine your own budget. [2] X Research source If you are starting a business, you should know the costs. You should understand a variable cost and a fixed cost. Fixed costs do not change every month. For example, the rent, utilities, and payroll. Variable costs change monthly, such as marketing expenses."

      "content": "Secure your location. Location is everything in convenience stores. As the name implies, they should be convenient to get to. Stores off the beaten path may have a stronger local customer base because people don't want to go all the way to the grocery store, while stores near the highway typically get traffic from travelers who are not as familiar with the area. Ideally, a convenience store is highly visible and must have either convenient parking options or a large amount of outside foot traffic like in a transportation terminal, mall, or office complex. [4] X Research source To find the best locations for convenience stores, large corporations use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) reports to map local competition and demographics. These reports are generally too expensive for small business owners. [5] X Research source However, you can get the same information for free from the small business development center (SBDC).

You'll need wholesalers to supply you with the goods you will sell, which include food and drink items, cigarettes, alcohol, paper and household goods, and fuel. You'll have to decide whether or not to use a full-service wholesaler, which may require larger order sizes, or several limited-function wholesalers, which may be more expensive and means additional for you. Both have their pros and cons, so consider the needs of your business before deciding. Another option, especially if you run a small store, is to get your supplies from a price club store, like Costco or Sam's Club. You will be responsible for picking up and shipping the items yourself, but you may save money this way."

Place your higher-priced or easy-to-steal merchandise within view of the clerk and a security camera. Consider who your primary customers will be and adjust your offerings accordingly. For example, if you are in a residential area, it would be beneficial to stock necessities like milk and bread so that locals will not need to go all the way to the grocery store. Alternately, a store surrounded by business will likely need to focus more on providing good coffee and breakfast."
