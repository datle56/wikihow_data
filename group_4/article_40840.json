      "content": "Make time for your daily prayer and devotion. When you find yourself struggling with your faith, you might find it hard to consistently make time to read the Bible and pray. However, keeping a daily devotion will help you feel closer to God, even when times are hard. [2] X Research source Choose a time that works best for you, then stick to it every day. If you're an early bird, you might enjoy starting off your day by studying God's word. If you're more of a night owl, you might prefer ending the day with reflection and prayer. [3] X Expert Source Zachary Rainey Ordained Minister Expert Interview. 19 May 2019. During this time, try to shut out any distractions. If it's possible, find a quiet place away from other people, and turn off your TV and phone so it will be easier to focus. Psalm 119:105 describes how God's word can help guide you: \"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.\""

      "content": "Talk to God about everything that's on your mind. Prayer doesn't have to be a formal speech to God with your hands folded in front of you. You can pray anytime, anywhere—and the more you pray, the more connected you'll feel to God. That can help keep your faith strong no matter what you're going through. [4] X Research source For instance, you might thank God when good things happen, ask Him for wisdom when you face a challenging situation, or pray for comfort when you're feeling sad. If you're really questioning your faith, try saying a prayer like, \"I feel so far away from you right now, God. Please help me feel Your presence in my life.\" It can take a while to get into the habit of praying constantly, so don't beat yourself up if you forget sometimes. Just keep talking to God whenever you think about it—with time, it will become more and more natural. The Bible describes this type of prayerful relationship in Philippians 4:6: \"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.\""

[5] X Expert Source Zachary Rainey Ordained Minister Expert Interview. 19 May 2019. Often, you'll be surprised how relevant your Bible study can be to whatever you're going through. When God's word feels applicable to your own life, it can really help refresh your faith. [6] X Research source There's no right or wrong way to read your Bible—you might start in Genesis and read all the way through, you might read a passage from the Old Testament and one from the New Testament each day, or you might do daily guided readings from a devotional. The important thing is that you spend time studying God's word. If you find yourself questioning your beliefs, try reading stories of Biblical figures who also struggled with their faith, like Moses, Job, Esther, and Noah. [7] X Research source Try meditating on what you read to really dig deeply into what it means for you."

      "title": "Ask for forgiveness when you sin.",
      "content": "Ask for forgiveness when you sin. Sin separates us from God, and that distance can lead to a crisis of faith if you don't address it. However, there's a way back to God—in 1 John 1:9, the Bible says, \"If we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" Pray to God admitting your sins, and ask him to forgive you and help you overcome them. [8] X Research source Everyone sins sometimes—it's human nature! However, part of being a Christian is dedicating yourself to being more and more like Jesus, so it's important to turn away from sin whenever you recognize it in your own life. The Bible instructs us to forgive other people for their sins against us, as well: \"And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.\" -Mark 11:25"

      "content": "Meditate on times you've felt God's presence. When you're feeling especially far away from God, remind yourself of times when you felt close to Him. Try to hold onto that feeling, and pray that God will help you feel His presence again. If you can persevere through the tough times, you'll likely find that your relationship with God is closer than ever when you get on the other side. [9] X Research source For instance, you might think back to when you first became a Christian or a time when you felt that He answered one of your prayers. Even if it seems hard to feel God's presence, the Bible reminds us that He is always there. Matthew 28:20 says, for instance, \"And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\""

[10] X Expert Source Zachary Rainey Ordained Minister Expert Interview. 19 May 2019. When you're going through hard times, read back through the journal, and reflect on how God may have answered those prayers. [11] X Research source You can also write things down in your prayer journal so you'll remember to pray about them later. Having a daily gratitude practice can make it easier to find the good things in life. Every day, write down something that you're grateful for. When you're having a hard time, read through your gratitude list and thank God for the blessings in your life."

      "title": "Allow yourself to ask questions.",
      "content": "Allow yourself to ask questions. It can be hard to have strong faith all the time, especially when you see and hear things that make you wonder if God is even real. Being a good Christian doesn't mean that you're not allowed to question who God is or how He works in your life. However, instead of allowing these questions to pull you away from God, lean on your faith, talk to fellow believers, and read God's word to try to find the answers. [12] X Research source During your time as a Christian, you might hear people say that God doesn't exist, or you might see other Christians acting in a way that makes you feel distant from the church. However, those things don't have to destroy your faith—instead, use them as a reminder that all people need God's love and forgiveness. You might also find yourself wondering why God allows bad things to happen to good people. There might not be any easy answers, but it's important to know that these types of questions are a normal part of faith. The Bible encourages Christians to think critically about the things we hear. 1 John 4:1 says, \"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.\" If you want to reflect on who you are and what you want, think about the last few months.

Many Christians go through times when they don't feel as close to God, especially if something happens to make them question their faith. Take your time to reflect on why you feel distant from God. In addition, think about times you felt very close to Him. Then, try to figure out how to return to that close relationship. [18] X Research source Remember, your faith doesn't necessarily have to look like anybody else's. For instance, you might believe that the stories in the Bible happened exactly as they're described, or you might believe that they're meant as metaphors to guide God's followers."

Join in church activities like Bible studies and fellowship groups to meet other believers in a more informal setting. As your friendships grow, you can even spend time together doing things that aren't church-related, like having a barbecue or grabbing coffee together. [22] X Research source When you're around other people who share your faith, they can help uplift you when you're struggling or hold you accountable if you're drifting away from God. [23] X Research source To meet other believers online, try checking out Christian forums or social media groups. [24] X Research source The Bible encourages this fellowship over and over again, as in Hebrews 10:24-25: \"Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.\""

Helping people in need is a great way to show God's love to others. In turn, this can actually help strengthen your own faith, so look for service opportunities wherever you can. [26] X Research source Check with your church to see if they have any missions you can be apart of, like helping with a food drive for hungry families or taking part in a neighborhood cleanup. Serving others doesn't necessarily have to be a formal thing, either—you might show God's love by being a caring listener when a loved one is having a hard time, for instance.
