[3] X Research source Up to 90% of cases do not show active symptoms. This means you may not even be aware you have it. So it is always best to seek a professional opinion when in doubt. If you suspect you may have amebiasis, your doctor can perform blood tests or stool tests to determine whether or not you have the disease. [4] X Research source"

[6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Complications can include severe and debilitating bowel troubles, as well as extra-intestinal disease, which means that the parasite invaded the lining of your colon and infected other areas of your body. The most common location for extra-intestinal disease is in the liver, which always requires medical treatment, and sometimes surgery as well. If you suspect you have amebiasis, or have been diagnosed with it, it is always best to seek the professional advice of your doctor on how best to proceed with treatment."

Even if you do not have active symptoms of the infection, treatment is helpful both as a means to prevent potential complications and a way to ensure public safety. And of course, anyone with active symptoms is always treated. [7] X Research source Medications for treatment include: paromomycin, iodoquinol, and diloxanide furoate among others. Ask your doctor about these options. Understand that more intense medications are required for an infection that has spread to other parts of the body (such as the liver). In cases that have spread to the liver, metronidazole is the most common medication used. It is an antibiotic, but it works very well against this parasitic infection as well. [8] X Research source"

Appropriate water treatment - always use bottled water, or boil or filter your water prior to drinking to avoid contamination. Safe food choices - avoid raw fruits and vegetables, and try to eat cooked foods or fruits you can peel to avoid contamination. Non-pasteurized milk, cheese and other dairy products should also be avoided. If you do eat raw vegetables, soak them in vinegar for 10-15 minutes prior to eating them. [17] X Research source Street vendor foods, which are common in developing countries and are not evaluated for health practices, should also be avoided. Proper hand washing is also important while abroad and at home."
