      "title": "Bring water bottles.",
      "content": "Bring water bottles. Depending on the length of your trip, you will want to bring at least 2 bottles of water with you. The 16oz. size travels well, since those bottles will fit nicely into a purse or backpack. Make sure your bottles have replaceable lids. The screw-on kind is best. Bring bottles with small-mouthed openings. Bus rides are notoriously bumpy, so if you bring wide-mouthed bottles, you might end up soaked."

      "content": "Don’t forget your iPod! If you are going to be traveling by bus for any length of time, you’re probably going to need some entertainment.

      "content": "Get to work. On your laptop or iPad, make sure to bring along some outlines or rough drafts for memos, reports, or articles that you can work on while on the road. If there's any work you can get done while you're on the bus, it's a great way to pass the time."

      "content": "Download a GPS app. Before you get on board, make sure you’ve downloaded a reliable GPS app. You may not be able to get reliable wifi in some of the areas you’ll be traveling, so having a handy navigation app at the ready will be important. It's also a great way to pass the time as you watch the miles clicking by to your destination. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Move around as much as you can.",
      "content": "Move around as much as you can. It’s hard to move around on bus, especially without annoying those around you! Keep in mind that your spine is designed to move, so sitting in one position for a long time can make your back muscles stiff. Stand up when you can to stretch (every 30 minutes if possible) so you can activate your core muscles. Stretching stimulates blood flow, and blood brings oxygen and nutrients to your back’s soft tissues. Even 10 seconds of standing to stretch is better than none! Moving around also helps to prevent blood clots from forming in your legs. This is one of the most dangerous risks of sitting still for long periods of time."

      "title": "Stretch while sitting still.",
      "content": "Stretch while sitting still. Sitting can cause all kinds of tension and stiffness in your body, but sometimes standing up to stretch is just not an option. Try some of these stretches that you can do while in a seated position. [2] X Research source You can stretch your hamstrings while sitting. Sit on the edge of your seat and straighten one leg in front of you (as much as possible) with the heel on the floor. Sit straight up and arch your back without leaning the trunk of your body forward. Hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3 times for each leg. Stretch your hip flexor muscles while sitting. Sit on the edge of your seat, lean forward, and put one leg behind you (probably under your bus seat) as far as you can while anchoring your toe on the floor. Then sit up straight while keeping your leg behind you. Hold the position for 30 seconds then repeat with the other leg."

      "title": "Check your posture often.",
      "content": "Check your posture often. Sitting for a long time can strain your low back. Even more strain is put on your spine when you sit with poor posture. Check yourself from time to time so you can self-regulate your sitting position. Make sure your back is aligned against the back of your seat when you are in a sitting position. Adjust your headrest so that it is supporting the middle of the back of your head. Keep your shoulders straight as much as possible, and try to avoid hunching forward. While sitting, make sure that both of your feet are resting on the footrest or on the floor in front of you."

      "title": "Wear comfortable, layered clothes.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable, layered clothes. Comfortable clothing will allow you to move freely and rest more easily. Dress in layers, because unlike in your car, you won’t be able to change the temperature of the bus. Use a tank or tee as your base, and then try putting a long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt over it. Think about bringing along a large, thin scarf. A scarf can be used not only for warmth and fashion, but for coverage if you find yourself without an available bathroom, to cover your eyes if you’re trying to sleep, or if you roll it up, as a makeshift pillow."

      "content": "Bring some ear plugs. Sometimes your earbuds just won’t cut it, and you will need to drown out crying babies, snorers, coughers, squeaking brakes, barking dogs, etc. If you are planning to sleep at all, bring ear plugs. It’s better to have them and not need them than to need them and not have them."

      "content": "Pack a small travel pillow. If you’re going on a long trip, a small travel pillow will be indispensable for saving your neck and shoulder muscles. The seats on buses often don't provide the right kind of support for your lower back and neck. A travel pillow can be used to support your lower back, rest your head and neck, and make your seat more comfortable. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Lean against the window or another seat. If you’re lucky enough to get a window seat, you can lean against the side of the bus for support. If not, you may have to rest your head against the seat next to you. This offers a little bit of head and neck support, but it might be a bumpy ride!"
