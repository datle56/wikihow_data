      "title": "Visit your doctor for 3 or more herpes outbreaks in a year.",
      "content": "Visit your doctor for 3 or more herpes outbreaks in a year. If you experience a genital or oral herpes outbreak more than 3 times a year, it’s time to see a doctor. Your doctor can do diagnostic tests to determine the type of herpes that you have and provide treatments that may help to suppress and reduce the frequency of your outbreaks. [1] X Research source Your doctor can determine if you have HSV-1 or HSV-2 by reviewing your medical history, discussing your symptoms, and doing a physical exam. Additionally, they may do a cell culture test. Identifying the infection is important for treating outbreaks and preventing transmission."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about antiviral medications.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about antiviral medications. This is usually the first line of treatment for herpes whether you have only had 1 outbreak or recurrent episodes. Taking these medications intermittently can help to shorten the duration and severity of an outbreak, while taking a medication daily can help to suppress outbreaks and reduce their frequency by 70 to 80%. Follow your doctor’s recommendations for using the medication. Some common antiviral medications that your doctor may prescribe include: Acyclovir Valacyclovir Famciclovir Topical penciclovir Topical docosanol (Abreva)"

      "content": "Request information to cope and prevent transmission to others. Your doctor can offer you valuable information to help you cope with the infection. This knowledge may also reduce the chances of transmitting herpes to your sexual partners. Ask your doctor for any brochures or other resources that can help you to manage the infection and protect others from contracting it."

      "title": "Wear loose-fitting, breathable pants and underwear.",
      "content": "Wear loose-fitting, breathable pants and underwear. If you’re having a genital herpes flare-up, wear loose-fitting underwear made from a breathable fabric (like cotton). Also wear loose pants that won’t chafe and rub against your sores and bumps. Wearing looser underwear and pants will also expose genital herpes sores to air and speed up the healing process. It’ll also decrease pain caused by chafing. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Avoid wearing things like tight jeans, leather pants, nylons or pantyhose or underwear."

      "title": "Wear a condom during vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse.",
      "content": "Wear a condom during vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse. If you’re concerned about passing the herpes virus on to a sexual partner during an outbreak, wearing a condom is an effective way to prevent the virus from spreading. Put the condom on before any intercourse begins, and leave it on until all genital, anal, and oral contact has wrapped up. [3] X Research source While condoms are good at blocking the herpes virus, they aren’t 100% effective. A safer bet is just to avoid sex altogether until the outbreak dies down. If you sense that a herpes outbreak is coming, avoid having sex with your partner."

      "title": "Take a warm bath or shower to soothe the afflicted area.",
      "content": "Take a warm bath or shower to soothe the afflicted area. The heat from the warm water will also render the herpes virus inactive and help stop the spread of the outbreak. When you’re finished in the shower or tub, air dry yourself with the aid of a hair dryer set to the lowest heat setting. If you find that urinating is very painful when you're having a genital outbreak, try urinating while in a warm bath. [4] X Research source If you vigorously scrub your body dry with a towel, you could tear open herpes sores."

      "title": "Use a cool compress for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times per day for pain relief.",
      "content": "Use a cool compress for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times per day for pain relief. Soak a clean washcloth in cool water, then wring out any excess liquid. Place the washcloth over your herpes sores and leave it in place for 15-20 seconds. Then, remove the cloth and pat the area dry. Repeat up to 2-3 times per day until your outbreak heals to help with pain. You can place the washcloth in your freezer for 1-3 minutes to get it cooler, if you'd like. Put used washcloths in your dirty laundry and get a fresh cloth each time. Don't use the the washcloths for anything else before you wash them because the virus is contagious."

      "content": "Wash your hands after you touch your herpes sores. If you touch your sores, you’ll have the herpes virus on your hands, from where it can easily be transmitted to another person. So, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching the sores. Make sure to do this before touching any other part of your own body or someone else’s body. [5] X Research source Say, for example, that you shook someone’s hand after touching your sores. If that person rubbed their mouth, they’d contract herpes."

      "content": "Don’t share any personal oral items with a friend or partner. Viruses can be easily transmitted via, for example, your toothbrush. If you and your partner are in the habit of sharing a toothbrush, stop sharing it until the outbreak dies down. Also avoid drinking out of the same cup or water bottle as anyone else during a herpes outbreak. [6] X Research source You could also transmit herpes if you, for example, were to chew on a pen, handed the pen to a friend, and they then put the pen in their mouth."

[9] X Research source So, if you are going to be outdoors for more than 15-20 minutes, plan to put on a sun-blocking lip balm. You can purchase lip balm with an SPF of at least 30 at most drugstores or pharmacies. Flare-ups caused by sunlight are rarely an issue for individuals with genital herpes."

      "content": "Wash the outbreak with soap and water to help heal the sores. Soap and warm water are great at keeping the outbreak clean and helping it clear up quickly. Try washing your herpes bumps 1–2 times a day to help heal the sores and stop the outbreak. To avoid scratching or breaking open the sores, lightly pat the area dry with a clean towel. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source After you’ve finished washing the area, do not apply a bandage to the area.

      "content": "Keep in good health to avoid an illness-related flare-up. The most effective way to prevent future herpes outbreaks is to keep your immune system healthy and strong, since outbreaks are most likely to occur when your immune system is compromised. This means that the less you find yourself getting sick (even with the common cold or the flu), the fewer herpes flare-ups you’ll experience. Keep your immune system healthy by: [12] X Research source Getting 7–9 hours of sleep each night Eating a healthy diet Exercising at least 2–3 times a week Using a lip balm that contains a sunscreen"

So, to prevent the virus from flaring up and causing an outbreak, try to keep your stress levels under control during your day-to-day life. While this may seem like a big change to make, it'll make a real difference in stopping herpes outbreaks!
