While bby (or “baby”) is usually romantic or flirty, it can also be a simple expression of affection and familiarity between people—even if they aren’t romantically involved. [1] X Research source “Hey bby, what’s going on today?” “I miss you, bby! Can’t wait to see you later 😘” For example, if a girl or guy texts you “bby,” it’s definitely a sign that they feel comfortable with you and want you to know they care about you. There’s a strong chance it’s also romantic unless you’re close friends and often talk to one another this way."

Although both spellings have the same overall meaning, some people consider “bb” more casual and laid-back, with “bby” (and, in turn, “baby”) more flirty or intimate. “How’s my bb feeling today? I love you! 💗” “Hey bb, just want you to know I’m thinking of you!” However, as mentioned above, you can use “bb” in any context from casual to romantic.
