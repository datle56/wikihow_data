      "content": "Locate your car’s VIN. Your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) is a serial number that identifies your car. Find the VIN code from the outside, on the driver’s side dashboard in the corner where it meets the windshield. You can also find it in the driver’s side door or door jamb printed on a sticker. [1] X Research source Your VIN might also be printed on the front of the engine block, on the front of the car frame near the windshield washing fluid, above the tire in the rear wheel well, or underneath your spare tire. [2] X Research source You can also look at your vehicle’s registration, insurance card, or title for the VIN."

      "content": "Look under the hood to determine what engine your car has. Open the hood of your vehicle and prop it up. You can tell how many cylinders your car has by how many spark plugs are coming out of the engine. Most engines will also have a label on the top that tells you how many cylinders your car has (V4, V6, V8, etc.) and the size of your engine in liters. [3] X Research source The letter next to the number of cylinders refers to the layout of the engine. “V” means that the cylinders are arranged in two rows while “I” or “L” means they’re in a straight line. Any engine above 2 liters is generally considered a large engine, while small engines are usually only 1-2 liters. Bigger isn’t always better—engine size should be relative to the kind of car you have. For example, a 2.0L engine is perfect for a compact car but would make an SUV lag far behind. [4] X Research source The size refers to how much room the engine’s pistons operate in. Bigger engines can produce more power because they have a larger amount of air and fuel that each piston can push. This is also why engine size affects the fuel economy of a car.

      "content": "If your car is newer, look at your car’s original window sticker. When a new car is built, it comes with a window or Monroney sticker that verifies the vehicle’s make, model, year, suggested retail price, engine information (such as size, number of cylinders, etc.), transmission specifications, VIN, and more. [6] X Research source If you don’t have the window sticker, you can request a copy from the dealership you purchased your car from. If you bought your car new, it’s a good idea to keep copies of your window sticker in the glove box so you know what specific parts are required for repairs in the future. Since 2007, new vehicles are required by U.S. law to have a window sticker displayed on them by the dealership."

A build sheet, or Marti Report, can tell you everything about your car, including what color it is, what day it was sold, what kind of engine it has, and more. You can request your build sheet here . [7] X Research source Marti doesn’t have any data for vehicles from 1966 and older, but they do have some original Ford invoices for 1962-1966 Thunderbirds."

      "content": "Ask a mechanic. If you’re still not sure what kind of engine you have, ask your local trusted car mechanic the next time you have your vehicle serviced. If you don’t have a regular repair facility, here are some things to look for when searching one out: [8] X Research source Look for repair facilities with civic and community service awards, AAA Approved Auto Repair status, and other signs of customer service professionalism. Inside the shop, look for evidence of qualified technicians, like trade school diplomas or Automotive Service Excellence certifications. Check to see if the facility is neat and organized, with modern equipment and cars that are equivalent in value to your own. Ask your friends or family members for their recommendations. Once you have a shop in mind, start by asking for small repairs. If you’re happy with the work they’ve done, then you can trust this shop with more expensive repairs later."
