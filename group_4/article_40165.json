With this phrase, you tell the other person that you feel sympathy for them in their time of grief. [1] X Research source However, some feel that the phrase is overused and insincere. The grieving person may perceive “sorry for your loss” as a canned message that fails to address the depth of emotion the person experiences. Critics of the phrase feel that even an awkward but authentic expression is better than a common phrase like “sorry for your loss.” [2] X Research source It’s also appropriate to say, “I’m sorry about your loss.” The phrases are interchangeable."

Losing a parent can be a profound experience that makes a person feel lost, fearful, and unsafe in a way they have never experienced before. It changes their identity because they are now the older generation instead of being someone’s child. It’s difficult to know what to say to someone who is experiencing this type of grief. [3] X Research source Here’s a list of example condolence messages to help you figure out what to say in this situation: “I'm so sorry you've lost someone so important to you and your family.” “You've experienced such a huge loss in saying goodbye to your mother. If you want to talk, I'd love to hear more about who she was and what your times together were like. Just call me, and I’ll be there.” “I know this loss hit you hard. I know the grief of losing your dad must be so difficult to navigate.” “Your mom was so funny and welcoming. I can't believe she's gone. My heart is with you right now.” “Your dad was such a solid member of this community, but it was so clear that he was so much more than that for you and your family.” “I know you feel unmoored and sad right now, but if there's anything I can do to help you or your family with meals, yard work, or grocery shopping, please let me know.” “I hope memories of the happy times you had with your dad can be of some comfort during this incredibly difficult time.” “I'm so sad for you and sorry a person as wonderful as your mom is gone.” “I know you loved your dad very much.

Not only is a beloved child lost, but the person’s idea of how life should unfold is shattered. Knowing what to say to someone going through that grief is a daunting task, but it’s much better to reach out than to wait until you have the perfect thing to say. [4] X Research source Here are a few phrases to help guide you as you offer comfort: “There are no words that can express the depth of sorrow I feel for you. Your precious son's memory will forever remain in our hearts.” “I pray that as the months and years pass, you find peace in the beautiful memories you created together as a family so your daughter lives on in your hearts.” “I appreciate you opening up to me about your miscarriage. I know it's such a hard thing to face, and I can't do anything to make it better, but I’m here for you whenever you need me.” “Your son had an incredible impact on the world in his short time here. He’ll always be remembered and cherished by everyone who knew him.” “You have my deepest condolences on the passing of your beloved daughter.

They have good and bad days and may even feel guilt over being alive when their partner is gone. Tenzer says, “It's difficult to say the right or wrong way to comfort a loved one who is grieving.” It’s important to acknowledge what they’re going through and let them know you’re there to support them. [5] X Research source Here are a few ideas of what to say: “Nothing can replace having your partner here. I certainly can't, but I can bring you groceries or anything else you need.” “I can’t imagine how much you’re hurting right now. It’s a tough road. Just know that I’ll walk it with you as much as I can.” “Call or text me any time. I really mean it. I don’t care if it’s 3:30 am on Christmas morning.

Whether it was an abrupt death or prolonged illness, grief is difficult to navigate and often leaves those around you struggling to be helpful,” says Tenzer. Sometimes, when a person loses a member of their extended family, it’s just as shocking as losing someone they see every day. This is especially true when they lose a grandparent, sibling, aunt, or uncle they were close to. But in many cases, their grief may be overlooked in favor of the parents, spouse, or children of the deceased person. [6] X Research source Here are a few suggestions for condolence messages for those who have lost an extended family member: “I hope that, even though your world is so dark right now, you’re able to see some light in the memories you had with your loved one.” “I want to be present for you, but I don't know how. Please know I'm thinking of you and praying for you. I’ll drop by with dinner on Wednesday. If there's anything else I can do, don't hesitate to let me know.” “I'm praying every day for your comfort and for you to be able to find joy again.

I love you and am so sad that you're going through this.” “Be kind and gentle with yourself. Take your time. You have my deepest condolences and support."

[10] X Research source Here are a few quotes that are appropriate for messages of sympathy: “The pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That’s the deal.” – C.S.

      "content": "Avoid using outdated condolence messages that can seem insensitive. Sometimes, finding what to say to someone experiencing grief may cause you to say something well-intentioned but hurtful. It’s also very easy to slip into focusing on your own experiences as you try to relate to what the grieving person is going through. You may feel the urge to make suggestions to help them feel better, but these are usually unwanted when someone is working through their grief. [11] X Research source Here are a few phrases to avoid when expressing sympathy: “They’re in a better place.” “I know how you feel.” “Everything happens for a reason.” “You’ll feel better soon.” “She lived a long life.” “This happens to us all eventually.” “You’re handling this better than I expected.” “They would have wanted it this way.” “He’s with God now.” “Time heals all wounds.”"

However, your words will be more comforting if they’re more personal to the situation and people involved. Focus on what they are experiencing and the grief they are feeling. Acknowledge the situation and express your concern. Make them feel recognized and supported. [12] X Research source For example, say, “I heard your mother died. I’m so sorry this happened to you. I love you and want to help in any way I can. Do you need me to come over and walk the dog or bring you dinner?”” For many grieving people, it’s more important to have someone listen than to receive the perfect sympathy message.
