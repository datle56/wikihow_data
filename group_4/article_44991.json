      "content": "Take turns asking the players to answer a “truth” or perform a “dare.” You need at least 2 people to play truth or dare .

Generally, it’s more fun if you play with 4-8 players, but you can still have a great time with 2 people. The main goal of the game is to have fun and bond with other players, but you can keep score and offer a small prize at the end for the player who completes the most questions."
