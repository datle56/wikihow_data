      "title": "Get moving.",
      "content": "Get moving. The most effective way to warm your hands is to exercise, which gets the blood pumping to your muscles and skin, warming your entire body. [2] X Research source Pick up the pace a little if your hands get cold when you are out walking. Do some chores to get yourself moving. Do some squats, jumping jacks, or other aerobic exercises."

      "title": "Do hand exercises.",
      "content": "Do hand exercises. Getting up and exercising on the spot isn’t always an option, so if your hands get cold and you can’t increase your heart rate with aerobics, do some hand and foot exercises. Wiggle your toes and fingers Move your hands in circles Clench and release your hands and feet"

      "title": "Massage your hands and arms.",
      "content": "Massage your hands and arms. Another way to get the blood flowing to your hands again is with a massage. Especially in the winter months when skin gets dry, spend some time massaging oil or cream into the skin of your arms, wrists, and hands. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Don’t forget to massage in between your fingers and your fingertips."

      "title": "Stay away from cigarettes and caffeine.",
      "content": "Stay away from cigarettes and caffeine. Although this is a more long-term approach to warming your hands, both smoking and caffeine cause your blood vessels to constrict or narrow, and if there isn’t enough blood flow to your hands, they will get cold. In cold months, try white teas instead of coffee to get your mornings going."

      "title": "Keep your body warm.",
      "content": "Keep your body warm. Because your body reacts to cold by sending warm blood to your internal organs, you can help prevent your hands from getting cold and help warm them up by keeping your core warm and protected. If your body doesn’t think your organs are in danger, it won’t take warming blood away from your hands. In cooler weather, layer your clothing, wear a base layer, an insulating layer, and an outer layer that protects from wind and rain."

    {
      "title": "Wear loose clothing.",
      "content": "Wear loose clothing. Tight clothes, socks, and even underwear can actually constrict your blood vessels, meaning blood has a harder time circulating, and this can leave your hands chilly. To combat this, wear loose clothes that are comfortable and provide you with freedom of movement. [4] X Research source If you are wearing tight clothes and your hands get cold, change into looser clothes as soon as you can."

    {
      "title": "Wear warm gloves.",
      "content": "Wear warm gloves. It makes sense that if your hands are exposed to the cold, then they will get cold, so keep them protected with warm, loose-fitting gloves. Mittens tend to be better than gloves as gloves isolate each individual finger. In many, but not every, circumstance your own fingers can actually heat each other up while the mitten retains warm air around your hand. Be sure to get gloves that cover your wrists as well, because a lot of heat can be lost here. Put your hands in your pockets if you don’t have gloves, or stick them inside your jacket to keep them out of the breeze."

      "title": "Eat ginger.",
      "content": "Eat ginger. Ginger is a thermogenic food, meaning it produces heat when your body metabolizes it. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A hot cup of ginger tea could help warm your entire body, including your hands, and holding the warm cup is sure to bring some life back to your hands."

      "title": "Use your own body heat.",
      "content": "Use your own body heat. No matter how cold it is outside, there are some areas of our bodies that are almost always warm, such as under our armpits and between and under our thighs. Put your bare hands directly on the skin in a warm area of your body and leave them there until they warm up."

      "title": "Bring instant heat packs or warmers with you.",
      "content": "Bring instant heat packs or warmers with you. When you are going traveling outside in winter or at night, or going on a cold-weather excursion, you should be prepared with reusable or disposable hot packs that can provide instant heat to warm your hands and body. Good choices include: ClickHeat Hand Warmers Charcoal hand warmers UniHeat Heat Pax"

      "title": "Have a warm bath.",
      "content": "Have a warm bath. Not only will the warm water heat up your hands as well as your entire body, but it’s also a relaxing way to recover after time spent out in the cold. A safe bath temperature should never exceed 110 F (43 C), as this could cause burns, dizziness, low blood pressure, nausea, and vomiting. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can run your hands under warm water, or fill a bowl with warm water and soak your hands and wrists."

      "title": "Blow on your hands and rub them together.",
      "content": "Blow on your hands and rub them together. The hot air from your lungs will help heat up your hands. Cup your hands to help keep the heat in as long as possible, and then rub your hands together quickly to spread the warmth to the back of your hands."

    {
      "title": "Warm your hands over a fire or heat source.",
      "content": "Warm your hands over a fire or heat source. Fires, heaters, hot car engines, and even running computers give off plenty of heat that you can use to warm yourself. Just be sure you don’t get too close, and don’t touch the heat source. If you are wearing gloves, take them off and place your hands directly in front of the heat. Try turning your gloves inside out and placing them close to the heat as well. That way they’ll be nice and toasty when you put them back on."

      "title": "Don’t drink alcohol.",
      "content": "Don’t drink alcohol. While alcohol may make your skin feel warmer, it actually lowers your overall body temperature. Alcohol causes the blood vessels in your skin to dilate, and this diverts blood away from your vital organs and toward your extremities."

      "content": "Know when to see a doctor. While having cold hands and feet is natural, if you start to experience numbness, changes to the skin color, hardened or tightened skin, sores and blisters, hair loss, or memory loss, [7] X Research source talk to your doctor. There are many health conditions that cause cold hands, including: [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Anemia Raynaud’s disease Diabetes Nerve damage Hypothyroidism Vitamin B12 deficiency"
