If your answer is an improper fraction, you may need to rewrite it as a mixed number: [4] X Research source Example: Rewrite 36 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {36}{5}}} as a mixed number. How many times does 5 fit evenly into 36? 5 x 7 = 35, so the whole number portion is 7 . What's left over? The whole number portion is equivalent to 35 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {35}{5}}} , so solve 36 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {36}{5}}} - 35 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {35}{5}}} = 1 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{5}}} Combine the whole number and fraction: 36 5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {36}{5}}} = 7 1 5 {\\displaystyle 7{\\frac {1}{5}}}"
