      "title": "Choose an airtight container to minimize oxidation.",
      "content": "Choose an airtight container to minimize oxidation. Ground flaxseed will quickly oxidize and start to turn rotten when it’s exposed to the outside air. Additionally, the moisture or humidity in the air can cause the ground flaxseed to clump and spoil quicker. Use an airtight container to store your flaxseed so it stays fresher for longer. [1] X Research source Examples of airtight containers include plastic containers with sealable lids, glass jars with lids that can be sealed closed, and plastic freezer bags with sealable openings. You can find airtight containers at department stores and by ordering them online."

      "title": "Place freshly ground flaxseed into a container as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Place freshly ground flaxseed into a container as soon as possible. As soon as you finish grinding your flaxseed, pour the extra into an airtight container to store it. Seal the container as tightly as possible to keep the flaxseed from being exposed to the air. [2] X Research source Make sure the container is clean and dry so you don’t introduce extra moisture or bacteria, which can spoil your ground flaxseed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put pre-ground flaxseed into a container after you open the package.",
      "content": "Put pre-ground flaxseed into a container after you open the package. Once you open up your package of pre-ground flaxseed, it becomes exposed to the air and will spoil more quickly. When you open your flaxseed to use it, pour the extra into an airtight container so you can keep it fresh until you’re ready to use more. Check the expiration date on the packaging to select the freshest flaxseed. If you’re looking for ground flaxseed that will store the longest, choose a vacuum-sealed container or bag."

      "title": "Use ground flaxseed stored at room temperature within 3-4 days.",
      "content": "Use ground flaxseed stored at room temperature within 3-4 days. Place the airtight container of freshly ground or opened ground flaxseed on your counter or table and open it up to use it as you need it. The ground flaxseed will go bad within a week if it’s stored at room temperature, so use it within 3-4 days. Smell the flaxseed every time you use it to make sure it doesn’t smell rotten. [3] X Research source Keep ground flaxseed at room temperature if you plan to use it frequently in the days after you grind or open it. Once ground flaxseed starts to smell slightly rancid, do not eat it or you could become ill."

      "title": "Place the container of ground flaxseed in the fridge for up to 6 months.",
      "content": "Place the container of ground flaxseed in the fridge for up to 6 months. Keep the airtight container of freshly ground or opened flaxseed in your refrigerator and pull it out to use it whenever you need it. Be sure to seal the container as soon as you’re done and place it back in the refrigerator. Store the container of flaxseed in your fridge for up to 6 months, but be sure to smell it before you use it to make sure it’s not rotten. [4] X Research source The more you use your ground flaxseed, the more it’s exposed to the outside air and the quicker it may spoil."

      "title": "Freeze the ground flaxseed to store it for up to 1 year.",
      "content": "Freeze the ground flaxseed to store it for up to 1 year. Place the airtight container in your freezer to keep the flaxseed frozen until you need to use it. You don’t need to let the flaxseed thaw whenever you add it to a recipe or dish. Close the container and place it back in your freezer as soon as you’re finished to avoid rapid temperature changes. Keep the flaxseed in your freezer for up to 1 year."
