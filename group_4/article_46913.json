      "content": "Measure 3 units from the corner along one side. Use a tape measure to measure 3 units out from the corner of your project, marking the measurement with a pencil. [1] X Research source Use feet, meters, or any other unit to make your measurements, so long as you use the same unit each time."

      "title": "Measure 4 units from the corner along the other side.",
      "content": "Measure 4 units from the corner along the other side. Using the same unit of measurement, measure along the second side and make a mark at 4 units along its length. Multiply each number in the 3-4-5 rule by the same amount to scale it up for a larger project (to get a more accurate measurement), or to convert it to different units. For example, try 30-40-50 cm if you’re using the metric system . For a large room, use 6-8-10 or 9-12-15 feet or meters."

      "title": "Measure the distance between your marks—if it's 5, your corner is square.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between your marks—if it's 5, your corner is square. Line up your tape measure between the 2 marks. If the distance is 5 units, your corner is square! [2] X Research source If the distance is less than 5 units, your corner is less than 90º. If the distance is over 5 units, your corner has a measurement of more than 90º. Depending on your project, you may need to adjust your measurements or plans, or rebuild the corner to achieve a more precise angle. Use a framing square as a guide when you do this to avoid further mistakes. Once you’ve got a square corner, check the project’s other 3 corners to ensure they’re the same."

      "title": "The 3-4-5 rule uses the Pythagorean Theorem to make a right angle.",
      "content": "The 3-4-5 rule uses the Pythagorean Theorem to make a right angle. If a triangle has sides measuring 3, 4, and 5 units long, it must be a right triangle with a 90º angle between the short sides. If you can \"find\" this triangle in your corner, you know the corner is square. This is based on the Pythagorean Theorem from geometry: A 2 + B 2 = C 2 for a right triangle. C is the longest side (hypotenuse) and A and B are the two shorter \"legs.\" [3] X Research source 3-4-5 is a very convenient measurement to check because of the low, whole numbers. The math checks out: 3 2 + 4 2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5 2 . The 3-4-5 rule works with any numbers of the same proportions. For example, finding a triangle with sides that are 6-8-10 or 9-12-15 units long will also give you a 90º angle."
