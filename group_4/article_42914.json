      "content": "Plan to teach the rider in several 30-60 minute sessions. Though some people may learn to ride a bike in one session, this may not be the case for everyone. The ideal session length depends on the student and their abilities, but aim for 30-60 minute sessions. It’s best to end the session after some progress has been made. Don’t wait until the rider is tired or frustrated, or they may become discouraged. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Ensure the bike works properly. Check for wear in the tires and fill them with air, if necessary. The saddle and the handlebars should be secure, and you should oil the bike chain . Make sure both brake levers should work properly and that there are no cracks in the frame. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a grassy or paved area with a slight slope. Short grass can provide a soft landing place in case of a fall. Long grass, however, will provide too much friction and make pedaling the bike more difficult. If the rider prefers, you can begin on a paved surface instead. Make sure the area you choose has a slight slope so riders can practice gliding. If possible, choose a path with gentle turns as well. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a spot with minimal traffic.",
      "content": "Pick a spot with minimal traffic. Don’t choose a busy Saturday morning at a popular park to teach someone to ride a bike. Other pedestrians and cyclists will be clogging up the paths and may intimidate the rider. Instead, choose a time when not many people are out, like a Tuesday afternoon, or find a secluded location. Ensure there is enough light to see adequately. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Outfit the rider with appropriate clothing and safety gear. Have the rider tightly tie their shoelaces and cuff their pant legs so they don’t get caught in the chain. Make sure the rider is wearing a bike helmet as well. They can also wear gloves and elbow or knee pads, if they’d like. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the bike seat so the rider can put their feet on the ground. A bike must be the correct size for the rider, or they will have difficulties learning how to ride. Tell the rider to sit on the bike and put their feet on the ground. You can lower the seat, if necessary. If the seat is as low as it can go and their feet still don’t touch the ground, they need a smaller bike. [6] X Research source The rider should also be able to comfortably reach the handlebars and brake levers."

Use a wrench to remove the pedals on either side of the bike. Put the pedals and hardware in a safe spot where they won’t get lost. [7] X Research source"

Tell the rider to apply the brakes when getting on and off the bike to minimize rolling or wobbling. To get on the bike, the rider should lean the bike toward them and swing their leg over the saddle. To get off the bike, the rider should lean the bike to one side and swing their opposite leg over the saddle.

Have the rider push their bike as they walk alongside it and practice using the brakes. Tell the rider to apply even pressure to both brake levers.

Instruct the rider to push the bike using their feet and practice gliding. As they scoot along, they’ll learn what it feels like and what it takes to balance on 2 wheels. They can roll down a slight slope to help them gain momentum and balance. Have the rider keep practicing until they can push off and glide along without putting their feet down to correct their balance. [10] X Research source"

Their other foot should remain firmly on the ground for balance. [12] X Research source"

They’ll then need to bring their non-dominant foot off the ground and onto the other pedal while looking straight ahead, rather than down. The rider should continue pushing down with their feet to pedal the bicycle. [13] X Research source"
