Choose Through to customize the areas that the text will wrap. This is best if you want the text to be incorporated with your image in some way, or not follow the borders of the image file. Choose Behind Text to use the image as a watermark behind the text. Choose In Front of Text to display the image over the text. You may want to change the color, or it can make the text illegible."
