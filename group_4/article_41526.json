      "content": "Refrigerate all eggs within 2 hours of boiling. If possible, place the eggs in the refrigerator as soon as they have cooled. [2] X Research source If the eggs are not refrigerated immediately, they can become dangerous to eat. Warmer temperatures make the egg more vulnerable to bacteria such as salmonella. Discard any eggs that have sat out for two or more hours. Keep the eggs refrigerated until you are ready to serve them. If the eggs remain out of the refrigerator for over 2 hours, you should discard them."

      "content": "Refrigerate unpeeled hard-boiled eggs. Keeping eggs in their shells will help to prevent the egg from deteriorating; place hard-boiled eggs that still have their shells back in the egg carton, or in a sealed container. Store the hard-boiled eggs on a refrigerator shelf. Don’t store hard-boiled eggs in the refrigerator door. The repeated opening and closing of the door can cause temperature changes, causing the eggs to rot more quickly. Keep hard-boiled eggs away from foods with strong odors. Eggs will absorb the flavors and aromas of nearby items. Keep foods such as garlic or cheese away from the hard-boiled eggs to prevent a change in flavor. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Refrigerate peeled hard-boiled eggs in a bowl of cold water.",
      "content": "Refrigerate peeled hard-boiled eggs in a bowl of cold water. Peeled hard-boiled eggs may dry out. Placing them in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator will help to keep them moisturized, and also help to ensure they stay at a constant, cool temperature. [4] X Research source Change the water daily. Replacing the water every day will keep the eggs fresh as well as help to keep contaminants out of the water and the eggs. Alternately, place peeled eggs in a sealed container. Do not add water to this container, but place damp paper towels over the eggs. This will help them to stay fresh and not dry out. Change the damp paper towels daily."

      "content": "Use the hard-boiled eggs within one week. Whether they have been peeled or not, hard-boiled eggs will stay fresh for a maximum of 5-7 days. If they are kept longer, they may begin to rot and be dangerous to eat. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Boiled eggs go bad much quicker than raw eggs; the most obvious sign that a hard-boiled egg has gone bad is a sulfurous, rotten odor. If it is still in its shell, you may have to crack it open in order to detect any bad smell. [6] X Research source A gray or green yolk does not necessarily indicate that the egg has rotted. The color of the yolk is usually the result of how long the egg was boiled. If eggs are boiled too long, the yolk may turn green or gray."

      "content": "Freeze only the cooked yolks of hard-boiled eggs. These can be used as garnishes or toppings for salads and other dishes. Freezing the entire hard-boiled egg is not recommended as the egg whites will become rubbery and tough. The thawing process might also cause the egg to become discolored. [7] X Research source Write the date on the container or freezer bag; this will make it easy to track how long the egg yolks have been in the freezer, ensuring that you use the eggs within the 3-month time frame."

      "content": "Consider separating the yolks before boiling. Many people find it easier to separate the yolks and the whites before boiling.That way the yolks can later be frozen,and the whites can be used in other dishes, such as chocolate mousse. If boiling the yolks only, place the yolks in a saucepan, then cover with enough water to cover the yolks. Quickly bring the water to boiling. Remove the pan from the heat, cover it, and let it stand for 11-12 minutes. Remove the yolks with a slotted spoon and drain them well before placing them in the freezer bag or container."

      "content": "Sterilize the jars in the oven. Canning jars are the easiest containers for pickling eggs. They can be ordered online or bought at kitchen-supply stores. They are designed to seal tightly, preventing any contaminants from entering the jar. It is important that the canning jars are sterile to prevent the risk of disease. [9] X Research source Wash the jar in hot, soapy water and rinse well. Then place the jars on a cookie sheet in the oven at 140 °C (284 °F) for 20-40 minutes. The eggs and pickling brine should be added as soon as the jars are removed from the oven."
