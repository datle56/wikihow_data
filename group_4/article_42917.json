      "content": "Recognize that a syllable involves a single vowel sound. A syllable is a unit of pronunciation that includes a single vowel sound and that may or may not include the sounds of surrounding consonants. [1] X Research source For example, the word Bahamas has three syllables, each with its own vowel sound: \"ba,\" \"ha,\" and \"mas.\" On the other hand, the word flat only has one vowel sound and therefore only one syllable. Remember to ignore silent vowels in this rule, such as the final -e in late . Even though the word late has two vowels, it only has one vowel sound and therefore one syllable. Keep in mind that two vowels next to one another can sometimes be two separate vowel sounds, as in chaos (with its two syllables \"cha-\" and \"-os\"). But sometimes two vowels next to one another can make a single vowel sound, as in leaf, which only has one syllable. Time and experience will allow you to determine whether a double vowel makes two vowel sounds or a single vowel sound. There are no syllables that do not involve a vowel sound in English."

      "content": "Divide doubled consonants in the middle to make syllables. When you see two consonants in a row that are surrounded by vowels, divide the doubled consonants in half to create proper syllabication. For example, sil-ly, let-ter, mar-ble, plas-ma, and Eas-ter are all the proper way to divide these words into their component parts. [2] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source The only exceptions to this rule are consonant digraphs, which are single sounds represented by two consonants. Common consonant digraphs include the ph, sh, th, wh, wr, ck, ng, and ch sounds. [3] X Research source These should be treated like a single consonant and should not be divided. For example, rather should be divided into rath-er, not rat-her."

      "content": "Divide words with single consonants sandwiched between vowels before the consonant. This does not work for all words, but it will work more than half of the time. You should therefore use this method first. For example, if you come across words such as ti-ger , sa-bre , or fi-ber , the syllable division comes before the middle consonant. That initial sound will be a longer vowel sound instead of a shorter vowel sound. Sound out the word to see if this syllable division makes sense. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Divide the word after the middle consonant only if dividing before the consonant doesn't sound right.",
      "content": "Divide the word after the middle consonant only if dividing before the consonant doesn't sound right. This method works for about 45% of words, so you will use it less often than dividing words before the middle consonant. Use this method only when dividing the word before the consonant does not make a recognizable word. [5] X Research source For example, when you come across the word \"habit,\" you should first try dividing before the consonant: ha-bit. However, there is no word that sounds like \"hay-bit\" in English. You should therefore move on to the second method, which will give you hab-it, a common English word. These words will often begin with a shorter vowel sound instead of a longer vowel sound. Other words in this category include cabin (cab-in), panic (pan-ic), and second (sec-ond). Sometimes, there are differences between American and British English in where you divide the word. For example, Americans would usually divide the word \"privacy\" as \"pri-va-cy\" (with a long i sound). However, most British speakers would usually divide the word as \"priv-a-cy\" (with a short i sound)."

      "content": "Memorize important English bound morphemes (or units of meaning). A bound morpheme is a part of a word that is unable to stand alone as a word but that has a self-contained meaning. For example, the English prefix non- implies a negation. The English syllable -er implies a comparison. These morphemes usually stand alone as their own syllables during syllabication. If you memorize common English bound morphemes, you will be better equipped to divide words properly. [6] X Research source Common bound morphemes include: un-, non-, pre-, post-, -ing, -ed, -er, -est, and -less."

The exception to this rule is when the -le is preceded by the ck digraph. These words are divided before the -le.

For example, driveway , wallpaper , and lampshade are all compound words. [8] X Research source Be sure that you divide compound words in between their base components: drive-way; wall-paper; and lamp-shade. If a base word in a compound word is composed of multiple syllables, follow the typical rules of syllabication: wall-pa-per."

She will also have to learn the fact that some vowel sounds are spelled using two vowel letters, such as the \"ou\" vowel sound in the word round. Before moving on to syllable division, ask your student to accomplish the following tasks: Know the difference between a short vowel sound and a long vowel sound. Be able to determine a vowel sound for one-syllable words based on the consonants around it. Recognize common English word patterns. For example, they should learn that many consonant-vowel-consonant words involve a short vowel sound, as in rat or tot, whereas many consonant-vowel-consonant-e words involve a long vowel sound, as in rate or tote. Memorize common vowel sounds that are spelled with two vowel letters, such as \"ou,\" \"oi,\" \"ie,\" \"ea,\" and \"ei.\""

      "content": "Build a student's vocabulary during syllabication instruction. Many of the rules of syllabication are approximations. There are no exact rules that can be applied 100% of the time. Much of correct syllabication has to do with instinct and experience. This is why it is essential that you are helping to build your students' vocabularies and reading skills at the same time that you teach syllabication. For example, continue to ask students to read increasingly difficult texts to expose them to new words, longer words, and new sounds. Assign vocabulary lists to memorize. Make sure you tell students how to pronounce these words as well. Encourage your students to listen carefully to other speakers to hear how words are pronounced and divided into syllables."
