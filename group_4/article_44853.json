      "content": "Exfoliate the wart with a pumice stone to sand it away. One of the easiest and most cost-effective things you can do for wart removal is exfoliate them with a pumice stone. Pumice stone is naturally abrasive and works well to essentially scrape or sand away your warts, particularly the ones on the bottoms of the feet (plantar warts) that form thick overlaying callouses. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source A pumice stone is an inexpensive way of removing warts above the surface of the skin, but keep in mind that warts have \"roots\" below the surface of the skin. As such, exfoliate most of the wart away with a pumice stone, then plan on applying a compound that destroys the roots and prevents it from growing back. Before using the pumice stone as a wart exfoliator, soak the surrounding skin in warm water for about 15 minutes to soften it up—this is particularly important for plantar warts that have a thick callus covering them. Be very cautious when using a pumice stone on genital warts due to increased sensitivity and thinner skin on the shaft of the penis and labia. A small emery board may be more appropriate for genital warts. People with diabetes or peripheral neuropathy should not use a pumice stone on their hands or feet because they have reduced sensations and may damage the surrounding tissue."

      "content": "Apply some salicylic acid directly onto the wart to dissolve it. [3] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Another technique to remove the fleshy part of the wart that appears above the surface of the skin (and the callouses on plantar warts) is applying an over-the-counter salicylic acid preparation, which is widely available at pharmacies. Salicylic acid is a type of keratolytic, which means it dissolves the keratin (protein) of the surface of the wart and any calluses that may be covering the wart. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source It can take several weeks to get rid of a large wart using salicylic acid, so patience is the key. Keratolytics also destroy/irritate healthy skin, so take care when you apply the liquid, gel, ointment, or patch. Before applying the salicylic acid (up to twice a day), soak the surrounding skin and file down most of the wart with a pumice stone or emery board so the medication can better penetrate into the roots of the wart. Salicylic acid products sometimes contain dichloroacetic (or trichloroacetic) acid, which helps burn away the visible part of the wart. However, be careful not to apply it on the surrounding healthy skin. For most warts, buy and use a 17% salicylic acid solution or a salicylic acid patch at 40% strength.

      "content": "Try cryotherapy to freeze the wart and remove it. Cryotherapy means \"to freeze\" and it's a commonly used procedure by family physicians and dermatologists to get rid of warts. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source However, there are some over-the-counter liquid nitrogen products that are available in liquid or spray form (Compound W Freeze Off, Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away) that you can use at home. The application of liquid nitrogen makes a blister around the wart initially, then the blister and wart eventually fall off after about a week. [8] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. Multiple applications are typically needed so that the wart doesn't grow back. Cryotherapy sounds painful, but it typically only causes mild discomfort. Liquid nitrogen can mildly scar light-colored skin or cause dark spots in people with dark-colored skin, so be careful when applying it to your wart. Applying ice is a form of cryotherapy used for sprains and strains, but don't try to freeze your warts with ice cubes! It isn't effective and you may give yourself frostbite."

      "content": "Cover your wart with garlic extract 2-3 times a day to treat it. Garlic is an ancient home remedy that's been used for many conditions, although it was eventually discovered that its strong antimicrobial abilities are due to the chemical, allicin, which can kill a variety of microorganisms, including viruses such as HPV. [11] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Raw, crushed garlic or store-bought extracts can be applied directly onto warts a couple of times per day for a week or 2. Once you apply it, cover it up with a bandage for a few hours until you have to reapply it. Consider doing so at night before bedtime, so the allicin can absorb deeply into the wart and get to its roots. In a 2005 study, chloroform extract of garlic was discovered to completely cure warts after a few weeks and there was no reappearance noted even after 4 months. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source As an alternative, albeit a less effective one to combat warts, capsules of refined garlic can be taken orally, which attacks HPV from the bloodstream."

      "content": "Apply Thuja oil to fight off the wart. Thuja oil contains compounds that can stimulate certain cells of your immune system that are efficient at scavenging and killing viruses or virally infected cells, which is helpful for destroying HPV and eliminating warts. [13] X Research source Apply Thuja oil directly onto warts, allow it to absorb for a few minutes then cover with a bandage. Repeat twice daily for up to a couple of weeks. Thuja oil is derived from the leaves and roots of Western Red Cedars. It's an ancient Ayurvedic remedy popular for many diseases and conditions due to its strong antiviral properties. Keep in mind that Thuja oil is usually quite potent and can easily irritate sensitive skin, which is especially important to remember if you're applying it to genital warts. If you’re applying Thuja oil to sensitive skin, consider diluting it with some mineral or cod liver oil. Thuja oil is often recommended for particularly stubborn warts that are resistant to other treatments. Even still, significant results are usually seen with these stubborn varieties after 1-2 months of daily application."

Tea tree oil is an antimicrobial that also boosts your immunity, which can be helpful in preventing reinfection with HPV. Start with 2-3 drops of tea tree oil on the wart, twice daily for at least 3-4 weeks and see how it works. [14] X Research source Tea tree oil has been a popular natural antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory for many generations in Australia and New Zealand, but has become better known in North America in the last decade or so. Tea tree oil can cause both irritant and allergic skin reactions in some people who are especially sensitive, but the prevalence is pretty rare. Never take tea tree oil orally, as it can be poisonous."
