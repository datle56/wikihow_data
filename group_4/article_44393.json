      "content": "Move down to the underground walkway. Follow the signage around you directing you to the walkway. You can take your luggage on a luggage cart but will need to get in a lift rather than the escalator. As the lifts are usually busy, this can sometimes take a while. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a Transport for London Oyster Card for additional shuttle stops. This is the most convenient way to pay for travel around London. You can purchase one from any London underground station (including in Heathrow). There are London underground trains that go between terminals 2&3, but if you use this mode of transport, it will only be free if you have an Oyster card. [3] X Research source Purchasing an Oyster card isn't a necessity, but if you are planning on spending time in London, it may be a useful purchase."

If you are in terminal 4 the stop is just to the right of the main entrance and on floor level -1. If you are in terminal 5 the stop is on the left side on floor level 0. You can also follow the clearly marked signs saying “Heathrow Express”. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Catch the free shuttle train. The shuttle trains come 4 times an hour and have ample room for luggage. The trains are also all at platform level so there's no need to worry about lifting luggage up stairs onto the train. All shuttle travel between terminals is free so just make your way to the stop and hop on. [5] X Research source The total travel time will take about 20 mins while the actual time you will be on the train for will probably be much smaller than this."
