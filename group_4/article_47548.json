      "content": "Find a suitable belt. A canvas belt with a clip fastener or sliding buckle is a useful tool for keeping your sag from slipping. When wearing a clip or sliding buckle, you can usually fasten your pants tightly in the position you need to keep your pants from falling down. Traditional pin buckle belts aren't as variable, which will result in a looser fit due to the spacing between belt holes."

      "content": "Be aware of how your choice of pants affects your sag-style. Regular cut pants should work fine for sagging, but if you're after the classic sag look, you'll want a baggy cut of pants. If you want a fresher style, try some drop crotch pants. Relaxed fit pants work best if you want a casual everyday outfit. They're the most versatile choice of pants. You can sag them just a few inches to create a smooth sagging-look or you can wear them below your buttocks to get a pronounced sag. Baggy pants are the traditional choice for sagging and the kinds of pants that created the sagging-style. They have a slightly lower and wider cut crotch plus wide legs. Be aware that baggy pants are designed to be worn lower than regular pants to allow their intended style to show. Never wear them too high on your waist or you will defeat their purpose, like wearing some sneakers on your hands would defeat the purpose of shoes. Drop crotch pants or harem pants already have a crotch that is cut lower than normal while maintaining tighter cut legs. They will create an impression that you are wearing your pants lower than you actually are. Drop crotch pants have become more popular in the last years, especially sweat pants with low cut crotches. But since not many people have adopted this style yet, they're still fresh and will work for you if you're looking for something distinctive. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Shorts can be sagged as well. You have to put extra care in how low you sag them. If you wear them so low that your shorts' legs are almost touching your shoes, you'll look like wearing normal pants, which defeats the purpose of wearing shorts."

      "title": "Pick the right size.",
      "content": "Pick the right size. Depending on your body type the size you need will vary, but generally you should wear pants that are at least one size bigger than your normal size. For a baggier, saggier look, you can also wear pants that are 2 or 3 sizes larger than your normal. For example, if your normal waist is size 34, you might wear pants ranging in size between 35 and 38. The brand of pants you purchase will also affect the size that's best for you. Sizes can differ widely in the inseam, hip, and leg between brands. Different brands of pants will also have different cuts, like longer or shorter cut crotches or wider or tighter legs. This will also affect the way your sag looks. If you have slender hips, it's likely you'll need a smaller size of baggy pants to prevent them from falling off. Stockier individuals thicker in the thigh, however, might want to invest in pants a few sizes normal than their average. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine your sag-style. If your baggy pants are worn too high, you'll miss the mark and simply appear like you are wearing overlarge clothes instead of sagging. Pants that are worn too low can fall easily off your body and/or make it difficult for you to walk. Generally, you'll want the crotch of your pants to lie lower than normal and the fit to be as relaxed as possible."

      "content": "Be aware of how low you wear your pants will affect your sag-style. A minor sag is when you simply wear your pants slightly lower on your hips. This creates a subtler, more casual sag-style. It can be a less offensive alternative if you're out with your parents or in polite company while still staying true to your sense of style. It is also the easiest way to sag, because your pants won't slide off your buttocks on their own. The downside of this style is that depending on the pants you wear, your sag won't be as noticeable as you might want it to be. Sometimes this style is called \"shy sagging\" and amongst saggers has the stigma of being worn by people who lack confidence in their own style. A medium sag is when you wear your pants right in the middle of your buttocks, which creates a more pronounced sag-style. This is a good alternative if you want to let other people clearly see that you're sagging. It is also comparatively easy to maintain in comparison to more extreme styles. This way of wearing your pants might be most appropriate when out with your friends. A major sag is a more extreme sag-style. It means wearing your pants below your buttocks and sometimes even below your genitals. It might take you some time to get used to it and it takes some experience to know how to keep your pants up and how to walk properly. Be aware that this style is more show-offy than the aforementioned, but it will create an aura of complete confidence if your style. You'll not only appear as someone who goes against traditional conventions and dress codes while staying true to yourself, but it might also earn you respect from other saggers. An extreme sag is when you wear your pants around your thighs. This is perhaps the most noticeable version of sagging and is also the most prone to slippage. It takes a lot of experience to wear. You might want to give this style a test run before you try it in public! This style works best if you combine it with long shirts or tall tees. Proficient extreme saggers rock this style casually as if they don't even care, and this makes people wonder how their pants stay up. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Position your pants.",
      "content": "Position your pants. Try a few different positions on your body and use a full length mirror to see how the different sag-styles look on you. Some body types might not work with certain styles of sag. For example, if you have a relatively flat butt, even if you want your pants to rest there, you may find your pants slide lower even with a tightly fastened belt. You should fasten your pants with a belt by bringing your legs together while tightening your belt. You'll want your belt to be tight against your body to keep your pants up while standing and walking. After firmly fastening your belt, you may want to readjust the way your pants are positioned. Cinching your belt can sometimes raise your pants higher than you desire. Tug your pants back into the position you prefer and check your look in a mirror. You might even wear your pants so low that the back pockets reach to the backs of your knees. This will create a visible, iconic sag-style, especially while walking. Wear your pants slightly lower in the back than in the front, as it will give them a baggy look and show off your boxers. Don't exaggerate the sag too much, however, or your might lose them completely."

      "content": "Adopt a wide stance to prevent slippage. When wearing your sag-style, especially for extreme saggers, you'll want to keep your legs at least slightly spread apart when standing and walking. This widened stance will help keep your pants from sliding down your legs."

      "title": "Add width to your body with sub-layers.",
      "content": "Add width to your body with sub-layers. Under layers will add width to your frame, and much like your widened stance, more width to your body will prevent your pants for sagging farther than you intend. Most saggers recommend and prefer boxer shorts when sagging to keep their backside fully covered, although you might want to avoid smooth fabric like satin or silk. Smooth fabric underwear will make it easier for your pants to slide down and off your body. You can add another sub-layer over your boxers by wearing a pair of athletic shorts. If you find that your boxers don't offer enough coverage, you could wear two pairs of shorts. These can also be worn fashionably, with the pair closest to your body hiked a little bit higher on your waist than the other. This can create interesting patterns between your shorts, boxers, and pants."

      "title": "Personalize your look.",
      "content": "Personalize your look. Sagger style doesn't just use baggy pants! You'll want to combine your choice of pants similarly baggy clothing, like tall tees, over sized t-shirts, and/or long, loose fitting shirt or top. If you are uncomfortable showing off your underwear, stick to longer shirts that hide your undergarments. Normal size t-shirts work well if you want to show off your underwear/shorts. Normal tees that reveal your sub-layers can create interesting, fashionable patterns between your outer and inner layers. Hoodies, being a baggier article of clothing, naturally match the sagger style. However, if you've chosen a sag-style that is especially low on your body, you might need to buy a hoodie that's longer than usual or is a size or two bigger than what you normally wear. [8] X Research source If you've decided on wearing drop crotch pants, the thinner legs will likely match well with thinner clothing on your upper body as well. Experiment to see what works best for you!"

      "title": "Avoid walking on your pants.",
      "content": "Avoid walking on your pants. Since your pants will be slung lower on your body than intended by the manufacturer, it's almost certain that the bottom cuffs of your pants will drag on the ground. This can fray or wear out the material of your pants, severely decreasing the amount of wear-time you get from them. This can also trip you up when you're walking, which can be dangerous. To ensure this doesn't happen to you, you might want to take the extra fabric around your feet, collect it together, and tuck the back of it into the back of your shoes. You may have to reposition the bottom cuff of your pants for the most natural look, but since you've only tucked the back of your pants into your shoes, the extra fabric should pool around your ankles. This should cover up the tucking, keeping it from looking weird."

      "title": "Sit down properly in your baggy pants.",
      "content": "Sit down properly in your baggy pants. Another reason a canvas or fabric belt is preferred among saggers is that these are less rigid. This means that while you're sitting, it's less likely your belt will dig into your butt uncomfortably. Sitting with baggy pants can create bunching that becomes uncomfortable over time. Get into the habit of noticing bunching quickly and pulling the fabric smooth. [9] X Research source If you find that your belt still causes discomfort when sitting, you may want to pull your pants up a little bit when you sit down. This will likely place your belt on a higher, narrower part of your body, where the belt will be more relaxed. Another way of avoiding discomfort is pulling your pants down a bit until you're no longer sitting on the belt. But be aware that you will be instead sitting directly on your boxers (which are completely exposed), so check first the place you are sitting on, in order to not get your boxers soiled. Be also aware that this will create a much more extreme sag when standing up, so you have to pull your pants up before they fall down completely."

      "content": "Rearrange your pants when standing up. Especially if you've had to pull up or smooth bunched fabric while sitting down, your sag-style might have shifted. You should tug the legs of your pants downward to return them to the sag-style you prefer. This also will keep unattractive creases from forming in your pants. Failure to keep your pants smoothed can result in permanent folds that harsh your cool sag style."
