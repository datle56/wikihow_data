      "content": "Purchase a 3 foot (0.91 m) 2x2 inch (5.08x5.08 cm) piece of lumber. You can purchase the wood for your stake at a hardware or home and gardening store. Once you get your stake, use a knife or a hand sander to taper the end of one side of the lumber. Alternately, purchase a piece of wood that is already tapered at one end. [3] X Research source You can also use a bamboo cane as your stake for saplings. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Position the stake on a 45-degree angle with the ground.",
      "content": "Position the stake on a 45-degree angle with the ground. Place the pointed end of the stake so that it crosses the base of the tree at a height of about 15 to 18 inches (38 to 45 cm). You'll want your single stake to be oriented into the direction in which the wind usually blows, to help stabilize the tree. Do not disrupt the tree's root system when planting your stake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hammer the stake 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) into the ground.",
      "content": "Hammer the stake 12-18 inches (30-45 cm) into the ground. Use a hammer to bang on the top end of the stake so that it drives it deep into the ground. You'll need to make sure that it's deep enough so that it adds stability to the tree and will remain in the ground, even in high winds. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the stake to the tree with a wire or string.",
      "content": "Tie the stake to the tree with a wire or string. You can use wire or twine to attach the tree to the stake. Tie your loop in the center of the wooden stake or as low as you can tie it without the tree falling over. You'll want to attach the stake to the tree securely but not so tight that your tree won't be able to grow or move. [6] X Research source If you want to avoid the wire from damaging your tree, you can wrap the wire with tubing, canvas strapping, strips of old carpeting, or burlap to protect the tree."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure the apple tree.",
      "content": "Measure the apple tree. If you are replanting an apple tree, you'll want to make sure that your stakes are no larger than 2/3 the height of the tree itself. If you are replanting a tree, you should also measure the width of the root ball so that you know how far apart each of the stakes have to be placed into the ground without hurting the tree's roots. The stakes should be as high as the lowest hanging branches of your tree. When replanting an adult apple tree, some of the roots may become damaged which will cause a loss of stability."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase your stakes.",
      "content": "Purchase your stakes. Go to a hardware or home and gardening store and purchase metal or wooden stakes that are around 2/3 the height of your apple tree. Each stake should be at least 2 inches (5 cm) wide. [7] X Research source Metal stakes provide greater overall stability when creating a permanent stake."

      "content": "Insert the stakes into the ground so they run parallel to each other. Use a tape measure to mark the area where you want to plant your tree. The stakes should be placed far enough apart on each side of the tree so that when you drive them into the ground, they won't disrupt the tree's roots."

      "title": "Drive the stakes a foot (30 cm) into the ground using a hammer.",
      "content": "Drive the stakes a foot (30 cm) into the ground using a hammer. Once you know where your stakes have to be, tap the top of the stakes and drive them vertically into the ground about a foot (30 cm) deep. You should now have two stakes running vertically on each side of your tree."

    {
      "title": "Tie the tree to both stakes using rope or string.",
      "content": "Tie the tree to both stakes using rope or string. Using twine, wire, nylon string, or tubing, attach the stakes to the tree near the middle of the stakes, or 1/3 the way up from the ground. Do not tie the knots too tight and make sure that there's enough slack so that your tree is free to sway slightly."
