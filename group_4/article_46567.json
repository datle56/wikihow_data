      "content": "Plug the test leads into the COM and V terminals. Always plug the black test lead into the terminal that’s labeled “COM” for “Common.” Always plug the red test lead into the terminal labeled “V” for “Voltage,” since this is what you’re testing. [1] X Research source Voltage is the speed or force at which electrons move through a circuit. Kuhlman likes to think of voltage like water pressure flowing through a water hose: The higher the force or \"pressure\" in an electrical circuit, the higher the voltage. [2] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. Both AC and DC voltage are measured using the test leads in this setting."

      "content": "Move the dial to the voltage setting for AC or DC voltage. Turn the dial to V~ (or the V with a wave sign next to it) if you’re measuring AC voltage. Switch the dial to V⎓ (or the V with a horizontal line next to it) to measure DC voltage. [3] X Research source AC/Alternating Current: According to Kuhlman, AC voltage is used in almost all standard wiring you find in the home. This includes electrical outlets, lights, and light switches. [4] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. DC/Direct Current: DC voltage is most often used to measure circuits that are powered by batteries. DC voltage is, therefore, used in cars and most electronic circuits. Kuhlman says you may find some DC wiring in the home, typically to power low-voltage lights like under-the-counter lights or yard signs.

      "title": "Set the voltage to auto-range or higher than what’s expected.",
      "content": "Set the voltage to auto-range or higher than what’s expected. Most digital multimeters have an auto-range function that automatically detects the voltage range. However, if your multimeter does not have this function, set the voltage to the nearest range that's higher than you expect. Look at the numbers on the dial and choose the setting that’s closest to the expected voltage of what you’re measuring while still being above that voltage. [7] X Research source If you set the voltage range too low, you won’t get an accurate reading. For example, if you’re measuring a 12V battery and there are settings for 2V and 20V on your multimeter, set the dial to 20V. If you don’t know the voltage of what you’re reading, just set the multimeter to its highest voltage rating. The standard voltage for most electrical outlets, lights, and light switches is 120V. Heavier appliances, such as your oven or clothes dryer, may plug into a 240V outlet. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Touch the probes to both sides of a load or power source.",
      "content": "Touch the probes to both sides of a load or power source. Put the tip of the black probe on the negative lead of a battery or into the right side of a wall socket, for example. Put the red probe on the positive end of a battery or into the left side of a wall socket, for instance. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure which end is positive and which is negative, try putting a probe on each end and seeing what the multimeter says. If it’s showing a negative number, your positive and negative are switched. To avoid getting shocked, keep your fingers away from the tips of the probes when you’re putting them near a wall socket. Keep the probes from coming into contact with one another, or you can generate a short circuit that could possibly cause an electrical fire. Always hold the probes by the colored handles. They are insulated, which prevents shock. The way AC electricity is wired in the home is through a \"hot\" wire that carries the electrical current and a \"neutral\" wire through which the electrical current returns through. The hot wire is usually black and the neutral wire is usually white. You also have a green wire, which is the ground. To test AC, touch the red probe to the hot wire and touch the black probe to the ground wire or a ground piece of metal. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Read the voltage on the multimeter screen.",
      "content": "Read the voltage on the multimeter screen. Once your probes are connected to the positive and negative leads, you’ll get a reading on the multimeter telling you the voltage of what you’re testing. Look at the digital screen to find the reading and take note of it if desired. [11] X Research source Looking at your reading tells you whether or not the voltage you're measuring is average or not. For example, if you measure the wall socket and the multimeter reads 100V, this is below the average (RMS value or root mean square value) of 120V, letting you know this wall socket voltage is low. If you’re checking the voltage of a new 12V battery, the reading should be right around 12V. If it is lower or there is no reading at all, the battery is low or dead."

      "title": "Plug in the test leads into COM and A or mA and turn the dial to Amps.",
      "content": "Plug in the test leads into COM and A or mA and turn the dial to Amps. Insert the black plug into the COM terminal. Put the red plug into amps or milliamps, labeled with A or mA, depending on the amperage of the current you intend to measure. Locate the Amps setting and turn the multimeter dial to it. [12] X Research source Amperage measures the rate or number of electrons flowing through an electrical circuit. [13] X Research source Using Kuhlman's water hose analogy, while voltage is equivalent to the water pressure flowing through a hose, amperage measures the size of the hose. A larger hose allows more water to travel through at once. [14] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. Your multimeter likely has two terminals for amps: one for currents up to 10 amps (10A) and one that measures up to roughly 300 milliamps (300mA). If you’re unsure of the range of amperage you’re measuring, place your red plug in the amps terminal. You can always switch to milliamps for a more precise reading if necessary. Some multimeters have two As, 1 for alternating current (AC used for residential power and represented by the wave sign) and 1 for direct current (DC used in batteries and wires and represented by a horizontal line with a dotted line under it). Direct current is the one that's most used for this reading."

      "title": "Break a circuit by disconnecting 1 of the wires in it.",
      "content": "Break a circuit by disconnecting 1 of the wires in it. This allows you to use your multimeter as an ammeter to complete the circuit and measure the current. Unplug or otherwise remove a wire from the terminals it’s connected to on one side of the circuit, leaving the other wire connected to its terminals. [15] X Research source It doesn’t matter which side of the circuit you disconnect. The point is to make a space to splice your multimeter into the circuit so it can act as an ammeter and tell you how much current is flowing through the circuit. \"Splicing in the multimeter\" means that you're connecting the multimeter to the current going directly through the wires."

      "title": "Touch the multimeter leads to the free terminals and read the current.",
      "content": "Touch the multimeter leads to the free terminals and read the current. Connect one probe to each of the terminals you just disconnected the wire from to splice it into the circuit. Read the screen to determine how much current is flowing through the circuit. [16] X Research source It doesn’t matter which probe you touch to which side of the circuit. Your multimeter will give you a reading either way. You can troubleshoot electrical circuits by splicing your multimeter into different sections of them. If one section gives you a lower current reading, it might mean a bad wire is inhibiting electrical flow. If you initially test amps and get a really low reading, such as 1, switch to testing milliamps for a more precise reading."

      "title": "Insert the black test lead in COM and the red test lead in the Ω terminal.",
      "content": "Insert the black test lead in COM and the red test lead in the Ω terminal. Stick the black test lead plug into the COM terminal. The red test lead plug goes into the terminal labeled Ω, which is the symbol for ohms, the unit that resistance is measured in. [17] X Research source Resistance measures how much a material obstructs an electrical current that flows through it. Different materials have different levels of electrical resistance. Materials that have low levels of resistance are called conductors because they allow electricity to flow through them more easily. Going back to the water hose analogy, resistance would be like adding a nozzle that restricts water flow through the hose. The Ω sign is likely linked with the V sign, meaning the terminal to measure ohms and voltage is the same."

      "title": "Set the dial to a number on the multimeter resistance scale.",
      "content": "Set the dial to a number on the multimeter resistance scale. Look for the Ω symbol on your multimeter dial area. Twist the dial to a number close to the expected resistance in this section. If you aren’t sure what the expected resistance is, set it to a number at the top of the scale. You can adjust it as you measure until you get a precise reading. [18] X Research source For example, if you’re measuring the resistance of a wire, set the dial to just above 0. You can look up the expected resistance for different electrical components online or in an owner manual. The Ω values on your multimeter can range from 200 to 2 million ohms, depending on the specific type of multimeter you have."

Look at the multimeter digital screen to see the reading, which tells you the amount of resistance in ohms. [19] X Research source If your multimeter is just reading “1,” you might need to increase the value of ohms measured by turning the dial so your reading is more specific. Write down the reading if needed, noting the correct unit."

      "title": "Unplug or remove the batteries from the device you want to test.",
      "content": "Unplug or remove the batteries from the device you want to test. If the device is still being powered, you can’t test for continuity. Make sure it is disconnected from all power sources before you proceed. [20] X Research source The continuity option on your multimeter is for testing whether wires are still working or not. If you’re not sure whether a certain cord or wire still has a good connection, you can test this by measuring its continuity. This tests the connection between two points in a circuit. Continuity is the presence of a complete path of electrical flow. For example, a brand-new electrical wire should have full continuity. However, if it is frayed or broken, it doesn’t have continuity because the electricity cannot flow through it. Using the water hose analogy, measuring continuity checks to see if there is a leak in the water hose. This is a good way to see if cables are broken internally."

      "content": "Plug the probe wires into the multimeter and set the dial to continuity. Put the red plug into the terminal labeled as V, Ω, or with the sign for continuity, which looks like a sound wave. Insert the black plug into the COM terminal. Turn the dial to the picture that looks like a sound wave. [21] X Research source A sound wave looks like a series of increasingly larger “)” symbols. Instead of having a range of numbers in its area, the continuity option only shows one sound wave. Twist the dial until it’s pointing directly at the continuity sound wave to be sure it’s on the right setting."

      "content": "Connect the probes to the ends of the component you’re testing. Place the black probe on one end of the component and the red probe on the other. Make sure that the probes are both touching the ends at the same time so the multimeter works properly. [22] X Research source The component doesn’t have to be disconnected from a circuit to test for continuity. It doesn’t matter which probe you put on which end of the component. Examples of components you can test the continuity of are wires, switches, fuses, and conductors. You have to be touching two conductive ends to test for continuity. For example, touch the probes to two bare ends of a wire."

      "content": "Listen for a beep to signal that there’s a strong connection. As soon as the two probes are touching the wire ends, you should hear a beep if the wire is working well. If you don’t hear a beep, this means you have a short in the wire. [23] X Research source If you have a cut or burnt wire, your wire might have a short. The beep is telling you that there’s almost no resistance between the two points."
