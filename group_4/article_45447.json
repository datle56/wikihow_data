To broaden your understanding of those that fall outside the scope of heteronormativity—in order words, the way in which society presents heterosexuality as the \"norm\"— familiarize yourself with key LGBT+ terminology that relates to sex, sexual orientation, and gender. Here are some terms to help you gain a more nuanced comprehension of LGBTQIS-2 matters: [1] X Trustworthy Source LGBTQIA Resource Center The LGBTQIA Resource Center of the University of California, Davis. Go to source Sex : A label you're assigned at birth (i.e., \"male,\" \"female,\" or \"intersex\"—a combination traits that don't fit the typical male/female binary). Gender : An internal sense of who you are (i.e., \"male,\" \"female,\" or \" non-binary \"—neither male nor female). Transgender : A gender that differs from what was assigned to you at birth. Cisgender : A gender that corresponds with what you were assigned at birth. Gender expression : The way in which you represent your gender to others (e.g., what you wear, how you act, the interests you pursue). Sexual orientation : Your emotional, sexual, or relational attraction to others (e.g., \"gay/lesbian\" to describe attraction to the same sex/gender, \"bisexual\" to describe attraction to multiple sexes/genders; \"asexual\" to describe a lack of attraction to anyone, etc.) Queer : An umbrella term for anyone who either doesn't identify as heterosexual or who doesn't identify as cisgender or who is neither heterosexual nor cisgender. Questioning : When you are unsure or exploring your sexual orientation or gender. Two-Spirit : The Native American term for tribe members who have a \"two-spirit\" identity and experience a unique, non-Western, and indigenous relationship with gender and sexual orientation. LGBTQIS-2 : Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, and/or Two-Spirit."

Fight back against any misinformation that claims being LGBT+ is a \"choice\" or a \"lifestyle.\" These false beliefs harm LGBT+ individuals because they create a stigma and imply that LGBT+ people can \"change\" if they decide to. To demonstrate respect for LGBT+ individuals and their humanity, acknowledge that they are living their truth and following their natural instincts. [2] X Research source There is absolutely no evidence that external factors, like home life, influence gender or sexual orientation. Gender expression is a choice, but it's a way to affirm —validate and honor—the gender someone already has. In some cases, people change their gender expression to \"pass\" as heteronormative, but this is a red flag that the environment they're in isn't welcoming or accepting. [3] X Research source To promote a society where everyone is free to express their gender in a way that affirms them, voice the tolerant stance that non-heteronormativity is not a \"choice.\""

Conversion therapy is a toxic type of program—usually in the form of one-on-one sessions or camps—that tries to force people to change their sexual orientation. Based on accounts from survivors, the LGBT+ community would be well served if society eliminated conversion camps altogether. [4] X Research source In fact, the America Psychological Association (APA) has adopted a resolution that states that all mental health professionals should abstain from telling their clients to change their sexual orientation. Identifying as LGBT+ cannot be \"cured,\" but reinforcing the harmful belief that it can be leads to mental health challenges, including internal battles, self-harm, and a lack of self-acceptance."

I wonder how I should approach it?\" To create a more welcoming and tolerant dynamic, they may discuss how to address their identity— \"Maybe we should talk about this before the holidays come up?
