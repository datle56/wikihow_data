The more views you have, the more likely you’ll get approved. [11] X Research source For example, if your main platform is YouTube, try posting new videos on a certain day each week. Or, try posting on Instagram daily. Don’t post content just for the sake of posting content. Make sure it’s something you’re proud of and passionate about."

Because they sell a lot of clothing, makeup, and household items, they’re more likely to select influencers who cater to an audience who is likely to buy these things. You may have a better chance of getting approved if you’re a lifestyle, fashion, or beauty blogger. [12] X Research source For example, if you only post content about books, it would feel out of place to suddenly promote Temu’s beauty products. This doesn’t mean it’s impossible to become a Temu influencer if you post other content. However, if you regularly post about how to fix cars, for example, and are suddenly reviewing women’s fashion, your audience might not engage. In this case, you probably wouldn’t earn as much money as a creator who regularly posts fashion hauls."
