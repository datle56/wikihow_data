This method “tricks” one Mac into thinking the other is an external disk drive, making it super easy to drag and drop files between your Macs. [1] X Research source To get started, connect your Macs together with a USB, USB-C, or Thunderbolt cable. You’ll need to use a Thunderbolt cable if either of your Macs is running macOS 11 or later. Depending on what kind of ports your Macs have, you might need to use an adapter. Check this page if you need help identifying the ports on your Macs. Most modern Macs have ports that support both USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 or 4 cables. The rest of the steps for this method vary slightly depending on whether the Mac you’re using as an external disk has an older Intel processor or the newer Apple silicon (M1, M2, or M3) chip. Either way, you’ll start by connecting your Macs with a cable. To look up what kind of processor your Mac has, go to Apple menu > About This Mac ."
