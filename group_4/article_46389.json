      "title": "Wash your hands before using Tiger Balm.",
      "content": "Wash your hands before using Tiger Balm. Scrub your hands with soap and warm water, then dry them thoroughly using a clean towel. It’s important to make sure that your hands are clean and free of any substances that might potentially interfere with the ointment. [1] X Research source You’ll want to wash your hands again after handling Tiger Balm to remove any lingering residue."

      "title": "Spread a generous amount of Tiger Balm over the affected area.",
      "content": "Spread a generous amount of Tiger Balm over the affected area. Scoop up the ointment with your fingers and rub it onto the part of your body that hurts. You’ll feel it begin to warm your skin and produce a mild tingling sensation instantly. [2] X Research source Start with a pea-sized bead to avoid leaving your skin greasy. You can apply more if you need to cover a particularly broad area or desire even more warming relief. Tiger Balm is also sold as a cream, gel, liniment, and spray, making it easy to find a product that suits your individual needs."

      "title": "Rub the Tiger Balm into your skin until it disappears completely.",
      "content": "Rub the Tiger Balm into your skin until it disappears completely. Gently massage the affected area using smooth, circular strokes. As you do, your skin will gradually absorb the ointment, which will numb and promote blood flow to the tissues underneath. Have someone else help you work the ointment into hard-to-reach spots, such as your lower back or the spot between your shoulder blades. Your skin may become slightly flushed or red after applying Tiger Balm. This is totally normal. The improved circulation created by topical ointments like Tiger Balm may help speed up the healing process for minor injuries like bruises and sprains. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Repeat the process up to 3-4 times a day.",
      "content": "Repeat the process up to 3-4 times a day. According to the product directions, you can reapply Tiger Balm as needed every 6-8 hours. Regular applications can help you alleviate pain throughout the day if you’re dealing with injury or soreness that’s causing constant discomfort. [4] X Research source Applying Tiger Balm too frequently may lead to prolonged numbing, which can be uncomfortable in itself. Prolonged numbing isn't dangerous, but it is temporarily unpleasant!"

      "title": "Rub Tiger Balm on your forehead and temples to ease headaches.",
      "content": "Rub Tiger Balm on your forehead and temples to ease headaches. Massage a small amount of ointment onto the parts of your head where the pain is strongest, then lie down and close your eyes. The throbbing ache of mild tension headaches should begin to fade within a few short minutes.

      "title": "Inhale the scent of Tiger Balm to open up your airways.",
      "content": "Inhale the scent of Tiger Balm to open up your airways. Smear a streak of ointment underneath your nose, or simply take a deep whiff straight from the jar. The powerful vapors will help clear your stuffy sinuses and allow you to breathe easy once again. [7] X Research source Be careful not to spread the ointment too close to your nostrils or the inside of your nose itself."

      "title": "Apply Tiger Balm to your chest when you’re suffering from a cold.",
      "content": "Apply Tiger Balm to your chest when you’re suffering from a cold. A little Tiger Balm can reduce the severity of many symptoms of respiratory illnesses. Just rub some onto your upper chest before you go to bed to soothe your sore throat, combat congestion, and make breathing less of a chore. [8] X Research source Tiger Balm is less than half the price of other, similar products commonly used to treat head and chest colds."

      "title": "Dab Tiger Balm on bug bites to stop the itching.",
      "content": "Dab Tiger Balm on bug bites to stop the itching. You’ll quickly forget about the itchiness and irritation thanks to the distracting effect of the ointment’s warmth and pleasant tingle. Don’t forget that you can reapply Tiger Balm every 3-4 hours, which you'll definitely want to do when the itching starts again! The pungent combination of camphor and menthol can also double as a natural insect repellent. Throw a jar of Tiger Balm into your gear bag the next time you go hiking, camping, or fishing."

      "title": "Apply Tiger Balm to external areas only.",
      "content": "Apply Tiger Balm to external areas only. Be careful not to get the ointment in your eyes, nose, ears, or mouth. Similarly, you should never attempt to use Tiger Balm to treat cuts, scrapes, burns, or otherwise damaged or irritated skin. Doing so could cause intense burning. [9] X Research source If you happen to get the ointment somewhere it’s not supposed to be, flush the area thoroughly with cool water. Avoid applying Tiger Balm to any open wounds or areas with signs of infection since it could impede the healing process."

    {
      "title": "Hold off on using Tiger Balm for about 1 hour before or after bathing.",
      "content": "Hold off on using Tiger Balm for about 1 hour before or after bathing. Water will only wash off ointment that’s applied immediately beforehand. Following a shower or bath, wait at least half an hour to rub on Tiger Balm to give your skin time to return to its normal temperature. [10] X Research source This also goes for saunas, hot tubs, and other places where conditions are hot and humid."

    {
      "title": "Avoid wrapping or bandaging areas you’ve treated with Tiger Balm.",
      "content": "Avoid wrapping or bandaging areas you’ve treated with Tiger Balm. Leave freshly applied ointment uncovered for at least 1 hour. Tiger Balm is designed to warm sites of pain by increasing blood flow to the surrounding tissues. Adding other heat-trapping accessories could therefore result in swelling or overheating. [11] X Research source Covering the ointment could also partially rub it off, preventing it from being fully absorbed. If you wear a supportive brace or sleeve on a part of your body where you’ve just applied Tiger Balm, wait about an hour before putting it on to ensure that the ointment has had a chance to begin working."
