      "content": "Wait about a day to reply. Award-winning Business & Executive Career Coach and CEO Elaine Lou Cartas says, “I would suggest [sending your email] the next day, about 15 minutes before they start their work…so it's right at the top of their inbox.” If you send a thank you note immediately, you risk coming off as over-eager (or of your email being lumped in with your interview and more easily forgotten). If you wait longer than a day, you run the risk of coming across uninterested or of your interviewer forgetting the details of your interview."

      "content": "Craft a brief but explanatory subject line. Elaine Lou Cartas advises keeping your heading short and sweet: “‘Thank you for the interview’…should be the subject heading.” Or, consider reminding them who you are and what you interviewed for in your subject, too. For example, Thank You –Darcy Bryant, Editor."

      "title": "Greet your interviewer respectfully, but warmly.",
      "content": "Greet your interviewer respectfully, but warmly. Start off your letter by addressing the interviewer by name. Offering a friendly but professional greeting sets a positive tone for your message. [1] X Research source Dear Joann Menendez, Good afternoon, Dr. Walters,"

    {
      "title": "Express gratitude for their time and attention.",
      "content": "Express gratitude for their time and attention. The primary purpose of your email is to thank your interviewer for the opportunity to discuss the position and your qualifications for the role. [2] X Research source State this upfront in your email, and be genuine, but not gushy. I hope you’re doing well! I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with you on Tuesday, and I wanted to reach out to express my thanks for your time."

    {
      "title": "Refer back to key points from the interview.",
      "content": "Refer back to key points from the interview. “Reiterate why you would be a good fit for the position, and how it would support them,” Elaine Lou Cartas says. This will help show you’re passionate about the job and that you were paying attention during the meeting. “And I would advise the candidate to go a step further,” Kolby Goodman, Career and Job Search Coach and Founder of The Job Huntr, says. “Don't just showcase your skills, don't just highlight your features. Talk about your benefits: how can that employer benefit from the skills and the expertise that you bring?” For instance, I’m excited to work with customers face-to-face in this role. I improved customer retention in my last position and am confident I’d be an asset in this role as well."

      "title": "Acknowledge a personal detail the interviewer shared.",
      "content": "Acknowledge a personal detail the interviewer shared. Elaine Lou Cartas advises referring not only to the professional details covered in the meeting, but to “something personal that maybe [the interviewer] shared” to help you forge a deeper connection. “Something like, ‘Greg, it was so great to know that we both came from the same college.’” A few friendly asides can make your email (and you) stand out, but don’t drag your email out. A brief email shows you respect your interviewer’s time. “Wasting someone's time, that's what we don't want to do,” says Kolby Goodman. “[That’s] a very easy way to burn bridges fast and to make these informational interviews just one-off conversations versus an opportunity to develop a genuine human-to-human relationship.”"

Please let me know if you’ve got any questions for me or if there’s anything I can do to move forward with the hiring process. I’m eager to move forward in the process and look forward to hearing back from you soon. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions for me."

      "content": "Review your spelling and grammar. Be sure to proofread your email before sending it. It’s unlikely a misplaced comma will cost you the job, but misspelling the interviewer’s name or forgetting to sign off could make you come across like a less-than-perfect candidate. [5] X Research source It’s best to wait a day to send your email, but you can draft your email immediately. The details will be fresh on your mind and it’ll give you plenty of time to proofread your writing. Try enlisting a buddy to check over your email before you send it."
