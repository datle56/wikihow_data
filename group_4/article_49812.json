      "content": "Understand the basic goals of all audit reports. Before delving into the specifics of writing an audit report, it is important to have a broad view of the major objectives of all audit reports. Having these in mind as you delve into the technicalities of writing a report will make sure your report does what it is supposed to do. [1] X Research source Illustrating non-conformities: The main goal of any audit report is to illustrate where the organization does not conform to whatever standard, rule, regulation, or objective that it is supposed to. It is important to identify the non-conformity, as well as the standard it does not conform to. It is then important to demonstrate which evidence you used to confirm the non-conformity. The goal is that each non-conformity will contain enough information so that the receivers of the audit report can change it. Outlining positives: An audit report should not just include negatives. This is especially true for compliance reports and operational audits. This allows the organization to focus on areas that are working and apply these to other areas. For example, if you are conducting a compliance audit to ensure an organization meets training requirements, you may say, \"The audit reveals the current training program has exceeded requirements on time and budget\". Opportunities for improvement: Beyond indicating things that are not conforming to requirements (non-conformities), it is important to also indicate high-risk areas, or areas that may be in compliance but are at risk of eventually not complying, or could be improved."

      "content": "Learn the different types of audits. An audit is considered an official examination to verify that proper policies and procedures were followed, and therefore, an audit can take many forms. [2] X Research source Financial Audit: This is the most commonly known form of audit and refers to the systematic review of a company's financial reporting to ensure all information is valid and conforms to GAAP standards. Operational Audit: An operational audit is a review of an organization's usage of resources to ensure those resources are being utilized as efficiently and effectively as possible to accomplish the mission and goals of the organization. Compliance Audit: A compliance audit is performed to determine if an organization or program is operating in according with laws, policies, regulations, and procedures. Investigative Audit: These are typically commissioned when there is an assumed violation of rules, regulations, or laws, and may involve a blend of all the previously mentioned types of audit."

      "title": "Learn the types of audit opinions.",
      "content": "Learn the types of audit opinions. If you are writing a financial audit report, for example, it is important to understand that four basic types of opinions can be expressed. Which opinion you express affects the tone, structure, and organization of an audit report, and the type of opinion you express is determined by the results of the audit. Other types of audits (like operational and legal audits) can use the same types of opinions. A clean opinion is used if an entity's financial statements are a clear representation of an entity's financial opinion. A qualified opinion is used when there were scope limitations on the auditor's work. Scope limitations are restrictions on the audit caused by the client or other events that do not allow the auditor to complete all aspects of his or her audit procedures. An adverse opinion is used if financial information was misstated. A disclaimer opinion can be triggered by several different situations. For example, the auditor may not be independent, or there are concerns with the auditee. [3] X Research source"

There are certain style guidelines you need to follow for any audit report, so make sure you know what these principles are before you begin to write. [4] X Research source Provide perspective for the reader, giving a fair balance of the positive and negative results of the audit. Be precise, and avoid redundant phrasing and inexact terminology. In the interest of clarity, opt for shorter sentences over longer ones. A limit of 15 to 18 words is recommended in business writing. Also, avoid intensifiers like clearly, special, key, and reasonable as these lack precision. Do not use passive voice. Passive voice can be difficult to read. Instead of saying \"No irregularity of operation was found,\" say \"The audit team found no evidence of irregularity.\" Use bullet points, which break up difficult information and make it clearer for the reader. Use gender neutral terms. Do not use audit buzzwords. Buzzwords are ambiguous, overused phrases like \"generally improved,\" \"significant risk,\" and \"tighten controls.\""

A standard outline is comprised of headings, marked by Roman Numerals, and subsections that use letters, numbers, or lowercase Roman Numerals. Pick an organizational strategy that works for you and go from there. For example, if you are auditing the processes for a particular department of an organization, you may consider breaking the department up into several key sections and reporting findings that way."

Condition is how effectively department management is meeting goals and/or achieving standards. Goals can either be fully achieved, partially achieved, or not achieved. Cause is a statement on the reason things have gone well or poorly. Possibilities include inadequate procedures, procedures not being followed, poor supervision, or unqualified employees. Effect states the result of the conditions, in quantifiable terms. Is the effect increased risk or exposure? Is it monetary cost? Is it poor performance?

Be very clear as to what specific aspects do not adhere to protocol, and to what concrete steps could be potentially implemented to ensure compliance. Identify who should act.

The memo should be one or two short paragraphs outlining who and what was audited, who has received or is receiving the report, and plans for future distribution. A table of contents follows the memo, and it contains a catalogue of chapters, page numbers, sections, and suggestions for the audit. The report should be written in plain, non-technical language and use proper grammar and paragraph organization. Reports are organized by chapters, each with a title, and by sections and subsections, each marked with a heading. Headings should go from general to more specific."
