You will need to look at your soft skills, experiences and background to help you develop a strong resume despite these deficiencies. Also, check out creating a resume when you have no experience. Make sure you don’t use distracting formats in your resume. Avoid fancy fonts and colors. Don’t make your resume too long—work toward it being about the length of one page. Showcase your skills and background. The hiring manager wants to know about your potential to be successful with them. Since you don’t have a lot of work experience, focus on things like your ability to meet deadlines, your customer service skills, professionalism, organization skills, teams and projects you have worked on successfully, fundraising work, hobbies, contests or competitions you have won. Don’t forget school grades. [1] X Research source"

Understand that you may not get the first job you apply to but if you keep trying, you are bound to get something. If you are serious about living on your own, you need to be serious at looking for a job. Check local listings as well as online sites such as Monster.com, LinkedIn or Indeed.com. Go in and drop off your resume. Fill out applications at places with open positions as well as those you’d like to work at. Do it every day of the week until you are offered a position. Call your contacts. Your friends, family members, neighbors, teachers and others may know someone hiring. Networking this way and letting everyone know you are in the market for a job can be a beneficial way to “get your foot in the door” somewhere. Look for a job doing something you're good at or that you can prove you’d be good at. You don’t need to be a perfect match for the position but if you know you can take phone calls and talk to people, then a customer service job at a call center may be a good fit."

You want to use your winning personality to help you get the job position. Remember, your goal is always to get an offer. Why do you think you’d be great at this job? If you don’t have experience, think of personal traits you can bring to the job. Have stories of past experiences that demonstrate you can be successful, particularly with this job position. Be both confident and show humility. You need to convince them you can do the job but that you’re willing to learn as well. Know your strengths and weaknesses but always paint weakness in a positive light. For example, maybe you used to be shy but now you understand the importance of making connections with people and make an effort to greet strangers, make new friends and be an engaged communicator.

Making money allows you to live on your own, teaches you valuable new skillsets, shows you what you will and will not enjoy doing long-term and provides valuable references. So do whatever it takes to earn money today. Don’t wait for that perfect job before making money. The job you get today does not have to be the job you’re doing years later. Wait tables at night, clean houses, deliver pizza or newspapers early in the morning so you can look for a job during day hours. Start your own service doing jobs during your off hours. You can choose to do yardwork, wash cars, walk dogs, chores or babysitting. The goal is to do these things regularly enough to earn enough money to support yourself. Consider non-traditional jobs like trying out for roles in commercials, movies, theater, radio and TV. Actors and performers are usually paid well and can make royalties. Check out temporary jobs. Temporary employment firms often hire individuals to do jobs in many fields on a temporary basis. You will be told how long the position will need you so you can get an idea when to start looking for jobs again. Doing temporary work gives you an opportunity to earn skills and make connections."

Recognize that you may be limited in some ways but that you have a lot to offer in other areas. Focus on what you have to offer. If a lack of experience is continually coming back to haunt you in your job search, you should think about ways to earn that experience. Examples might be part-time internships or volunteering. It can be a bummer to work for free for a while before you move out but everyone has to start somewhere."

Take a look at inexpensive, local colleges to see what programs are offered. Many colleges have dorms that can help you learn to live on your own. Meals are often provided as well. If you or your family can’t afford college housing, financial aid can often cover some or all of it. Speak to your local college about your possibilities. Colleges also often offer work-study opportunities. These part-time jobs can give you the experience and references you need to get into higher level positions when you graduate. Work study is usually part of your financial aid package. Ask your financial aid department for details."

You can also try sites like craigslist.org but be sure to check out each potential roommate’s references and do background checks before moving in with anyone you don’t know. Some apartments might be willing to provide two separate leases for each roommate so that you each pay the apartment complex directly. Some areas are less expensive than others.

Otherwise, venture out with your roommate and find some good deals on houses/apartments. You will likely both need to sign a lease or rental agreement. Call up the apartment complexes in your city and start asking questions. How much is rent? What utilities are included? Does the place come fully furnished? These questions give you important information that can ultimately lead to making a decision. Be aware that many apartments charge an application fee (usually $25-50) as well as require a security deposit and/or first and last month's rent. You may also be responsible for renter's insurance. Be sure you have enough saved up to cover these extra costs. Pay the required fees and sign the lease--a 12 month lease is standard but some apartments may offer 6 month or even month-to-month options, which can be good if you want to try out a certain location or roommate. When you have decided on an apartment, take pictures of the exterior and interior before moving in so you have proof that any damage existed before you got there. Keep the images along with the date they were taken somewhere safe in case you ever need them. Make sure you understand the rules at your new apartment--not following them can get you into trouble. Are pets allowed? If so, is there a pet deposit required?"

You might need a copy of your lease, so be sure to have it handy. Bundle your services. Phone and internet companies often have deals where you can pay for multiple services at a discount. Because you are now paying for your utilities, you’ll want to be as energy efficient as possible. Buy energy efficient lightbulbs and turn off the lights whenever possible.

When you do cook a meal, make enough to last more than one day. Since there is likely to be only you and possibly another person or two, this shouldn’t be too difficult. Double or triple the ingredients. Refrigerate or freeze extra for later. Avoid spending money on fast food or going out to eat too often. While eating out is usually quicker than making food at home, it costs a lot more. These expenses can really add up. Take advantage of invitations.

You will want to wash them, either by hand or in a dishwasher. Don’t forget to dry them and put them away. Take out the trash whenever it gets full.
