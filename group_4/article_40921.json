      "content": "Wash the potatoes thoroughly. To do this, simply vigorously scrub the outside of the potatoes with a scrub brush and water to remove any dirt or chemicals. You don’t need to peel the potatoes. In fact, leaving the skins on will help them keep their shape once they soften."

      "content": "Boil 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water in a pot with a steamer basket. A metal sieve or colander can be used in place of a steamer basket. Make sure the water is not touching the steamer basket. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the potatoes in the steamer basket with the largest ones on the bottom. The smaller ones can then go on top. [2] X Research source If your potatoes don’t all fit in the steamer basket at once, cook them in batches. You may want to cut the larger potatoes be the equivalent size of the smaller ones. This will help them cook evenly."

      "title": "Cover the pot tightly with a lid.",
      "content": "Cover the pot tightly with a lid. This is an incredibly important step - the lid is what traps the moisture in and steams the potatoes. [3] X Research source Covering the pot also keeps the temperature inside the pot hotter so that the potatoes can cook faster."

      "title": "Cook the potatoes for about 10-15 minutes on medium heat.",
      "content": "Cook the potatoes for about 10-15 minutes on medium heat. Keep in mind that larger potatoes may take longer while smaller potatoes could be done in less time. [4] X Research source You’ll know the potatoes are cooked completely when you can easily cut through them with a butter knife. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrub the potatoes under running water. Use a scrub brush to get rid of dirt or debris on the skins. Don't soak the potatoes as this can actually remove some of their nutrients. [6] X Research source There's no need to peel the potatoes."

      "title": "Fill a medium pot with 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of water.",
      "content": "Fill a medium pot with 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of water. You don't need much water, just enough to create moisture when covered with a lid later on. The more water you put in the pot, the longer it will take to boil. A sprinkle of sea salt in the water will add flavor to your potatoes."

      "content": "Place 3 balls of aluminum foil in the pot, laying a heat-proof plate on top. Make the balls about the size of a golf ball, or at least big enough that the plate is not in the water. They should all be the same size, too. [7] X Research source You can use a small baking rack instead of a plate, if desired."

[10] X Research source Always cut at the thickest section of the potato because this will be the last part to cook through. [11] X Research source Baby potatoes work best for steaming. Larger potatoes can take 20 minutes or more. [12] X Research source"
