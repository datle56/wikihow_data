It is also helpful to stand over a plugged sink while removing your contacts. That way, if you accidentally drop a contact, it will land in the sink and will be easier to find than if you dropped it onto the floor. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Put your non-dominant hand or a lint-free towel below your eye. This will help you to catch the contact lens when it comes out of your eye. You do not want to drop your contact onto the sink, counter, or floor if you can avoid it because doing so may introduce lint, irritating particles, or bacteria onto your contact."

      "title": "Position your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Position your dominant hand. On the eye you have chosen, place the tip of the index finger of your dominant hand on the center of the upper eyelid, near your eyelashes. Place the tip of either your middle finger or your thumb — whichever is most comfortable — on the center of your lower eyelid. Gently pull the eyelids back, away from the eye, and push in. [6] X Research source This will pull your upper and lower eyelids back a little bit, exposing your waterline on each eyelid. The waterline is the inner rim of your eyelid, between your eyelashes and your eye. Do not pull your eyelids back too far. You just want to expose your waterline, not the inside of your eyelid. Keep your hand steady, and do not dig your fingernails into your eyelid as you press down to avoid injuring yourself."

      "title": "Blink your eye.",
      "content": "Blink your eye. While holding your eyelids back and gently pushing down with your two fingers, blink your eye forcefully. When you blink, you should move your two waterlines together by moving the bottom lash line up and the top lash line down. This will squeeze the top and bottom edges of your contact lens. Your lens should fall right out onto your hand or towel. If your lens does not fall out the first time you blink, repeat this step. [7] X Research source"
