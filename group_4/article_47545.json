      "content": "Pick a shirt that best fits your body type. Looking good is important, but feeling good is as well. Just because your shirt is oversized, doesn’t mean it should be too big for you. The shape and cut is very important. The oversized shirt should be an item in your wardrobe that you can seamlessly rock any day of the week. Being confident and comfortable with your style will make any clothes you wear look even better. The collar of the shirt should fit comfortably without sagging below your neck line. The shoulder seam of the t-shirt should sit right where your shoulders and arms meet. Your sleeves can reach as far as your elbow, but shouldn’t droop past them. The length of your oversized t-shirt should run past your crotch, but stop well before your knees, preferably at your upper thigh."
