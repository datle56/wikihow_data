    {
      "title": "Jot down what you should know.",
      "content": "Jot down what you should know. For math, science, and similar tests, you should have an idea of which concepts the teacher will be testing your knowledge of. Put all of them down on paper so you can check off the ones you learn. This also gives you a way to organize the concepts in your head. Find some practice problems. Some good places to look are your textbook, on pages you didn’t do in class or homework, or the review section in the back of the book. A study guide would be ideal for this as well. If you don’t have anything to give you practice problems, you may have to write your own. Though this is more time-consuming, it may help you learn the concept. To write a practice problem, after all, you have to have some understanding of the concept or formula."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take a stab at working through a problem.",
      "content": "Take a stab at working through a problem. It is a good idea to go ahead and see how close you are to understanding the theory. This will save you from wasting time on a problem you could already almost solve. Prioritizing your time will mean that when you get stuck, you will have less to look up in your notes and textbook. After you get stuck, use your notes to work through the problem. Graded homework is another good place to find solutions to problems like the one you’re working on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Retry the first concept.",
      "content": "Retry the first concept. After you have used your notes to solve the first practice problem, try another one. The goal is to be able to solve each kind of problem without help from your notes. If you can get it on your second or third try, then you can move onto the next concept. Repeat this process until you have mastered the concept."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move onto the next concept.",
      "content": "Move onto the next concept. Go down your checklist using the book as you need it to solve practice problems. You want to move quickly down the list, but make sure you are internalizing the formulas you need. It will be much less stressful later on if you have taken the time to memorize everything at first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make and take your own practice test.",
      "content": "Make and take your own practice test. Writing your own test or study guide will help you in more ways than one. First, you have to think about and work through a theory or formula in your head in order to come up with a practice problem. Second, going back through and solving the problems makes you actually walk through the process on paper, and see which methods do and don’t work. [1] X Research source Organize the practice test like you did your notes. Have a subheading with each concept or chapter, then give 2-3 practice problems."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down the overarching concepts you need to know.",
      "content": "Write down the overarching concepts you need to know. Contrary to popular belief, humanities subjects like English and History are not just rote memorization. It is much more important to know the importance of the ideas you read about than simply who said them. Your test will likely have some component of free writing, and this is the space to really impress your teacher. Be aware that it's very difficult to cram for a test that asks you to discuss the importance of themes and overarching concepts, as that isn't something you can quickly quiz with flashcards. Try to formulate some \"big picture\" questions and come up with answers to them. For example, if you're studying for a History exam, you could try a question like this: \"What are a few of the contributing factors to the start of the American Revolution?\" Then, list some factors and how they helped start the war."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down as many specific terms as you can.",
      "content": "Write down as many specific terms as you can. While learning the overarching concepts is the purpose of a humanities exam, you will likely also be expected to know the names, dates, and terms. Go through your notes and write down as many of them as you can find. You may not be able to learn all of these, but writing them down stores them in the back of your mind in a place you might be able to access later. For a history test, look for names, dates, eras, organizations, political movements, etc. For an English test, write down characters, authors, years, major works, literary movements, etc."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cluster similar ideas.",
      "content": "Cluster similar ideas. The next step in learning ideas for a humanities exam is developing associations between all the terms. This mental map will help you connect the individual terms to the overall concepts. If you want, you can even draw out a map, or ‘spider web,’ between names and dates to help visualize how they relate to one another."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn some names and dates.",
      "content": "Learn some names and dates. Now that you have put together the basic concepts and some of the major terms in your mind, you need to learn some little details. The best way to do this is repetition and memorization. Rote memorization may be tedious, but it’s your only shot this late in the game. Draw a straight line in the middle of a piece of paper. Write a name or date on the left side, and what you need to know about it on the other. Fold the paper in half and only look at one side at a time. This is an easy way to quiz yourself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go back and quiz yourself on concepts you already looked at.",
      "content": "Go back and quiz yourself on concepts you already looked at. Every time you reinforce what you’ve already learned, it becomes more imprinted in your mind. This will make it easier for your brain to access the information in the test tomorrow. However, if it is already late, go to bed and help your brain recover that way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down the lessons you need to know.",
      "content": "Write down the lessons you need to know. You want to learn every aspect of a language over time, but you don’t have time for that right now. Don’t worry about becoming fluent overnight, because you won’t be able to. Instead, focusing your learning will help you demonstrate mastery of the concepts that will earn you a good grade. A few examples of vocabulary sets are kitchen and dining, transportation, and animals. Some examples of grammatical units are irregular verbs, past tense, or adjective endings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use flashcards for vocabulary.",
      "content": "Use flashcards for vocabulary. Write the English word on one side, and the other language on the flip side. Cutting your index cards in half is a good way to conserve them. After all, you only need a little space to squeeze in a word or phrase. A way to make this even easier for your brain to associate a concept with its word in a foreign language is with drawings. For example, if you’re trying to learn die Gabel, German for fork, drawing a fork on one side rather than the English word fork may help you connect the concept to the German word."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write sentences to practice grammar.",
      "content": "Write sentences to practice grammar. As tedious as this is, it is the best way to learn grammar. Write a sentence for each tense and/or word ending. Afterwards, you can choose to write more sentences, or to read over the ones you already wrote, partially memorizing them. Grammar is an essential part of languages, so you should spend time on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice speaking out loud.",
      "content": "Practice speaking out loud. If you are no longer in entry level courses, your test may involve a speaking component. Luckily, this is pretty easy to do if you are already studying. When you are using flash cards, say the word before you flip it over. Similarly, say the sentences you are writing out loud. This will get you in the habit of saying the words that you will need for the test tomorrow. Make sure you are pronouncing the word correctly. Some languages are easier for beginners to learn the intonations than others, but your teacher will respect that you have done your best for your skill level. Speaking out loud in the language will also help you with circumlocution. This is the ability to find ways to describe what you want to say if you can’t remember the word. For example, if you can’t remember the word fork, saying something like “this is a small kitchen tool that is not a spoon or a knife, that you use to eat chicken.” Your teacher may not give you full credit, but may be impressed with your ability to use the language to describe what you mean."

      "title": "Plan what you will study.",
      "content": "Plan what you will study. If you have only a few hours to cram for a test, every minute counts. A smart plan of attack will allow you to learn the most important concepts for your test. You’ll have to save learning the little details for the next test, when you plan ahead enough time for studying. [2] X Research source Look at any information the teacher has given you about the test: study guides, the syllabus, etc. Divide your time according to each unit or chapter you’re responsible for knowing. If one is much bigger than another, adjust your time accordingly. Jot down where to find book chapters and personal notes for each chapter. If you know ahead of time what concepts you need to learn, jot them down quickly so you have a goal for each section. It may be helpful to start each study session with the topics that you struggle with the most, then move onto easier subjects that you feel more confident in.

      "content": "Study in short, concentrated increments. Try studying for 45 minutes out of every hour, then taking a break. This will help you stay focused and keep your brain performing optimally. [3] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020.

      "title": "Don’t study in bed.",
      "content": "Don’t study in bed. Your brain normally associates your bed with sleep. The first problem with studying in bed is that you will feel sleepy and learn less effectively. The second problem is that you’ll gradually reconfigure your brain, making it associate bed with staying awake. This will make it more difficult for you to fall asleep when you want to. If you don’t have a desk or workspace, try a kitchen or dining room table. Couches may be a comfortable place to work, but they may be too comfortable. If you find yourself less alert studying on a sofa, move to a table."

      "title": "Get enough sleep.",
      "content": "Get enough sleep. You might think that studying all night will help you learn more for your test, and therefore it’s a good idea. However, learning every fact in the book won’t help you if you’re too sleepy to take the test. You’re much better off learning what you can and getting a good night’s rest. After all, you may have to accept the fact that you aren’t getting a 100 on this test. Getting enough sleep will help you get the best grade possible. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wake up with enough time to get ready.",
      "content": "Wake up with enough time to get ready. You don’t want to wake up so late that you’re rushing to get ready and stressing yourself out. However, you also don’t want to wake up with enough time to overthink the test. Do all your studying the night before, get some sleep, wake up the next morning, and get to school on time."
