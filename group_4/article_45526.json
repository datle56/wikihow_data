As you may have figured by now, Instagram does not make it very easy to unhide tagged photos–once you hide a photo, the only way to find it again is to go to the profile of the person who originally posted it. You can do this by clicking the magnifying glass icon towards the bottom left of the screen, then using the Search bar to search for their name. Once you find the right profile, tap it to see their photos. [1] X Research source While there's no easy way to view the tagged photos you hid, we have come up with a workaround for next time you want to hide a photo you're tagged in. If you hid the photo recently, it should be near the top of the person's profile."
