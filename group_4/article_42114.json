Chest pains may spread to other parts of the body, including the neck, shoulders, back, jaw, teeth, and abdomen.

However, women (and some men) may suffer a heart attack with only mild chest pains, or without experiencing chest pain at all. Women – as well as elderly people and people with diabetes – are also more likely to experience the following symptoms of a heart attack, with or without chest pain: Women may experience chest pain that does not conform to what is perceived as the sudden, crushing pain of a heart attack. This pain may appear and recede, begin slowly and increase in severity over time, ease with rest and increase during physical exertion. Pain in the jaw, neck or back are common signs of a heart attack, particularly for women. Pain in the upper abdomen, cold sweats, nausea, and vomiting are more common in women than men. These signs can be misinterpreted as pointing to heartburn, indigestion or the flu. Breaking out in cold, nervous sweat is a common symptom in women. Usually, this will feel more like stress or anxiety, rather than normal sweating following exercise or other physical activities. Anxiety, unexplained panic attacks and a sense of impending doom are more common symptoms for women than men. Sudden, unusual or unexplained fatigue, weakness and lack of energy are common signs of a heart attack in women. These symptoms can last a short period of time or persist for several days. Shortness of breath, lightheadedness and fainting. [12] X Research source [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

If you or somebody you know experiences one or more of the common signs of a heart attack, seek medical attention immediately. Speed is critical. Around 60% of deaths from a heart attack occur within the first hour. On the other hand, those that reach a hospital within the first hour and a half have a higher chance of survival than those who arrive later. [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Many people mistake the signs of a heart attack for other ailments, including heartburn, the flu, anxiety, and more. It is important that you don’t ignore or downplay symptoms that may point to a heart attack, but seek help immediately. Symptoms can be quite different from person to person, may appear in mild or severe forms, and may appear and recede and reappear over several hours. Some people can suffer a heart attack after showing only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.

[18] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Many heart attack fatalities occur because victims fail to receive swift medical attention, and their failure to do so is often caused by their own hesitation to act. If you feel any of the above symptoms, don't try to wait them out. Immediately call your country's local emergency number (if you're abroad and don't know the number, try 1-1-2 for Europe and Asia or 9-1-1 for the Americas). While it's true that the symptoms could be harmless if you are indeed suffering a heart attack your life depends on getting medical attention as quickly as possible. Don't be afraid of being embarrassed or wasting the doctors' or paramedics' time – they will understand. Emergency medical personnel can begin treatment as soon as they arrive, so calling for emergency assistance is the fastest way to get help during a heart attack. Don’t drive yourself to the hospital. If medical personnel can’t reach you in good time, or if there are no other emergency options, have a family member, friend or neighbor drive you to the closest emergency room."

If your situation worsens, your life may depend on someone giving you CPR, and you're more likely to get effective help if people know what's going on. If you're on the road, stop the car and flag down a passing motorist, or call 9-1-1 and wait if you are somewhere where paramedics can quickly reach you. If you're on an airplane, notify a flight attendant immediately. Commercial airlines carry medication on board that may be helpful, and the flight attendant can also find out if there's a doctor on the plane and perform CPR if necessary. Pilots are also required to detour to the nearest airport if a passenger is having a heart attack."

Inactivity, obesity, high cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure, stress, and smoking all increase the risk of a heart attack. Reduce your consumption of saturated and trans fats. Aim to avoid foods that contain partially hydrogenated oils. Lower your cholesterol. This can be accomplished through diet, regular exercise or a cholesterol medication as prescribed by your doctor. A good way to lower your cholesterol is to eat oily fish, which contain the omega-3 fatty acid. Cut down on alcohol consumption. Only drink the recommended daily amount of alcohol, and avoid binge drinking. Reduce your weight. A healthy body mass index is between 18.5 and 24.9. Exercise. Consult with your doctor on how you can start an exercise program. A supervised cardiovascular exercise program is ideal but not necessary. With your doctor's advice you can work out a program of cardiovascular exercise (e.g., walking, swimming) based on your current level of fitness and focused on reasonable, achievable targets over time (e.g., walk around the block without getting \"short-of-breath\"). Stop smoking. Quitting smoking immediately can reduce your risk of heart attack by half.
