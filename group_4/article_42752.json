      "content": "Find a saddle (optional). You don't technically need a saddle to tame a horse. You do need a saddle to ride the horse after you've tamed it, though. If you skip this step, you'll still be able to lead the horse around and breed it, and sit on its back without controlling it. [1] X Research source Saddles cannot be crafted. You can find saddles in naturally appearing treasure chests, get them by trading with villagers. You can find them by fishing as well, but they will show up only about 1 in 120 tries with an ordinary fishing rod."

      "title": "Find the horse.",
      "content": "Find the horse. Horses will only spawn in Savanna or Plains biomes. [2] X Research source These are mostly flat, grassy areas with a few scattered trees. Horses come in several different colors and have slight pattern differences as well. Donkeys are found in the same locations. They are smaller than horses and have longer ears. They are tamed in the same way, though there are other differences explained below."

      "content": "Interact with the horse with an empty hand. Select an empty spot on your hotbar, so you are not holding anything. Right-click the horse to move onto its back. [3] X Research source On consoles, use the basic control for interacting with objects."

      "title": "Repeat until the horse is tamed.",
      "content": "Repeat until the horse is tamed. The first time you try to ride the horse, it will almost always buck and kick your character off. Just keep getting back on; each time you try the chance of succeeding is higher. Eventually, a swarm of hearts will appear around the horse. This means it is tamed. [4] X Research source Keep reading to learn how to control the horse. You have roughly a 5% chance of taming on your second try, and can usually tame a horse within six attempts. You might get unlucky and have to try several more times, though."

      "title": "Feed the horse to increase the chance of taming it.",
      "content": "Feed the horse to increase the chance of taming it. This is usually unnecessary, but try it if the horse keeps throwing you and you get frustrated. Just hold the food in your hand and right-click the horse. This will use up your food, but make future taming attempts easier. [5] X Research source Each unit of sugar, apple, and wheat helps a little, adding another 3% to your chances. Golden carrots add another 5% chance, and golden apples add a 10% chance. You might want to save these for breeding, however, as described below."

When you get on a saddled horse (or donkey), you'll be able to move around with the usual controls. Horses can jump much higher and farther than your character. Hold down the jump button to charge up a bigger jump. [6] X Research source To dismount, press the left Shift key on a computer, or the right trigger button on a console."

      "content": "Lead the horse around. Use a lead (leash) on the horse to tie it to your hand. The horse will now follow you around. While holding the horse, use the lead on a fence post to tie the horse to it. To detach the lead without tying the horse to anything, use the lead a second time on the horse. To make a lead, hunt for slimes (hostile green cubes) underground or in dark swamps, and kill them to get slimeballs. Craft a lead by placing a slimeball in the center of the crafting table, then adding string to the top left, top center, middle left, and bottom right squares. (Kill spiders to get string.)"

While riding the animal, open your inventory to see their equipment slots: [7] X Research source Horses can wear armor, protecting them from damage. You'll need special horse armor, which you can only find in treasure chests or by trading with villagers. Donkeys can hold a chest, which you can store items in as usual. [8] X Research source"

The foal cannot be tamed until it grows up, which takes about twenty minutes. You can speed up the growth by feeding it non-golden food. [9] X Research source Craft a golden apple by placing an apple in the center of the crafting area, then surrounding it with eight golden ingots. Craft a golden carrot with a carrot at the center, surrounded by gold nuggets. Breed a horse and donkey together to make a mule. Mules carry chests like donkeys, but cannot breed with any other animal."

Learn how using this guide to installing mods , if you've never tried it before. (Note that this can be difficult or impossible on some versions of iOS.) You can search for horse mods on your own, or look up the mods named \"Horses\" created by Argll or Bernard. [10] X Research source Download mods at your own risk.

In others, you might just interact with it using an empty hand. The creator usually posts these details somewhere on their website."
