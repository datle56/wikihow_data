Stir the pasta so it doesn’t stick together. When it’s finished, taste it to make sure it’s the right texture. Al dente pasta should be firm but not crunchy when you bite into it.

If your sink isn’t empty, take everything out or move it out of the way so the colander is flat and steady. [2] X Research source Make sure your sink doesn’t have any standing water in it. You don’t want dirty sink water to touch your pasta when you drain it in the colander."

      "content": "Use a ladle to reserve some of the pasta water for your sauce. Pasta water is full of salt and starches left over from the cooking process. When you add pasta water to your pasta and sauce, it makes the sauce smoother and helps it stick to the noodles. Instead of dumping all of the pasta water down the drain, reserve some for your dish. Save about 1 cup (240 mL) of pasta water before you dump the rest out. [3] X Research source Set the pasta water aside in a bowl or glass until you’re ready to use it."

      "content": "Pour the pasta and remaining pasta water into the colander. Carry the pot of pasta over to your kitchen sink, being careful not to splash yourself with any of the hot water. Slowly pour the pasta and pasta water into the colander. The water will drain out of the holes in the colander, leaving you with perfectly cooked pasta that’s ready to be mixed with some sauce. [4] X Research source Don’t rinse the pasta after you drain it. Rinsing it removes some of the starches, which are necessary for helping the sauce stick to the noodles. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Steam vegetables with a metal colander if you don’t have a steamer. You’ll need a pot that’s wide enough to hold the rim of the colander and deep enough that the colander doesn’t sit on the bottom of it. Fill the pot with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and bring it to a boil. [6] X Research source Place the colander on top with the vegetables inside, and cover the pot with a lid to trap the steam inside while everything cooks. [7] X Research source"

When you’re ready to use fresh produce, place it in a plastic or metal colander, hold it under your kitchen sink faucet, and run some cold water. Give the colander a few shakes to make sure all of the produce gets rinsed off. Then, pat the produce dry with a paper towel. Always wash your fresh produce before eating it to prevent food-borne illness. [8] X Research source"

If you’re cooking something on your stovetop and you don’t want grease to get everywhere, turn a metal colander upside down and place it over the pan you’re cooking with. The colander will catch all of the grease splatters, and you can just wipe it down with soapy water when you’re finished. Be careful touching the colander after you're done catching grease with it in case it’s hot."

Then, use a potato masher or stiff spatula to press the potatoes through the holes in the colander. Catch the mashed potatoes in a bowl underneath.

You can also use a colander to mash other things, like avocados and pumpkin."

Just take a block of semi-firm cheese, like cheddar or gruyere, and drag it along the inside of the colander. Collect the grated cheese in the bottom of the colander, then add it to your recipe when you’re ready to use it. [11] X Research source"

Place the colander on top of a large bowl, then fill it with ice and add your drinks. As the ice melts, it will drain into the bowl underneath. Instead of having your drinks sitting in a bucket of melted water, you can just add more ice whenever the old ice melts and drains away. [12] X Research source Remember to empty out the bowl underneath the colander whenever it gets full so it doesn’t overflow."
