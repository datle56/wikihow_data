      "title": "Fill a medium-sized bowl with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a medium-sized bowl with hot water. The bowl needs to be large enough to fully submerge the putty into the water. Heat the water until it’s hot but not boiling then pour it into the bowl and allow it to cool down enough so you can put your hands into it. [1] X Research source Use a microwave-safe bowl and microwave the water for 1-2 minutes until it’s hot enough to steam but not boiling. You could also use hot water from the tap if it gets hot enough to give off steam. Wait about 2-3 minutes to allow the water to cool down."

      "title": "Roll the play putty up into a ball.",
      "content": "Roll the play putty up into a ball. Take the putty in your hands and roll it around in your palms. Keep rolling it around until you’ve formed a nice round ball. [2] X Research source Use putty intended for play, like silly putty, rather than caulking or home improvement putty. Squish the ball flat a few times and then roll it back up so you can press out any air that might be trapped in it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the putty ball into the bowl of hot water and let it sit for 5 seconds.",
      "content": "Place the putty ball into the bowl of hot water and let it sit for 5 seconds. Gently drop the putty into the water so it’s fully submerged. Wait a few seconds to let the outside of the ball heat up so it becomes soft and malleable. [3] X Research source Make sure the water isn’t too hot or you could melt the putty into goo instead of slime! The water should be cool enough for you to touch, but still hot enough to give off steam."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the putty apart in the water with your hands.",
      "content": "Pull the putty apart in the water with your hands. Spend about 10-15 more seconds stretching and pulling the putty apart in the water so it’s heated evenly. Squish the putty and pull it, but try not to separate it into multiple pieces. [4] X Research source If the putty does break into pieces, pull it out of the water, squeeze the pieces together to reconnect them, then submerge it in the water again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the putty from the water and spread it out.",
      "content": "Remove the putty from the water and spread it out. When you take the putty out of the water, it will be loose and easy to stretch. Lie it down on a surface in front of you and flatten it out into a sheet. [5] X Research source Use a plate to keep the putty contained and leave less of a mess."
    },
    {
      "title": "Squirt about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of hand lotion onto the putty.",
      "content": "Squirt about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of hand lotion onto the putty. The lotion will loosen and moisten the putty to help change the texture.You don’t need a lot of lotion to change the texture of the putty. Place a dab of hand lotion in the center of the putty. [6] X Research source Add about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) for every 1 ounce (28 g) of putty. You can add a nice smell to the putty by choosing a fragrant lotion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the putty over the lotion.",
      "content": "Fold the putty over the lotion. After you’ve added your dab of lotion to the putty, fold it over onto itself so the lotion is in the center. This will help you distribute the lotion into the putty without it running or squirting out. [7] X Research source You can pinch the edges around the putty to keep the lotion contained in the center."

    {
      "title": "Use your fingers to knead the putty until it turns into slime.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to knead the putty until it turns into slime. Take the putty in your hands and use the tips of your fingers to work and knead the putty. The putty will start to change texture and become slimy. Stretch the putty and squish it back together while you’re kneading to really work the lotion into it. If the putty doesn’t get softer after you’ve kneaded it and mixed in all of the lotion, add more lotion until it starts to loosen up and turn into slime."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of hair conditioner onto the slime.",
      "content": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of hair conditioner onto the slime. To add an even more slimy texture to the putty, squirt a dab of hair conditioner onto it. Fold the slime over the conditioner so it’s in the center of it. If you don’t have any hair conditioner, use hair gel instead to make the slime gooey."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue kneading the slime until the lotion and conditioner are mixed in.",
      "content": "Continue kneading the slime until the lotion and conditioner are mixed in. Keep using your fingers to work the conditioner into the slime until it’s as gooey as you want it to be. Squish, squeeze, and pull the slime to mix the lotion and conditioner into it. Add a little more conditioner if the putty hasn’t is still solid after you’ve mixed in the lotion and conditioner."

    {
      "title": "Store the slime",
      "content": "Store the slime in an airtight container for up to a week. Your slime will eventually need to be disposed of, but you can make it last longer by storing it in the right container. Use a ziploc bag or an airtight container and keep the slime in your refrigerator. [8] X Research source Check on the slime after a few days. Throw it away if there’s mold, lots of dirt, or an unpleasant odor coming from it. Throw the slime away in a garbage can. Don’t flush it down the sink or it could clog the drain."
