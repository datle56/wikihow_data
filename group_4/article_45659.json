      "content": "Uno has officially stated that you cannot stack your cards. For decades, Uno lovers have been responding to a Draw 2 or Draw 4 card by stacking another Draw card on top and passing the burden to draw extra cards onto the next player—who may then stack their own Draw card on top. But Uno’s official Twitter account has stated that stacking Draw cards is expressly forbidden. [1] X Research source Despite Uno’s ban, many players continue to view stacking as a legitimate Uno strategy and ignore the official rules. Why stack? Stacking brings a bit more intensity to the game. Players may end up being forced to draw upwards of 12 cards."

      "content": "For the tamest stacking game, only stack Draw 2 cards. To follow the most common stacking rules, only stack Draw 2 cards. Not stacking any cards at all keeps the game relatively tame, but stacking Draw 2 cards allows you to kick up the intensity a bit. In this variation, if a player lays down a Draw 2 card, the next player may draw 2 cards or may counter the initial draw card with their own Draw 2 card, forcing the next player to draw 4 cards. You cannot stack Wild Draw 4 cards. [2] X Research source If that player has a draw card, the next player will draw 6 cards."

However, you cannot stack Draw 2 cards onto Wild Draw 4 cards and vice versa. [3] X Research source This variation offers the opportunity for a bit more excitement, as the player at the end of the stack may end up having to draw even more cards."

If a Wild Draw 4 is laid down, the next player may lay a Wild Draw 4 card or a Draw 2 card. [4] X Research source This variation allows for the possibility that the player who eventually draws will be forced to draw a lot of cards—even 12 or more! Play this variation if you’re feeling particularly vindictive."

The first player to run out of cards in each round scores points by combining the cards their opponents are left holding. Whoever earns 500 points first wins the game .

All number cards are worth their face value; Draw 2, Reverse, and Skip cards are each worth 20 points; and Wild and Wild Draw 4 cards are each worth 50 points. To avoid players getting upset mid-game when they realize stacking either is or is not allowed, establish ground rules before beginning the game!"

Wild Draw 4 cards may only be played when the player has no other appropriate cards to lay down. The player who lays this card down may choose a new color—and the player that follows them must draw 4 cards (or stack another draw card, if acceptable)."

Blank cards are also included in the deck. If you lose any standard cards, you may replace it with a Blank card.
