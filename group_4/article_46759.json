      "title": "Wash your hands",
      "content": "Wash your hands with warm water and mild soap. Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds to make sure you don’t have lingering germs or bacteria. Rinse away all of the soap, then dry your hands on a clean towel. [1] X Research source If your hands are dirty, you may transfer those germs or bacteria into your vagina, which can cause an infection. If necessary, you can use hand sanitizer to clean your hands before you insert the Softdisc."

      "title": "Squat, put up one leg, or sit on the toilet to open your vaginal canal.",
      "content": "Squat, put up one leg, or sit on the toilet to open your vaginal canal. Use the same position that you use to insert a tampon. Spread your legs and relax your muscles so that the cup can slide into your vaginal canal. [2] X Research source Choose the position that’s most relaxing for you.

      "title": "Squeeze the rim of Softdisc for easy insertion.",
      "content": "Squeeze the rim of Softdisc for easy insertion. The opposite sides of the rim should touch each other. The Softdisc will be about the size of a tampon when it’s squeezed shut. [3] X Research source If you don’t squeeze the disc, it will be difficult to insert it and it will not capture menses. The disc will lodge in place low in the vaginal canal."

      "content": "Push the Softdisc into your vaginal canal toward your tailbone. Slide your finger into your vagina in a slight downward motion, following the path of your vaginal canal. Keep pushing the Softdisc back toward your tailbone, not upwards. The Softdisc will fit just below your cervix at the top of your vaginal canal. [4] X Research source If you push it upward into the canal rather than backward, it won’t be in place and may leak. If you’re worried it went upward, take out the Softdisc and re-insert it toward your tailbone."

      "content": "Check that you can’t feel the Softdisc. The Softdisc should conform to your body’s natural shape. When it’s in place, you shouldn’t feel it at all.

      "content": "Change your Softdisc every 6-12 hours, depending on your flow. You can wear your Softdisc for up to 12 hours, which is one of the perks of using it. However, you will need to change your Softdisc more often if your period is very heavy, as the cup will fill up faster. [6] X Research source If you notice any leaks, change your Softdisc immediately. Use your knowledge of your own cycle to decide how often to change your Softdisc. When you’re first using the product, you might use a pantyliner for added protection on your heavy days."

Go slowly to reduce the risk of leaks. [9] X Research source If you’re having trouble reaching your Softdisc, reach your longest finger into your vagina. Use your finger to break the seal by pushing into the side of the Softdisc rim. This will make it easier to pull the Softdisc down so you can remove it. [10] X Research source"
