Some studies and dentists recommend electric toothbrushes for certain types of patients, but an ordinary toothbrush is fine for most people.

[4] X Expert Source Tu Anh Vu, DMD Board Certified Dentist Expert Interview. 10 April 2020. If the label lists the RDA, a measurement of abrasiveness, pick a toothbrush with a low value. An RDA below 70 is considered gentle, but you'll wear down less of your teeth the lower you go. Many labels do not display the RDA. Either look up the product's RDA online, or just stay away from whitening toothpastes, which tend to be the most abrasive. Some studies suggest that toothpaste made from hydrogen peroxide and baking soda may damage your teeth if you use them daily and frequently. Also, toothpastes that have salt in them are abrasive for your enamel."

Place your toothbrush at a 45ยบ angle against the gum line, pressing only hard enough to touch the tips against your teeth, not the bristle sides. Brush with small, vertical motions followed by circular strokes, not side-to-side strokes making sure you brush the entire surface of each tooth.

[8] X Research source In other words, proper technique is everything. Floss once a day with the following method: Cut off a 45 cm (18 inch) section of floss and wind it around your middle fingers. Hold a 2.5 to 5cm (1 to 2 inch) section between your forefingers and your thumbs. Gently guide the floss between your teeth, rubbing up and down. Bring the floss beneath the gumline, curving it to press against the tooth, not the gums. Keep moving until you feel resistance. Remember to floss two tooth surfaces at a time. This step is essential for removing the plaque that causes gum recession."

      "content": "Consider mouthwash. You may want to ask your dentist for advice first, as the wrong mouthwash can cause more harm than good. Mouth wash containing Listerine, the prescription-only Chlorhexidine mouthwash, or (to a lesser extent) fluoride will remove some of the plaque that leads to gum recession. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source However, the high alcohol content in most mouthwash can cause dry mouth, burning sensations, or even mouth ulcers, which may cause intense pain and you may not want to brush your teeth or eat for a while. Stained teeth and altered taste sensations are common as well when you overuse chlorhexidine mouthwash. To take most mouthwashes, swish liquid in mouth for thirty seconds and spit out. Do not rinse, eat, or smoke for thirty minutes afterward, for maximum effect."

Sometimes the gums recede rapidly, even if no other signs are present. This happens more often in puberty and young adulthood.

She will most likely start by cleaning your teeth with special tools: At a regular cleaning session, the dentist will brush away plaque and polish your teeth to a smooth surface. This is called \"scaling and root planing.\" [24] X Research source If you have receding gums caused by disease, the dentist will probably do the same thing lower down on your teeth: a deep cleaning . Depending on how much the gums have receded, this might take two to four appointments. This can make your mouth sore, sensitive to hot and cold, and bloody. If it causes worse pain, stop your dentist and ask for a numbing medication. [25] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn about more advanced treatments. More serious recession may require more serious treatment. Your dentist will let you know if these are a good idea, but here's a description to make them less mysterious: A pocket depth reduction cleans teeth down below the level of the gums, in \"pockets\" of air left by thinning gums. The gum is then secured back onto your teeth to hopefully slow or stop recession and in some cases bone grafts may be required to stabilize the tooth. Depending on your mouth, this may feel the same as deep cleaning, or require very minor local surgery to get access to the gums. If the recession is severe, the dentist can perform a gum graft , cutting skin from the roof of your mouth or elsewhere on your gum, and attaching it over the exposed teeth. Most patients remain awake but numbed, but if you have extreme dental fear you can be put unconscious. Most pain and swelling ends within a day, but for a week or two you should avoid alcohol and tobacco, rinse with mouthwash, and be careful while chewing.
