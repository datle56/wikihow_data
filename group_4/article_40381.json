      "content": "Identify unhealthy eating patterns. The first thing that might indicate that someone has an eating disorder is the way that they eat. This includes the types of foods they will and will not eat, the amount of food that they eat, and how they eat their food. Pay attention to the person’s eating behaviors to determine if he may have an eating disorder. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, a man with anorexia may only eat low-calorie foods, such as lettuce, celery, and carrots. He may also limit his food intake by eating extremely small servings, or by staying within a rigid calorie limit, such as 800 calories per day. You might also notice that he avoids eating around people. Someone who is bulimic might exhibit unhealthy eating patterns by eating large amounts of food, but never seeming to gain weight. However, people with bulimia are more likely to binge in secret than in front of other people, so you might never see this behavior. Pay attention to whether or not he goes to the bathroom immediately after eating. Watch for excessive overeating in men with binge-eating disorder. Men who have binge-eating disorder may eat to excess on a regular basis. They may eat this way even if they are not hungry."
