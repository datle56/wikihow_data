      "content": "Soft Natural is a body type with broad shoulders and an hourglass figure. The Soft Natural body type is a part of the 13 Kibbe body types from David Kibbe’s 1987 book Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity . Kibbe’s descriptions of the different types of bodies fall under a yin/yang spectrum—where yin represents the most feminine or romantic figure, and yang identifies the most dramatic or masculine figure. The Soft Natural ID leans toward yang, presenting a figure with a masculine frame and softer features. The Kibbe scale has 3 Natural body types: Flamboyant Natural, Pure Natural, and Soft Natural. Flamboyant Naturals have a straight and angular body type. Pure Naturals have a straight and muscular body type. Soft Naturals have a soft and proportional body type. When gaining weight, a Soft Natural’s body will become soft and full. The waist loses its definition, and the upper arms, thighs, and hips fill out first to create a rectangular shape.

      "content": "Clothing Soft Naturals shine in slightly fitted garments that define their waist. Your soft, subtle hourglass figure looks best in styles that are flowy but not oversized. Opt for clothing that fits your frame comfortably without being too tight or baggy to accentuate your proportional figure. [4] X Research source Tops: Draped, round, or open necklines Bottoms: Cinched waists, straight-leg jeans, and pants with a folded hem Skirts: Above the knee in length, flared at the end, cinched at the waist Dresses: Waist definition, unconstructed, lightweight Sweaters: Lightweight, cropped, scooped neckline Outerwear: Belted jackets and mid-thigh length Shoes: Open-toe, round-toe, or tapered sneakers"

      "content": "Fabrics Soft Naturals look best in flowing material that’s undefined, relaxed, and asymmetric. Opt for lightweight cotton, linen, and silk fabrics that drape effortlessly over your soft, angular frame. [5] X Research source As a general rule, stick with natural fibers and materials, as these will beautifully hit your subtle curves and cascade over your broad shoulders."

      "title": "Prints",
      "content": "Prints As a Soft Natural, stick with rounded prints and patterns with minimal or abstract designs. The softer the pattern is, the better. Loud and bold prints can overpower your naturally soft and broad features, so work with them by choosing garments with subtle patterns or prints. [6] X Research source For instance, go for a baby blue and ivory polka dress rather than a brightly-colored floral dress. Stick with prints that have round shapes like circles, ovals, diamonds, and hearts. Stay away from bold animal prints and loud geometric patterns. Avoid monochromatic schemes and small symmetrical prints."

      "title": "Accessories",
      "content": "Accessories Soft Naturals look best in delicate jewelry and belts. Because of your broad frame, delicate jewelry helps round your angular edges to accentuate your softer features. Belts do a fabulous job of highlighting your hourglass figure and making almost any look more feminine. [7] X Research source Stick with jewelry with rounded edges and swooping designs. Pair belts with looser clothing to cinch the waist, letting the rest of the fabric drape elegantly over your frame. Avoid bulky jewelry with elaborate designs."

      "content": "Hair If you’re a Soft Natural, stick with sleek, tidy hairstyles that open up your face. Try to avoid messy up-dos since the messier look may contrast with your soft yet masculine features. Try pin-up looks for a retro vibe. Stick with a classic slicked-back ponytail for an effortless but cute look. Keep your haircut simple and polished, with long, face-framing layers and a side or middle part."

      "content": "Makeup Soft Naturals glow in neutral tones and shimmery looks that adhere to their soft features. If you’re a Soft Natural, your best bet is always to keep your makeup natural. Opt for neutral eyeshadows, a nude or pink lip, and peachy blush to make your subtle femininity pop. [8] X Research source Go with a bold red lip on special occasions, but keep the rest of your makeup natural and subtle. Aim to accentuate one part of your face rather than every part. For example, if you want a bold makeup look with lashes and a smokey eye, go with a nude lip and a hint of bronzer."
