Carefully pull or twist the stuck cooking bowls apart. [1] X Research source You could use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other cooking oil to unstick the cooking bowls."

      "content": "Spray the point of contact between the two bowls. If you don’t have any liquid cooking oil on hand, or if you’ve found that the oil is ineffective, you could use an oil-based spray. Just spray the point of contact between the two bowls with a light coating of cooking spray. [2] X Research source Carefully pull or twist the cooking bowls apart."

      "title": "Wait for the oil to trickle between the bowls.",
      "content": "Wait for the oil to trickle between the bowls. Whether you’ve used an oil spray or liquid cooking oil, sometimes the oil won’t be effective immediately. If, after pulling or twisting the bowls apart, they are still stuck, wait about 20-30 seconds. This will give the oil time to work its way between the two cooking bowls that are stuck together. [3] X Research source If necessary, apply or spray another coat of cooking oil to loosen them."

      "content": "Place a handful of ice cubes in the upper pot. Wait five to 10 minutes. The difference in temperature will cause the top pot to contract in size and the bottom pot to enlarge slightly in size, thereby making it easier for you to unstick them. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the pots in opposite directions.",
      "content": "Twist the pots in opposite directions. For instance, you could choose to twist the bottom pot counterclockwise while twisting the top pot clockwise, or vice versa. Don a pair of rubber dishwashing gloves in order to improve your grip. [6] X Research source"
