      "content": "Evaluate your qualifications. Before applying for a promotion, you need to be sure that you qualify for the position. If you don't meet the minimum requirements, it is unlikely that a glowing recommendation or otherwise impressive resume will get you the job. Applying for a position without meeting these requirements makes the applicant look foolish and overly ambitious."

      "content": "Identify the requirements of the new position. Perhaps the most important thing you need to do is go over the requirements and desired experience of the new position. At the same time, you need to identify what qualities your potential new supervisor is looking for in the ideal candidate. Knowing this will help you gear your letter specifically toward the demands of the position. If there is one, read the job listing of the position very carefully. Note every qualification desired and experience required. If you know someone in a similar position, ask them exactly what the new position entails. If you know someone who already works under your potential new supervisor, ask them what kind of attributes their boss likes as well as any other information that might benefit you when writing the application.

      "content": "Identify the decision-maker. Although you might be applying for a promotion within an organization you work for or are familiar with, you might not be familiar with the specific individual, branch, or program within that organization. Since you might be applying for a promotion to a new division, you need to spend time investigating whoever will be reading your application for promotion. Consider: Read up on your new potential boss and find out what they are like, what their education and experience is, and what their employment record is like. Even if they don't make the hiring decision, your research will give you a better idea about who they are. The new supervisor may not always determine the promotion. In this case, identify who will be making the decision, how the process will work, and key factors that will determine the decision. Approach your current or new potential supervisor and let them know your interest. Ask them about the position and tell them about your qualifications. Be confident and energetic. Odds are they are at least involved in the hiring process for the position. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Present your intention.",
      "content": "Present your intention. Perhaps the first line in your letter should be your statement of intention. The statement of intention will clearly explain the intent of your letter. Often times, statements of intention should state your interest in a promotion followed by a statement of where you heard about the position. Consider: ”Please accept this as my letter of application for the position of General Manager of Sports X advertised on the Sports X website.” ”I am writing to apply for a promotion from Assistant Manager to General Manager of Sports X.” Your exact wording can and may vary, depending on the specifics of the position."

Perhaps the most important thing in applying for a promotion is to show that you have been successful in your current position and that you are ready for new responsibilities and challenges. Ultimately, you need to show that you are highly qualified and are the right person for the job. If your promotion is a natural, linear promotion, be prepared to provide evidence that you've mastered your current position and are familiar with the new position's responsibilities. Point out any awards or recognitions you've received. If your promotion is non-linear, be prepared to demonstrate you are qualified. For example, if you have experience with people from the division you're applying to, point it out. If you are a natural leader or manager, provide evidence. For example, highlight a time when you took lead on a project and led a group to success."

If space permits, quickly revisit the top reasons why you are the best candidate for the job. Don’t repeat, but remind the reader. Demonstrate your enthusiasm again. End the final paragraph with a sentence such as “Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing about your decision in the future.” Provide a professional closing phrase such as “Sincerely yours.” Sign letters by hand, if you can. Electronic signatures are permissible, but hand signatures demonstrate more interest and commitment to securing the position. [12] X Research source"
