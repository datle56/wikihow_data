      "content": "Determine load size. Before starting the wash cycle, determine the load size of your laundry. Make sure that your clothes, sheets, or towels are loosely packed into the washer to allow for proper cleaning and rinsing, and to prevent wrinkling and pilling. As a general rule: [1] X Research source A small load will fill about 1/3 of the washing machine. A medium or regular load means that the washer is half full. A large load fills up about ¾ of the washer. An extra-large load will fill the washer to full capacity."

      "title": "Add Tide pods.",
      "content": "Add Tide pods. Place Tide Pods at the bottom or back of your washer, then place your laundry on top. Choose the appropriate number of pods based on your load size. Use one pod for small to medium loads, two packs for large or very soiled loads, and three pods when the washing machine is at full capacity. [2] X Research source Be sure that you don’t place Tide pods in the dispenser part of your washing machine, but in the drum itself."

      "title": "Select the wash cycle.",
      "content": "Select the wash cycle. Tide pods work in all types of washing machines, in warm and cold water. Choose the correct wash cycle on your washer based on the care instructions on your clothing labels. For a breakdown of what instructions the five fabric care symbols indicate, visit Tide’s website at http://tide.com/en-us/how-to-wash-clothes/how-to-do-laundry/how-to-read-laundry-symbols . For instance, the symbol showing a water-filled basin with one dot in it indicates that an item should be washed in cold water."

      "title": "Store Tide pods securely.",
      "content": "Store Tide pods securely. Tide pods can be toxic if ingested by children or animals, which is a concern given the pods’ colorful and candy-like appearance. Store Tide pods securely in a high cupboard, out of reach for kids and pets. Be vigilant when using laundry pods (e.g. avoid putting a pod down on a counter or table while preparing laundry, or simply make sure kids and pets are out of the room before doing laundry). [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Make sure that the container is locked. The lid or zipper should not open with basic rotation or zipping. To unlock, press the zipper or lid, align it, then open. Lock Tide Pods in cupboard doors when caring for someone with dementia."

      "content": "Keep Tide pods dry. Make sure that the lid of your Tide pods container is shut firmly before storing, and that the pods are kept dry.

      "title": "Place Tide pods in the washer first.",
      "content": "Place Tide pods in the washer first. To ensure that your Tide Pods dissolve properly, always place them in the washer before you put in your laundry. Placing pods at the bottom of the machine allows for the maximum contact with water necessary to dissolve them. If you need to place laundry in the machine to gauge your load size, do so and then remove it to place the Tide pod at the back or bottom of the barrel.

      "content": "Avoid overloading your washing machine. Make sure that your washing machine is loosely packed. Overloading your machine will prevent the level of agitation during washing that is necessary for your Tide pods to completely dissolve. When placing clothing or other laundry items in the barrel, avoid pushing or pressing them in to make more room.

Pods are formulated with super-concentrated detergent that is released during the wash cycle. The stain remover included in Tide pods should be adequate for dealing with stains.
