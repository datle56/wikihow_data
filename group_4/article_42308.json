      "title": "Try cold drinks.",
      "content": "Try cold drinks. If your braces are bothering you, try cold drinks. Ice cold water and cold juices or soft drinks can help ease the pain of your teeth and gums. Cold liquids can cause a numbing sensation in the mouth, resulting in a reduction of inflammation and pain."

      "title": "Eat cold foods.",
      "content": "Eat cold foods. As cold drinks can provide pain relief, you could try cold foods to see if they have a similar effect. Try drinking chilled smoothies or eating ice cream or frozen yogurt or sugar-free popsicles. You can also refrigerate fruit, veggies, and other healthy foods so they're cool when you eat them. Cold fruits, like chilled strawberries, may have some effect on strengthening the gums. Do not, however, bite into any frozen foods, and avoid using your front teeth. Doing so may cause cracks in your enamel, which can be difficult to repair and increase sensitivity."

      "title": "Try an ice pack.",
      "content": "Try an ice pack. Icing sore areas can decrease inflammation, lessening pain. Applying an ice pack to the outside of your mouth may reduce pain. Remember, do not apply a store bought ice pack directly to bare skin. Wrap it in a towel or cloth before use to avoid frostbite and other complications."

      "title": "Use warm salt water rinses.",
      "content": "Use warm salt water rinses. A salt water rinse is an easy home remedy that help ease pain for some. It's quick and easy to use. [2] X Research source Mix about a half a teaspoon of salt into a glass of warm water. Mix until the salt is dissolved. Rinse your mouth with the solution for about 30 seconds and then spit it out into a sink. You can also rinse with chamomile tea, green tea, or ginger tea, which may have an anti-inflammatory effect. Rinse twice a day: for one minute in the morning and two minutes before going to bed."

      "title": "Stick to soft foods.",
      "content": "Stick to soft foods. Teeth tend to be very sensitive after braces are tightened or adjusted. Softer foods can help reduce pain and irritation. [3] X Research source Go for foods that do not require much movement of the teeth. Things like mashed potatoes, smoothies, puddings, soft fruits, and soups are good options. Try to avoid spicy foods and hot drinks as these can cause gum irritation."

    {
      "title": "Take over-the-counter pain medications.",
      "content": "Take over-the-counter pain medications. Simple over-the-counter pain medications may reduce swelling, inflammation, and pain associated with new braces. Try using pain killers and see if you notice an effect. Ibuprofen can help reduce pain and swelling associated with new braces. Take the medication as recommended on the bottle. Avoid alcohol when taking pain medications. If you're on any existing prescription medication, it is important to talk to a pharmacist to make sure over-the-counter meds will not interact poorly with whatever medication you're taking."

      "title": "Use dental products designed to relieve pain.",
      "content": "Use dental products designed to relieve pain. Ask your orthodontist about special gels and medicines designed to reduce pain. There are many dental products that can ease the transition into new or tightened braces. [4] X Research source Several rinses and gels have medications in them that help ease pain. Follow all instructions when taking these medications. Ask your dentist if you have any questions about the medications. Bite wafers are products shaped to fit your teeth. You bite down on these products for a set period of time, which encourages an increase in blood circulation that results in less pain. Chewing gum can also help reduce pain.

      "title": "Try barrier products.",
      "content": "Try barrier products. Barrier products are designed to provide some separation between your braces, teeth, and gums. This can help prevent irritation that causes pain and soreness. Dental wax is one of the most common and easy to use barrier products. Your dentist will give you a container of wax and you simply break off a piece and rub it on the areas that are sore. Make sure you take dental wax off before brushing your teeth as dental wax can get stuck in your toothbrush. There are also barrier products that are somewhat similar to whitening strips, known as comfort strips. You place a strip over your teeth and it forms a protective barrier between your braces, teeth, and gums. Ask your dentist about using comfort strips when you get your braces put in place."
