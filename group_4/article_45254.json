Let him know where your head is at, but give him the chance to reciprocate in a similar fashion before you run with it. A light, teasing text helps you find out when he might be open to something a little hotter. \"Hey, sexy... ðŸ˜‰ How's your day going?\" \"If you think that was hot, just wait until later.\" \"I'm trying to be good, I wouldn't want to distract you at work... or would I? ðŸ˜ˆ \" \"Let me know when you want your surprise...\""

      "content": "A Scorpio guy feels powerful when he knows something no one else does. Power is a big turn-on for him. Besides, he's super secretive himself, so if you're telling him something no one else knows, he'll feel a deep, intimate bond with you. Telling a secret also makes you vulnerable, which is an even bigger turn-on for a Scorpion. [3] X Research source \"Ok, I'll tell you the story... but you have to promise not to repeat it. I've never told anyone about this before.\" \"Can I tell you something I've never told anyone else before?\" \"OMG, I can't believe I told you that. No one knows I did that but you!\" Reader Poll: We asked 261 wikiHow readers if they think Scorpios are generally more mysterious or open, and 91% agreed that Scorpios are mysterious and it may take a while to get to know them . Sharing secrets can definitely help! [Take Poll]"

He can be super competitive (thank his co-ruling planet Mars for that) and he likes to come out on topâ€”a sexy bet really pushes all the right buttons. He'll take your bet and might even up the ante, so make sure you're ready to deliver whatever you offer. \"If the Braves win, I'll watch the next game with you wearing your jersey... and nothing else.\" \"I bet a hot oil massage you can't get a reservation at that restaurant tonight.\" \"I bet a striptease you won't score a goal in this game.\""

Don't worry about your dream being too wildâ€”nothing's too wild for a Scorpio guy. In fact, the wilder it is, the more turned on he'll likely be. \"So you were in my dream last night... wanna hear about it?\" \"You were in my dream last night.

      "content": "Scorpio men are extremely visually stimulated. If you really want to turn him on, this is the way to go. Don't think you have to send him full nudes, though. Your sizzling Scorpio loves a little mystery, so it's totally okay if you don't feel comfortable baring it all. Try some of these tantalizing teases: If you're wearing provocative underwear, take a pic revealing just the waistband against your skin. Pose nude, but in a position where nothing NSFW is revealed. Dangle a pair of sexy underwear from one finger and take a picture of your hand. Take an extreme closeup of a random bare part of your body (such as your inner elbow or your calf) and ask him to guess what it is."
