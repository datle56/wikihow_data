Unless he gave you some indication he was upset or unhappy, he may just think your relationship is moving a little too fast or that he doesn’t get enough time for himself. Keep an open mind when he brings it up since it may not be the end of the world.

      "content": "Your needs and emotions are just as important as his in your relationship. Even though your boyfriend is the one asking for space, you should still tell him what you need to feel fulfilled. Use “I” statements to talk about how you’re feeling so it doesn’t seem like you’re blaming him for anything. Explaining how you’re feeling makes him more receptive and may help keep him close. [3] X Research source “I feel confused because I cherish our quality time together and I don’t want to lose it.” “I look forward to talking to you each day so I feel sad that I won’t be able to reach out.” “I feel lonely when we’re apart, and I just need some security to make sure we’re okay.”"

      "content": "Choosing when to end a break keeps you from waiting around for him. If your boyfriend wants more time and space apart, pick a length of time to get back together and talk. It might just last a week or he may need a month or two. That should give him enough time to decide what he wants. [5] X Research source “Can you text me in 1 week and let me know how you’re feeling then?” “Let’s talk again in a few weeks and we can catch up.” “Do you think a month is enough time? Can you check in with me after that?” If he doesn’t want to pick an end date, it might mean that he’s trying to move on. Remember that you deserve someone who respects your time and wants to be with you."
