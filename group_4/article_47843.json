If you’ve been struggling to find your sense of personal style , the solution may be as simple as taking note of all your favorite things. If you love color, don’t shy away from it!

Building personal style is also a matter of considering how you want to be perceived by the world. Sharp suggests asking yourself the following question in order to better understand: “What words come to mind when you think about how you want people to perceive you? Attractive? Smart? Powerful?” She says, “If you're wearing a Rolex versus a Fossil watch , that is actually communicating to somebody that you like to invest in your overall appearance, your style, and your image.”"

      "content": "Don’t be afraid to take risks. As with so many other things in life, fashion fun begins where your comfort zone ends. Sharp and Renee both agree that it’s important to try new styles on for size to see how they fit— pun intended. Sharp encourages you to think about what's going to help you stand out, not what will help you look like everybody else. “Your style is an extension of who you are,” she shares. “So, you want to think about stepping outside your comfort zone a little bit, try new colors, try new patterns, try different styles and silhouettes.” Renee is a big advocate for using color as a means to explore your personal style. She says, “The most common mistake I see is being afraid to take risks with color and relying heavily on black.” When it comes to injecting more color into your wardrobe, try starting out small. Colorful accessories, like scarves , hats , or even shoe laces , can help you become more comfortable with color in general."
