Squirt a pea-sized amount or so of styling product or pomade into your palm and knead it through the hair. [1] X Research source The hair product will make it easier to comb and work through."

      "content": "Grab a section of hair that’s about 2 finger widths wide. Comb through the hair with a wide-toothed comb and pick out a section of hair along the back or center of the person’s head. Check that the section is about 2 finger widths wide, and at least 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Pinch the top of their hair with 2 fingers, using your dominant hand to actually do the trimming. [2] X Research source While it may seem a bit slow going, working in gradual chunks will help the haircut look more consistent and polished."

      "title": "Cut tiny snips along the back of the hair in a pyramid pattern.",
      "content": "Cut tiny snips along the back of the hair in a pyramid pattern. Look close to the roots, where the curly hair begins to form a “C” along the bottom of the hair section. Envision a pyramid shape within the section of hair you’ve separated, with the roots serving as the base. Loosen your grip on the hair with your fingers, then cut 3 tiny, evenly-spaced snips along the base of this pyramid, which will thin out a tiny portion of hair. Move your scissors up to the “middle” of the pyramid and create 2 small snips, centered above the 3 snips that you’ve already made. As a final touch, move your scissors to the “top” of the pyramid and create a single cut, centered above the 2 snips you just made. [3] X Research source Each cut will only be a millimeter or 2 long. Keep in mind that you’re cutting into the hair instead of cutting across. Try to keep all of your cuts centered and evenly spaced. You’re not going to lose a ton of hair from these cuts—you’ll just thin it out a little bit to reduce the bulk. This is also known as a “bricklaying” pattern."

      "content": "Comb through all of the hair to get rid of the freshly cut strands. Go over their hair with a wide-toothed comb, brushing away any extra hair that you just trimmed away. Smooth out their hair so you‘ll be ready to thin out their hair once more. [4] X Research source A wide-toothed comb makes it easier to smooth out their hair, as opposed to a fine-toothed comb."

[5] X Expert Source Angela Justice Master Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 5 November 2021. Grip it tightly between 2 fingers, and find the “C” shape of the bottom curl. Loosen the hair section a bit, then repeat the bricklaying trim pattern in the same way that you did before. You won’t notice a lot of hair separating from the other person’s head, but there will be enough to reduce the bulk. [6] X Research source Double-check that you’re grabbing a new section of hair, and not the one that you just trimmed. Some shorter hairs may slip out of your fingers, which is perfectly normal. You’ll want to progress in an upwards direction, moving closer to the forehead as you go."

      "content": "Repeat this process until you reach the front hairline. Continue grabbing small sections of hair along the other person’s head, working your way up to the front hairline. Keep in mind that the majority of the bulk isn’t found near the front hairline, so you don’t need to worry about trimming this section at all. Pinch each new section of hair with your fingers before loosening it a bit, then snipping tiny cuts across in the “3 2 1” bricklaying pattern. After each trim, comb through the hair again to smooth it out. [8] X Research source Focus more on the center and top of the other person’s head instead of the bottom and front. This is where the majority of the bulk will be. You don’t need to thin out every section of hair along the back of someone’s head—just enough to thin out some of the bulk."
