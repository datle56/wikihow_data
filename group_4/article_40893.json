    {
      "title": "Choose a fresh cauliflower.",
      "content": "Choose a fresh cauliflower. A fresh cauliflower will be pure white and will be wrapped in crisp, bright green leaves. [1] X Research source In particular, pay close attention to the base of the cauliflower. Regardless of how dirty or dingy the top looks, the base should be as white as possible. The color of the base is the best indication of how fresh the vegetable is. The floret tops along the outside of the head should be fairly compact. If they are loose, or if there are wide gaps between the tops, this could be an indication that the cauliflower has already started to go bad. A less fresh cauliflower will be great for making cauliflower soup."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off the leaves.",
      "content": "Cut off the leaves. Use a sharp knife to cut off the green leaves surrounding the head of cauliflower. Cut the leaves off as close to the base of the stem as possible. Note that the leaves can be cooked, too, as long as they are fresh. They are especially useful for vegetable stock, but they could be cooked down and used in stews, roasted, or eaten raw in salads."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim down the central stem.",
      "content": "Trim down the central stem. To make removing florets easier, cut off the large stem just before the point at which it divides into individual florets. The stem could also be saved and used for vegetable stock. Technically, this step is only optional. You can remove individual florets from the cauliflower without first removing the excess stem, but doing so will be more difficult."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut individual florets from the central stem.",
      "content": "Cut individual florets from the central stem. Turn the head upside down so that the cut stem end faces up. Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut off each individual branch or floret. Slice the floret off at the point where the floret stem meets the central stem. Cut each floret from the central stem at a 45-degree angle. Take the time to trim away any discolored parts of the cauliflower. Brown or otherwise off-color cauliflower parts will not taste as good and also lack many of the nutrients found in fresh cauliflower. Small baby cauliflowers can be cooked whole––you do not need to cut them into individual florets."

    {
      "title": "Trim large florets into smaller pieces.",
      "content": "Trim large florets into smaller pieces. You can use large florets as they are now, but if they are still quite large, they might take longer to cook. Use your knife to trim the florets down into smaller pieces. Make sure that all florets used for steaming are about the same size as each other, to ensure even cooking. Cooking cauliflower for a shorter amount of time means preserving more of its nutrients. This is why it is a good idea to make smaller florets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash the cauliflower florets.",
      "content": "Wash the cauliflower florets. Place the cauliflower florets in a colander and rinse them under cool, running water. Pat dry with clean paper towels when done. Dirt and debris can get caught in between the floret clusters and stems. If you spot any dirt, gently scrub it away with your fingers. Your fingers are usually sufficient; a vegetable brush would likely be too rough."

    {
      "title": "Bring a large stockpot of water to boil.",
      "content": "Bring a large stockpot of water to boil. Fill the stockpot with roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water and boil it on the stove over high heat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a steamer basket in the stockpot.",
      "content": "Place a steamer basket in the stockpot. Make sure that the steamer basket does not dip into the boiling water. If you do not have an actual steamer basket, you could use a metal or wire mesh colander instead. Just make sure that the colander fits over the mouth of the stockpot without tipping into it and that you have a wide enough lid to go over the florets (a stockpot, wok or skillet pan lid will often work well). You can purchase a steamer saucepan with a pre-fitted steamer pan that fits snugly into the base saucepan and comes with a lid of the correct size."

    {
      "title": "Add the cauliflower florets to the steamer basket or pan.",
      "content": "Add the cauliflower florets to the steamer basket or pan. Carefully dump the florets into the steamer basket or pan, spreading them out into an even layer. Arrange the florets upright, with the clustered tops facing up and the stems facing down. If possible, arrange the florets in a single layer. If this is not possible, at least make sure the florets are distributed across the basket or pan as evenly as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook for 5 to 13 minutes with the lid on.",
      "content": "Cook for 5 to 13 minutes with the lid on. Cover the stockpot and let the gathering steam cook the cauliflower. For standard-size florets, check the cauliflower after the first 5 minutes. If they still seem too tough, cover the pot again and continue cooking. Usually, it will take 7 to 10 minutes for the cauliflower to cook through. When done, the florets should be tender enough to pierce with a fork but should not be mushy. The stockpot and steamer basket or steamer pan must be covered. Placing the lid on is essential because it traps the steam inside, and the steam cooks the cauliflower florets. Large florets can take up to 13 minutes. If you decide to steam the entire head of cauliflower at once, it could take 20 minutes or longer to do so."

      "title": "Serve warm.",
      "content": "Serve warm. Remove the cooked cauliflower florets from the steamer basket and place them immediately, either on single plates or in a serving dish. Season with salt, pepper, and butter, as desired. There are other ways you can serve steamed cauliflower. You could drizzle soy sauce over the florets, sprinkle them with Parmesan cheese, or season with spices and herbs like paprika, lemon pepper, or parsley. How you enjoy this healthy treat is up to you, so get creative."

    {
      "title": "Add a little water.",
      "content": "Add a little water. For a standard head of cauliflower broken down into florets, add about 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of water. Make sure there is only about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in the bottom of the dish. You want enough water to create steam, but not so much water that you end up boiling the cauliflower florets."

    {
      "title": "Cover the dish.",
      "content": "Cover the dish. Covering the dish traps steam, which cooks the cauliflower florets. If the dish you use has a microwave-safe lid, cover it with that. Otherwise, cover the dish with a layer of microwavable plastic wrap. If you'd rather not use plastic, you can cover the bowl with a microwavable ceramic or stoneware plate. Make sure that the plate covers the mouth of the dish completely. [2] X Research source"

Check the cauliflower florets after the first 2 1/2 minutes. Remove the dish and check with a fork. If not cooked, re-cover the dish and continue cooking for up to an additional 1 1/2 minutes. Take care when removing the lid. Open the lid away from your face so the steam does not burn you as it escapes."
