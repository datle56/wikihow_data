Rearrange it by subtracting 2y from each side, to get: 4x = 8 - 2y . This method often uses fractions later on. You can try the elimination method below instead if you don't like fractions."

If you're confident you didn't make any mistakes, you have one of the following results: [7] X Research source If you end up with an equation that has no variables and isn't true (for instance, 3 = 5), the problem has no solution .

If the equations don't have a variable that cancels out naturally, change one of the equations so they will. This is easiest to follow with an example: You have the system of equations 3x - y = 3 and -x + 2y = 4 . Let's change the first equation so that the y variable will cancel out. (You can choose x instead, and you'll get the same answer in the end.) The - y on the first equation needs to cancel with the + 2y in the second equation. We can make this happen by multiplying - y by 2. Multiply both sides of the first equation by 2, like this: 2(3x - y)=2(3) , so 6x - 2y = 6 . Now the - 2y will cancel out with the +2y in the second equation."

You can also use this method to double-check your answers from one of the other methods. The basic idea is to graph both equations, and find the point where they intersect. The x and y values at this point will give us the value of x and the value of y in the system of equations."

Label the numbers -1, -2, etc. moving down on the y-axis and left on the x-axis. If you don't have graph paper, use a ruler to make sure the numbers are spaced precisely apart.

Draw the line segment between (0,5) and (1,3). The line y = ½x + 0 has a slope of ½ . At x = 1, the line moves up ½ from the point at x=0. Draw the line segment between (0,0) and (1,½).

In some systems of equations, the lines will intersect at a value between two whole numbers, and unless your graph is extremely precise it will be difficult to tell where this is. If this happens, you can write an answer such as \"x is between 1 and 2\", or use the substitution or elimination method to find the precise answer."
