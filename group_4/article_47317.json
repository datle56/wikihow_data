Then, dab a damp white cloth or cotton swab into an inconspicuous part of the garment to ensure the dye doesn’t transfer. [2] X Research source Most silk garments with tags that say “Dry Clean” are safe to hand wash. If the label says “Dry Clean Only,” take it to a dry cleaner instead of washing it at home. If any color transfers onto the cloth or swab, your silk garment isn’t colorfast. Take it to the dry cleaners to help protect the garment from fading. If you have an especially expensive or high-quality item, Ali recommends taking it to a dry cleaner rather than washing it, as silk can damage easily.
