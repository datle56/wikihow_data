Figure out how much money you need to make to cover these costs and maintain a profit margin of at least 10 to 20 percent. [11] X Research source For example, if you want to make $52,000 per year to maintain a 15 percent profit margin, you need to make $1,000 per week. If $80 for a women’s cut and $40 for a men’s cut are reasonable prices in your area, you’ll need to book enough appointments at these rates to meet your weekly quota. While reasonable prices and discounts can build your client base, you need to charge enough to cover your overhead and generate profit.
