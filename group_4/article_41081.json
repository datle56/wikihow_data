      "content": "Stay hydrated. The stuff that comes out of your nose and trickles down your throat when you're sick or dealing with allergies (lovingly called the post-nasal drip) can irritate your throat and contribute to coughing fits. Fortunately, a lot of that irritation can be relieved by drinking warm water. This thins out the mucus, making it more manageable for your throat. [1] X Research source Water, as always, is best. Stay away from coffee and carbonated drinks--they may irritate your throat even more."

      "content": "Keep your throat healthy. Though taking care of your throat doesn't necessarily mean taking care of your cough (that's often a symptom in itself), it will help you feel and sleep better. Try lozenges or cough drops. They soothe or numb the back of the throat, decreasing the cough reflex. [2] X Research source Drinking warm tea with honey helps soothe the throat in a similar manner. Make sure it's not too hot though! 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of ground ginger or apple cider vinegar with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of honey is not an common tactic, but it is medically supported."

      "content": "Breathe some humid air. Humidity can help moisturize your nasal passages, reduce post-nasal drip, and soothe your throat, which may reduce your coughing. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can increase your humidity by: Taking steamy showers. They can loosen the secretions in your nose, making it easier to breathe. Investing in a humidifier. Putting moisture back in the air if it's dry can help ease the pain."

      "title": "Remove irritants from your environment.",
      "content": "Remove irritants from your environment. Being around things that irritate your nose, lungs and throat can cause or aggravate coughing. Perfumes and scented deodorizing sprays are harmless on the outside, but some people are sensitive to them and can develop sinus irritation from the exposure. Of course, smoke is the ultimate culprit. If you are around someone who smokes, remove yourself. If you smoke, your cough is probably chronic and above being deemed just a nuisance."

      "title": "Try over-the-counter decongestants.",
      "content": "Try over-the-counter decongestants. These medications work their miracles by lessening the amount of mucus your sinuses produce and shrinking your swollen nasal tissues. They can also dry up the mucus already present in your lungs and open up the airway passages. You can find them in pills, liquids and sprays. As with any medication, look at the potential side effects before taking a decongestant. Some, like pseudoephedrine, can raise your blood pressure, so don't take it if you struggle with hypertension unless your doctor recommends it.

If your cough is thick with phlegm, it helps to take a cough expectorant such as guaifenesin--found in Humibid, Mucinex, Robitussin Chest Congestion, and Tussin. These thin out the mucus, and the pretty part is you'll be able to cough it up. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Talk to your doctor. A simple cough may not warrant a visit to a healthcare professional, but if it lingers or is the side effect of a bigger problem, it's best to consult someone who can properly diagnose you. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Regardless of the duration of your cough, if you are coughing up blood or experiencing chills or fatigue, see your doctor immediately.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may have a sinus infection, asthma, or gastroesophageal reflex disease (GERD). Knowing the cause of your cough is the first step to treating it. Your doctor may put you on an antibiotic if you have a sinus infection. They may also suggest a nasal spray. If you have allergies, you'll obviously be told to avoid those allergens as much as possible. Your cough could diminish easily if this is the case. If you have asthma, avoid conditions that make it flare up. Take your asthma medications regularly and avoid all irritants and allergens. When acid from your stomach gets into your throat, that's GERD. There are medications your doctor can prescribe for you to relieve your pain. Apart from that, wait 3 or 4 hours after you eat before you go to bed and sleep with your head adequately elevated to lessen your symptoms."

      "content": "Quit smoking. There are many programs and resources out there to help you kick the habit, and your doctor can help. They can refer you to a program or expose you to new, effective methods. If you are around second-hand smoke, know that that could be an explanation for your cough. Remove yourself as often as possible."

      "content": "Take medication as recommended by your doctor. Coughs are generally a symptom -- therefore, cough medications are only taken when the actual problem isn't known. If you have a chronic cough, though, that's a slightly different story. Only take medications if your doctor okays it. Here are your options: Antitussives are prescription cough suppressants. These are generally the last thing to be recommended and only are so when nothing else works. OTC cough suppressants aren't backed up by science, for the record. Expectorants loosen up mucus, and as a result, you cough it up. Bronchodilators are medicines that relax your airways."

      "title": "Up your fluid intake.",
      "content": "Up your fluid intake. Though the cause of your cough won't go away, you'll feel significantly better. Drink mainly water. Carbonated or overly sugary drinks can irritate your throat. Warm soups or broth can help ease the pain of an aching throat, too."

They are dangerous and considered a choking hazard at this age."

Take note if the cough happens at roughly the same time every year or is caused by something specific--it may be allergies."

[10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source A combination of honey and warm milk or cream can be a wonderfully soothing combination when you can't stop coughing. For this recipe, you'll need 1 cup (200 ml) of full cream milk, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of honey, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of butter or margarine.
