      "content": "Learn the numbering system for the blade guard lengths. The numbers on the clipper guards refer to the length they cut your hair to. Smaller numbers mean a shorter length, where “1” is the shortest guard and \"8\" is the longest at 1 inch (2.5 cm). The rest of the blade guards go up by 1 ⁄ 8 in (3.2 mm) for each number. The guard numbers and lengths are: [1] X Research source 1: 1 ⁄ 8 in (3.2 mm) 2: 1 ⁄ 4 in (6.4 mm) 3: 3 ⁄ 8 in (9.5 mm) 4: 1 ⁄ 2 in (13 mm) 5: 1 ⁄ 8 in (3.2 mm) 6: 3 ⁄ 4 in (19 mm) 7: 7 ⁄ 8 in (22 mm) 8: 1 in (25 mm) The “0” setting is when you use your clippers without any blade guard or attachment."

      "content": "Wash and dry your hair. Washed hair is easier to comb since it doesn't have any extra bends or waves. Shampoo your hair and rinse it out thoroughly. Be sure to dry your hair thoroughly since your clippers won’t work very well if it’s wet. [2] X Research source If your hair is a little tangled, get rid of knots with a detangler ."

      "content": "Cover the person's shoulders with a cape . Drape a barber’s cape made from a slick material around the person's shoulders and pull it tight against their neck. Secure the cape in place so hair doesn’t get on or inside the person’s clothes while you’re cutting their hair. [3] X Research source A slick fabric allows the hair to fall off onto the floor instead of sticking to clothes. If you don’t want to clean up a mess inside when you’re cutting hair , do it outside or in a garage. Otherwise, stick to an easy-to-clean area, such as the bathroom or kitchen."

      "title": "Secure with the longest blade guard you need for the style to your clippers.",
      "content": "Secure with the longest blade guard you need for the style to your clippers. Choose the blade guard with the longest length you want for the hairstyle. Slide the attachment onto the blade until it clicks into place. Then, you’re able to just buzz the person’s entire head to a uniform length, and go back to trim other parts shorter. [4] X Research source Example: If you want #2 on the sides and #4 on top, start by buzzing your whole head with #4."

      "title": "Move your clippers against the direction your hair grows.",
      "content": "Move your clippers against the direction your hair grows. Start either on the side of your head behind an ear or at the nape of your neck. Hold your clippers upside-down so the top of the guard is against the scalp. Then, move the clippers up toward the top of the head in the opposite direction of the hair’s natural growth. [5] X Research source Similarly, move from the front to the back when you use your clippers on the top of the head. Where you start cutting hair depends on what you prefer. Just be careful not to skip around to different areas so you don't miss any spots."

      "title": "Scoop the hair away from the person’s head with the blade.",
      "content": "Scoop the hair away from the person’s head with the blade. Start by holding the top of the clippers’ blade close to the skin. When you want to end your cut, scoop the blade outwards and away from the person’s scalp by a little bit. Use short scooping strokes all over the person’s head to create a softer cut. [6] X Research source Avoid lifting the clippers straight away from the person’s head since it could leave a more noticeable line in their hair."

      "title": "Blend different areas of hair with a guard in between lengths.",
      "content": "Blend different areas of hair with a guard in between lengths. If you notice there may be a line between the shorter and longer length, use a blade guard that’s between the sizes of the other ones you’ve used. Move your clippers against the direction that the hair is growing and scoop the blade away from the scalp so you have a smooth transition. [7] X Research source Example: If you've used #2 on the sides and #4 on top, blend the line with a #3 guard. Just go along the line and smooth out the border between the sections. If your clippers have a lever near the side of the blade, flip the lever up for a slightly closer cut and push the lever down for a slightly further cut. The lever helps you create a more precise fade ."

      "content": "Use guard 1 or 2 for a burr cut. A burr cut is a typical military-type cut where you buzz your hair to one short length. Use guard 1 or 2 across your entire head. Start at the back, work your way to cutting the sides, and then finally, buzz the length off the top. [8] X Research source Choose a hairstyle before you start cutting and look at it for reference so you can see what the finished style should look like."

Create an even line around your crown from one side to the other so you clip off all the longer hair. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Begin with guard 2 or 4 for a crew cut.",
      "content": "Begin with guard 2 or 4 for a crew cut. Start by cutting the sides and back with a 2 or 4 blade guard depending on the length you prefer. Transition up to the crown of your head by using increasingly larger guard sizes, leaving the top for last. Trim the very front with the longest guard you want to use, then gradually reduce the guard size as you cut back toward your crown. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a 3 or 4 guard to start a basic boy's cut . Begin by buzzing the whole head with the longest blade guard that you want. Once the hair is buzzed down, attach a shorter blade guard, like a 2 or 3. Move your clippers up the sides of your head to make a clean line around the top of your skull to leave some longer hair on top. [11] X Research source If you're cutting your own hair , place your hand on the top of your head. Use it to guide the clippers, so you don't move the clippers too far up your scalp."

      "content": "Switch to a 1 or 2 guard around the ears. Remove the guard you’ve been using for your haircut and attach one of the smallest guards. Even if you want your hair all the same length, it's still a good idea to switch to a lower guard number for your ears and sideburns for a cleaner look overall. Use your clippers without a guard to cut hair closest to the skin."

Move your clippers in the direction your hair grows. Press the blade against your scalp at the bottom of the sideburn and trim it to the length you want. When you trim the other one, make sure to make it even with the other one. [12] X Research source In the back, clean up the edges around the nape of your neck so you have a clean hairline."

Comb the hair forward and snip the longer strands away with your scissors. Try to make a clean hairline that’s even around both ears. [13] X Research source Use scissors meant for hair cutting. If you're in a pinch, sharpen a pair of small embroidery scissors to cut your hair."
