      "content": "Watch for nausea and vomiting. Most people develop signs and symptoms 12 to 72 hours after being exposed to the bacteria. A common symptom of salmonella infection is vomiting, which is the result of eating contaminated food. Your body’s natural response is to void the contexts of your stomach. You may feel very sick and vomit multiple times a day until the infection has left your body. Do not eat or drink anything for several hours after vomiting. This may induce more vomiting. Instead, sip some water or suck on ice chips every 15 minutes for 3-4 hours. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Be aware of abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Watery diarrhea is a chief symptom of salmonella infection. It usually comes on suddenly, and your stool may be bloody or contain mucus. Diarrhea may last up to 10 days, although it may take several months before bowels return to normal. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to fever and chills.",
      "content": "Pay attention to fever and chills. Some other common symptoms of salmonella are fever and chills that usually accompany a headache. This occurs because salmonella causes your body temperature to rise. Use a thermometer to check your temperature. If your fever exceeds 104 degrees Fahrenheit, seek medical attention immediately."

      "title": "Watch for symptoms of dehydration.",
      "content": "Watch for symptoms of dehydration. Dehydration is a common complication associated with salmonella infection because a lot of fluid is lost from vomiting and runny stools. Dehydration can cause a number of medical issues and hinder your body’s ability to combat the illness and get better. Common signs of mild to moderate dehydration include less frequent urination, dark colored urine, dry mouth, nose, and eyes, headache, and fatigue. Severe dehydration symptoms, such as increased heart rate, low blood pressure, confusion, and seizure require immediate medical attention. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Contact your doctor if symptoms are severe. You do not need to see a doctor for a typical case of salmonella infection that gets better after a few days. However, there is more concern for people of certain age groups, such as infants, children under 5, and the elderly. Other groups that are at risk for severe infection include those with a compromised immune system (HIV infection, cancer treatment), have sickle cell disease, or are taking medications that suppress the stomach acid.

      "content": "Complete a stool culture. Your health care provider will give you detailed instructions to collect the stool sample. You may collect the sample at the doctor’s office, or asked to do it at home. Results from the stool test will help your doctor decide which antibiotics are the right ones for you if needed. Once you return the sample to your doctor, it will be sent to a lab, and then incubated for a couple of days before a technician tests any bacterial growth. It may take 2-3 days to get your results. Normal test results are negative, meaning you don’t have a salmonella infection. A positive result means you have a salmonella infection.

      "content": "Get blood work to test for salmonella. In some cases, salmonella may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other parts of the body. This is called bacteremia. If your doctor suspects this has happened, he will need to do a blood test to confirm the diagnosis. Bacteremia only affects about 5% of people who get salmonella.

This is important so that your test will provide accurate data. For example, some tests may require discontinued use of certain medications.

      "content": "Ask about imaging in salmonella infections. Radiological and imaging findings in salmonella diagnosis are rare, due to the fact that acute salmonella is typically easy to treat. For elderly patients, laboratory imaging tests may be done for rapid diagnosis to rule out vascular infections caused by salmonella. Imaging procedures may include X-rays, ultrasounds, or CT scans.
