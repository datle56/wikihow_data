      "content": "Look for the signs of a first-degree burn. A first-degree burn is usually a thermal burn caused by contact with a hot object or environment. It may result from sun exposure (sunburn), oil splatter from a hot pan, or accidentally touching a hot oven rack. A first-degree burn is painful, and will leave a deep red color on the top layer of skin (epidermis). But despite the stinging redness, there is no blistering in a first-degree burn. The skin will remain dry and intact.

[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A superficial second-degree burn will present with redness, like a first-degree burn. But the skin damage will go beyond the top layer (epidermis) down into the top of the second layer (dermis). And unlike a first-degree burn, you will see blistering in a second-degree burn. Pain and bleeding are both good signs, as they suggest that there is no significant damage to nerves or blood vessels. Superficial second-degree burns usually heal without scarring within two weeks, and do not require medical attention.

A superficial second-degree burn can heal on its own, but a deep second-degree burn needs to be seen by a doctor. Look for spots of pale skin interspersed between the blisters.

The first order of business in a first or superficial second-degree thermal burn is to lower the skin temperature at the burn site. Place the burned skin in cool (not cold) water for 10 minutes. If you don't want to waste running water, fill a sink or bathtub to submerge the skin. Either refill with cold water as the water warms up, or use ice cubes to keep the water temperature low.
