How am I harshly evaluating myself? Once you write these things down, rate the strength of your beliefs on a scale of 0 to 100%. Next, challenge your beliefs by questioning the evidence you are using to support your beliefs. Your goal for using a Thought Diary is to have a balanced self-evaluation. Focus on learning to accept yourself. Identify your positive qualities and write them down. For example, ask yourself what are you good at? What struggles have you overcome? What positive qualities do others see in you? Are you responsible, artistic, considerate, or creative? When you see that you have many positive qualities let them sink in and never forget them.
