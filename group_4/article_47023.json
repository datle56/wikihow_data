Venus is the planet of love, beauty, pleasure, and money; it represents your desire for love and how you want to be loved by others.

Thus, people with Venus in Aries placements may have to work a little harder to find love because Venus tends to clash with the brash, masculine energy of Mars (which rules Aries)."
