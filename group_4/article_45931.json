While this step is optional, it's fun and potentially rewarding to experiment with different herbs for scent, tone and conditioning that suits your own hair type. [5] X Research source Some suggestions include: Unbleached chamomile leaves can be a great blonde booster. Cinnamon can add warm red or auburn tones. Powdered cloves can mask the cassia scent. Rhubarb root, like cassia, contains a large amount of Chrysophanic acid, which makes it stain yellow so it's great to enhance the blonde. This will also stain your hands or clothes, so take care!"
