      "content": "The cat might be feeling relaxed or sleeping. Like humans, cats might relax their jaw just enough so that their tongue falls out while they’re sleeping. Some cats might even blep (or stick their tongue out) when they’re feeling super relaxed. [1] X Research source Cats don’t usually stick their tongue out when they’re feeling stressed or anxious. However, this can be a unique response for your specific cat."

      "content": "The cat is in the middle of cleaning their fur. Cats spend between 30 to 50 percent of their day cleaning their coat. [2] X Research source If you happen to look over at a cat while they’re doing their daily grooming, they might look back at you with their tongue out, waiting to see what you’re going to do next. They might also stop in the middle of their grooming if they smell something interesting or if they notice there’s food nearby."

      "content": "The kitty is feeling playful. A cat might stick out their tongue if they get really excited while they play. If their ears are facing forward, their tail is up, and their eyes are somewhat dilated, they’re ready to pounce on whatever toy is unlucky enough to be in their path!

      "title": "The cat has something stuck to their tongue.",
      "content": "The cat has something stuck to their tongue. Cats have tiny, sharp spines on their tongue that are perfect for cleaning and removing excess fur from their coat. [4] X Research source However, these barbs can get caught on large chunks of hair, feathers, or other items, which might cause a cat to stick their tongue out. You can remove the item from their mouth or wait for the cat to do it by themselves. However, if the cat is also gagging or struggling to breathe, it may be a sign they’re choking . If the cat is choking and you see the object, remove it with tweezers or a finger. If not, hold them with their back against your chest and firmly squeeze their chest 5 times with quick, upward thrusts. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "The cat is gathering information about their surroundings.",
      "content": "The cat is gathering information about their surroundings. Cats have an extra organ for their sense of smell on the roof of their mouth called the Jacobson’s organ. When they smell something super fascinating, they open their mouth, squint their eyes, and inhale so the organ intensifies the scent and gives them more information about it. [7] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source While a kitty is opening their mouth to figure out what they’re smelling, their tongue might fall out, too. This reaction is called the Flehmen response."

      "content": "The cat has motion sickness or nausea. When a cat is feeling nauseous, they might drool, vomit, or gag with their tongue out. This can be caused by motion sickness if the cat has been traveling by land, sea, or air. [10] X Research source Cats might also feel nauseous if they eat a bug or if there’s a sudden change in their diet. [11] X Research source A cat might also vomit or gag if they have a hairball. This is completely normal, and it’s not uncommon for a cat to have a hairball every week or two. [12] X Research source However, if a cat shows other symptoms like lethargy, decreased appetite, or diarrhea, it might be a symptom of another health issue. Visit a vet right away.

[14] X Research source If a cat is panting, give them a drink of cool water and cover them in cool towels. If their condition doesn’t improve, take them to the vet. If a cat also drools, looks weak, has difficulty breathing, or collapses, they might be suffering from heatstroke—take them to the vet immediately.

If the cat’s gums are red, swollen, bloody, or discolored and the cat drools or struggles to eat, visit the vet right away.

      "content": "The cat may have a respiratory disease, infection, or blockage. If a cat sticks their tongue out and breathes heavily or otherwise abnormally, they may be having difficulty breathing. This could be a sign of other issues, like asthma or pleural effusion, that need medical attention. If you’re not sure whether a cat can breathe, get them to a vet. [19] X Research source A cat breathing heavily with their tongue out can be a sign of a heart condition, an allergic reaction, or pain from another health condition. Check the color of the cat’s tongue. If it’s blue, it means they aren’t getting enough oxygen—go to the vet."

If your cat is suffering from a neurological condition, they might be disoriented, stare blankly, urinate outside the litter box, or frequently forget to put their tongue back into their mouth.

You can also tell if a cat’s happy if they blink slowly at you, show their stomach, hold their tail up with a slight curve at the end, or rub their head or cheek against you. [22] X Research source Signs of happiness can be subtle in cats, but you’ll know they’re in a good mood if they seem to be relaxed or interested in playing and interacting with their surroundings.

Although a cat sticking out their tongue is normal most of the time, it may be worrying if their behavior is unexpected, they paw at their face, or they seem distressed.
