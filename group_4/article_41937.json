Because you have a bob haircut, you likely do not have a lot of length to your hair. You may not need to move the round brush at all if it is short enough, but in most cases, you will have to pull the brush down through your hair a bit. Continuously turn the round brush gently to help train your hair into the inward curl. This involves a quick wrist movement to flick the round brush back up to your roots, once you get to the ends. Completely blow dry one section of hair before moving onto the next. Moving on before a section is arid will cause it to lose its shape."
