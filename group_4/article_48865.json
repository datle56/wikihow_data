      "content": "Yes, a nose piercing can close overnight if it is not fully healed. When you remove the jewelry from an unhealed piercing, the opening shrinks back down, especially if the piercing is newer. Generally, the longer you’ve had the nose piercing, the more likely it is to stay open. A fresh piercing can close in just a few minutes or hours, and if you’ve had the piercing for less than a year, it can close within a few days. Even a piercing that is several years old can close within several weeks. [1] X Research source Everyone’s body is different, and each person’s piercings react differently. Some piercings can close within minutes, even if they are several years old! [2] X Research source Because the amount of time it takes for a piercing to close can vary, it’s generally best to wear jewelry in your piercing overnight if you want to keep it open.

      "title": "Piercings are wounds, so your body works to close them quickly.",
      "content": "Piercings are wounds, so your body works to close them quickly. Piercings generally heal in 3 stages. In the first stage, your body attempts to seal the wound shut, and a blood clot forms around the opening. In the second stage, your body creates what's called a fistula, which is a tunnel of scar tissue running from the opening of the piercing to the other side. In the third and final stage, the fistula walls thicken and expand, and the wound (aka your piercing) is healed. Before this thickened, tougher tunnel forms in your nose, your piercing is more susceptible to quickly closing up, which is why it’s extra important not to take your piercing out before it’s healed. Generally, nose piercings take 2 to 6 months to go through the 3 stages and heal completely. If you just got your nose pierced , don’t attempt to change the jewelry for at least 8 weeks, and don’t remove it until the piercing is fully healed. [4] X Research source After 2-6 months, check for signs your piercing is fully healed. If 2-3 weeks have passed without any crust or discharge forming on your piercing, it could be fully healed.

      "content": "If your nose piercing starts to close, see a professional to reopen it. If your nose piercing seems like it has closed, don’t panic! Oftentimes, a professional can use their tools to stretch the area and reopen the hole. This is especially successful if the piercing was mostly healed and stable when you removed your jewelry. Visit a professional piercer to see if they can stretch your piercing back open, without having to re-pierce a new channel."

      "content": "If the piercing is completely closed, see a professional to re-pierce it. It’s possible to re-pierce your nose, but it’s important to wait until the wound heals, which takes about 12 weeks. If you try to re-pierce the area too early, you can have problems with healing and scarring. This is why it’s important to see a professional, who can assess whether or not it’s a good idea to re-pierce the area.
