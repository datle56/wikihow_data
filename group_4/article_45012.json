For example, if a clip of an NBA player doing a 360 posterizing dunk went viral, there’d likely be a bunch of teenagers in the chat talking about how tuff it is. Tuff isn’t limited to guys, though. It can describe anything cool, dope, or exciting, whether it’s a drawing, makeup look, outfit, or whatever! [1] X Research source"

When a situation is hard on you or someone you know, or you discover something that’s difficult to deal with, it is considered tuff. For example, say you just got a new car and the first time you take it out for a drive, you get into an accident that isn’t your fault. If you told your friend about this, they’d likely respond by saying something along the lines of “Man, that’s tuff.” This use is more common on the internet, as it’s a playful spelling of the word “tough.”"

According to Wits End Parenting, pursuing your child’s interests with them is a great way to promote learning, even if it’s something you think is boring or gross. So, if you notice that they’re using slang words like tuff, aura, and chopped, ask them what those terms mean and start to casually use them. Even if your kid thinks that you using those slang terms is embarrassing or goofy, it’s still a great way to show that you’re interested in what they’re doing."

This applies more to offensive slang, like chopped or bop , and slurs, than it does to the term tuff."
