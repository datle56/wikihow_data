      "content": "Create a calendar of everything you want to do over the holidays. If you want to keep yourself on a regular schedule over your holiday break, making a calendar can help you stay organized. Start by filling in the most important things you need to do, like any trips, family gatherings, or parties you’re expected to attend. Then, work everything else around those events. [2] X Research source You can make one big schedule to cover your whole holiday, or you can do a weekly or daily list if you prefer. Try using a calendar app or a planner to help keep your schedule organized, or you can draw your own calendar by hand if you’d like."

      "title": "Set aside time for any work or schoolwork you need to get done.",
      "content": "Set aside time for any work or schoolwork you need to get done. If you have any assignments that will be due after your holiday, schedule them in time to get them done. You might need to schedule a block of time every morning or evening if you have a big paper or project due, or you might just need a few hours on a Saturday if you only have a few smaller assignments. By having a set time for work or schoolwork, you'll be more likely to get it done on time, but you'll still have plenty of time for enjoying your holiday."

      "content": "Allow for time for holiday shopping and running errands. Holiday-related tasks can take up a lot of your time, so be sure to give yourself plenty of room for getting things done. You might need several afternoons for shopping, for instance, but you’ll also need to schedule time for tasks like wrapping gifts, addressing holiday cards, and going to the post office. [3] X Research source Online shopping and delivery services can help you make the most of your time, but you'll often have to pay an extra fee."

      "content": "Include some downtime. Remember, this is your holiday break, and it's important to take time to relax. [4] X Expert Source Carolyn Rubenstein, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021. If you can, include a little time each day to unwind and enjoy your time with family and friends, especially if you're going to be really busy during the break. For instance, you might avoid planning anything after 6:00 p.m. each day so you’ll have time to eat dinner and unwind before bed. [5] X Research source It can be really hard, but sometimes you might have to say no when people want you to go places or do things with them. Try to avoid overscheduling yourself, or you might spend your whole break feeling stressed out. Always ask yourself if you're going to be happy doing each activity before deciding what you want to do.

      "title": "Wake up early",
      "content": "Wake up early to get each day off to a good start. It can be tempting to sleep in during the holidays, but you'll get more out of your time off if you wake up a little earlier than normal each day. Even setting your alarm 30 minutes early can help keep you from getting off-schedule, and you'll have more time during the day to get things done. [7] X Research source Of course, this means you’ll have to try to get to bed at about the same time you normally do, too. If you do end up staying up late one night, try to get up as early as you can the next morning, then get to bed extra-early the next night to help you stay on schedule."

      "content": "Read a book for a relaxing way to engage your mind. Reading is a great way to stimulate your imagination, but it’s also a relaxing way to pass the time. It’s your holiday, though, so don’t push yourself to read anything too dry or boring. Find a spy novel, a romance story, or an epic adventure that will keep you interested and excited, and you’ll be surprised how quickly you’re turning the pages! [9] X Research source If you have any assigned reading you’re supposed to do over the break, try reading that material for about 10-15 minutes before you switch to the book you’re reading for fun."

You can also combine exercise with family time by engaging in activities like skiing, ice skating, sledding, or swimming."
