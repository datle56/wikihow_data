      "title": "Gather the necessary materials for your lamp.",
      "content": "Gather the necessary materials for your lamp. Head to your local hardware store or visit an online supplier. Either purchase a DIY lamp socket kit or purchase the following: a zinc-plated nipple about 8 inches (20 cm) long, light bulb, lamp cord, lamp base, plug, lampshade, socket, socket cap, harp, knurl washer, and a rubber washer. Each lamp cord is made of 2 wires stuck together: one with smooth insulation and one with ribbed insulation. Take note of each one for later on. If you purchase a flat cord, use a clamp-style wire plug. For round wires, use a two-pronged wire plug. Swap a metal lamp base for a pretty piece of wood if you want a smaller table lamp."

      "title": "Drill a vertical hole through your lamp base.",
      "content": "Drill a vertical hole through your lamp base. Attach a 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) bit to an electric drill. In terms of length, make sure the bit is at least half the length of the base material. Now, drill a vertical hole through both sides of the base to meet in the middle. Afterward, you should have a hole straight through your material for the lamp wire. Hold the base steady with one hand as you drill the hole."

      "title": "Create a cord escape within 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the bottom of the lamp base.",
      "content": "Create a cord escape within 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the bottom of the lamp base. The cord escape will run the lamp cord from the base and connect to a plug. Attach a 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) bit to an electric drill. Make sure the length is at least the radius of your lamp base. Hold the base steady with one hand and drill the hole horizontally through the base so that it meets the vertical center hole. Place your lamp base on a flat surface before drilling the cord escape. To help guide your drill, draw a line with a straight edge on top of your lamp base extending from the center hole to its edge."

    {
      "title": "Connect the nipple to the lamp base.",
      "content": "Connect the nipple to the lamp base. Whether your base is wooden or metal, it needs a nipple on top to connect to the socket. Hold the threaded nipple vertically in front of you. Thread the knurl washer (the one with ridges) onto the nipple followed by the rubber washer. Attach the nipple into the center channel of your lamp base and make sure the knurl washer is closest to the base. Keep about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) between the top of the nipple and the washers. Purchase a DIY lamp socket kit from online suppliers or purchase each part separately. If you buy your own nipple from a hardware store, select one that's zinc-plated and about 8 inches (20 cm) long."

      "title": "Connect your socket locknut to the nipple.",
      "content": "Connect your socket locknut to the nipple. Thread the locknut that comes with your socket base down the length of the nipple extending from the base. Make sure it rests securely against the base with the rubber washer between it. There should be about 1 ⁄ 4 inch (0.64 cm) of the nipple extending from the lamp base to connect to the locknut. If there isn't, adjust the washers."

      "title": "Purchase a plug suitable for your lamp's wiring.",
      "content": "Purchase a plug suitable for your lamp's wiring. Take a look at your plug's cord: is it flat? If so you need to buy a clamp-style wire plug. But if it's round, you need to purchase a two-pronged wire plug. Head to your local hardware store and check out your options! [1] X Research source Ask employees at local hardware stores for suggestions based on your lamp. Provide them with a picture if possible."

      "title": "Unscrew the old socket and unhook its wires.",
      "content": "Unscrew the old socket and unhook its wires. Look closely at the old socket—where the lamp's power switch extends—and locate the word \"Press\". Use your thumb or forefinger to press firmly on this area while wiggling the socket apart. Loosen the screws where the wires are attached and unhook the wires from the socket. [3] X Research source Remove the insulating covers on your socket if it has any. Never attempt this with the lamp connected to a power source."

      "title": "Twist the ends of the old wires to the ends of the new wires.",
      "content": "Twist the ends of the old wires to the ends of the new wires. After twisting them together, take a piece of electrical tape and wrap it around them to secure them. Don't apply too much tape—the wires need to fit through the hole running down the center pipe that leads to the base of the lamp. [4] X Research source After wrapping electrical tape around the wires, snip off the excess piece with scissors."

      "title": "Pull the old cord through the base of the lamp to feed the new cord through.",
      "content": "Pull the old cord through the base of the lamp to feed the new cord through. Pull on the old cord from the bottom of the lamp until the new cord appears. Now, pull on the old cord from the edge of the lamp base to bring the new cord through the channel. Leave about 6 inches (15 cm) of new cord exposed at the top of the lamp. [5] X Research source Discard the old cord once the new cord runs from the top of the lamp to outside of the lamp's base. If your lamp's base is covered in felt, carefully cut around its perimeter with a paring knife and peel it off."

      "content": "Tie an underwriter's knot into the 2 wires. Start by making a 1 inch (2.5 cm) loop with each wire that points upward. Hold them together with your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger. Now, take the free ends of each wire and feed them through the loop of the opposite wire. Afterward, pull the ends outward to tighten the knot. [10] X Research source After tying the knot, pull the wire from the base of the lamp so that the knot lowers into the socket cap and there's no slack in the line. Cut the wires 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the knot when you're done."
