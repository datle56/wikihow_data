      "content": "Most fake Dunks have sloppy and crooked embroidery, while real Dunks have neat embroidery with little to no excess threads. Both fake and real Dunks have “NIKE” logos located in the center of the heel stamp, but fakes often have a thinner font. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "",
      "content": "For the 3 stitching lines placed on the back of the shoe, fake Dunks have thin, long, and inconsistent stitches, while real Dunks have thick, small, and symmetrical stitches. Some fakes have a scallop-like stitch pattern, while real Dunks are always straight. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fake Dunks have a thick and angular logo that’s located close to the midsole, while real Dunks have a naturally curved logo that’s located near the center of the shoe panel. The swoosh stitching is also thin and long on fakes, while real Dunks have thicker, smaller, and more consistent stitching overall. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "From the side profile, fake Dunks lay completely flat on the ground, while real Dunks lift upward (near the tip of the shoe).

      "title": "",
      "content": "The stitching on fake Dunks is usually loose, thin, and inconsistent, while real Dunks have clean stitching that’s consistent in thickness, depth, and color. Some counterfeit shoes may have paint stains throughout the midsole because of the lack of quality control."

      "title": "",
      "content": "Fake Dunks have a weakly imprinted “NIKE” logo that blends into the background of the sole, with lots of space between each letter. Real Dunks have a deeply engraved logo near the middle of the sole, with little space between each letter, plus 2 registered trademark symbols on opposite corners of the logo."

      "content": "On fake Dunks, the registered trademark logo on the insole is thick and bolded, with the “R” touching the surrounding circle. Real dunks have a thin registered trademark logo, and the “R” does not touch the surrounding circle at all."

      "content": "The text throughout the interior tongue label looks wavy, boxy, or uneven in fake Dunks, while the text is the same font weight, height, and thickness in real Dunks. The country inscription is usually placed near the bottom of the label in fakes, but it is perfectly aligned in the center for real Dunks. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Both fake and real Dunks have a “NIKE” logo with 2 registered trademark symbols, but the symbols on fake Dunks look thicker and larger. The symbols are almost touching the “NIKE” logo in fakes, while authentic Dunks have much more empty space in between."

If you look up the style number (the 9-character code in the upper righthand corner) on Google, fake Dunks do not match the exact model and color online.

Real Dunks come packaged in a sturdy box that has an official manufacturing sticker with the color, size, country of origin, barcode, and QR code. Tip: Authentic Nike Dunk Pandas come with filler paper in each shoe."

Find the 12-digit alphanumeric code above the QR code on the interior label, then type in the code onto Barcode Lookup . From there, you can check whether your Dunks are real or counterfeit."
