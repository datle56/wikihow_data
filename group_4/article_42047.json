      "content": "Tie the yarn onto the hook. Attach the yarn to the tip of the hook using a slip knot . This slipknot must lie behind your work. Note that you can skip the slipknot step, but using a slipknot adds security to the beginning stitch, so it is highly recommended."

      "title": "Pull up a loop.",
      "content": "Pull up a loop. Bring the hook back through to the front of your work. The loop of the slipknot should be at the front of the work. Both the tail and working side of the yarn should still be behind the work."

      "content": "Insert the hook into the next spot. Poke the tip of the hook into the next stitch, space, or row. The right spot will depend on your design. If your design runs with the original stitches, you will need to insert the hook into the next stitch or space of the same row. If your design runs against your original stitches, you will need to insert the hook into the corresponding stitch or space of the adjacent row."

Pull this tail through the loop on your hook, still working along the back of the piece, to secure your surface slip stitches. Weave the loose tail in along the back of your work. This step completes the process and removes the last loop from your hook."
