      "content": "Read the care label before you do anything else. Most linen shirts can be washed in the laundry machine, but every once in awhile, you might have a blend that needs to be hand washed or dry-cleaned. In general, unless there is lace, satin, or velvet lining, you should be safe to use a laundry machine. [1] X Expert Source Elias Weston Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 30 January 2021. Linen shirts don’t have to be washed every time they’re worn. If they’re dirty, stained, or smelly, definitely wash them. Otherwise, you can rehang them in your closet and wear them another time before cleaning."

      "content": "Treat stains with baking soda and white vinegar. If the stain is still wet, sprinkle it with baking soda. If the stain is dry, mix 1 teaspoon (4 grams) of baking soda with 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of water to make a paste and rub it into the stain. Mix a 1:1 ratio of water and white vinegar and spray it onto the stain. Let it soak for 15-20 minutes and then wash the shirt without rinsing off the stain treatment first. Avoid using commercial stain removers on your linen shirts as they could discolor the fabric."

      "content": "Fasten buttons and tie up drawstrings before you start washing. Anything that can be secured on your linen shirt should be before you toss it into the wash. Keeping shirts buttoned can help them maintain their shape in the wash, and tying any loose strings, like a belt, can keep them from tearing away. [2] X Research source If your linen shirt has any beading, opt to wash it in a lingerie bag so it doesn’t accidentally catch against other clothes or bang against the walls."

      "title": "Opt for a gentle dye-free detergent for your linen shirts.",
      "content": "Opt for a gentle dye-free detergent for your linen shirts. The gentler the product, the longer your linen shirts will last. Dye-free, scent-free detergents are the best options, and you could even use products meant for baby clothes, as they are super sensitive. Most often, you can use half of the recommended amount of detergent unless your shirts are unusually dirty."

      "title": "Run a gentle cycle with cold water to wash your linen shirts.",
      "content": "Run a gentle cycle with cold water to wash your linen shirts. Add the detergent to the laundry machine before adding the shirts. Wash your shirts with other linens, and separate them by color . Avoid washing a full load; if you can, wash medium-sized loads so that the shirts aren’t crowded. [4] X Research source Linen shirts, especially the first few times they are washed, shed really fine fibers that can get caught on the other items they’re washed with. That’s why it’s a good idea to keep similar colors and types of fabric together."

    {
      "title": "Air-dry",
      "content": "Air-dry your linen shirt so it doesn’t shrink or get misshapen. Because linen is so prone to wrinkles, lay the shirt out flat if possible. Reshape it as best you can so it dries wrinkle-free. If you can’t lay it flat somewhere, hang it up on a line inside or outside, depending on what’s available to you. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a drying line, use a clothes-drying rack. You can buy them at the store or online for $10-$15."

      "title": "Fill a clean tub or sink with cool water.",
      "content": "Fill a clean tub or sink with cool water. Your bathroom, kitchen, or laundry-room sink would work perfectly fine as long as they are clean. If you don’t have access to one of these, you could even use a plastic bin or a really large bowl. [6] X Research source It’s best to wash each linen shirt individually so they get clean and are easier to rinse out. Avoid washing more than 2 shirts together at once."

      "content": "Add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of mild laundry detergent to the water. If you’re washing 2 shirts at once, use 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of detergent. Opt for a dye- and fragrance-free detergent for the most gentle wash possible. [7] X Research source Baby shampoo is also a great option for your linen shirts."

      "title": "Soak the shirt in the tub for 10-20 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the shirt in the tub for 10-20 minutes. After the tub is filled and the water is soapy, submerge your linen shirt. Hold it down until it is completely saturated with water, then set a timer and let it soak. [8] X Research source If the shirt is dirty or stained, leave it to soak for an additional 10 minutes."

      "title": "Wash the shirt by swishing it around in the sudsy water.",
      "content": "Wash the shirt by swishing it around in the sudsy water. Use gentle motions to move the shirt back and forth in the water. Avoid yanking it so that the fibers don’t tear. Use your fingers to rub areas that are especially soiled, like the collar and armpits. Spend about 2-3 minutes per shirt. [9] X Research source If your hands are bothered by the cold or by the detergent, wear a pair of rubber gloves."

      "title": "Rinse the shirt with clean water until all the suds are gone.",
      "content": "Rinse the shirt with clean water until all the suds are gone. After you’ve washed the shirt, drain the sink and fill it up again with cool water. Agitate the shirt in the water to rinse out the soap suds. Drain and refill the sink as many times as needed until there are no more suds. [10] X Research source You could also run a gentle stream of cool water over the shirt after the sink has been drained, but that can sometimes lead to unnecessary damage to the linen. If you decide to rinse the shirt this way, support its full weight in your hands and gently squeeze it out from time to time. Avoid wringing or twisting the shirt."

      "title": "Hang up your shirt and let it air-dry for the best results.",
      "content": "Hang up your shirt and let it air-dry for the best results. Once the shirt has been fully rinsed, gently squeeze out as much excess water as you can. Then, hang it up on a line or lay it out flat to dry. Avoid using the dryer, as high heat can damage linen and cause it to age quicker. [11] X Research source If you want to quickly get rid of a few wrinkles, you can toss an almost-dry linen shirt into the dryer on low heat for 5 minutes. This should reduce the appearance of the wrinkles without causing any damage."
