      "title": "Start your essay with an introductory paragraph.",
      "content": "Start your essay with an introductory paragraph . Your introduction should tell your reader what your essay is going to be about. The first 3 sentences will give an overview of the subject. After you introduce your topic or problem, you’ll end your introduction with a 1 sentence thesis that will lay out your argument or stance on the topic.

      "title": "Include at least 3 body paragraphs to explain your ideas.",
      "content": "Include at least 3 body paragraphs to explain your ideas. Your body paragraphs are where you’ll explain your argument or stance on your topic. First, introduce the main point of this paragraph. Then, give your evidence or support for the points you’re making. Next, explain your evidence and how it supports your ideas. Finally, provide a transition to your next paragraph. [2] X Research source Body paragraphs will make up the bulk of your essay. At a minimum, a body paragraph needs to be 4 sentences long. However, a good body paragraph in a short essay will be at least 6-8 sentences long."

    {
      "title": "End with a concluding paragraph.",
      "content": "End with a concluding paragraph . Your conclusion provides a brief summary of your ideas so that the reader can reflect on them. Help the reader understand what you want them to take from this essay. For example, you might give them a call to action or ask them to rethink their position on your topic.

    {
      "title": "Use transition words to move smoothly from paragraph to paragraph.",
      "content": "Use transition words to move smoothly from paragraph to paragraph. Your reader will recognize that your paragraph breaks mean that you are going on to a new point. However, transitions can help you make that move more easily. You can use transitions to show how your ideas are either related to each other or opposed to each other. [4] X Research source For example, let’s say you’re writing an essay about recycling. Your first point might be about the value of local recycling programs, while your second point might be about the importance of encouraging recycling at work or school. A good transition between these two points might be “furthermore” or “additionally.” If your third point is about how upcycling might be the best way to reuse old items, a good transition word might be “however” or “on the other hand.” This is because upcycling involves reusing items rather than recycling them, so it's a little bit different. You want your reader to recognize that you're talking about something that slightly contrasts with your original two points."

      "title": "Open your essay with a “hook” that engages your reader’s interest.",
      "content": "Open your essay with a “hook” that engages your reader’s interest. Your first sentence needs to make your reader want to continue reading. This is often difficult, so you might want to write this sentence last. Here are some common ways to hook your reader: [5] X Research source Provide a quote: “According to Neil LaBute, ‘We live in a disposable society.’” Include statistics: “The EPA reports that only 34 percent of waste created by Americans is recycled every year.” Give a rhetorical question: “If you could change your habits to save the planet, would you do it?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Explain your topic and why it’s important in 2 sentences.",
      "content": "Explain your topic and why it’s important in 2 sentences. Write 2 general statements about your topic, narrowing down to your thesis. Give your readers a general idea about what you will write about, including any important background information. Here’s an example: “Recycling offers a way to reduce waste and reuse old items, but many people don’t bother recycling their old goods. Unless people change their ways, landfills will continue to grow as more generations discard their trash.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Present your argument or stance in your thesis statement.",
      "content": "Present your argument or stance in your thesis statement . The last sentence in your introduction is your thesis statement, which is like a road map for your essay. Your thesis should include your stance on the topic and the points you will article. Later, you will develop thesis points in each of your paragraphs. [6] X Research source Here’s how a basic thesis about recycling might look: \"To reduce the amount of trash in landfills, people must participate in local recycling programs, start recycling at school or work, and upcycle old items whenever they can.\" If you’re writing an argument or persuasive essay, your thesis might look like this: “Although recycling may take more effort, recycling and upcycling are both valuable ways to prevent expanding landfills.”"

    {
      "title": "Begin each body paragraph when you have a new idea to introduce.",
      "content": "Begin each body paragraph when you have a new idea to introduce. The \"body\" paragraphs are the paragraphs between your introduction and conclusion. Paragraphs begin with a new idea, which should be explained in the topic sentence. There is no standard size for paragraphs, but they should have at least 4 sentences. [7] X Research source A good body paragraph in a short essay typically has 6-8 sentences. If you’re not sure how many sentences your paragraphs should include, talk to your instructor. Write a new paragraph for each of your main ideas. Packing too much information into one paragraph can make it confusing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write a clear topic sentence to introduce your main point.",
      "content": "Write a clear topic sentence to introduce your main point. Begin your paragraph by clearly stating its topic. The topic sentence should state one idea or point, as clearly as possible. The rest of the paragraph will expand on the idea in this sentence. [8] X Research source If you begin your essay by writing an outline, include your topic sentence for each paragraph in your outline. You might write, “Local recycling programs are a valuable way to reduce waste, but only if people use them.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide your evidence to back up the point you’re making.",
      "content": "Provide your evidence to back up the point you’re making. Your evidence might be a quote, statistic, or example that backs up your idea. Choose evidence that’s appropriate for your essay assignment. If you’re not sure what to use, talk to your instructor and review your assignment sheet. [9] X Research source Your evidence might come from books, journal articles, websites, or other authoritative sources . The word evidence might make you think of data or experts. However, some essays will include only your ideas, depending on the assignment. In this case, you might be allowed to take evidence from your observations and experiences, but only if your assignment specifically allows this type of evidence. You could write, “According to Mayor Anderson’s office, only 23 percent of local households participate in the city’s recycling program.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Analyze your evidence in 1-2 sentences to connect it back to your ideas.",
      "content": "Analyze your evidence in 1-2 sentences to connect it back to your ideas. Explain the evidence in your own words, then tell the reader how it supports your main idea for this paragraph. Help the reader understand how this information supports your thesis. [10] X Research source In some cases, you may offer more than one piece of evidence in the same paragraph. Make sure you provide a 1 to 2 sentence explanation for each piece of evidence. For instance, “Residents who are using the recycling program aren’t contributing as much trash to local landfills, so they’re helping keep the community clean. On the other hand, most households don’t recycle, so the program isn’t as effective as it could be.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Conclude the paragraph.",
      "content": "Conclude the paragraph. Use the final sentence of the paragraph to link your paragraph to the main topic of your essay, or to introduce an idea that you will explore in your next paragraph. [11] X Research source For instance, you could write, “Clearly, local recycling programs can make a big difference, but they aren’t the only way to reduce waste.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Restate your thesis in the opening sentence of your conclusion.",
      "content": "Restate your thesis in the opening sentence of your conclusion. Begin your conclusion by reminding your reader of your main points. This helps your reader recall what you set out to prove in your essay. [12] X Research source You could write, “By participating in local recycling programs, recycling at work, and upcycling old items, people can reduce their environmental footprint.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Summarize how your arguments support your thesis in 1-2 sentences.",
      "content": "Summarize how your arguments support your thesis in 1-2 sentences. Briefly explain the key information your provided in your essay, as well as how it proves your ideas. Convince the reader that you proved your point. [13] X Research source As an example, “Statistics show that few people are participating in available recycling programs, but they are an effective way to reduce waste. By recycling and upcycling, people can reduce their trash consumption by as much as 70%.”"

      "content": "End by answering the question “so what.” This helps your reader know what you want them to take from your essay. It provides relevance to your essay, making the reader appreciate your ideas more. Here are some great ways to end your essay: [14] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Give your readers a call to action. For example, “To save the planet, everyone needs to recycle.\" Offer a solution to the problem you presented.

You might write, \"To get more people to recycle, researchers need to determine the reasons why they don't.\" Provide a valuable insight about your topic. As an example, \"If everyone recycled, landfills might become a thing of the past.\""
