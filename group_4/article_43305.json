      "content": "An early sign of rabies is a sudden and intense change in behavior. There are 3 phases of a rabies infection, and the first is the prodromal stage . During this stage, the cat will usually exhibit behavior that’s really unusual for them. [1] X Research source For example, cats who are usually shy and timid may become excitable, and cats who are normally extroverted may turn nervous or irritable. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You may also notice changes in your cat’s appetite. Here are some key things to look for: Aggression: Even the tamest and shyest cats can become mean if they have rabies. If a normally sweet and gentle cat is suddenly aggressive toward you or other animals, this could be a sign of the infection. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Nervousness: A cat that’s usually very calm and relaxed could become incredibly hyper, excitable, or anxious for no apparent reason. Changes in how social they are: A cat that’s typically very shy might become unusually outgoing if it has rabies, and a cat that’s usually friendly could completely isolate itself. Lack of appetite: An early sign of rabies is a sudden lack of appetite or abnormal disinterest in food. If a cat turns away a meal or treats or stops eating altogether, it may be a sign that there’s a bigger problem.

      "content": "In the next stage, intense aggression, seizures, and drooling develop. The second stage of a rabies infection is called the furious stage , also known as the “mad dog” stage. [5] X Research source During this period, the cat will become much more aggressive and even vicious toward you and other animals, and they may lash out with their teeth and claws. Since the virus is attacking the nervous system, a lack of coordination, trouble swallowing, drooling, and foaming at the mouth can also occur. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is the stage when a rabid cat is most dangerous to humans and other animals.

      "title": "During the final stage, intense weakness and paralysis sets in.",
      "content": "During the final stage, intense weakness and paralysis sets in. Rabies damages a cat’s nervous system, making it difficult for them to control their muscles. Because of this, they can have a hard time walking or moving their legs and appear lethargic. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source As the disease progresses, the paralysis becomes worse and the cat eventually goes into a coma. Unfortunately, cats usually pass away at this stage of infection, which is called the paralytic stage."

      "title": "Bring your cat to the vet if they show symptoms of rabies.",
      "content": "Bring your cat to the vet if they show symptoms of rabies. If you believe your cat may have rabies, or if they’ve been bitten by an unknown animal, take them to the vet immediately. Rabies is a fast-acting virus, so it’s important to act quickly. [9] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source The vet will ask for your cat’s vaccination history, and they’ll also ask if your cat is displaying any symptoms yet, as both of these things will affect your treatment options. For example, if your cat has already been vaccinated against rabies, the vet will administer a booster shot to help fight off the virus, and you’ll then be instructed to quarantine the cat at home for 45 days to make sure no symptoms develop. Unfortunately, if your cat isn’t vaccinated against rabies or if they’re already displaying symptoms, veterinarians will usually recommend euthanasia. This is because the vaccine can’t reliably prevent rabies if your cat has never been vaccinated before, and there is no treatment available for rabies once symptoms start. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "There is no live animal test to determine rabies.",
      "content": "There is no live animal test to determine rabies. Unfortunately, there’s no test a vet can perform on your cat to determine if they have rabies or not. Because of this, the vet will likely ask you questions about possible rabies exposure (recent smell of skunk in your yard, exposure to raccoons, any bats in the area), examine your cat, and make a diagnosis based on their symptoms. [11] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source To make a completely accurate rabies diagnosis, the brain has to be removed postmortem. Small sections of the brain are then examined under a microscope to look for the presence of Negri bodies."

      "title": "A rabies booster shot may be advised.",
      "content": "A rabies booster shot may be advised. If your cat has been previously vaccinated against rabies, they’ll have a booster shot of the vaccine as soon as possible after they’re bitten. This helps the immune system fight off the virus. Your cat will also likely have to be observed for signs of rabies for 10 to 45 days. This can often be done at home, as long as they’re confined and not in contact with any animals or humans outside of the household. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Be aware that euthanasia may be necessary.",
      "content": "Be aware that euthanasia may be necessary. If your cat has not been vaccinated against rabies and is bitten by a confirmed rabid animal, euthanasia is often recommended. This is because rabies is a serious threat to human health, and there’s a high chance your cat will become rabid. [13] X Research source Your cat can also be quarantined and observed for 6 months in a veterinary clinic; however, euthanasia may still be suggested or advised depending on the cat’s condition and estimated quality of life. Of course, euthanasia is an incredibly difficult thing for a cat owner to consider, but rabies is a very dangerous disease for humans, and it’s also very painful for your cat. If your vet determines that your cat does in fact have rabies, euthanasia is often the best option for your own safety, and it also prevents your cat from suffering as the disease progresses."

Caused by a virus in the Rhabdoviridae family, this disease is most common in wild and domestic animals (primarily skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, bats, dogs, and cats). The virus attacks the nervous system and can be 100% fatal in animals left untreated. [14] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source The virus enters the body through a bite, cut, or scratch and is typically transmitted through mucus from the mouth or eyes."

      "content": "Cats get rabies when they come in contact with an animal with rabies. Rabies is spread through direct contact with an infected animal, typically through a bite. When an infected animal bites another animal, the infected animal’s saliva may transmit rabies to the healthy animal. Once the disease enters the body, it travels via the nerves to the spinal cord and brain. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The rabies virus can live on the cat’s skin or hair for up to 2 hours, so wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt and pants before handling a potentially infected cat. If you think your cat might have come in contact with a rabid animal , check to see if he has any bite marks, open wounds, or signs of a fight, as exposed skin could put them at risk."

If your yard is not appealing to wild animals, then there’s less of a chance of your cat coming into contact with rabies. Some things that you can do to keep wild animals out of your yard include: [20] X Research source Placing tight lids on all of your garbage cans. Making sure there are no hiding spots for skunks or raccoons, such as under your deck or house. Putting in a fence to keep wandering animals out of your yard. Keeping trees and shrubs pruned and trimmed."

Wash the bite thoroughly with soap and water. Then, contact your doctor immediately. [21] X Research source It’s important to seek medical attention right away after a bite from a suspected rabid animal because a rabies infection is very dangerous for humans, and once symptoms begin, there's no effective treatment. [22] X Trustworthy Source World Health Organization Health information and news provided by the World Health Organization Go to source A healthcare professional will likely administer a series of rabies vaccinations and a dose of rabies immunoglobulin to protect you from the virus as soon as you think you’ve been exposed.
