      "content": "Gather reference images when thinking of a design. When deciding on a tattoo design , tattoo artist Burak Moreno suggests that you “Collect the designs you like as reference images and give them to an artist if you like their work and think they work in a similar style to your reference images. Let them design [the tattoo] for you.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide if your tattoo has any special meanings.",
      "content": "Decide if your tattoo has any special meanings. According to tattoo artist Katherine D. Vargas, people get tattoos for a variety of reasons: “People find different ways to cope or to find closure with things. I do a lot of grief tattoos, and that helps them a lot. [Sometimes], people just like the look and aesthetic of it, but mostly, it’s because of healing or overcoming something and becoming a better version of themselves.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Be willing to listen to your artist’s design suggestions.",
      "content": "Be willing to listen to your artist’s design suggestions. Tattoo artist Grant Lubbock advises being flexible about your tattoo design and placement: “The more willing you are as a client to work with the artist and let your artist guide you through the tattoo process, the better tattoo you’ll wind up with. If the client can be flexible with control over where the tattoo’s going, how it’s going to be placed, and all that stuff, overall, the tattoo will be much better.” For example, while watercolor tattoos can look pretty at first, Moreno warns, “Watercolor fades way easier than any tattoo if it isn’t made the right way. It’s best if you use the watercolor effect as a supporter element. If it’s the main part of the design, it won’t hold very well.” Your artist may offer similar advice when discussing your tattoo."

    {
      "title": "Do your research when looking for a tattoo artist.",
      "content": "Do your research when looking for a tattoo artist. Moreno shares a classic motto: “Good tattoos are not cheap, and cheap tattoos are not good.” The price for a good tattoo will vary depending on your location, so be sure to check out the artist’s portfolio to make sure you like their work. Lubbock says, “Look for clean linework, solid shading, smooth gradient shading, and consistency throughout pieces. Just because they have one rockstar piece in their portfolio doesn’t mean they’re going to be a good tattooer.” Vargas warns, “Don’t expect one artist to know how to do every [style].” For example, if you want a fine line tattoo, look for an artist who specializes in that style. It’s probably not a good idea to go to someone who specializes in traditional or realism. Lubbock also suggests seeing the tattoo shop in person before committing to getting a tattoo there: “You can generally just walk into a shop and look around to pick up on cues as to whether or not the shop is clean. Many shops will often open their doors and show you the back so they can show you their cleaning rooms and how they sterilize.”"

    {
      "title": "Be certain you like the placement of your tattoo.",
      "content": "Be certain you like the placement of your tattoo. When it comes to placing your first tattoo, tattoo artist Michelle Myles says, “That’s a personal preference. A lot of times, it just goes back to how visible you want it to be. Girls sometimes go for the ankle or shoulder, but I would say get it where you really want it… Don’t make the decision based on how much it hurts. The pain will go away, but you’re still going to be stuck with the placement.” When it comes to choosing the least painful area to get a tattoo, Vargas explains, “Everyone is different. I would definitely say the arms are the easiest, though.” The location of your tattoo can determine how quickly it fades. Moreno explains, “If a tattoo is on your hand/finger or feet, it might fade as fast as 6 weeks.” Be careful about getting hand, neck, or face tattoos. Moreno says these are “job stopper tattoos,” as they may prevent you from getting hired for certain jobs."

    {
      "title": "Come prepared for your appointment.",
      "content": "Come prepared for your appointment. “If they’re going to have a long appointment,” tattoo artist María Fernández González explains, “I will recommend that [the client] takes something to drink, maybe some snacks. When you are getting a tattoo, your body temperature feels lower, so something that I think helps a lot of people to feel calm and relaxed is to take a little blanket with them.” Depending on the size of your tattoo, don’t expect to get it done quickly. Vargas explains, “It’s not a fast process. People think it’s like you’re in and out, but it’s definitely like a two-hour process.” Your appointment may be longer or shorter depending on how large and intricate the design is, however. Depending on the studio, you may be out in the open when getting a tattoo. Fernández González explains, “Always think about which body position [you’ll be in] and try to use clothing that allows you to show [that] area without being naked.” Myles explains, “The most important thing before you go in and get a tattoo is to get a good night’s sleep and to have something to eat. You want to be in as good a shape as you can be. You don’t want to go in all hungover and tired from the night before.”"

      "title": "Follow your artist’s instructions on how to care for your new tattoo.",
      "content": "Follow your artist’s instructions on how to care for your new tattoo. When healing your tattoo, Lubbock stresses that you should listen to your artist, not your friends: “Don’t listen to what your friends say. More often than not, friends [think they’re] professional tattooers, that they know best for a tattoo, but don’t follow what they say.” To help handle the pain of a fresh tattoo, Vargas says, “Usually, the next day, I tell the clients to take a Tylenol or something because the body is in shock when you get a new tattoo.” To help prevent your tattoo from getting infected , Myles recommends, “Wash it a couple times a day the first few days, and just use a very mild soap and your hands. Don’t use a washcloth because washcloths tend to hold bacteria… [Use] vitamin A&D ointment or Aquaphor. You don’t want to use anything that’s too greasy, like vitamin E, aloe, or Vaseline.” When showering with a new tattoo, Moreno says to avoid “hot or long showers” as well as baths. While you should always listen to your tattoo artist’s aftercare instructions , Lubbock says, “If you already have a couple of tattoos, listen to your body because your body will tell you what’s going to work best for you. We all heal a little bit differently.”"

If you’re worried, your best bet is to show the artist who did it and ask their advice. If it seems like something that’s very urgent, go to your doctor.” Myles says, “Be careful of clothes rubbing on your tattoo. [For example], how often do you actually wash your jackets? If you have a dirty jacket sleeve, rubbing on your tattoo, that can make the healing process take longer.”"
