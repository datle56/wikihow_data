If she’s the one with chapped lips, you can give her a cute lip balm set or a gift bag with lip balm, lotion, and other spa-related items so she doesn’t feel embarrassed. Before you go in for a kiss, you can even use your lip balm and casually offer it to her. [2] X Research source Pull out your lip balm and ask if she wants to use it, saying, “Hey do you want some?”"

Try to stay relaxed in your body and lips, and take note of what kissing technique your girlfriend uses so you can mimic it. [3] X Research source Let your lips lead and keep the tongue to a minimum (at first). Then follow her lead and try the level of pressure and tongue motion she uses.

      "content": "Reflect on the quality of your relationship. Has anything changed lately? Holding back on physical affection might be your girlfriend’s way of communicating that something’s wrong—even though it can be really distressing and frustrating for you. She might be withdrawing if she doesn’t feel heard or understood. Start a conversation with your partner about your needs in the relationship as well as hers. [5] X Research source Ask open-ended questions that don’t rely on blaming one partner. For instance, you can ask, “What’s missing from our relationship?” or “What can we do to make our relationship better?” Reader Poll: We asked 1057 wikiHow readers what they’d do if they noticed a lack of connection in their relationship, and 50% of them agreed that they would initiate a conversation with their partner to address the issue .

Since couples who kiss more often have more sex, if she has a lower desire for sex than you do, she might be concerned that a make-out session will lead to more physical intimacy than she wants. Whether or not you’ve slept together before, let your partner know what you’re thinking about when you go to kiss her so that you can be on the same page. [10] X Research source Start a conversation about intimacy in general by asking, “What level of intimacy are you comfortable with? Is it okay if I kiss you?” Clearly ask for consent by posing the question, “Can I kiss you?” Clarify your intentions by saying, “I want you to know that kissing doesn’t have to lead to sex if you don’t want that.”"

If not kissing your partner is a “deal breaker” for you, you might consider ending the relationship.
