      "title": "Purchase a mild shampoo.",
      "content": "Purchase a mild shampoo. The shampoo should be a shampoo specifically formulated for synthetic hair. A shampoo for synthetic wigs works fine on synthetic extensions as well. However, if you cannot find a shampoo for synthetic hair, then a mild shampoo works fine too. Not all shampoos are labeled mild or strong, so look for a shampoo without “sulfates,” which is a strong cleansing agent. Shampoos without sulfates are much gentler on the hair, and they’re usually labeled as “sulfate-free” on the front of the bottle. [2] X Research source You should be able to buy shampoos for synthetic wigs and extensions at a beauty supply store or wig store. (Try only to use conditioner if you can.) That said, you should only wash synthetic hair if it is smelly or visibly dirty. Washing will not add shine or strengthen the hair, and you should not wash it too often."

      "content": "Comb out tangles with a wide tooth comb gently. A wide tooth comb won’t snag the hair like a comb with smaller teeth does. Work from the ends of the hair to the roots as you gently comb the tangles out. In other words, work from the bottom up. To make the combing process easier, wet the hair by spritzing it with a spray bottle filled with water or detangling spray. Then, comb the hair. If the hair has a really tight curl pattern, use your fingers to comb the hair. Your fingers are much gentler, won’t snag the hair and won’t disrupt the curl pattern like a comb does. If you are wearing a wig or clip-in extensions, you might find it easier to take them off and then comb them. Purchase a wig block at a beauty supply store, and set the wig on the block with T-pins. This will help you comb the hair."

      "content": "Fill up a sink basin with water. The water should be cool to lukewarm -- not hot. Make sure that the water is not too hot or it might affect the smoothness or texture of the hair. Fill up the sink to a level high enough to immerse all of the hair in the water."

      "title": "Mix a capful of shampoo formulated for synthetic hair into the water.",
      "content": "Mix a capful of shampoo formulated for synthetic hair into the water. If you are washing a lot of hair, then mix two capfuls of shampoo into the water. Use your best judgment to decide if you need one or two capfuls. You don’t want to use too much shampoo because you don’t want the cleanser to strip the hair of any coatings that give it a sheen or change the look and feel of the hair. Using too much shampoo or a harsh shampoo can make the hair look dull."

      "content": "Immerse your wig or hair extensions in the water. The hair should be fully submerged. Make sure it absorbs the water. Push it down under the water if necessary. If the hair is not wet enough, then the shampoo won’t be able to cleanse the hair."

Go back and forth between swishing and dunking the hair until you think it is clean. [3] X Research source Avoid rubbing the hair in circles, as this may cause more tangles."

      "content": "Rinse the hair with cool water. Cool water closes the hair cuticles on human hair. On synthetic hair, cool water won’t disrupt any of the coatings on the hair or alter the curl pattern like hot water can. So, rinse out the hair thoroughly with cool water until all of the lather has rinsed out and the water runs clear."

      "title": "Purchase a detangling conditioner.",
      "content": "Purchase a detangling conditioner. You want to prevent the hair from detangling at all costs. If the hair gets tangled, then you will have to painstakingly detangle it without messing up the texture, curl or wave pattern of the hair. Since the hair is not natural, moisturizing conditioner won’t be as effective as it is on human hair because the synthetic hair can’t absorb it. Conditioners are usually labeled by type. So, they will say moisturizing, volumizing, or detangling on the front of the bottle. If you are still having trouble finding a detangling shampoo, check the children’s section. Several companies make shampoos and detangling conditioners for children. If you want to add some sheen back to the hair, purchase a conditioner with some natural oils such as avocado or jojoba oil."

      "content": "Swish the hair back and forth in the water. Agitate the hair by gently moving it back and forth in the water, just as you did before. You want just a bit of the conditioner to grab hold of the hair and condition it. Too much will weigh the hair down and make it look greasy since synthetic hair can’t absorb the conditioner the way human hair can. Keep swishing the hair around for a few minutes until you think the hair is conditioned."

      "content": "Let the conditioner sit in the hair. Do not rinse it out.The conditioner should remain in the hair even if it is not a leave-in. If you prefer, use a leave-in conditioner on the hair instead. Use a water-based leave-in that typically comes in a spritz-style spray bottle. [5] X Research source You also can let the hair sit in the conditioner water for 10 to 15 minutes if you're washing the extensions in the sink. You can make your own leave-in conditioner by pouring a cap of detangling conditioner into a spray bottle and filling the bottle with water. Shake to combine the two ingredients, and spray on hair as needed. If you think that you have added a bit too much conditioner to the hair, spritz the hair with water from a spray bottle to gently rinse out some of it."

Some synthetic hair has been specially formulated to work with hot tools, but most have not. It should say if you can use hot tools on your synthetic hair on the package . Even then, check the label to see if you can blow dry the hair. For best results, allow the hair to air dry even if you can use hot tools on the hair.

      "content": "Comb with a wide-toothed comb. Using a wide-toothed comb ensures that you’ll have far fewer snags when you’re combing the hair since the teeth are wider. If the curl pattern is especially tightly curled, use your fingers to finger comb the hair. In this case, your fingers are your best tool. Don’t brush curly or wavy synthetic hair with bristled brushes such as boar bristle brushes. These kinds of brushes can mess up the pattern and texture of the hair."

      "title": "Spritz the hair with water to comb it.",
      "content": "Spritz the hair with water to comb it. If the hair is curly, wavy or textured, this will be especially helpful. Water helps add slip so that you can move the comb through the hair easily. If you need more slip, add a little bit of leave-in conditioner to the water in the spray bottle. You also can purchase wig spray to comb the hair. Lots of synthetic hair is tightly curled textured hair because synthetic hair can recreate the texture and curls of specific types of hair that is difficult to recreate with straight human hair -- the original state of most extensions. Synthetic hair creates texture and holds the curl and waves better than human hair does. So, if you’re using curly and wavy synthetic hair and you want it to last longer, spritz the hair with water and comb through with your fingers."

      "title": "Set hot tools to a cool setting.",
      "content": "Set hot tools to a cool setting. If you have synthetic hair that you can use hot tools on, make sure you use a cool setting on the flat iron or curling iron. Otherwise, you might melt the hair. Also, styling changes that you make with hot tools can set the hair permanently. So, be careful when you’re using flat irons and curling irons. [6] X Research source . You also can curl straight synthetic hair with hot water. Set the hair on rollers, or whatever you’re using as a curling rod. Then, dip the hair in very hot water, or spray hot water on the hair if you're wearing them. Place the hair on a towel to dry or let it air dry, and then remove the curling rods once it’s dry. Only do this if you really want to change the style of the hair. It’s not recommended to curl it and then try to straighten it. Synthetic hair can’t undergo frequent style changes so easily without damaging the hair. If your synthetic hair does not say that you can use hot tools on it, then don’t. You might ruin or melt the hair."

Leave it for an hour, and then wipe off excess oil by blotting with a towel.. If necessary, wash out the excess with a dollop of mild shampoo and rinse. Most synthetic extensions are naturally shinier than human hair, so only do this if they appear dull."

After a while, even if you take good care of them, eventually they will have to be removed. They don't last forever. So, plan a return trip to the hairdresser to get some replacements reinstalled."
