      "content": "Prepare your desired waffle batter . You can make it from scratch using your favorite recipe, or you can make it using a boxed mix. Don't over-mix the batter; you want there to be some lumps. If you do this, the waffle will turn out chewy. [1] X Research source Add some oil or melted butter into your recipe to reduce sticking. [2] X Research source For extra flavor, add some cinnamon, vanilla, or almond extract. If you want some heat in your breakfast, try a dash of chili powder."

      "content": "Preheat the waffle maker. Set the waffle maker onto a flat, heat-safe surface and plug it in. If your waffle maker has different heat settings (ie: light, medium, dark), select the one that appeals to you. [3] X Research source Some models will have an indicator light that switches on. Pay attention to this light; it will turn off or change color when the iron is ready to use."

      "content": "Grease the waffle maker plates, if needed. You can use cooking spray, melted butter, or oil. This will prevent the batter from sticking and makes cleaning up easier. [4] X Research source If you have a non-stick waffle maker, skip the cooking spray, butter, or oil. This will only lead to sticky, gummy build-up. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the batter in a spiral. Measure out about ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of batter. Pour it onto the plate in a spiral, starting from the outside edges. If your waffle maker has an indicator light, wait for the light to change color (or switch off, depending on the model) first. [6] X Research source If some batter leaks out, don't worry; just use less next time."

      "title": "Close the lid and allow the batter to cook.",
      "content": "Close the lid and allow the batter to cook. As your waffle cooks, it will release steam. Wait until the steam stops coming out before checking on the waffle for doneness. How long this takes depends on the model and setting you are using; it usually takes about 5 minutes. Do not peek while the waffle is cooking. If you lift the lid too early, you could rip the waffle apart! [7] X Research source If your waffle has an indicator light, wait for the light to change color or switch off (depending on the model). If your waffle iron doesn't have an indicator light, check the crack between the to plates. The waffle peeking out from the side will look more like cake when it is done."

Use a rubber spatula to pick off any pieces of batter stuck to the plates. For really stubborn spots, cover them with cooking oil, wait 5 minutes, then wipe them away with a soft cloth. Do not use scouring pads or steel wool on the plates. Do not use soap unless the instructions tell you to do so. If the plate are removable, you can soak them in water. Avoid using soap unless the instruction manual specifically tells you to do so. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Try a different kind of batter, such as brownie. Prepare your desired batter, then pour it into a greased waffle maker. Close the lid, and cook the batter until there's no more steam. If you want a crispier finish, leave the batter in the waffle maker for a few more seconds. [11] X Research source This can get a little messy. Make clean up easier by placing a baking sheet under the waffle maker to catch any spilled batter. You can use this technique to make lots of yummy treats, including brownies, banana bread, carrot cake, doughnuts, or even muffins! Make your doughnuts more doughnut-like by glazing them with glace icing or chocolate ganache once they have cooled. [12] X Research source"
