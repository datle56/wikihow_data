      "content": "Opt to take an all- or partially-nude photo if you want to show more skin. Being nude isn't a requirement for an erotic photo, but if it's something you'd like to try, then go for it! If you want to take a nude photo but are nervous , try starting out with some clothes on and gradually remove them as you're taking photos to work yourself up to it. If you are bold you can actually start completely naked! You can pose as much as you want, or simply take a selfie as you get out of the shower. [1] X Research source No matter your size, you can take a nude photo. Be confident and take time to appreciate the beauty of your body—it'll reflect in your photo. If it may help, read the article How to Look Good Naked (Girls Version) if you are a girl/woman and if you are a man/guy read the article How to Look and Feel Good Naked (Guys) ."

      "content": "Apply makeup to give yourself a more dramatic look. Use a slightly heavier hand than usual to make sure your features stand out in a two-dimensional setting. For classically sexy, pinup-style makeup, try false eyelashes, black eyeliner, and bright red lipstick. Use foundation to even out your skin tone and cover any blemishes. [2] X Research source If you prefer a more natural style , that can also be really sexy. Use light eyeliner and mascara to define your eyes, and put on some lipgloss to make your lips look a little more plump. If you don’t want to include make-up don’t apply it. You can also download a beautification app like Meitu, BeautyCam or another app which includes the makeup feature."

      "content": "Style your hair so it's voluminous and sexy. Tousle your hair for a suggestive bed-head look that implies a recent roll in the hay. Tease already-dry hair with back-combing and hairspray, or you could wash and blow dry your hair, applying a root-lifter or mousse around your scalp. The tousled look is a great one to emulate for both feminine and masculine styles. [3] X Research source If you want to take a sexy photo of yourself in the bath, try making a messy bun with your hair to keep it out of the water. If you just want to take a quick selfie to send to someone else, you definitely don't have to take tons of time to get prepared. Just try to tame any flyaway hairs, make sure there is nothing stuck in your teeth, and snap away!"

      "content": "Pluck, trim, and shave away stray hairs that you don't want in the photo. This depends entirely on what kind of photo you want to take—if you're focusing mainly on your face, you may not need to shave your legs or trim your bikini line . Just how plucked you want to be is completely up to you! Decide what makes you feel the best and go with that. If you love the all-natural look and don't want to shave any body hair, you don't have to. For men, having a beard or some facial stubble can be a really sexy look; just make sure you're well-groomed before snapping a photo."

      "content": "Pick out a few sexy pieces of clothing if you want to wear clothes. A photo can be erotic even when you're clothed (and sometimes wearing something sexy can be even more alluring than being in the nude). If you do decide to wear some sexy garments, remember that the goal is to tease, intrigue, and highlight your best qualities. Just make sure that whatever you choose fits you well and is in good shape. [4] X Research source For men, try wearing a button-up shirt and undoing several of the top buttons to show off your chest. Or put on a tank top that highlights your arm and shoulder muscles. Lingerie like bustiers, negligees, slips, stocking, and garters are all fun options. Lace bras, push-up bras, and other styles can accentuate your cleavage in a really attractive way. Steer clear of baggy or worn-out underwear. Opt for thongs , boyshorts, or a bikini-cut style. Add a few accessories to your ensemble, like high heels, oversized button-up shirts, men's ties, long necklaces, scarves, glasses, or whatever else strikes your fancy."

      "content": "Get creative with the location and think outside the box. Don't feel like you have to restrict your photo location to the bedroom or bathroom (though you can get some great shots while laying in bed or coming out of the shower). Using a couch or plush chair or posing against a plain wall can produce some great pictures, especially if the lighting is right. [5] X Research source You can even take a sexy pic while you're out in public. Just find a nice backdrop and pose while you snap a selfie."

      "content": "Remove distractions and clutter from the background of the photo. Make sure you're the star of the photo by removing any distractions from the area where you plan to take your shots. Remove clutter, get rid of any loud wall hangings, and clear out anything else that doesn't fit the look you want. [6] X Research source For example, if you're taking a photo on your bed, clear off your nightstand and make sure any closets or drawers are shut. If you're in the bathroom, clear off the counter completely and remove any wet towels that might be hanging up."

      "title": "Clean the mirror",
      "content": "Clean the mirror if you're planning to use it in your photo. A lot of erotic photos utilize a mirror so that you can capture certain angles, and an otherwise beautiful photo can be made less so if the mirror is covered in spots and streaks. Take a few minutes to wipe down the mirror with glass cleaner and a lint-free towel so that your photos will be (literally) spotless. [7] X Research source Make sure your camera lens is also clean . Whether you're using an actual camera or the camera function on your phone, a grimy lens can really affect the quality of your photos."

      "title": "Opt for natural lighting when you can for the most alluring photos.",
      "content": "Opt for natural lighting when you can for the most alluring photos. Sunlight is the best light to use to take photos of yourself because it softens you and makes you look more natural. So while it may seem counterintuitive, schedule your erotic-photo session for midday if you can. Open up the blinds to let in natural light; just be careful if there are people outside that they can't see you, especially if you're nude. [8] X Research source If you can't use natural light, opt for lamps rather than overhead lighting for a softer glow to your photos. If the glare is too strong, throw a sheer scarf over the lamp to mute its brightness."

      "content": "Get familiar with your camera's timer and settings. If you're taking photos of yourself, chances are you're using your phone's camera function . But regardless of whether you're using your phone or an actual camera, knowing how to set a delay and how to change the focus will make your photo-taking experience a lot simpler. Most phone cameras have filters you can apply to your photos, which can be a fun way to quickly edit a photo before you send it off to someone. [9] X Research source If you're interested in taking photos from some unusual angles, invest in a tripod for your phone (they cost about $15). Some social media apps have fun filters that you can use when taking your sexy selfies. Check out Instagram and Snapchat to try out their photo-altering filters to see if there's one you like."

      "content": "Ensure that you'll have privacy while you're taking your erotic photos. If you live with other people, try to pick a time when you know you'll have the place to yourself. If you're alone, you won't have to worry about being interrupted, and you'll be able to relax and enjoy yourself more. If you can't be in a totally empty home, then make sure to lock your bedroom door before you start snapping those erotic photos. Keep your pets out of the room while you're snapping your pics. They may be cute, but no one wants to be distracted by your dog jumping in the background."

      "content": "Get in the right mood before you start snapping selfies. If you're old enough, have a nice drink while you're getting ready. Put on some relaxing, sensual music. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and affirm the things you like about yourself. If you're tense or uncomfortable, that will reflect in your photos. [10] X Research source If you do have a drink, avoid having too many before you start taking photos! You want to be relaxed, but you don't want your eyes to be glazed over from accidentally imbibing too much."

      "title": "Highlight your favorite features to take a photo you will love to look at.",
      "content": "Highlight your favorite features to take a photo you will love to look at. If you're not a professional photographer, it might seem like models use witchcraft to look amazingly proportioned in every photo. But a lot of this is just smart photography that accentuates your best features. Remember that you don't have to just focus on your chest, legs, curves, six-pack abs, or toned arms. Take a look at yourself in the mirror and think about which part of your body you love the most, is most unique, or that you're most proud of. [11] X Research source If you're snapping a selfie, try taking a photo from up above your head so that you're looking up at the camera—this will elongate your face and give you the opportunity to include a downward shot of your body, too. Take a photo over your shoulder of your backside in a mirror. Whether you want to show off your back muscles or your curves, this is a great way to highlight your posterior."

      "title": "Try out multiple poses and angles.",
      "content": "Try out multiple poses and angles. While you can, of course, use a timer and a tripod to get some cool angles for your photos, don't be afraid to snap a quick selfie (and don't forget you can use a selfie-stick , too, to get a little more height). It may take a little time before you find a pose you absolutely love. Try out some of these poses and angles to get started: [12] X Research source Make the S-curve. Arch your back as much as possible so that your breasts are pushed forward and your butt is pushed back. This will accentuate your curves and imitate an hourglass shape. Keep your chin up. Raise your chin a little bit more than you think you need to. It'll make your neck look longer and slimmer, and you'll avoid creating weird shadows over your collarbones. Throw your shoulders back. As with arching your back, this posture helps to push your breasts forward. Try holding your phone out to the side instead of right in front of you when you take a selfie. This will give you a sexier, more mysterious look. Get on your bed on your stomach and take a selfie from that position to include your chest, curves, legs, or whichever other part of your body you want to accentuate. You can twerk also if you want or you can pose topless! You could pose also while reading a book, or legs up, or pose while you strip! Get creative because the possibilities are endless!"

Instead, look away into the distance, or keep your eyes mostly closed for a seductive look. Turn your face to the side to optimize on shadows to create a more dramatic look. [13] X Research source"
