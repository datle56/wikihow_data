Dip a clean cloth, cotton ball, or cotton swab in the solution and use it to gently wipe around the piercing to clean it. Do this 3-4 times a day if you suspect your piercing is infected. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The sea salt solution also softens any crust around the piercing so it won't hurt to remove it. When you wash the piercing, gently wipe away the crust with a clean paper towel. [2] X Research source Use sea salt or non-iodized salt. The chemicals in iodized table salt don't dissolve completely and could further irritate your skin."

Ice is only going to be beneficial for the first day or two after the infection starts, when you might have swelling. If there's no swelling, switch to warm compresses."

Rest the tea bag on your piercing until it cools. [5] X Research source When the tea bag cools, feel free to repeat the process again. This is a gentle treatment you can keep doing as often as you like. Use the same tea bag multiple times.

Makeup harbors bacteria that can potentially infect your piercing. Avoid skincare products such as lotions, sunscreens, acne creams, face masks, exfoliators, and any facial cleansers that aren't fragrance-free. [20] X Research source It's okay to continue to use some of these products on the rest of your face—just keep them away from your nose. This also means you need to be very careful when you're out in the sun. Wear a wide-brimmed hat to keep the sun off your face and nose since you can't wear sunscreen."

Beyond that, twisting or pulling on the jewelry while your skin is dry can re-open the piercing site and make it take longer to heal. [21] X Research source Think of it this way: the less you touch your piercing, the better. Spin your jewelry around a few times immediately after you've cleaned your piercing to loosen the crust around it and keep it free from your healing skin. But do this while your skin is still wet—otherwise, you might accidentally tear it.

Both pools and bodies of freshwater harbor bacteria that can easily lead to another infection if it gets into your piercing before it's fully healed. Since the piercing is on your nose, you might be tempted to get in the pool and just not go under. But splashing and touching your face with wet hands could still reinfect the piercing, so it's best to stay dry. [23] X Research source Keep in mind that it can take 4-6 weeks for a nose piercing to heal. If you had to battle an infection, though, you're looking at more like 6-8 weeks."
