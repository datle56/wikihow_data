If your stencil is made from a thinner material (like printer paper), be sure to cut the edges precisely. Use thin slivers of tape under any edges that may fold over or stick up during the paint application, to avoid smearing or paint bleeding over the edges."

      "title": "Use a stencil brush.",
      "content": "Use a stencil brush. Dip into the acrylic paint but here is the trick––only dip just the edge of the brush and do not apply too much paint. Thin layers are the most effective for acrylic paint stenciling. Rub off any excess paint if needed, using paper towel or an old rag. [1] X Research source A stencil brush has a wide, flat surface. It's ideal for picking up a thin layer of paint. A soft stencil brush with natural bristles is the best choice; do not use synthetic ones or any other sort of paintbrush. Use a large stencil brush for large canvas areas, a small one for daintier and smaller areas."

      "title": "Dab the brush over the canvas, inside the stencil.",
      "content": "Dab the brush over the canvas, inside the stencil. Take a lot of care at the edges; do not push the brush under the stencil."

      "content": "Allow to dry completely. Apply other colors or areas only after the first one has dried, to avoid accidental smudging from your hand movements. Fortunately, acrylics dry quickly."
