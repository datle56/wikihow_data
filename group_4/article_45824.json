      "title": "Do this if your example has a subject and verb and can stand alone.",
      "content": "Do this if your example has a subject and verb and can stand alone. When used at the beginning of the sentence, the phrase \"for example\" introduces the example you're going to use. Here are some sentences with \"for example\" at the beginning: [1] X Research source \"Nurture creativity at home. For example, chalkboard paint allows kids to draw on walls.\" \"Getting in your daily exercise doesn't have to be difficult. For example, Jaime walks every evening after dinner.\""

      "title": "Your example can't stand alone if it doesn't have a subject and a verb.",
      "content": "Your example can't stand alone if it doesn't have a subject and a verb. In this situation, add your example to the sentence the example describes. Here are some sentences with \"for example\" in the middle: [2] X Research source \"You don't have to splurge on expensive cleaning products. Vinegar, for example, will clean most things.\" \"Playing a musical instrument requires skill and practice. Professional guitarists, for example, practice up to 8 hours a day.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Sometimes, the phrase \"for example\" sounds better at the end.",
      "content": "Sometimes, the phrase \"for example\" sounds better at the end. This is best used sparingly with shorter, less involved examples. When reading your writing aloud, if you find that the phrase sounds clunky in the middle of the sentence, you might try it at the end. Here are some sentences with \"for example\" at the end: [3] X Research source \"The diet does require you to eliminate a few things from your diet—sugar, for example.\" \"Learn a new language through immersion by changing the default language on your phone, for example.\""

      "title": "Commas separate explanatory information from the rest of the sentence.",
      "content": "Commas separate explanatory information from the rest of the sentence. The phrase \"for example\" explains to your readers how the information that follows it relates to the information that came before it. The commas enhance readability and reduce the obscurity in your sentence. Whether you put commas before, after, or both before and after depends on where you have the phrase in your sentence. At the beginning of the sentence: \"Many animals are monogamous. For example, otters mate for life.\" In the middle of the sentence: \"Many animals are monogamous. Otters, for example, mate for life.\" At the end of the sentence: \"Many animals are monogamous and mate for life—otters, for example.\""

      "title": "The parentheses already do the job of setting off the phrase.",
      "content": "The parentheses already do the job of setting off the phrase. Commas are normally used in a sentence to separate explanatory words from the sentence itself. In a parenthetical phrase, there's typically no need to do that. [4] X Research source Here's an example: \"Becky measured out her ingredients (for example flour and sugar) before she started baking.\""

    {
      "title": "Set the phrase off with commas before and after.",
      "content": "Set the phrase off with commas before and after. When it comes in the middle of a sentence, \"for example\" tells your readers that the words that follow shift the focus of the sentence slightly. The same principle applies if you have \"for example\" at the end of your sentence, except that the comma following the phrase isn't needed. Here it is in the middle of a sentence: \"Kelly expected us to bring our own supplies, for example, our notebooks and pens.\" If you had \"for example\" at the end of a sentence, it might look like this: \"Kelly expected us to bring our own supplies: our notebooks and pens, for example.\""

    {
      "title": "For some longer phrases, a semi-colon works better than a comma.",
      "content": "For some longer phrases, a semi-colon works better than a comma. A semi-colon indicates a longer pause than a comma and provides a resting place between 2 related ideas. It also makes your sentence easier to read when there are already a lot of commas. Typically the semi-colon comes immediately before \"for example.\" Here are some examples: [5] X Research source \"Find ways to fit activity into your day; for example, you could take the stairs instead of the elevator.\" \"You don't need artistic training or talent to be creative; for example, paint-by-numbers kits allow novices to create beautiful works of art.\""

    {
      "title": "Use \"for example\" when the list of possibilities is too long.",
      "content": "Use \"for example\" when the list of possibilities is too long. It might be that the list is just too long and would be cumbersome to write or read. In other situations, there's no need to include all the possibilities—just a couple will give your readers the basic idea. Here are some examples: [6] X Research source \"Many animals are monogamous. For example, otters, geese, and beavers mate for life.\" \"Campers are expected to bring their own supplies and gear. Tents and sleeping bags, for example, will not be provided.\""

      "title": "Add \"for example\" before a fictional set of circumstances.",
      "content": "Add \"for example\" before a fictional set of circumstances. Examples allow you to take a theoretical concept and show how it operates in the real world. With \"for example, you're taking the concept and applying it to a set of fictional circumstances. This shows your readers one possible way the concept could work. Here are some examples: [7] X Research source \"For example, if Judy bakes 4 cakes each day for 5 days, she would bake 20 cakes each week\" \"Children risk injury when playing with dangerous toys. For example, if you buy your child a BB gun, they could shoot their eye out.\""

      "title": "Use an example to show how an idea works in practice.",
      "content": "Use an example to show how an idea works in practice. Your illustration can be real or imagined—either way, it adds some life and color to your writing. Just as a drawing provides a visual image of text, a verbal illustration helps your readers picture the idea in their minds. Here are some examples: [8] X Research source \"Make language learning easier through immersion. For example, you could listen to music in the language you want to learn while doing chores.\" \"You don't have to take art classes to be creative. For example, you can use a paint-by-numbers kit to create a piece of art suitable for framing.\""

    {
      "title": "\"For example\" tells your readers your scenario is one of many.",
      "content": "\"For example\" tells your readers your scenario is one of many. The phrase \"for instance\" works better when you're talking about 1 particular case specifically. But if your example isn't meant to be specific, \"for example\" is a better choice. Here are some examples: [9] X Research source \"Many careers require you to perform in high-pressure situations. EMTs, for example, save the lives of people in trauma.\" \"Common cooking ingredients often have other uses. For example, you can use baking soda to clean and deodorize your refrigerator.\""

      "title": "Add a specific, real-world example as evidence in support of something.",
      "content": "Add a specific, real-world example as evidence in support of something. This is particularly effective if you're talking about something subjective. While you may not be able to demonstrate conclusively that the statement is true, you can list an example that backs it up so your readers are more inclined to believe you. [10] X Research source Here it is in a sentence: \"Everyone loves Mary's cupcakes. For example, Julian begs for them and he doesn't even like sweets.\" Here's another one: \"The service at Tom's Diner is too slow. Last night, for example, we had to wait for 2 hours to get our food!\" If you want to improve your writing skill , you should write a lot. [11] X Research source It is good to have a writing routine. Write in a journal every day. [12] X Research source The main exercise for writing well is to read a lot and understand the language through reading. [13] X Research source"
