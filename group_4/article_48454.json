      "content": "Wear just a towel (or nothing at all) if the sauna allows nudity. Not every sauna allows nudity, so check the regulations at your gym or spa beforehand. If they do, all you need to wear is a towel—you can keep it wrapped around your waist or chest, or just lay it down on the sauna bench and sit on top of it in the nude. [1] X Research source Either way is fine as long as you have a layer of towel separating your skin from the hot benches beneath. Even if you plan on being naked, you’ll still need a robe, coverup, or at least a towel for when you’re going to and from the sauna. You can use your own towel or use a clean one provided by your gym or spa."

      "content": "Wear clothes or a towel made of natural fabrics if you want to cover up. Even if a sauna allows nudity, that doesn’t mean you have to bare it all. Instead, wear breathable fabrics in the sauna so the heat can circulate freely around your body. Natural fabrics won’t trap heat and moisture against your body, making for a more hygienic, comfortable, and relaxing experience. Whatever you choose to wear—a swimsuit, a dress, or shorts and a t-shirt—opt for lightweight and natural fibers like cotton, linen, or bamboo. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose garments that are loose-fitting and don’t restrict your movement. Loose and flowy towels, robes, and garments, allow the air to circulate around you, helping sweat evaporate off your skin more easily and keeping you cool and comfortable. Tight, heavy, or restrictive layers can trap heat, sweat, and oils, making for an all-around less hygienic and enjoyable sauna experience. [3] X Research source Fitness trainer Laila Ajani says gym clothes are even OK if you’re in a pinch. “After a sauna, you should expect to be quite sweaty, so workout clothes often work well too.”"

      "content": "Cover up to the extent that you’re comfortable. Even if nudity is the norm for your spa or club, you don’t have to go naked if it makes you uneasy. Feel free to wear shorts, a swimsuit, or stay wrapped up in a towel if you’re feeling modest. Sauna-goers in some cultures where nudity is common may find it a little bit odd to cover up, but don’t let that stop you from doing what’s comfortable! On the flip side, there are many locations where nudity is not expected or common, so if you’re unsure, it’s best not to head into the sauna fully nude. Enter in a robe or towel and look around to see whether folks are covering up or not. Some prefer to cover up in order to sweat more for weight loss (like wearing an insulated sauna suit). This can help you temporarily lose some water weight (especially if you’re typically sedentary), but is not a long-term weight loss solution. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear slip-resistant flip-flops, shower shoes, or slippers. Certain spas and clubs may have specific guidelines about wearing flip-flops in the sauna or not, so check with your gym before wearing any footwear inside. In most cases, it’s recommended to bring a non-slip pair of shower shoes with you in case you need to walk around inside the sauna (and some clubs provide you with these). [5] X Research source Flip-flops or slippers protect your feet from potential germs on the ground—a sauna is a shared space, after all!"

      "content": "Consult your spa, gym, or club guidelines if you’re unsure what to wear. Call ahead or consult your gym or spa’s website to see what the dress code is for the sauna. It can vary between clubs—for example, some co-ed saunas may require men to wear t-shirts or tank tops. It also depends on which region you’re sauna-ing in—in Europe, most sauna-goers are in the nude, whereas public nudity in America is much less common. Some may allow nudity, but require you be wrapped in or seated on a towel. [6] X Research source Regardless of the guidelines, respect the location’s rules and cover up accordingly."

      "content": "Wear light, breathable shorts or trunks (or just a towel wrapped around the waist). If it’s a nude sauna, feel free to just lay a towel down on the bench and take a seat. Or, you can keep your towel wrapped around your waist and/or drape a second towel over your shoulders to cover up a bit more. Here are some recommendations for sauna garments if they’re required: [7] X Research source Loose and lightweight gym shorts, swim trunks, or even boxers, preferably made from a natural fiber like cotton, linen, or bamboo. A breathable t-shirt or tank top (if desired or required by the gym). A sauna kilt (like a towel or wrap that’s held up by elastic). A sauna suit (a full-body athletic suit designed to make you sweat more)."

If it’s a nude sauna, you can sit wrapped in a towel (up to the waist or chest, depending on how comfortable you are) or just lay a towel down and sit nude on top of it. If you’d like to cover up more (or are required to by the spa), here are some good options: [8] X Research source A swimsuit (1 piece or 2 piece) made from breathable, natural fabric. A towel or sarong. A loose-fitting dress or skirt made of natural fibers. A breathable t-shirt, tank top, and/or bra. A loose kaftan, kimono, or robe. A sauna suit (a full-body athletic suit that increases how much you sweat)."

      "content": "Avoid synthetic fibers, metal accessories, and cosmetics in the sauna. What you wear in the sauna is fairly flexible, but there are a few things to avoid to make your session more comfortable and enjoyable, like: [9] X Research source Synthetic fibers like nylon, spandex, and polyester that trap heat and sweat, causing you to overheat. Tight, restrictive, or heavy clothes that will absorb sweat and hold it against your skin. Swimsuits with metal clasps or appliques that can get uncomfortably hot in the sauna. Metal jewelry that may heat up and burn your skin (the heat may also cause you to swell temporarily, making items like rings hard to remove). Perfumes or lotions that release fragrances into the hot air, potentially irritating other sauna users. Cosmetics and makeup that can clog your pores in the heat."

      "content": "Items like water bottles, bench mats, and hair ties can keep you comfy in the sauna. Check your spa or club’s rules to see what is and isn’t allowed in the sauna. For example, some locations may ban phones and other electronics or have other guidelines about what you can bring in with you. Here are a few things you may want to have on hand for your next sauna session: [10] X Research source A water bottle. Ajani recommends “making sure you stay hydrated , because it's hot in there. If you just did a workout, you might be on your way to becoming dehydrated.” A headband or hair tie to keep long hair out of your face. Spare towels—one to wipe up sweat and another to sit on. A robe or coverup to wear as you enter and exit the sauna. A book or magazine to pass the time. Waterproof covers for phones and electronics (if allowed inside). A sauna hat to protect your head, ears, and hair from the heat. A wooden sauna pillow to support your head and neck. A sauna bench mat or seat cushion to make sitting or lying down more comfortable."

These rules may dictate what you can wear, what you can bring in, and how to behave while inside the sauna.

      "content": "Respect others’ privacy and personal space. It probably goes without saying, but try not to stare at another person’s body in the sauna, especially if nudity is the norm—this can make other guests pretty uncomfortable. Also, be considerate of how much space you’re taking up. It’s perfectly fine to lay down and stretch out if the sauna’s pretty empty, but if it’s crowded, sit up and keep your belongings together to make room for more people. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Shower before you enter the sauna and again after you leave. Especially if you’re fresh from a workout, take a quick shower to rinse off any sweat, oil, or dirt that may be on you. This removes any debris that might get in your pores as they open up in the heat. It also prevents any lingering BO from wafting throughout the sauna. [13] X Research source Shower afterward as well to clear your skin of sweat."

      "title": "Sit on a towel to put a barrier between you and the bench.",
      "content": "Sit on a towel to put a barrier between you and the bench. A towel can make the bench feel more comfortable, but more importantly, it separates your germs from the germs potentially left behind by other sauna guests. This makes the sauna more hygienic for you and for everyone else! [14] X Research source Keep a second spare towel on hand to wipe up your sweat, too (especially if it happens to drip on a surface someone else may touch). Speaking of surfaces, try not to touch any surfaces (like the bench, floor, or walls) more than you have to avoid sharing bacteria."

      "content": "Ask before you adjust the temperature or pour water on the rocks. You may love extreme heat or bursts of hot steam, but not everybody does (and for some people, it could be a potential health hazard). Politely ask others in the sauna if they’re comfortable with any adjustments. If everyone in the sauna consents, then adjust away! [16] X Research source On a related note, some people enjoy adding essential oils to the rocks for aromatherapy or healing benefits. Do not add essential oils if your club forbids it. If it’s allowed, always ask others in the sauna if they’re OK with you adding them first."

It can be unhygienic and distracting to others if you’re eating or leaving crumbs in the sauna, so never bring food inside (it’s almost certainly banned by most spas and clubs anyway). Whatever you do bring in—illegal snacks or otherwise—make sure not to leave any trace of it behind. Take all garbage with you and leave the sauna as clean and organized as you left it."

Wait until you’re 100% healthy again to use a public sauna, since you risk infecting others (or potentially picking up even more germs while your immune system is down). However, if you have your own private sauna that no one else uses, a sauna session can actually help alleviate your cold symptoms—just don’t go in if you’re experiencing serious symptoms like a high fever or severe congestion.
