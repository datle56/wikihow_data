How do you like city life?” If she doesn’t have any major life updates, bring up a smaller update you’ve seen social media like, “Hey, I saw the pic from your niece’s recital. She’s gotten so big!

Specific questions tend to be better because they show you’re genuinely interested in how your she’s doing. Try this approach if you’re wondering what your ex is up to or checking to see if she’s willing to be friends. “I just realized it’s college admissions season.

Hope you’re having fun in Portland.” “I went to a sports bar with some buddies the other night and they were impressed at my Raiders trivia knowledge. I told them it was all thanks to you. I hope you’re doing well.” “You were right about South San Francisco. They have surprisingly good sushi. Hope you’re not missing it too much living in Colorado.”"
