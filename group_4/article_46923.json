      "content": "Search for your book in the library's card catalog. This system is likely computerized. If you are having trouble, ask a librarian for help or have her simply look it up for you. The Dewey Decimal System applies only to nonfiction books. This system organizes the books by topic, ranging from genetics to Victorian England to astrology."

      "title": "Go to the shelves.",
      "content": "Go to the shelves. Skim the spines of the books you pass to find the ones with the same first digit as your desired book. Then search those books for ones with the same second digit, and so on. Here's an example: Let's say you are looking for a book with Dewey Decimal number 319.21. Find the aisle that 319 would fall under, ignoring the decimals for now. For example, \"300.2â€“340.99\" would be the correct aisle, since 319 falls between 300 and 340. Walk down the shelf looking at the spines until you find the books beginning with 319. Search within the books beginning 319 to find the one you're looking for. These are arranged by the value of the decimal, so 319.21 falls between 319.20 and 319.22."

      "content": "Look for a label matching both the call number and the author's last name. There may be multiple books with the same call number, so check the author's name to confirm that you've found the one you selected in the card catalog."

      "content": "Know the ten general areas of content. Melvil Dewey originally created ten general categories that most books could be sorted into. The ten areas are listed below with their corresponding numbers. [3] X Research source 000 - Generalities, Computer Science, and Information 100 - Philosophy and Psychology 200 - Religion 300 - Social Sciences (anthropology, archeology, sociology) 400 - Language 500 - Natural Sciences (biology, astronomy, etc.) and Mathematics 600 - Technology (applied sciences) 700 - The Arts 800 - Literature and Rhetoric 900 - Geography and History"

      "content": "Understand divisions and sections. Each of the ten areas contain 99 divisions - more specific categories that fall under the larger areas. Additional decimals indicate the even even smaller sections, which are even more specific. Decimals are added if the topic is even more specific. An example of this specification process is below: 500 Natural Sciences and Mathematics 590 Zoology 595 Arthropods 595.7 Insects 595.78 Lepidoptera 595.789 Butterflies"

      "title": "Browse using the system.",
      "content": "Browse using the system. The Dewey Decimal System is great when you're browsing. If you wanted a book on Ethics, for example, you would go to 170. Once you were there you could scan the shelves for a book on an area of Ethics that interested you. This is infinitely more convenient than alphabetical arrangement, in which you might find a book on turtles next to one about turbulence in politics."

If your library is large and you would rather not spend a whole day browsing books on the Arts, you could go online for a guide to the various general categories, divisions, and sections.
