      "content": "Place the egg in question in a bowl or wide glass of cold water and see if it floats. There is a tiny air pocket inside eggs, and over time more and more air passes through their porous shells and into the egg. As more air enters the egg, the air pocket grows larger, making the egg more buoyant. If the egg lays on its side on the bottom of the bowl, it is at peak freshness . [1] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021. If the egg stands upright on one end but is still touching the bottom, it is aging past its prime but is still safe to eat. If the egg is floating, it is not a fresh egg. This does not necessarily mean itâ€™s bad or unsafe to eat. [2] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 30 August 2021. You should test the egg by cracking it open and looking for (or smelling) signs that it has gone bad.

      "content": "Hold the egg up to your ear and shake it, listening for a sloshing sound. As the egg ages and moisture and carbon dioxide escapes through the shell, the yolk and white begin to dry out and shrink, and the air pocket in the egg becomes bigger. A larger air pocket gives the egg more room to move around inside the shell and create a sloshing sound. A fresh egg should not make much, if any, sound when you shake it. [4] X Research source A sloshing egg only indicates that the egg is old and does not mean the egg is unsafe for consumption."

The integrity of the egg will lessen as it ages, so it won't hold together as well as a fresh egg. Notice if the egg seems to spread over a wide distance on the plate, or if it stays relatively compact. An egg that spreads or seems a little watery has a thinner white and is past its peak freshness.

      "content": "Throw out any eggs that have been refrigerated and then sat out at room temperature for two hours or more. Once an egg has cooled in your refrigerator, it is important to keep it at the same temperature. A cool egg in a warmer environment begins to sweat, which can encourage bacteria to grow on the outside of the egg. Because the egg shell is porous, it is sometimes possible for the bacteria on the shell to pass into through and contaminate the egg. To prevent temperature fluctuations, store your eggs in the coldest part of your refrigerator, not on the door. The temperature is more likely to fluctuate on the door when it is opening and closing, which may cause your eggs to sweat. If you receive your eggs unwashed and at room temperature, they do not need to be refrigerated. Many countries, including most European countries, keep their eggs at room temperature. [23] X Research source This is safe because eggs are laid with a protective \"bloom\" which naturally keeps bacteria out. Once the eggs are washed, however, they must be refrigerated.
