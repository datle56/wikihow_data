      "content": "Wrap the butter tightly in its original packaging or in aluminum foil. Butter can be stored in the fridge in its original greaseproof paper as long as it is tightly sealed. If the paper came is ripped and you cannot reseal it tightly, just wrap it up in aluminum foil to keep it fresh. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the butter in the fridge away from other foods.",
      "content": "Place the butter in the fridge away from other foods. Butter compartments keep your butter separate from other items in your fridge, preventing it from absorbing flavors and smells from other foods. Keep the butter in that compartment or, if you do not have one, store it as far as you can from foods with strong smells or tastes. Both salted and unsalted butter will stay fresh wrapped up in the fridge for about 3 weeks. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Double-wrap the butter for lasting freshness if you won't use it soon.",
      "content": "Double-wrap the butter for lasting freshness if you won't use it soon. You can get a little extra life out of your butter if you double-wrap it in foil before putting it in the fridge. If you think you will not use the butter within 3 weeks of buying it, wrap it twice and store it away from your other foods. Salted butter can stay fresh another couple of weeks if it is double-wrapped. Unsalted butter may only last another week, so try to use it up as soon as you can."

      "title": "Cut the butter into 1⁄4 c (4.0 US tbsp) chunks for easy thawing.",
      "content": "Cut the butter into 1 ⁄ 4 c (4.0 US tbsp) chunks for easy thawing. Not all recipes call for a full stick of butter, so chop up your butter into smaller bits to make it more convenient and easy to thaw when you need it. You can cut it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections or measure it out into 1 ⁄ 4 c (4.0 US tbsp) portions. How big you cut it doesn't really matter. You can make it bigger or smaller based on how you usually use your butter. It's not necessary to cut up the butter before freezing. You can freeze whole sticks or blocks as well. Just keep in mind that you will have to thaw the entire block when you want to use it. Thaw frozen butter the same way you'd soften refrigerated butter. You can leave it at room temperature, grate it, heat it up, or just leave it in the fridge until you are ready for it."

    {
      "title": "Protect the butter by wrapping it tightly in aluminum foil.",
      "content": "Protect the butter by wrapping it tightly in aluminum foil. You want to keep the butter protected from freezer burn and from absorbing smells in the freezer. Wrap it completely in the foil, making sure none of the butter is exposed to the air."

    {
      "title": "Place the wrapped butter in a freezer storage bag.",
      "content": "Place the wrapped butter in a freezer storage bag. For added protection, place the foil-wrapped butter in a plastic freezer storage bag. You can put several of pieces of wrapped butter in one bag, depending on how much space you have in your freezer. Consider using reusable storage bags because they are better for the environment."

    {
      "title": "Label the bag with the date and the type of butter.",
      "content": "Label the bag with the date and the type of butter. Salted butter will keep fresh for about 1 year in the freezer and unsalted butter is good for about 3 months. [4] X Research source Write the date that you put the butter in the freezer on the bag so you can always tell how long it has been in there. If you want to store the salted and unsalted butter in one bag, you'll have to mark the portions of butter individually."

    {
      "title": "Choose salted butter for storing at room temperature.",
      "content": "Choose salted butter for storing at room temperature. Bacteria are less likely to grow on salted butter because of its high fat content and added salt. [5] X Research source Because of this, salted butter can be kept on the counter for two to three weeks. [6] X Research source Unsalted or whipped butter should not be kept on the countertop as it will go bad quickly. [7] X Research source You can also store ghee at room temperature because it has a very low milk content. This means it won't spoil as quickly as other dairy products. If it's summertime and you do not have A/C, it's probably too warm in your kitchen to keep the butter on the counter. To avoid a melty mess or rancid butter in the hot summer months, keep it in the fridge instead. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Seal the butter tightly in a closed container or a butter crock.",
      "content": "Seal the butter tightly in a closed container or a butter crock. You can get a specially-made airtight butter crock or use any sealed container to store your butter on the counter. You just need to make sure your container doesn't expose the butter to the air when you are not using it. [9] X Research source French bell crocks use water to create a vacuum seal. If you are concerned about air exposure, consider getting one of those."

      "content": "Keep the sealed butter away from heat. Don't keep the butter anywhere near your stove or your kitchen appliances. Excess heat can cause the butter to go rancid or melt into a greasy mess. The best place to store it is on a counter or in a cupboard away from the cooking equipment. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid cross-contamination with utensils when you use the butter. Bacteria from your eating or cooking utensils will contaminate the butter and make it spoil faster. [11] X Research source Keep a dedicated butter spoon or knife with the butter and don't use it for anything else. Wash the butter spoon or knife after every use to ensure it does not get contaminated with bacteria."
