      "content": "Think about what you want to transform in a broad sense. Starting with a broad goal will help you define what you want and why you want it. Ask yourself what you’d really like to change in your life and why that’s something you care about. Are you looking to be healthier, or do you want to learn something new? Would you like a new career? Is there something else you want to change? [1] X Expert Source Tracey Rogers, MA Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 January 2020. For example, you could set a goal like, “I want a new career because I want to feel more fulfilled with my job.” It could be tempting to try to change every aspect of your life at once, but that can quickly get overwhelming, making it more likely that you’ll fall off the wagon. Instead, focus on just one area of your life, such as getting healthier or going back to school."
