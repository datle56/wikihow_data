      "content": "Run away from someone who tries to take you if you can. If you're ever in a situation where someone tries to abduct you, do anything you can to avoid going with them. Try to pull away from them, then run as fast as you can in the direction of the nearest people or building that you can see. [1] X Research source Especially avoid getting into a vehicle, since it will be much harder for authorities to find you if your attacker drives you a long distance. If you're taken hostage, the situation may unfold very quickly, and you might not have the opportunity to run."

      "title": "Yell to draw attention to the situation.",
      "content": "Yell to draw attention to the situation. If someone makes an attempt to kidnap you, start shouting right away, especially if you know there are people nearby. Even if the attackers manage to subdue you, keep yelling to try to get someone's attention. If someone hears a shout and they see what's happening, they may be able to help you before you're taken. Try yelling something like, \"Help!\" or \"Call the police!\" As a suggestion, yelling, \"FIRE!!\" is your best bet. People are more likely to respond to fire, and this can summon help faster. At the very least, an onlooker can contact the authorities and let them know that an abduction has taken place. They may also to provide critical details like the kidnapper's physical appearance or the type of vehicle they're driving. Really try to get the license plate to see if the car was stolen or to see if it is really their car."

      "title": "Fight your attacker as hard as you can.",
      "content": "Fight your attacker as hard as you can. It can be really hard not to panic, but if you can stay calm and focused on survival, you may be able to fight off an attack if someone grabs you. Fight in any way you're able, whether that's hitting, kicking , biting, or scratching. As you do that, try to target your kidnapper's eyes, nose, throat, or groin, as these are especially sensitive targets. As long as there's still a chance you could break free and run, it's worth fighting for. This is your best chance to escape, because the moment will be hectic, and there's a chance someone will see what's happening and intervene."

      "title": "Look for objects in your environment to use as weapons.",
      "content": "Look for objects in your environment to use as weapons. As you're fighting off your attacker, try to gather yourself enough to scan around you. Look for anything that's close enough to grab that might give you an edge in the fight. If there's nothing that you can use as an offensive weapon, check for anything you can use as a barrier between you and your attacker, like a chair or a table. [2] X Research source For instance, even if your attacker knocks you down, you might spot a loose chunk of sidewalk that you can grab to hit them with. In your home, you might be able to grab a heavy vase or lamp, a fireplace poker, or even a large book."

      "title": "Follow your captors' instructions once you are in captivity.",
      "content": "Follow your captors' instructions once you are in captivity. If at any point it becomes clear that your captors have gained the upper hand, stop resisting right away and comply with any orders they give you. You're more likely to be hurt or killed if you continue fighting after you're overpowered, such as if you're being held by multiple people, put in restraints, or placed in a vehicle or other confined space. Once you're abducted or taken hostage, it's best to take a measured approach to escaping, rather than an impulsive one, so start evaluating your surroundings rather than fighting to get away. If you're put into a vehicle while you're conscious, try to pay attention to as much about the trip as you can, like how long the car travels without stopping, the direction of any turns, or any sounds you notice on the road. If you're in the trunk of a car, look for a glow-in-the-dark handle that you can pull to release yourself from the trunk. If this release cord isn't present, try to kick out the tail lights and wave your hands to alert other motorists that you're trapped inside. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stay calm and focused on survival.",
      "content": "Stay calm and focused on survival. It might be really hard, but once you're taken captive, try to dig deep within yourself to find your composure. Try to hold onto your dignity, rather than crying hysterically or begging for them to let you go. That will make you seem more human in your kidnappers' eyes, which may make them less likely to kill you. If you can help it, try not to even cry. When you're talking to the person who's abducted you or taken you hostage, speak softly and clearly. Don't be belligerent or uncooperative. If you antagonize your captors, they may be more likely to attack or even kill you. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Try to connect with your kidnappers, but don't pretend to support them.",
      "content": "Try to connect with your kidnappers, but don't pretend to support them. It can help to talk to your kidnappers about universal subjects, like families, your hobbies, or sports. However, don't go so far as to try to befriend your captors or defend their cause. They're likely to see this as a ruse, which could anger them. If there's anything you want or need, like medication or a book, calmly ask for it—it might help establish some rapport. During conversations with your captors, avoid the subject of politics or religion, especially if you are being held by terrorists. If you have pictures of your family with them, you can even show them to your captors to help them see you as more of a person, rather than just a victim."

      "title": "Observe as much of your environment as you can.",
      "content": "Observe as much of your environment as you can. While you're in captivity, pay attention to every detail. This might include how many people are holding you, their physical descriptions, and any exits in the place you're being held. You might spot something that helps you escape, or you might be able to provide authorities with key information that will lead them to your captors after you're rescued. Even if you're blindfolded or it's dark, you might be able to pick up on sounds or smells that can give you clues to your location. For instance, if you hear a lot of traffic, you'll know that you might be able to find help if you can just escape the building. Other details to notice about your captors might include their accents, their names or aliases, and who seems to be in charge. If they seem to follow the same routine each day, make note of that as well."

      "title": "Do not admit to accusations if you're interrogated.",
      "content": "Do not admit to accusations if you're interrogated. In some cases, you might be taken hostage or abducted because your captors believe that you have information they could use for political or personal gain. No matter what they do, do not divulge any information that can be used against you. However, do try to act like you're being cooperative. For instance, you might answer questions about your line of work without divulging your company's bank account numbers."

      "content": "Find a way to communicate if there are other captives. If you're taken hostage as part of a group, or if you discover that your captives have also abducted others, try to set up some way to communicate. However, avoid speaking openly amongst yourselves in front of your captors, as they may separate, restrain, or even kill some members of the group in an attempt to subdue everyone. You might speak quietly amongst yourselves when the kidnappers are out of the room, for instance, or you might tap out a message if you know Morse Code . It may be helpful to set up a code word in case the opportunity to escape arises."

      "title": "Prepare yourself to be held for a long time.",
      "content": "Prepare yourself to be held for a long time. Depending on the situation, you may be held for only a few hours, but you might be there for days, months, or even years. As you begin to adjust to your situation, try to develop a daily schedule, tracking time by outside cues like birds chirping, temperature changes in the room, or even your guards' activities. Even if it doesn't seem very appetizing, eat whatever food they give you so you'll stay healthy and strong. Try to use flexing exercises like planks and squats to keep your muscles strong. Many of these can be adapted to work even if you have a very small range of movement. Meditation or prayer can be a good way to keep yourself mentally strong while you're being held. Fortunately, the longer your captors hold you, the more your chances of survival increase."

      "title": "Wait to be rescued unless you are sure you can escape safely.",
      "content": "Wait to be rescued unless you are sure you can escape safely. If you're in captivity, you're most likely to be killed if your captors discover you trying to escape. If you see an opportunity to escape and you're absolutely sure it can work, take it. However, if that's not the case, bide your time. Tracking an abduction victim or negotiating with hostage-takers can take a lot of work, so it's important to be patient and allow the authorities to find you. Similarly, if you gain access to a phone, only try to dial emergency services if you're sure you can do it unnoticed. An exception to waiting for rescue is if you believe your captors are planning to kill you. For instance, if they suddenly stop feeding you or if they seem very nervous or scared, your life may be in danger, and you should find any way out you can. If you do escape, get somewhere safe right away, like a police station or a crowded building."

If you're found by the authorities, there will likely be several chaotic moments where they have to determine who's a kidnapper and who's a victim. For your safety, get low to the ground with your hands behind your head or crossed in front of your chest. Don't run, and don't make any sudden movements. As the authorities secure the scene, they may handcuff and search you. Allow them to do this, then let them know that you've been abducted."

      "content": "Remind yourself that kidnapping is uncommon when you start to feel anxious. It's extremely unlikely that you'll face a kidnapping attempt in your lifetime. Keeping this in mind may help you regain a feeling of control if your anxiety starts to spiral out of control. However, don't beat yourself up over your anxiety—it's normal to worry that bad things may happen to you or your family, especially if you've recently read or heard about a kidnapping case. [6] X Research source This may be particularly true if the kidnapping was in your area or happened to someone who resembles you."

Everyone can benefit from some basic safety awareness, like paying attention to your surroundings or being cautious around strangers. However, if you perceive yourself to be at a greater threat for being a kidnapping target, take extra precautions to protect yourself. This can give you the piece of mind you need so you're not preoccupied with anxiety. [7] X Research source For instance, if you are visiting a different country, you work for a political or social organization, or your family is very wealthy, you may feel that you're more likely to be targeted. If you're in an area that's politically unstable, pay attention to daily news reports, as well as any terrorist threat levels, and assess your own kidnapping risk based on that."

      "content": "Stay aware of your surroundings. While you don't need to constantly obsess about kidnapping, it can help you have better peace of mind if you keep your guard up, especially when you're out in public or if you're around people you don't know well. Pay attention to what people around you are doing and trust your instincts. If something or someone seems suspicious, try to leave the situation as soon as possible. [8] X Research source Whether you're traveling or you're in your home town, try to avoid locations that have a reputation for being unsafe. Also, avoid walking alone at night. Park in well-lit areas and ask someone to walk you to your car if you're by yourself. When you arrive at your home, have your keys in your hand before you exit your vehicle. If you have a garage, open the garage door, drive in, and make sure the garage door is fully closed before you get out of the vehicle. Don't reveal personal information about yourself when you're talking on the phone in a public location, as this could give a kidnapper information they could use against you."

      "content": "Try to make yourself as inconspicuous as possible. When you're out in public, avoid drawing attention to yourself, as this can make you a more attractive target to potential kidnappers. Wear nondescript clothing and avoid wearing jewelry or flashy shoes. Also, depending on where you're going, you may not want to carry high-value electronics like a smartphone, tablet, or nice camera. [9] X Research source If you're traveling by foot, walk confidently and with purpose. Avoid stopping on the street to check a map, and take care whom you ask for directions since you want to avoid giving the appearance of being a lost tourist."

      "content": "Change up your routine every few days. Kidnappers often study a person's daily habits before attempting to take them. You can make yourself a more difficult target by making your movements unpredictable. For instance, you might plan out several paths to work or school, and change which one you take every 2-3 days. [10] X Research source You can also eat lunch at a different restaurant each day, visit different bars or meet your friends at different times, or leave for work at a different time. If you do believe you're being followed in your vehicle, immediately drive to a police station or somewhere you feel safe. If you're walking, go into the nearest crowded, public space. [11] X Research source If you're working for a government agency overseas, consider driving a nondescript vehicle without any obvious markings so you're less likely to be identified on the road."
