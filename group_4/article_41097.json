      "title": "Give your child plenty of fluids.",
      "content": "Give your child plenty of fluids. Because it is easy for kids to become dehydrated, making sure that your child gets enough fluid is the best thing you can do when she is suffering from a bout of diarrhea. Do not hydrate her with water alone — your child will need to replenish sodium, potassium, and other nutrients lost through diarrhea.Instead, look for oral rehydration solutions (ORS), such as Pedialyte. Make sure you speak to your doctor about how much and for how long you should give your child an ORS. [1] X Research source ORSs are available in most drug stores. Do not try to make your own solution unless your pediatrician gives you a precise recipe. Do NOT use sports drinks, sodas, or even juice. The high sugar content in these beverages can make diarrhea worse. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Feed your child foods that you know he can tolerate. Stick to foods that you know won’t cause a problem for your child and do not try to introduce your child to any new foods while he has diarrhea, either. [3] X Research source The main things to avoid are high sugar foods and beverages because these can make diarrhea worse. Avoid giving your child anything that has caused problems for him in the past. If you feed your child something and it seems to make his diarrhea worse, then do not offer your child that food again."

      "title": "Put your child on the BRAT diet.",
      "content": "Put your child on the BRAT diet. To stop diarrhea, it is also important to increase your child’s fiber intake. Fiber helps to solidify the stool. One good way to ensure that your toddler is getting enough fiber is to use the BRAT diet. BRAT stands for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast (use whole grain bread to make the toast). BRAT diet foods are unlikely to cause a problem unless your child has a food allergy or sensitivity to one of them. In that case, omit one of the foods or modify the food so that your child can have it. For example, if your child has a sensitivity to gluten, then give your child gluten-free bread instead of wheat bread."

      "content": "Offer your child some yogurt. Yogurt may also help stop diarrhea in your toddler by rebalancing the bacteria in your child’s gut. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Give your child whatever flavor of yogurt she will eat, just make sure that the yogurt contains “live cultures.” Live cultures provide the healthy gut bacteria that your child needs to maintain normal bowel function. You can also use popsicle forms to make frozen yogurt popsicles if you think your child will like these better."

      "content": "Try increasing the fat in your child’s diet. In some cases, increasing your child's fat intake may help stop diarrhea. Try offering your child some more healthy high fat foods.

      "title": "Take your child to see your pediatrician.",
      "content": "Take your child to see your pediatrician. If your toddler’s bowel movements suddenly increase or change consistency, then he probably has diarrhea. Diarrhea can often be treated at home, but it is a good idea to make an appointment for your child to see a pediatrician. Some forms of diarrhea may be caused by food sensitivities, infections, or other conditions that require medical treatment."

      "content": "Ask about probiotics. If your child's diarrhea is prolonged or the result of antibiotics, ask your doctor about probiotics. It may be necessary to rebuild the good bacteria in your child's intestines to prevent further illness. The type of probiotic depends on why your child has diarrhea, as not all probiotics can help diarrhea, and not all types of diarrhea are helped by probiotics. [6] X Research source Your doctor may recommend strains such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus , Lactobacillus reuteri , or Saccharomyces boulardii, or possibly even a combination."
