      "title": "Greet people by saying “salut,” “bonjour,” and “bonsoir.”",
      "content": "Greet people by saying “salut,” “bonjour,” and “bonsoir.” From starting conversations to greeting passersby, saying hello is the first step in learning basic French. Say “bonjour” (bon-zhur) for the most basic greeting. [1] X Research source The “j” in “bonjour” is soft; it’s a “zh” sound, or a combination between “sh” and “j.” Pronounce the “n” just slightly, but try not to let the tip of your tongue hit the roof of your mouth as you would in English. French is pronounced with the back of the mouth and nose more than front of the mouth. Bonjour literally means “good day,” and is a more formal way to say hello. Say “salut” (sa-loo) for an informal expression, like “hi” in English. It’s also best to use bonjour during the day. At night, say, “bonsoir” (bon-swarh), which means “good evening.”"

      "title": "Say “au revoir,” “bonne nuit,” or “salut” to bid farewell.",
      "content": "Say “au revoir,” “bonne nuit,” or “salut” to bid farewell. “Au revoir” (ohr-vwah) is the best-known way to say goodbye in French. Literally, it means “until we see each other again.” For a more informal expression, you could use “salut,” which can mean either “hi” or “bye.” While it’s Italian, the French also sometimes use “ciao,” too, such as “Ciao, salut.” [2] X Research source You can also say, “bonne nuit” (bon-nwee), which means “goodnight.”"

      "title": "Practice saying the alphabet to get a feel for French phonics.",
      "content": "Practice saying the alphabet to get a feel for French phonics. Pronounce the vowels a, e, i o, and u as “ah,” “eh,” “ee,” “oh,” and “oo.” Consonants like b and c, which sound like “bee” and “see” in English, are pronounced “bay” and “say” in French. [3] X Research source Pronounce the alphabet in French like this: “ah (a), bay (b), say (c), day (d), eh (e), eff (f), zhee (g), osh (h), ee (i), zhay (j), kay (k), elle (l), em (m), en (n), oh (o), pay (p), koo (q), air (r), ess (s), tay (t), oo (u), vay (v), doo-bluh-vay (w), eex (x), ee-grek, (y), zed (z).” Practicing the alphabet can help you get to know how vowel and consonant sounds work in French. This can improve your pronunciation, even if you just want to learn how to say a few practical phrases."

      "content": "Work on learning how to count in French. Whether you’re ordering in a restaurant or telling someone how old you are, knowing your numbers will come in handy. Break it up into steps, and you’ll be able to count to 1,000 in no time. On the first day, practice 1 through 10, then work on 11 through 20, and memorize the rest of the tens digits (30, 40, 50, and so on) the next day. [4] X Research source The numbers 1 through 10 in French are “un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix.” Say them like this: “uhn (1), duh (2), trwah (3), katreh (4, the “reh” is subtle, and isn’t a distinct syllable), sank (5), sees (6, the “s” sounds are soft, like “cease”), sept (7), weet (8), nuhf (9, it sounds like “surf” without the “r”), dees (10, it rhymes with “cease”).

      "content": "Master practical phrases if you’re a traveler. If you’re visiting a French-speaking location, learn how to ask useful questions, such as “Do you speak English?” or “Where is the bathroom?” Keep in mind there are 2 words for “you” in French; “vous” is polite, and “tu” is informal. Use “tu” if you’re talking to a friend, and “vous” if you’re asking a passerby for directions. [5] X Research source To ask “Do you speak English,” say, “Parlez-vous anglais?” (par-lay voo ahn-glay). For the informal version, ask “Parle-tu anglais?” (parl-too ahn-glay). If you’re at a restaurant, say, “Je voudrais” (zhuh voo-dray), which means “I would like.” For instance, tell the waiter, “Je voudrais une salade” (zhuh voo-dray oon sah-lod), which means “I would like a salad. In an informal setting ask, “Où sont les toilettes?” (oo, sohn lay twah-lette) if you need to find the restroom. If you’re at a formal dinner party at someone’s home, ask the host, “Excusez-moi, où est-ce que je peux me rafraîchir?” (eh-skew-zay-mwah, oo ess-kuh zhuh puh muh rah-fray-sheer), which means “Excuse me, where can I freshen up?” Many French speakers know English but, if you’re in France, it’s polite to excuse yourself for not knowing French: “Je suis désolé, mais je ne parle pas français” (Zhuh swee day-zo-lay, may zhuh-nuh parl pah frahn-say). This means “I’m sorry, but I don’t speak French. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Memorize the French words for please and thank you. It’s always wise to be polite if, say, you’re asking for directions or ordering at a restaurant. Recall that there are 2 ways of saying “you.” Likewise, there are formal and informal ways of saying “please.” [7] X Research source The formal way of saying “please” is “s'il vous plaît” (see voo play). Say, for instance, “Excusez-moi, s'il vous plaît, parle-tu anglais?” (eh-skew-zay-mwah, see voo play, parl-too ahn-glay), which means “Excuse me, please, do you speak English?” The less formal version of “please” is “s'il te plaît” (see teh play). Ask your friend, “Je voudrais de l’eau, s'il te plaît” (zhuh voo-dray deh low, see teh play), which means “I’d like some water, please.” “Merci” (mair-see) means “thank you.” To say “Thank you very much” or “Thanks a lot,” say “Merci beaucoup” (mair-see bow-koo) or “Merci bien” (mair-see bee-ehn). To say “You’re welcome,” use “Je vous en prie” (zhuh voo-zawn pree), which is more polite, or “De rien” (deh ree-ehn), which is less formal."

This is the polite version; less formal alternatives include “Comment vas-tu?” (koh-mah vah-too) and “Ça va?” (sah vah). [8] X Research source If someone asks how you’re doing, you could respond, “Très bien (treh bee-ehn), which means “very good.” Other responses include “Pas mal” (pah mahl), which means “not bad,” and “Ça va” (sah vah), or “It’s going.”"

      "content": "Practice your pronunciation, especially the French “R.” Listen to spoken French, and practice mimicking the way sounds are formed in the throat instead of the front of the mouth. For example in English, the “r” sound is made in the front of the mouth with the lips and teeth. French speakers, on the other hand, make the “r” sound by drawing the back of the tongue close to the soft palate. [10] X Research source One of the best ways to improve your pronunciation is to get a French speaker to correct your mistakes. If you know a native speaker or someone who’s fluent, ask them to help you develop a better accent. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with gendered words.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with gendered words. In French, all nouns and adjectives are either masculine or feminine. Many words that end in “e” are feminine, but keep in mind there are lots of exceptions! The key thing to know is that the adjective’s gender must match the noun’s gender. [12] X Research source Additionally, if a noun is plural, an adjective that describes it must also be plural. You’d use “Sam est petit,” (Sam eh puh-tee) to say Sam, who’s a boy, is short. If Sam and Beth, who are girls, are both short, you’d say “Sam et Beth sont petites” (Sam aye Beth sohn puh-teet). Articles, such as “the” and “a,” also need to match the gender and number. “Un” and “une” (uh and oohn) are the masculine and feminine versions of “a.” “Le,” “la,” and “les” (luh, lah, and lay) are the masculine, feminine, and plural ways of saying “the.” You’d use “l’” for words that begin with vowels: “l’école.” If you’re describing yourself, make sure the adjective matches your gender. For instance, “Je suis américain” (zhuh sweez-ah-may-ree-keh) is masculine, and “Je suis américaine” (zhuh sweez-ah-may-ree-kenn) is feminine."

      "content": "Learn about how the verb “to have” is used in French. Knowing when to use “être” (to be) and “avoir” (to have) can get a little tricky, but it’s a key aspect of basic French. In French, you’d use the verb “to have” to say “I’m hungry” and “I’m thirsty.” For instance, the literal translations of “J’ai faim” (zhay feh) and “J’ai soif” (zhay swof) are “I have hunger” and “I have thirst.” [13] X Research source To ask someone if they’re hungry, use “Avez-vous faim?” (ah-vay voo feh) or “As-tu faim? (ah-too feh). Swap out “faim” with “soif” (swof) to ask if they’re thirsty, and “sommeil” (soh-may) to ask if they’re sleepy. The verb “to have” is always used to express conditions such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Use “être” (to be) for adjectives such as gender and nationality."

They don’t have to be complex, especially when you first begin. To reinforce your vocabulary, try incorporating words from your daily or weekly lists. For instance, you might write, “Aujourd’hui c’est dimanche, le 7 Octobre. J’ai déjeuné avec ma cousine. J’ai mangé une salade de poulet, de la laitue, des épinards, des oignons, et des tomates.” That translates to “Today is Sunday, October 7. I had lunch with my cousin. I had a salad with chicken, lettuce, spinach, onions, and tomatoes.” If you have a friend or relative who speaks French, ask them to read your entries and correct any errors."
