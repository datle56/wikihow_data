      "title": "They think you’re incredibly good looking.",
      "content": "They think you’re incredibly good looking. When someone calls you “fine,” it usually means that they find you physically attractive. It’s more casual than saying you look “gorgeous” or “beautiful,” and it's less offensive than calling you “hot.” However, pay attention to the context of the conversation, the other person’s body language, and your relationship to them before assuming it’s a flirty compliment. [1] X Research source If someone is giving you a genuine compliment, it will probably be in response to something specific that you’ve done, whereas if they’re trying to flirt with you, they might say it randomly in a playful, teasing, or casual way."

    {
      "title": "They’re trying to flirt with you.",
      "content": "They’re trying to flirt with you. Calling someone “fine” is an easy way to make the first move, especially if the other person doesn’t want to come on too strong. If they tease you playfully, make lots of eye contact, or look for any excuse to touch you, it might be a sign that they want to be more than friends or take your relationship to the next level . [2] X Research source Other signs of flirting include laughing at your jokes, asking you for help frequently, giving you small gifts, smiling or blushing around you, and mirroring your body language."

    {
      "title": "They want to see how you’ll react.",
      "content": "They want to see how you’ll react. If someone has a crush on you, they might call you “fine” to see if you’re interested in them . They might be too shy to reveal their romantic feelings toward you, so throwing out this compliment is a good way to gauge your reaction. If you respond positively, they’ll probably think that you’re into them, but if you seem uncomfortable, they’ll probably take it as a sign to back off."
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re interested in your personality.",
      "content": "They’re interested in your personality. Sometimes, being called “fine” doesn’t relate to your physical appearance—the other person might be enchanted by your charisma, humor, intelligence, or energy. It’s another way of saying that they get good vibes from you and that they like you for more than just your looks. This is likely if you’ve recently had a deep conversation, played a fun game, worked on a project together, or experienced some other kind of activity as a team."
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re complimenting your style.",
      "content": "They’re complimenting your style. If you’re wearing an outfit you’ve never worn before (or something slightly more scandalous), they might say you’re “looking fine” to compliment your new look. It communicates that they’ve noticed a change in your appearance and they think you look even more amazing! This could also apply to a new hairstyle or makeup look, or your self-confidence and the way you’re carrying yourself in the outfit."
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re trying to reassure you.",
      "content": "They’re trying to reassure you. If the other person notices that you’re stressed, scared, or self-conscious, they might say “you’re fine” to make you feel better . It’s a sweet way to comfort you without making things too serious, especially if it’s coming from your boss, colleague, or someone you’re not super close with. In this context, think of it as another way of saying “you’ve got this” or “everything’s okay.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say thank you to be polite.",
      "content": "Say thank you to be polite . If you’re comfortable with the compliment, reply with a simple “thank you” to be courteous. It shows the other person that you appreciate their kind words, plus keeps the door open for a relationship that’s platonic or romantic. “TYSM😁💘” “Thanks—I appreciate it.” “Thanks for saying that!” “Aw, thanks! That means a lot.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Return the compliment if you’re interested.",
      "content": "Return the compliment if you’re interested. Trying to take things to the next level? Give a compliment to make the other person feel desired! Think about their best qualities, and mention something specific that you admire about them if you want to sound more genuine. “And you’re sexy.” “You’re pretty handsome yourself.” “I could say the same thing about you.” “Well, you have the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flirt back to spice up the conversation.",
      "content": "Flirt back to spice up the conversation. If you want to get sparks flying, drop a flirty one-liner that’s sweet or suggestive. Being direct shows that you’re really into someone, and it might spark something more serious! “Right back at you😉” “I’d be finer in your bed.” “Don’t be shy—how am I fine?” “Stoppp! You’re making me blush😊”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ignore them or express your discomfort.",
      "content": "Ignore them or express your discomfort. If someone’s comment makes you feel uncomfortable, don’t feel pressured to respond positively. Confront the other person and let them know that they’re being inappropriate, or simply ignore them altogether. “Um, okay. Moving on….” “Please don’t speak to me like that ever again.” “Not going to lie, your comment was really uncalled for.” “I don’t know you well enough for you to say that to me.”"

      "title": "The expression “Fine AF” stands for “Fine As F***.”",
      "content": "The expression “Fine AF” stands for “Fine As F***.” In other words, someone thinks you’re super attractive and good looking. [3] X Research source The abbreviation “AF” gives off a slightly derogatory vibe, so some people might take offense to this phrase—it’s similar to calling someone “hot” or “sexy.” If someone says “you’re fine AF,” it’s usually a sign that they’re trying to flirt with you."
