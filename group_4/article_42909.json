      "title": "Let your kid color.",
      "content": "Let your kid color. Give your child crayons specifically made for younger kids, and let them color. Younger kid's crayons are usually smaller and wider (more like a pebble than a stick), so they are easier to grasp. [1] X Research source Just like any part of the body, kids need to build up muscle and dexterity in their hands before they learn to write. [2] X Research source If it's a nice day, take it outside. Use chalk to color on the sidewalk."

      "title": "Make necklaces together.",
      "content": "Make necklaces together. Using macaroni or large beads, string them on yarn to create wearable art. The act of picking up pieces and stringing them works on dexterity. For this project, lay out the noodles in a bowl on the table. Cut a length of string. Thread a noodle onto the string, and tie the noodle in place on one end with a knot. Place the string back on the table, and proceed to create a string for each kid. Let your kids thread noodles on their respective strings, and then tie them off to create the necklace."

      "content": "Give them Play-Doh. Let them have fun playing around with the dough. Their creations don't need to be perfect--just let them create what they want with the dough. [3] X Research source Working with Play-Doh and other clay builds up hand muscle and dexterity."

      "content": "Tell a story with finger puppets. Give your kids finger puppets and ask them to come up with a story about them. Have them act it out with the puppets on their hands.

      "title": "Teach them to cut snowflakes.",
      "content": "Teach them to cut snowflakes. Any kind of cutting activity helps strengthen their hands and increase fine motor skills. Just be sure to give them safety scissors so they don't hurt themselves. To make snowflakes, fold a piece of paper in half horizontally. Fold it in half again, but do it vertically. Fold it in half several times, always keeping one end without any folds. You should have a triangle shape that is misshapen on the non-folded end. Cut shapes in the paper. Angular shapes work best. Also, make the unfolded end regular by cutting along the edge in a design. Open the paper back up for a snowflake."

      "title": "Teach them not to grip it too tightly.",
      "content": "Teach them not to grip it too tightly. Holding it too tight can hurt your kid's hand over time. Signs of this problem include ripping the paper and white knuckles. To help a kid loosen his or her grip, place a small lump of something, such as Play-Doh, in the palm of his or her hand while he or she writes."

      "title": "Copy his or her name.",
      "content": "Copy his or her name. Let your child copy the letters of her name rather than trace them. This process will reinforce the letters, as she actually has to learn the shapes.
