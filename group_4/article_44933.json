      "content": "Wait until your cat is calm and relaxed. Pick a time when your cat is feeling nice and relaxed, like when it’s just getting up from a nap, getting ready to nap, or calmly resting on its favorite surface during the day. Don't try to trim your cat's nails right after play time, when it’s hungry, when it's restless and running around, or in an otherwise aggressive mood. [2] X Research source Another good time for nail trimming is after your cat has eaten and is feeling sleepy and content. You may see that your cat has a broken or splitting nail and will want to cut it instantly, but hold off. Make a note of it and wait for your cat to get relaxed before trying to cut it, or you could make the nail worse."

      "content": "Use nail clippers designed for a cat. Before sitting down to cut your cat’s nails, be sure you have the right equipment to do so. To trim your cat's nails, use a pair of nail clippers designed to clip cat claws and a styptic pencil. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Choose from 2 different styles of nail clippers: scissor clippers and guillotine clippers. Scissor clippers cut a cat’s nails using a scissor motion and usually come in small and large sizes. The small “nippers” tend to be better for those new to clipping nails or if you just need to snip the tips. Use a sliding blade that cuts the nail when you squeeze the handles together. The claw fits into a slot and the blade slides across to clip the nail. These are strong clippers that are good for cutting long, thick nails. Clippers don't stay sharp forever, so discard them (or send them for sharpening) if you suspect the blades have gone dull. Signs of this include having to apply a lot of pressure to cut the nail or the nail being “chewed” by the clippers rather than making a clean cut. Styptic pencils cauterize blood vessels when touched to the nail and help prevent bleeding. If you cut the quick, hold the styptic pencil to the claw for 1 - 2 minutes to stop the bleeding."

      "content": "Hold your cat on its back with its rear on your lap. Hold the clippers in one hand and hold your cat’s paw in the other. Gently squeeze the top and bottom of your cat’s paw, on the joint just behind the claw to extend the claw. [4] X Research source If your cat doesn’t like this position, hold it in the crook of your arm instead. If you need to trim your cat’s nails but it's putting up a fight, wrap the cat in a towel or blanket and extend one arm or leg out at a time. Start with the back claws first. Many cats will try to use their hind legs to get free, but if you've already cut them, you won't get scratched as easily."

      "content": "Find the place where the nail separates from the quick. Be sure you know where the quick is before you attempt to cut the nail—the quick will look like a small, pinkish triangle inside the nail. Take note of where this is on your cat’s nail so you can avoid clipping it. [5] X Research source Try to orient the clippers so that when the nail is cut, the blade cuts from bottom to top. This will help prevent splitting. First cut just the tip of the nails. As you get more comfortable, you can cut closer to the quick, but never cut all the way to the quick or you can hurt your cat and make its nails bleed."

      "title": "Cut the nails with the trimmers.",
      "content": "Cut the nails with the trimmers. Hold your cat firmly and cut the nails one by one. Position the trimmers halfway between the end of the quick and the claw. Snip slowly, and speak to your cat in a calm, soothing voice the entire time. [6] X Research source Try to avoid getting frustrated. Your cat may protest, meow, and try to scratch you, but don't yell at your cat or rush through the process, or you may end up hurting it and scaring it away having its nails trimmed again. You may only be able to trim one or two nails at a time at first, which is okay. Your cat’s comfort matters the most. Don't forget the dewclaws! Most cats have 2 dewclaws, one on each front leg. These are like a small thumb, located on the side of the front legs, just below the wrist. Check these monthly and cut them if they’re too long. [7] X Research source Jones Animal Nursing. Jones.

Some cats also like sour cream or butter. [8] X Research source Over time, your cat will associate getting its nails trimmed with getting a treat. Though your cat may not love the nail-trimming part, it'll want the treat afterwards, so it'll be less resistant in the future."

Each cat's nails grow at a different rate, but it's a good rule of thumb to trim your cat's nails somewhere between every 2 weeks and every month so that its nails don't get too long, split, or break. [9] X Research source Though your cat will be sharpening its claws and keeping them in good shape on its own, keep an eye on their nails nonetheless. Your cat could be walking around with a broken nail, and you can help it out by trimming it into shape. Older cats need special attention because their nails are thicker and can sometimes press around into the pads, cutting into them. Check your older cat's nails every week and clip the tip off if necessary. If your cat’s nails cut into their pads, take them to a vet. [10] X Research source Jones Animal Nursing. Jones.

Begin gently petting its paws while simultaneously petting the cat in its favorite spots (the back of the neck, under the chin, where its back meets its tail, etc.). Do this for each paw you plan to trim.

Eventually, you should be able to gently squeeze the paws (applying most of the pressure on the pads) to push individual claws out without upsetting your cat. [14] X Research source Jones Animal Nursing. Jones. Publisher: Pergamon. When your cat’s claws are extended, you’ll see the thick part of the nail, and, towards the cat’s toe, a pinkish area inside the nail, called the quick. The quick is the living part of the nail and contains blood vessels and nerves, so cutting a cat’s nail to the quick is quite painful for the cat. Never cut a cat's nail close to or with flush with the toe; your aim is to clip off only the sharp point. Look carefully at where and how large each quick is—through a clear nail it will look like a small pink triangle. Each of your cat’s nails will be similar, so even if the cat has dark nails, look to find one clear nail as a reference point for the others."

If you're going to be trimming the cat's nails by yourself, the cat will need to sit on its rear on your lap, facing away from you, while you hold its paw with one hand (and, eventually, the clippers with the other).

Gently press on each nail to extend it. Again, reward the cat with treats and praise.
