      "content": "Transfer half of your favorite conditioner to an empty container. Use a spare plastic bottle or a resealable glass jar to put half of the conditioner in, and set it aside somewhere safe so you can use it later and make a second batch of aloe conditioner. [1] X Research source Mixing up a batch of aloe conditioner saves you money because it doubles the amount of time you’ll go between having to purchase new product."

      "title": "Funnel aloe vera gel into the half-empty bottle to fill it up.",
      "content": "Funnel aloe vera gel into the half-empty bottle to fill it up. You may be able to simply spoon the gel in, but if the mouth of the bottle is narrow, it would be easier to use a funnel. In general, you should aim to make your conditioner bottle a mixture of 1:1 aloe to conditioner, but it’s okay if the proportions are a little bit off. [2] X Research source Use fresh aloe vera gel, which can be purchased at your local health food store, or harvest the aloe vera gel yourself if you have a plant at home."

      "title": "Shake up the bottle to fully incorporate the aloe and conditioner.",
      "content": "Shake up the bottle to fully incorporate the aloe and conditioner. Reattach the lid to the bottle, and give it several good shakes until everything is mixed together. Test the product by squeezing some out into your hand—if it is primarily aloe, then you need to mix it up more. [3] X Research source Each time you use the conditioner, give it a few shakes in case either of the ingredients settled."

      "content": "Apply the conditioner after washing your hair and leave it in for 2 minutes. After you wash your hair, apply the conditioner and let it sit for a few minutes before you rinse it out. It may take a week or two for you to notice the difference, but before long the aloe should start working its magic on your hair. [4] X Research source Aloe vera helps clear up dry skin and dandruff, and it also heals hair that has been damaged by heat or chemicals."

[6] X Research source If you’re going to lay down, though, you could wrap a towel around your head to keep the aloe vera gel on your scalp, though it won’t hurt anything if it rubs off."

      "content": "Put 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of aloe vera gel into a bowl. For such a small amount of aloe, you’ll only need 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of an aloe leaf if you’re harvesting it yourself. [9] X Research source If you don’t have fresh aloe at home, use store-bought aloe vera gel, which can be found at health food stores."

For the easiest results, use coconut oil that is at room temperature—it’ll be easier and faster to incorporate with the aloe. Use a spoon to mix up the ingredients until they make a single paste. [10] X Research source If your hair needs a little extra conditioning, you could also add in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of honey."

Keep working the mask through your hair until it is covering everything. If you have really long hair, you may need to double the recipe. [11] X Research source Starting at mid-shaft helps ensure the mask gets smoothed over all your hair and isn’t mainly at the scalp, which could end up making it look greasy. You may need to massage the coconut oil and aloe gel with your fingers for a few minutes to warm it up and make it easier to spread. Wear an old t-shirt that you don’t mind getting a little messy, just in case any of the mask gets onto your clothes."

This is mainly to protect your clothes and furniture while you let the mask do its work, but the warm, damp towel can help to provide your hair with a little extra moisturizing power, too, and it’ll keep the mask moist. [12] X Research source If you leave your hair unwrapped, it’s possible that the mask will start to stiffen on your hair and won’t work as well."
