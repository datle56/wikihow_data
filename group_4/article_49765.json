      "content": "Consider the assets you can legally bequeath. If you are married, you may not be able to bequeath every asset you have. Some of those assets may be shared with your spouse, which means state laws and prior legal agreements could dictate how these assets can be bequeathed. Even if you are not married, if you have entered into previous contracts, those agreements may supersede your will. If you are married and live in a common law state, you can bequeath any property that includes your name on the deed, registration papers, or any other document proving title. [1] X Research source If you live in a community property state, 50% of all assets you accumulate during the marriage belong to the spouse. [2] X Research source The other 50% is yours to distribute. The nine community property states are Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. [3] X Research source Contracts such as prenuptial agreements and trusts can also affect what you can legally distribute in your will. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Be sure you examine any of these contracts to determine your obligations."

      "content": "Determine the division of your assets. Before you write your will you need to decide how you are going to divide your assets among beneficiaries. Name the beneficiaries and include the percentage of your estate they will receive. Make sure the total percentage equals 100. For example, if you want to give 25% of your assets to your mother, you can simply state \"To my mother, Tara Smith, I bequeath 25% of my estate.\" If you are disposing of your assets in an awkward manner, for example giving everything to someone that is not in your family or giving everything to someone you have not known long, you should always speak to an attorney."

      "title": "Choose who will receive specific assets.",
      "content": "Choose who will receive specific assets. If you want to be more particular when you distribute your assets, you can bequeath specific assets to a particular beneficiary. If you do this, the specific asset will be distributed and will not be included in the percentages of your estate (the remainder) that will be distributed among other beneficiaries. For example, you may write: “To Tara Smith, I give my house at 123 Cherry Lane, and to Bob Jones, I give 50% of the remainder.” As the example illustrates, you should be as specific as you can be when making a disposition. Be sure you include any identifying information that will help an executor or judge dispose of your property."

Make sure you consider what you want to happen to an asset that was to be distributed to a beneficiary that happens to die before you. For example, you might write: “To my mother, Tara Smith, I bequeath 5% should she survive me; otherwise the share of Tara Smith shall pass instead to Bob Jones should he survive Tara Smith and myself.” If you do not name someone else to receive the gift, it will \"lapse\" and be put back into the general pot."

An attorney can review the will you write, provide you with witnesses and ensure that you have met your state's requirements. This can be a costly option depending on your attorney's fees and how complicated your will is. Using an online resource will automatically ensure that your will is written according to your state's requirements. [6] X Research source Online will writing services generally cost between $60 and $100, depending on how complicated your will is. When you write your own will, you will need to know your state's requirements and decide how to fulfill them. You can write your own will and be responsible for making sure it fulfills your state's requirements. Be aware that state laws can change from year to year, so the process may be more complicated than you think."

Therefore, you should always include a statement that proves your soundness of mind. Most often it is argued that a testator had dementia or another sickness that prevented them from understanding the effects of the will. Include this statement: “I declare that I am of legal age to make this will, and that I am of sound mind.” You can also videotape the execution of the will to put to rest any future allegations of incapacity."
