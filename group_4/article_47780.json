      "content": "Aspects are the degree of angles between planets at the time you were born. In other words, aspects represent a connection or relationship between planets. How close or far apart planets are to each other can show how you take action and interact with others. There are five major aspects, five minor aspects, and hard and soft aspects. [1] X Research source Five major aspects: conjunction (0°), sextile (60°), square (90°), trine (120°), and opposition (180°). Five minor aspects: semi-sextile (30°), semi-square (45°), sesqui-quadrate (135°), inconjunct (150°), and quintile (72°). Hard aspects represent the parts of your life and personality you may struggle with the most. Soft aspects represent the positive and otherwise easy parts of your life. To find aspects in your birth chart, check the angle degree between two planets."

      "title": "A square aspect is a hard aspect.",
      "content": "A square aspect is a hard aspect. This aspect occurs when two planets are 90° apart, or three signs apart, and represents a mental or physical tug-of-war. The building tension from a square angle causes you to take action in one way or another, driving you toward negotiation, balance, and harmony. If you feel like you’re constantly at war with yourself, it may be because of a square aspect. For example, a square aspect between the Moon and Mercury represents the inability to express emotions. The Moon symbolizes your emotions, while Mercury is the planet of communication. A square aspect connecting these planets may make it difficult for you to say what you need emotionally. [2] X Research source Finding a balance for both planets can be difficult, but not impossible as the square aspect challenges you to find harmony in the least likely of places."

      "title": "An opposition is a hard aspect.",
      "content": "An opposition is a hard aspect. This aspect happens when two planets are 180° apart, or six signs apart, and on the opposite side of each other in your chart, giving off a natural polarity. Think of opposition as opposite. If the planets in opposition are naturally opposites or incompatible, chances are they’ll cause tension in you physically and mentally. This can cause conflicting emotions and personality traits. For example, if Mars is in opposition with Saturn, this could be a sign that you’re hardworking but hold yourself back. Mars is fast-paced and impatient, whereas Saturn is cautious and careful. These qualities oppose each other, but you can learn to balance their energies by making calculated decisions and taking advantage of opportunities quickly. These zodiac signs are natural opposites: Aries and Libra, Taurus and Scorpio, Gemini and Sagittarius, Cancer and Capricorn, Leo and Aquarius, Virgo and Pisces [3] X Research source"

      "content": "A conjunction is a neutral aspect that represents the strongest planetary expression. This angle is dependent on planet connections, which makes it a hard and soft aspect. A conjunction occurs when a planet moves into the same part of the zodiac as another planet. Think of it like a solar eclipse. [4] X Research source Some astrologers don’t consider conjunction a hard or soft aspect at all. Rather, they call it a strong or dynamic aspect as its influence triumphs all other aspects."

      "title": "If the planets in conjunction are incompatible, they create a hard aspect.",
      "content": "If the planets in conjunction are incompatible, they create a hard aspect. If the planets in conjunction are compatible, they create a soft aspect. For example, a Mars and Neptune conjunct is a hard aspect because their relationship is inharmonious, meaning that their zodiac signs don’t get along. You can tell if planets are harmonious or not by looking at their zodiac signs . If their signs get along, they get along. Here’s a quick compatibility guide: Aries: Gemini, Sagittarius, Leo Taurus: Cancer, Capricorn, Pisces Gemini: Libra, Aquarius, Aries Cancer: Taurus, Scorpio, Virgo Leo: Sagittarius, Aries, Gemini Virgo: Taurus, Cancer, Capricorn Libra: Aquarius, Gemini, Sagittarius Scorpio: Cancer, Capricorn, Pisces Sagittarius: Aries, Aquarius, Leo Capricorn: Taurus, Pisces, Virgo Aquarius: Sagittarius, Libra, Gemini Pisces: Scorpio, Cancer, Capricorn"
