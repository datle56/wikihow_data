Don't bring the part down onto the sides of your headâ€”it should line up about with your temples.

      "content": "Comb the back section in the direction you want to wrap it. Hold the ends of this section so your hair is taut, then comb it down and around in a circular pattern, moving in the direction of the wrap. For instance, if you're wrapping your hair to the left, you'd start combing on the right side of this section. Comb that section circular pattern, first going downward, then up around your hairline. Work from your roots and working toward the ends, and make sure all of your strands of hair are as smooth and taut as possible as you do this. [4] X Expert Source Shun Pittman Master Cosmetologist, Global Salon Educator & Author Expert Interview. 17 June 2021. Tuck the bottom section of your hair under the side section in the direction you're wrapping. For instance, when you're wrapping to the left, the ends of your back section will be under the section that's combed down over your left ear. Hold the comb so you're working from the top of the section, rather than coming up from the bottom. This will help you get a smoother finished result."

Pull all corners towards your forehead and tie them all into a single knot to hold them in place. Consider placing a pair of clean pantyhose over the scarf as you sleep. This can help to keep the wrap intact. Place the trunk section of the pantyhose over your head. It should be tight but comfortable. Wrap the legs around to the base of the neck. Tie them in place."
