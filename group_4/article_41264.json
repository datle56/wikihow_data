      "content": "Check for bright red drops on toilet paper, which indicate minor issues. If you have minor rectal bleeding, you’ll see small drops or smears of blood on your toilet paper or in the toilet bowl. This indicates that you’re bleeding from your lower rectum, which actually isn’t the end of the world and will likely go away on its own. Still get it checked out soon, but you aren’t in danger. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Minor rectal bleeding may indicate: Hemorrhoids . These are swollen veins inside or outside of the anus that can cause itching or pain while passing stool. These are extremely common. Anal fissure . This is a tear in the lower rectum. You’ll likely have a sharp pain while pooping, followed by a low burning sensation. An STI or irritation after anal sex . If you have genital warts in your anus, or you have anal sex without proper lubrication or preparation, it can cause temporary rectal bleeding. A side effect of blood thinners (like warfarin). This is especially likely if you have zero pain associated with the blood."

If you see streaks of bright red blood mixed into your stool when you wipe, attached to your stool in the toilet bowl, or coagulating together in the water, it indicates bleeding slightly higher up in your lower colon or rectum. These problems are usually minor, but can occasionally indicate something serious.

You’ll often have yellow slime alongside blood and frequent anal pain. Gastroenteritis . If you feel sick or feverish, it’s probably just a tummy bug. IBD or Crohn’s disease . If you feel bloated and have bloody diarrhea, you likely have one of these chronic conditions. Bowel polyps . These are small growths in your intestine that occasionally bleed. This could be nothing, or an early warning sign of colon cancer."

      "content": "Search for dark red or black stool, as this is a sign of upper GI bleeding. Rectal bleeding isn’t always as apparent as blood-stained toilet paper. If the poop is black or the blood in your stool is a deep, dark maroon, then the bleeding in your upper digestive tract. This is much more serious and you should see a doctor ASAP. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source This could be: Internal trauma . You may have internal bleeding in your small intestine, stomach, or esophagus if you were in a car crash, fight, or fall. Colon cancer . Other signs include: trouble emptying your bowel, weakness, fatigue, radical changes in your bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss. Ulcer . You may have an ulcer in your stomach, intestine, or esophagus. If you have localized pain somewhere other than your rectum, this is likely the cause. Diverticular disease . These conditions are caused by bulges in your digestive tract. If you have a fever and nausea alongside the bloody stool, it’s probably a diverticular disease."
