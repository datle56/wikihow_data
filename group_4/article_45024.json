You can also download a guitar tuner app on your smartphone for free. Some tuners can plug directly into your guitar while others just need to be in the guitar’s vicinity as you play. [1] X Research source Read reviews for the app or digital tuner you want before downloading or purchasing it. Popular brands for digital guitar tuners include Boss, D'Addario, and TC Electronic. Popular guitar tuner apps include Guitar Tuna, Fender Tune, and Pro Guitar Tuner. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Strum the top string next to the tuner. Turn on the electronic tuner and hold it next to the guitar. Use a pick to strum the top string, or 6th string, and look at the digital display on the tuner to see which note the top string is in. In standard tuning, this string should be an E when played in the open position. The electronic tuner should have a digital display that reads the note you’re playing with a needle under it. When the needle is centered, it means that the note is in tune. If the needle is to the left or right of the center, it means it is out of tune. [3] X Research source The open position is when the string is played without holding down any frets on the neck. If you want to tune the guitar to drop D by ear, you need to make sure that the rest of the strings are in tune or you won’t have anything to match the 6th string tone to. If the needle is to the left of the center, it means the note is flat. If it’s to the right, it means the note is sharp."

      "content": "Tune the 6th string to a D note. Play the top string in the open position. It should read an E. Then, turn the knob closest to you on the top of the neck counterclockwise and look at the digital tuner. The needle should move left until the display changes to a D. Keep turning the knob until the needle is in the center and the note reads D. Your guitar's 6th string is now tuned to a D. [4] X Research source As you turn the knob, you’ll hear the note of the string change. If the guitar is somewhat in tune, the digital guitar tuner should read an E when you strum the top string."

Turn the knob until the digital tuner reads a D and the needle is centered on the screen. [6] X Research source If the guitar is partially in tune, you’ll only have to rotate the knobs slightly to put it into D. It’s important that the 4th string is properly in tune if you’re going to put your guitar into drop D by ear."

The 3rd string should be a G, the 2nd should be a B, and the bottom string, or 1st string, should be an E. Turn each corresponding knob while strumming the string to ensure that your guitar is completely in tune.

The 3rd string from the top on the guitar neck, referred to as the 4th string, is a D note when your guitar is in standard tuning. Strum the string without pressing down on any of the frets on the neck of the guitar to play a D. This is known as playing the string \"open.\" [8] X Research source You will match the sound of the top string, or 6th string, with the 4th string. Holding down the frets, or rectangles on the neck of your guitar, will change the note of the string."

Listen to the difference in tone between the top string, or 6th string, and the 4th string as they play simultaneously. This is because in standard tuning, the 6th string is tuned to an E note and the 4th string is tuned to a D note. [9] X Research source If the guitar is in standard tuning, playing the two strings at the same time should sound off key. The goal is to lower the note of your 6th string so that it matches the tone of the 4th."

Listen to the vibrations between the two strings and stop turning the knob when they match up. You’ll know they are matching when you don’t hear any warble sounds between the two notes and they both match up. [10] X Research source Tuning a guitar by ear takes practice and experience."

Usually, you'll hold down the middle of the fret but with harmonics, brush over the metal divider between the frets.
