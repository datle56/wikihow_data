      "content": "Don't get sucked into sales. Ah, the irresistible lure of a deal! Retailers are counting on their customers to get sucked in by the sales rack. It's important to resist the temptation to justify a buy just because its on sale. Even big discounts can mean big spending. Instead, your only two considerations when shopping should be: do I need this item? And does this item fit within my budget? If the answer is no to these questions, it may be best to leave the item in the store and save your money on an item you need, rather than want, even if its on sale."

Shovel your walkway yourself, instead of paying someone else to do it. Get the whole family involved in outdoor chores, like mowing the lawn or cleaning the pool. Make your own household cleaning items and beauty products. Most of these products are made of basic items you can buy at your local grocery store or health food store. Laundry detergent, all purpose cleaner, and even soap can all be made by hand, by you, for cheaper than store prices. [14] X Research source"

Unlike fixed expenses (essentials like rent, utilities, and other payments) which remain the same each month, discretionary expenses are nonessential and are easier to cut back on.

Or do you really need the designer shoes or the latest gaming system? Check for things you do not use. [18] X Expert Source Benjamin Packard Financial Advisor Expert Interview. 11 March 2020.

Take note of even little things like a coffee, a postage stamp, or a meal on the go. [19] X Research source You may be surprised by how much you end up spending in just one week or in one month. If possible, look at data compiled over the course of a year. Most financial planners would review entire year of expenditures before making recommendations. Discretionary expenses can end up taking up a large percentage of your pay cheque or allowance. Recording them will give you a sense of where you can cut back on your spending. Take note of how much you spend on wants versus needs (for example, drinks at a bar versus groceries for the week). Figure out what percentage of your expenses are fixed versus discretionary. Fixed expenses remain the same each month, while discretionary expenses are malleable."

This can only lead to greater debt and less savings. So, be honest about your spending every month and make sure you only spend as much as you earn. This means factoring in money every month for expenses and savings. [21] X Expert Source Trent Larsen, CFP速 Certified Financial Planner Expert Interview. 22 July 2020.

      "content": "Understand the characteristics of compulsive shopping. Compulsive shoppers often cannot control their spending habits and become emotional spenders. They \"shop till they drop\" and then they keep shopping. But compulsive shopping and spending generally makes a person feel worse, rather than better, about themselves. Compulsive shopping usually affects women more than men. Women with compulsive shopping issues usually have racks of clothing with the tags still on them. They will go to the mall with the intention of buying just one item and come home with bags of clothing. Compulsive shopping can be a seasonal balm for depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the holiday season. It can also occur when a person feels depressed, lonely and angry."

Notice if you have large amounts of debt on your credit card or multiple credit cards. You may also hide your purchases from concerned family members or partners. Or you may try to cover up your spending by taking on a part-time job to supplement your spending habits. Individuals who have a compulsive spending problem will likely be in denial and have a hard time admitting they have a problem."
