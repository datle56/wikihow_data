      "content": "Understand that using tampons doesn't make you lose your virginity . Contrary to one particularly unhelpful myth, using tampons does not make you \"lose your virginity.\" Tampons might stretch the hymen (the thin membrane that usually stretches when you have sex), but the hymen should not tear. The hymen only partially covers the vaginal opening and is intended to stretch and bend. Even if your tampon use does stretch the membrane (which can happen during other activities, too, like frequent horse-riding), it doesn't mean you're not a virgin . [4] X Research source Another myth is that the hymen completely covers the vagina. Rest easy, your hymen does have an opening for tampon insertion and for your period to leave your body. The hymen normally will expand if you relax, but if you force a tampon through it while tense, your hymen may rupture. This can happen while doing sports, too."

      "title": "Buy tampons.",
      "content": "Buy tampons. As you've probably already seen in the grocery store, tampons come in a variety of types and sizes . Here's what's easiest for your first time: [6] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Buy tampons with applicators. Tampons come in two basic types: with applicators, or a plastic tube that will help you push the tampon up into the vagina. Having the help of an applicator will make life easier when you're first learning, so choose a box that includes them. (In the U.S., O.B. is the primary brand that sells without applicators––most other brands have them.) Pick the right absorbency. Absorbency is a measure of how much absorbent cotton is in the tampon, ranging from light to heavy. Most women use heavy absorbency tampons during the first day or two of their periods when bleeding is heaviest, and transition to lighter ones toward the end. [7] X Research source If you're concerned about pain, though, try buying light absorbency tampons. You'll have to change them more frequently, but they'll be slimmer and more comfortable. A good beginning tampon is Tampax Pearl Lite . You can also just get \"junior\" or \"slim\" tampons. Using a smaller sized tampon at first will help you get used to inserting them and they will also be easier to take out. You can buy heavier tampons later if you discover light absorbency doesn't work for you. If you have a heavy flow during the day, it may be handy to use a pantyliner or thin pad along with your tampon, in case the tampon overflows. Overflowing can happen even with heavy absorbency tampons, within 4 hours."

[9] X Research source Alternatively, you can stand to insert a tampon, placing one foot on a higher surface such as a toilet seat. If this works better for you, give it a shot. However, most women prefer sitting on the toilet so that any stray bleeding is contained."

      "content": "Find your vagina. This is the most common hurdle first-time tampon users run into, and it can seem really daunting. Once you figure it out, though, you're set for life! Here's how to make it a little easier: [10] X Research source Understand your anatomy. There are three openings: the urethra (where urine exits) at the front, the vagina in the middle, and the anus at the back. If you already know where your urethra is, feel an inch or two behind it to find the opening of the vagina. Use the blood to guide you. This might sound weird, but it'll help if you're struggling. Wet a piece of toilet paper, and completely clean up all the menstrual blood in the area, from front to back (or hop in the shower and scrub down). Once everything is clear, dab yourself with a clean square of toilet paper until you find where the blood is coming from. Ask for help . If you are really and truly lost, don't worry, as many girls before you have been here! Ask a trusted female relative––such as your mom, sister, grandma, aunt, or older cousin––to help you figure this out for the first time. Try not to feel embarrassed, and remember that every woman has been where you are now. You can also ask your doctor or nurse to help."

If you're queasy at the thought of grabbing the string with your bare fingers, do it with a square of toilet paper. If you do feel some catching and resistance as you pull the tampon out, it's probably because it's dry. Switch to a lighter absorbency to solve the problem.
