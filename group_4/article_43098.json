While you can’t do this on the iPhone 4 or 4s (which won’t support any iOS later than 7), you can still look up the model number this way. Here’s how: Open your Settings app and go to General > About . Locate the Model Number . It will be a different number from the one on the back of your phone, starting with “M” instead of “A.”"
