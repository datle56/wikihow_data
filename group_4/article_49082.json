      "content": "Understand why strengthening the core is important. Strengthening the core is essential in both the treatment and prevention of a slipped disc, and the accompanying sciatic pain. A strong and solid core helps to protect the spine from misalignment or injury, as the core muscles will keep the sciatic nerve in its proper place. The core also stabilizes the spine against any twisting motions and reduces the effect of daily wear and tear on the spine. As the core strengthens, you should no longer feel a one-sided shooting leg pain, which is one of the most common complaints of sciatica. The core muscles include the abs and transversus abdominis, obliques and the erector spinae muscle. These muscles are located at the front, side, and back of the abdomen and encase the spine. See below for some specific exercises you can do to strengthen the core muscles."

      "content": "Do planks. The plank is one of the best exercises for relieving sciatic pain caused by a slip disk, as it keeps the spine in proper alignment and prevents the disc from slipping further. To correctly perform the plank exercise: Assume a traditional push-up position on a soft surface such as a mat. The head, shoulder blades, and butt must form one straight horizontal line. The hands should be directly under the shoulders and feet are kept together. Brace your abdominal muscles as if you were preparing to be punched in the gut. Hold this position for 15 seconds, making sure that your hips do not drop down at any point during the exercise. Breathe deeply as you perform the exercise, this will prevent your blood pressure from spiking. There should be no pain, numbness, or tingling sensations throughout the exercise. If you feel any of these symptoms, rest for 15 minutes then try the modified plank position, which involves holding yourself up with your elbows and knees, rather than your hand and feet. Do 3 sets of 15-second holds, resting for 30 seconds in between each set. Work your way up to doing 30-second and then 1 minute-holds."

      "content": "Do side planks. Once you have built up the core doing regular planks (meaning that you can comfortably hold the plank position for 30 seconds) you can progress onto side planks. This exercise is great for strengthening the oblique muscles and helps to prevent sciatic leg pain, especially during twisting movements. Lie down on your left side, keeping your body in a straight line. Make sure your left elbow is lined up directly below your left shoulder. Lift yourself up so your entire body weight is being supported by your left elbow and the outer side of your left foot. You body should form a straight diagonal line from your head to your foot. As you hold this position, keep your hips elevated above the ground with the aid of your left oblique muscles. Remember to keep your abs tight, as if you were bracing yourself for a punch in the stomach. Hold this position for 15 seconds. You shouldn't experience any pain, numbness, or tingling when performing the side plank exercise. If you do, rest for 15 minutes then try the modified side plank position. To do the modified side plank, you will bend your knees instead of keeping them straight, so you will be supporting your weight with your left elbow and left knee. Do 3 sets of 15-second holds, resting for 30 seconds in between. Switch sides and do 3 more repetitions on your right. Work your way up to 30-second holds."

      "content": "Do hip thrusts. Hip thrusts are a great exercise for working the lower back, hip, and butt muscles. These muscles are part of the posterior chain, a group of muscles at the back of the body that supports the body weight and helps you to maintain proper posture. Good posture and equal distribution of weight lessens the pressure on the bones of the lower back and helps to relieve sciatica. To do a hip thrust: Sit down on the floor with a bench or couch behind you. Rest your arms and upper back against the bench or couch. Position your feet hip-width apart with the knees bent (this position engages the hip and butt muscles later on in the exercise). Thrust your hips up until your torso and thighs are parallel to the floor. The knees should be bent and in-line above the ankles, while the feet remain in contact with the ground. Don’t forget to breathe in and out during the movement. Slowly lower your butt back towards the floor. This counts as one repetition. Do 3 sets of 15 reps daily with 1-minute rests in between. No pain, numbness, or tingling sensations should be felt during this exercise. If you do experience any of these symptoms, stop the exercise immediately and consult your physician."

      "content": "Do the cat and camel exercise. The cat and camel is a combination yoga pose that may improve spinal mobility, via flexion and extension. However, if the camel pose is performed incorrectly, it can lead to pinched nerves in the lumbar region. You should only include it as part of your exercise routine after you have developed a strong core using the three exercises outlined above. Get down on all fours on a soft surface. The hands should be placed directly beneath the shoulders, while the knees should be under the hips. Do the camel part of the exercise: suck in your abs and round your back up towards the ceiling as far as you can. The shape of your back should resemble a camel’s hump. This position stretches your spinal erector muscles. Hold this position for 5 seconds, then return to the starting position. Next do the cat part of the exercise: Arch your back by pressing your stomach towards the floor and lifting your chest towards the ceiling to arch your upper back. This strengthens the lower back muscles and stretches the abdominals. Hold the position for 5 seconds. You should feel a stretch in your abdominal area. Alternate between the cat and camel posture for 5 times each. That counts as 1 set. Do 3 sets with 2 minutes rest in between. Avoid doing this exercise if you experience any slipped disc symptoms and see a doctor for proper guidance."

      "content": "Do an Iliotibial band stretch. The iliotibial band (ITB) is a type of connective tissue that spans the hip, butt, and outer leg muscles. If your ITB is not flexible, it will limit your movement and cause the muscles to compress the sciatic nerve. This aggravates the symptoms of sciatica. To do an ITB stretch: Stand tall and cross your left foot over your right foot. Without bending the knees, bend at the hips by pushing your butt back and out, as you were closing a door with your backside. Try to maintain the natural arch of the back at all times. There should be no slouching or rounding of the back. Rounding the back puts the spine out of its proper alignment. The feet should be in contact with the ground at all times.Lifting the toes off the ground shifts the weight of the body backwards. This compresses the back and may cause aggravation of sciatica. Push the hips out as far as they can go without experiencing any pain. Don't worry if you can't go more than a couple of inches — it is normal to have very limited ITB flexibility. Hold the position for 30 seconds to a minute."

      "content": "Understand what causes sciatica. There are several different root causes of sciatic pain, however they all involve irritation of the sciatic nerve, either through compression, kinking or physical trauma. [7] X Expert Source Karen Litzy, PT, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 27 August 2020. Some of the most common causes include: A lumbar herniated disc: This happens when a disc in the spinal column “spills” out from its original place. This herniated disc comes in contact with the sciatic nerve, compressing it and causing pain and irritation. ' Degenerative disc disease: This condition is usually associated with aging. As the spinal disc ages, it weakens and may partially collapse leading to compression of the sciatic nerve. Piriformis syndrome: This is when the piriformis muscle (located in the buttocks) compresses the sciatic nerve. Lumbar spinal stenosis: This occurs when the spinal canal narrows in size, pushing its content outward and causing a kink in the sciatic nerve. ' Abnormalities in the spine: Anything abnormal in the structure of the lumbar spine may lead to sciatica. This may include infection, injury, tumor, internal bleeding, bone fracture or muscle weakness.

The process for diagnosing sciatica will usually involve the follow: A physical examination: A physical examination may be performed, involving the straight-leg-raise test. The doctor will ask you to lie down and raise your leg slowly. The doctor will note the point at which pain is felt to determine which part of the sciatic nerve is affected. X-ray: An x-ray may be ordered to rule out fracture of the spine. MRI and CT scans: These may be prescribed by your doctor to aid in diagnosing sciatica. Detailed images of the lower back are created to learn more about the problem. Additional tests: Other nerve tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.These may include: velocity studies, electromyography, myelogram and evoked potential testing. [10] X Research source"
