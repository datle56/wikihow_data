      "content": "Thread the needle by sliding the thread through the needle’s eye. Cut a strand of thread long enough for your specific project using sharp scissors so the end doesn’t fray. Carefully slide the end of the thread through the eye of the needle and pull the thread through so it doesn’t fall back out. [1] X Research source Wetting the end of your thread makes it easier to slip through the eye hole."

      "content": "Push the tail end of the thread through the loop. Tuck the loose end of your thread through the loop. If the thread is too short to go through the loop and stay there, try making your loop over again and leaving yourself more thread to stick through the loop. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add 2-3 more knots on top of the first knot to make it thicker, if needed.",
      "content": "Add 2-3 more knots on top of the first knot to make it thicker, if needed. If your thread is especially thin, it’s important to make a couple more knots on top of the first one so that your knot won’t slide through the eye of the sewing needle. Repeat the same steps to make additional knots, but be careful to tie your knots right on top of the first one so that it creates a larger clump. Guide the second or third knots over the first knot using your fingers."

      "title": "Thread your needle so it’s ready to form a knot.",
      "content": "Thread your needle so it’s ready to form a knot. Cut a strand of thread in whichever color you’d like to use for your project. Slide an end of the thread through the eye of the needle and pull that end through 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) so it won’t fall back through. It helps to wet the end of the thread before you slide it through the needle’s eye. Your knot will be made at the end of the thread."

      "content": "Make a small ‘X’ with the needle and loose end of the thread. Form a large loop so that the tip of your needle is facing the end of your thread. With just the tips of the needle and thread, form an 'X' shape by crossing the needle underneath the end of the thread. Hold this up in the air so you can manipulate it easier. [5] X Research source Hold your needle in one hand and the loose thread end in the other hand."

      "title": "Hold the loose thread end against the needle so it doesn’t move.",
      "content": "Hold the loose thread end against the needle so it doesn’t move. Use your finger to press the thread against the needle to keep it in place. It’s important that this end doesn’t move around so that your knot forms easily. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the thread around the needle point 2-3 times.",
      "content": "Wrap the thread around the needle point 2-3 times. Take the thread near the tip of the needle and begin wrapping it around the needle. Do this 2-3 times, or until your knot is bigger than the needle's eye so it won't slip through. Wrap the thread tightly so it’s right against the needle. [7] X Research source Wrapping the thread around the needle 3 times will give you a bigger knot than only wrapping it around the needle twice."

      "title": "Pull the needle up while holding onto the wrapped thread to make a knot.",
      "content": "Pull the needle up while holding onto the wrapped thread to make a knot. Use one finger to hold the wrapped section of thread in place while you use the other hand to pull up on the needle. The wrapped section will slide down and off the needle. Keep pulling the needle up until the wrapped thread forms a knot near the end. [8] X Research source This is similar to how you might make a French knot while embroidering."
