      "content": "Both you and your partner lie on your side, facing the same direction. If you want to be “big spoon,” rest your stomach against your partner’s back and wrap your arms around them. If you want to be the “little spoon,” push your back into your partner’s stomach and let them hold you. [1] X Research source This is a classic snuggling position that most people know how to do instinctively. It lets the big spoon feel like a protector, while the little spoon gets to feel loved and cared for. Typically, whoever is taller will be big spoon and whoever is shorter will be little spoon. Feel free to mix it up however you’d like, though!"

      "content": "One person lies on their back, and the other person lies on their side. This cuddle position is just as intimate as spooning, but it’s great if someone is a little too hot temperature-wise. Have one of you lie flat on your back while the other person nestles into the crook of your arm. Whoever is lying on their side can rest their free arm on their partner’s chest. [2] X Research source This snuggling position gives the feeling of being cradled and held, which can be very soothing."

      "content": "Lie down facing your partner with your limbs intertwined. If you want to snuggle but still have a conversation, this position is for you. Lie down on the bed and gently tangle your arms and legs together with your partner’s. Lean in close so you can see their face, then look into their eyes as you chat or fall asleep. [3] X Research source This is a great position to choose if you want to chat before bed or you feel like giving your partner a few kisses."

      "title": "Face your partner while draping one arm over theirs.",
      "content": "Face your partner while draping one arm over theirs. Similar to the honeymoon hug, this is a great snuggle position for having a conversation or stealing a few quick kisses. Lie on your side facing your partner and gently rest your arm on top of theirs. Then, you can pull them in close or scooch further away if you need to. [4] X Research source This position is ideal for anyone who gets warm under the blankets, since your legs are free."

      "title": "Face away from each other with your lower backs gently touching.",
      "content": "Face away from each other with your lower backs gently touching. Maybe you both want to roll over in bed, but you still want to feel close. Lie down on opposite sides facing away from each other, but scoot in close so your backs and butt cheeks touch. You can even stretch your legs and play footsie with your partner until you both fall off to dreamland. [5] X Research source If you like snuggling but you need your space in order to fall asleep, this is the cuddling position for you."

      "title": "Have your partner lie on their back, then place your head on their chest.",
      "content": "Have your partner lie on their back, then place your head on their chest. If you or your partner are feeling the need to be nurtured, look no further than the cradle. Have your partner lie on their back and rest your head on their chest, bending your arm to drape across their stomach. You’ll be able to hear their heartbeat and their slow breathing as you drift off to sleep. [6] X Research source This snuggle position increases intimacy and can strengthen the bond between you two."

      "content": "Lie comfortably and drape one leg over your partner’s. If you both need a good night’s sleep but you still want to snuggle, lie in bed and get into a comfortable position on your stomach or your back. Rest one leg on top of your partner’s leg and leave it there as you fall asleep. You may need to adjust if your leg or your partner’s leg gets uncomfortable (but that’s a problem for later)."

      "content": "Use your partner’s rear end as a soft cushion for your head. Maybe you want to feel close without a ton of eye contact, or maybe you’re just really into your partner’s butt. Whatever the case is, have your partner lie on their stomach and scooch down until you can lay on their behind like a pillow."

Have one person sit criss-cross-applesauce, then have the other person rest their head in their lap. [7] X Research source Feel free to play with your partner’s hair or rub their head while they’re in your lap (as long as they’re okay with that, of course)."

Sit down next to your partner and get comfortable, then swing their legs on top of your lap (or vice versa). Their body will be slightly angled toward yours so you can still chat, and you’ll be close enough where kissing or heavy petting feels natural. [8] X Research source"

Have your partner sit up, then gently place yourself in their lap, facing away from them. Lean back into their stomach as they wrap their arms around your torso to pull you close.
