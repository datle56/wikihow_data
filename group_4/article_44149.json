      "content": "Contact relevant individuals. If you were unsuccessful, you should begin by contacting various professionals to see if they know anything about an insurance policy. These professionals include any financial advisers/planners that had a relationship with the policy owner, accountants, insurance agents, or any other professional who had any relationship with the policy holder.

      "title": "Contact any known insurance companies that the policy holder had a relationship with.",
      "content": "Contact any known insurance companies that the policy holder had a relationship with. For example, you are most likely looking for a life insurance policy. It is possible that the policyholder had their life insurance policy at the same company that sold other forms of insurance coverage they have. During your search of financial records and conversations with professionals, keep your eye out for the mention of auto insurers, home insurers, disability insurers, or any other type of insurers. Contact them to see if the policy holder had any other type of policies with that same company. In addition, ask them if they were aware of any other insurers that the policy holder had. If you live in a smaller city, you can also try calling all the major insurance companies one-by-one to check. This may be impractical in a larger city with hundreds of providers.It may be worthwhile to call the most prominent providers, however. If you live in a large city, call the insurance companies closest to where the policy holder lived, as well as the largest names. Identify yourself and your relationship to the decedent. Be prepared to show a death certificate for the decedent."
