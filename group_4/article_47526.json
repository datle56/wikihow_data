      "title": "Pick a jersey one size up.",
      "content": "Pick a jersey one size up. Jerseys are meant to fit loosely, not like a dress shirt. It should fit more like a sweatshirt, instead, so either aim for that kind of fit when trying one on or choose a size higher than you normally do if you're ordering online. [1] X Research source When you put it on, make sure it's not hugging your physique. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, such as if you're tucking it into slim pants or a pencil skirt. Then, you want it to fit much tighter, and you should pick your regular size."

      "title": "Buy from licensed retailers.",
      "content": "Buy from licensed retailers. While you can get knockoffs at a low price, they're generally going to look like cheap knockoffs. If you want to look nice in a jersey, you should opt for licensed brands, as they tend to last longer and look like new for much longer. Knockoffs will have poor stitching or even misspelled words. Online, you might see poor quality photos."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for a stitched jersey if you can.",
      "content": "Opt for a stitched jersey if you can. Most jerseys are expensive, so if you can spend a bit more, the stitched jersey is a better option. It will hold up better over time. The painted-on version may start to crack and fade in the wash. [2] X Research source Stitched, authentic jerseys can cost upwards of $200. However, licensed replicas can cost much less and still be high quality."

      "title": "Look for jerseys from current players.",
      "content": "Look for jerseys from current players. While it's fun to wear a throwback every now and then, you want to support the current team! Therefore, wear a jersey of a current player, so you show you're rooting for the home team. [3] X Research source If you're older, wearing a jersey of an older player is more acceptable. After all, you've been a fan for longer than most! You have a right to wear what you want. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Go for jerseys that are in the right colors.",
      "content": "Go for jerseys that are in the right colors. That is, avoid the jerseys that intentionally use pink or camouflage or some other color. You're wearing a jersey to show who you support, so use their colors! [5] X Research source It doesn't matter whether you wear the home or away jersey, as long as it's in the right colors!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Layer the jersey with complementary colors.",
      "content": "Layer the jersey with complementary colors. If you want to wear a shirt or jacket over your jersey, try to pick a color that's complementary rather than matching. Complement the color that's \"louder\" or stands out more. For instance, if the jersey is navy and orange, pick a complement for orange. A complementary color is one that is across from another one on the color wheel. [6] X Research source The color wheel is based on the three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. Between those colors are orange, green, and purple, which are the secondary colors (colors that are blended together from primary colors). Think of the colors in a circle: red-orange-yellow-green-blue-purple-red with shades of the colors in between. Colors across from each other on the wheel are complementary. So, for instance, red is across from green, meaning those colors are complementary. If you need to, look up the color wheel so you can visualize it better."

      "title": "Try a jersey with shorts for a low-key look.",
      "content": "Try a jersey with shorts for a low-key look. Shorts tend to dress-down an outfit, which can be great if you're going to a game. Throw on a pair of shorts to help keep your outfit casual. [7] X Research source Any kind of shorts work, from cargo and capris to short shorts. Alternatively, go all-out sporty with sneakers and sporty shorts or pants. Opt for longer shorts or even pants in a sporty material, such as knit or even a jersey-like material. Pair it with your favorite pair of (clean!) sneakers, and you've got a fun look for any game. [8] X Research source You can even wear a long, sheer jersey over shorts, or you could try a jersey over leather capris."

      "title": "Wear a form-fitting t-shirt under a jersey for a more polished look.",
      "content": "Wear a form-fitting t-shirt under a jersey for a more polished look. If the jersey has short sleeves, a shirt underneath allows you to unbutton the top if your jersey has buttons. For other jerseys, such as basketball jerseys, it can make the look feel like it actually belongs off the court. [9] X Research source A simple white t-shirt will do, though you could also use black if the jersey is dark."

      "title": "Add a jacket over your jersey for more flair.",
      "content": "Add a jacket over your jersey for more flair. Whether you choose a sports jacket or a jean jacket, throw a stylish jacket over your jersey to help complete your look. Pick one that's shorter for a more sophisticated look or a one that's longer to help tie the outfit together. [10] X Research source For instance, pair a short jean jacket with a longer jersey and leggings for a fun, laidback look. Alternatively, try a long trench coat with a partially tucked jersey and tight-fitting pants. Another option is a suit jacket over dark jeans and a form-fitting jersey."

      "content": "Polish the look and stay warm with a turtleneck underneath. Layer a neutral or complementary turtleneck underneath your jersey. It can bring a bit of sophistication to the look and help keep you warm! [11] X Research source Try a shearling jacket over it all to help bring it together."

      "title": "Wear a long jersey as a dress.",
      "content": "Wear a long jersey as a dress. Longer, form-fitting jerseys can be worn as dresses, though check to make sure it goes past your rear. If you're a little nervous about the length, just add a pair of leggings to make it more comfortable. You can even add a belt at the waist to give the \"dress\" definition."

      "content": "Add a structured hat with a brim to downplay the sporty look. To make your look seem a bit more glamorous or dapper, add a non-sport hat. Think fedora or something similar. [12] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Image Consultant Expert Interview. 20 April 2021. [13] X Research source For instance, add a black fedora or a boater when you're wearing a mostly black jersey. You could even try a cowboy hat for a completely different look."

      "content": "Give your jersey outfit a boost with fancy shoes. Whether you opt for a fun pair of boots, high heels, or loafers, the right shoes can help take your outfit from dull to chic. Just make sure that whatever shoes you choose also pair well with your pants. For instance, you may want a pair of skin-tight pants to go with a billowy jersey. In that case, try a pair of slim boots or strappy high heels. Alternatively, if you want to wear loafers, try a tucking a tight-fitting jersey into dress pants."

      "content": "Put on a blinged-out belt over a partially tucked jersey. This combination adds a little glam to your look. You can wear it over a long jersey to make it more dress-like, or wear a partially tucked-in jersey to show off one worn in your belt loops. For instance, try one with silver studs along the edges of the belt. [14] X Research source You could also pick a particularly sparkly one, such as one with fake diamonds. Alternatively, try a pair of jeans and boots, along with a leather belt with a large belt buckle."

      "content": "Choose a large watch to add a masculine touch. An oversized watch is the perfect accessory to help create a more upscale look. Pick one that's large but understated in its details for some sophistication. For other jewelry, try a chain necklace or metal bracelet."

      "content": "Pop on a pair of sunglasses for added chic. Nothing says sophistication quite like the perfect pair of sunglasses.

      "content": "Keep the jersey untucked if you don't mind it hiding your figure. As jerseys are meant to be worn large, you can simply wear it untucked for an easy look. Wearing it all the way tucked in can look too formal unless you're actually playing a game. [17] X Research source Players don't even wear jerseys tucked in all the time while on the field, except for certain games like baseball."

      "content": "Tuck a bit of the jersey in at the front for a bit of contouring. If you want to show off your figure some, tuck just the front edge into your shorts, pants, or skirt. That little bit of tucking provides some definition for your body. [18] X Research source Plus, it helps create a better flow between your torso and your legs."
