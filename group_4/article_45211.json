      "content": "Make her feel you find her attractive. You know that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you find out that someone thinks you're good looking ? That's what you want to create for her. The fact that you think she's lovely to look at is a significant turn-on. Here's how to communicate it without going overboard: Say \"Hey, pretty lady\" or \"Hello, beautiful\" when you greet her. It's simple and short, but direct (and potentially patronising - use with caution). Pay her a compliment . [1] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Lower the volume and tone of your voice slightly, and say something like \"You look amazing today\" or \"I love your eyes.\""

      "content": "Be confident , even if you don't act like it. Some girls like a person who is nervous and even klutzy around her, but don't overdo it. If the girl is shy, be confident; if the girl is confident, feel free to act somewhat shy . Keep your shoulders straight and your chin high, and don't be afraid to look her in the eyes. You're communicating through your body language that you're strong, brave, and worthy of her attention. [4] X Research source"

Use good table manners , hold the door open for her, and say please and thank you. Good manners aren't necessarily attractive, but bad manners are definitely unattractive, so play it safe.

You can do these in passing, at the end of a date, while you're watching a movie, whenever â€” the point is that they don't have to be saved for when you're already making out.

      "content": "Whisper in her ear . Ears are an erogenous zone for all genders, and the light pressure of your breath will probably feel good. Saying the right things will also turn her on. Try something like: \"I couldn't stop thinking about you today\". [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Touch her in and outside the bedroom. If you're fairly sure it will be welcomed, try touching her intimately. A few places to touch her include: Her neck: You can gently run your thumb over her hairline if your arm is already around her shoulders, or offer to give her a neck rub. Keep your motions slow and light. [9] X Research source Her wrists: Lightly stroke the inside of her wrist or her palm. A few slow kisses on the inside of the wrist could work, too. [10] X Research source Her leg: This works only if you're both sitting down. Place your hand on her thigh or knee and let it rest there lightly. If she seems receptive, you can try slowly moving your thumb back and forth over her leg, keeping the rest of your hand where it is. [11] X Research source Her scalp: The scalp is a sensitive area for most people, and the light (repeat: light, not hard) tugging that comes from you playing with her hair will feel nice. Run your fingers through it, twirl it, or stroke it. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Warm your girl up.",
      "content": "Warm your girl up. The key to turning a girl on is being patient. As fast as people usually get turned on, some ladies need about that much build up. This means that you'll have to lay a little ground work and take the seduction part nice and slow. [13] X Research source A huge part of warming her up, of course, is making her feel comfortable and safe. You're going to see a lot of steps below about respecting her, seeking consent, and otherwise doing things that you might not think of as \"turn-ons\". Don't neglect them, they're important. [14] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Sex is very mental, as well as mutual, and if you help them by making it so that they don't have to worry, as well as understand what you mean, then that's half the battle."

      "content": "Ensure you have consent with anything you do. If you touch a girl without her consent, it is sexual assault. A simple \"Is this OK?\" or \"Can I touch you here?\" is enough.

      "content": "Give her an amazing kiss . If it's done right, a kiss can be the most effective way of turning a girl on. Keep your breath fresh with some gum or mouthwash and keep your lips loose. Tight, puckered lips is how you kiss your grandma! You should also keep the tongue action delicate (at first). The motions should be light, soft and alternate between fast and slow. [16] X Research source Know where to put your hands. The back of her neck, the sides of her face, or around her waist are all good areas for your hands to rest during a kiss."

      "content": "Tell her what you want. Many girls are way more sexual than you, potentially. Give them credit for that and there's nothing wrong with telling them how much you want them (once you've gotten your foot in the door a bit). This actually turns them on! Think about it: you feel turned on when you feel desirable too. Don't be really gross about it but don't be afraid to tell them how sexy you think they are and how you can't wait to get them in bed."

      "content": "Pay attention to lubrication. Friction can cause skin to become sensitive or even painful. Low friction also increases pleasure. Consider getting a quality, water-soluble lubricant to keep everything slick and sexy-feeling if you plan on some prolonged fun times, but, for lots of people (certainly not all) additional lubrication mostly required if they are turned on, but it definitely doesn't hurt. Replacement water-based lubricants are important in place of, or addition to, natural lubricant. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Use some variety. If you find an area where she likes to be touched, don't overuse it. Instead, back away from it for a while and slowly make your way back, touching everything around and up to it. The anticipation will make it more intense when you finally do touch her."

      "content": "Take your time. When you get in bed, start making out and rip each other's clothes off. Go slowly and take your time--this is especially important if your partner needs more time to get aroused. Tease each other and go slowly."

      "content": "Introduce a bit of kink. If you two are okay with this, try adding a bit of kink to the mix. You don't have to go wild, but a blindfold or tying her hands back with a silk scarf can force her to focus on what she's feeling and turn things up a notch."

      "title": "Master different types of kisses.",
      "content": "Master different types of kisses. The neck and inner thighs tend to be the obvious spots. If you want to get her writhing, trail some kisses along the side of her ribs (that spot that's so easy to tickle), the curve of her stomach just past where her abs are, and the protruding bit of her hip bone, usually found just above or just below the waistband. If you feel daring, move under her waistband and perform cunnilingus. Done right, this will drive her crazy! If you're having trouble turning her on, try communicating with her about her wants and desires. You can get expert help with wikiHowâ€™s course: How to Talk about Sex (Without Feeling Awkward) .
