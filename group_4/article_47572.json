      "title": "Try a low-back bra if you need more support.",
      "content": "Try a low-back bra if you need more support. These bras have a band that wraps around your stomach and lower back, providing your chest with an ample amount of support while remaining hidden beneath your dress. If you have a larger bust, this is the choice you should consider first. [1] X Research source Some bras can be converted into low-back bras. This is a great option if you want to invest in an undergarment you can wear every day."

      "title": "Cover up with stick-on silicone gel petals if you need less support.",
      "content": "Cover up with stick-on silicone gel petals if you need less support. If your bust is smaller, you might be able to get away without wearing any support. However, if you choose to go braless, you can risk exposing yourself through thin or light-colored fabric. Avoid this by sticking specialized gel petals over your nipples. [2] X Research source If you're looking for a simple, inexpensive coverage option, putting band-aids on your nipples can work just as well as wearing gel petals. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try an adhesive bra if you have a small- to moderately-sized bust.",
      "content": "Try an adhesive bra if you have a small- to moderately-sized bust. It provides a little more coverage and support than gel petals, but offers a similar guarantee that no straps or clasps will peek through the back of your gown. It offers less support than a low-back bra, and for this reason, it may offer inadequate support to larger-busted women. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider a bra with a transparent back for subtlety and support.",
      "content": "Consider a bra with a transparent back for subtlety and support. These bras are similar to strapless bras, but instead of a visible band and clasp, the back of the bra is made up of clear plastic or sheer fabric. [5] X Research source If you enjoy wearing strapless bras, but the one you usually wear will show through your backless dress, this is an excellent alternative. It’s also a more supportive option for women with medium to large busts."

      "title": "Choose a halter bra for dresses with higher backs and halter necks.",
      "content": "Choose a halter bra for dresses with higher backs and halter necks. Some backless dresses go around the neck and only expose a small portion of your back. For these dresses, you may be able to hide a halter style bra beneath your dress. This is another supportive option for women with larger busts. [6] X Research source Be sure to try this type of bra on with your dress to ensure that your dress covers up the clasp. It's a good rule of thumb to try any type of bra on with your dress in advance of the night you plan to wear it – if the bra fits poorly or is too visible beneath the dress, you'll want time to find an alternative."

      "title": "Practice proper posture to look confident and poised in your dress.",
      "content": "Practice proper posture to look confident and poised in your dress. Hold your head high, your shoulders back, and your chest out. Straight posture will draw attention to your back and enhance your look, so try your best to avoid slouching or hunching over. [7] X Research source Tucking your stomach in and bearing weight primarily on the balls of your feet can help you stand taller. It's also helpful to keep your head on a level plane by making sure your earlobes are directly above your shoulders."

      "content": "Choose minimal, elegant jewelry to counterbalance your daring dress. Accessories are an important part of any outfit, but the primary purpose of a backless dress is to show off your back. Jewelry that’s prominent or flashy can draw attention away from the true focus of your look. [8] X Research source Instead of a bold piece of statement jewelry, choose a simple yet elegant pair of dangling earrings or a delicate bracelet to add just a touch of sparkle to your look.

      "content": "Pick a pair of shoes that complements your dress without distracting from it. People usually wear backless dresses to more formal occasions or events. As such, it’s usually appropriate to choose a fancy pair of evening shoes – usually heels – to go with your dress. Just make sure that your footwear doesn’t steal the spotlight from your gown. [10] X Research source If your dress is sequined, patterned, or otherwise embellished, it’s a safe bet to choose simpler,solid-colored shoes. If both your dress and your shoes are elaborate, they may clash with each other. Black shoes tend to go well with many different colors. Metallic and nude shoes can also be versatile. But if you want to experiment with an unexpected color choice, try picking shoes that are the same color as your dress, but a slightly different shade. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid accessories, such as scarves, that cover your neck or back. Again, you want your back to be the focal point of your look. Necklaces can also create a disruption by drawing the eye to a clasp or an adjustable chain instead of your back. [12] X Research source Necklaces that are designed to drape down over your back are an exception to this rule. These tend to be fairly delicate, and are designed to be worn with backless dresses and shirts."

      "content": "Keep climate in mind while choosing accessories. If you are attending an outdoor event that might be a little chilly, wear a shrug, shawl, or jacket. You certainly want to show off your back at every chance you get, but you should prioritize your comfort – backless looks expose a lot of skin and can leave you vulnerable to the cold.

      "content": "Pin up your hair to highlight the style of your dress. You may have long, luxurious locks, but if they cover your entire back, there is not much point in wearing a backless dress. Choose a hairdo that sweeps your hair up and away in order to show off your back. [14] X Research source Updos often complement a backless gown. Try a sleek, simple bun, or attempt a more elaborate style involving twists or braids. [15] X Research source"

Allow part of it drape down your back, but make sure that enough of your skin still shows through. Covering up slightly can heighten the attractiveness of a backless dress. [16] X Research source Try curling your hair in loose waves, then sweep it to the side and across your shoulder to reveal a section of your back. [17] X Research source"

After getting sweaty, try to change out of your wet clothes and shower right away to clear away oil and bacteria from your skin.

This is an especially important step for those who have dry or sensitive skin. [22] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Using moisturizer soothes dry skin, but it can also prevent further acne breakouts. If your skin is dry, it produces more pore-clogging oil. Keeping your skin soft and hydrated with an oil-free moisturizer can curb excess oil and guard against resulting acne."

After you begin your skincare regimen, check up on your skin to make sure you’ll be comfortable baring it in your backless dress. If you cannot see it by craning your head, use a hand mirror to assist you. Stand with your back to the full-length mirror and hold the hand mirror in front of you. Move the hand mirror around until you can clearly see the reflection of your back in the full-length mirror.
