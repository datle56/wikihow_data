You should never wear a watch bigger than 50mm, at most, but 34mm-40mm is standard and ideal for both men and women. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide on which wrist you want to wear your watch.",
      "content": "Decide on which wrist you want to wear your watch. There is no “correct” side. Choose the wrist that is most comfortable and where your watch won't get in the way of your movements. This is typically the non-dominant hand, as it might be uncomfortable to write with a watch under your wrist."

      "title": "Wear your watch beside your wrist bone.",
      "content": "Wear your watch beside your wrist bone. Make sure that the face sits right next to the bone on the outside of the wrist (the ulna). When standing, little or none of your watch should be visible beneath your shirt cuff. When wearing a long-sleeved shirt, your watch should only be fully visible when your arm is bent. Never wear your watch on top of your shirt cuff."

      "title": "Wear a band that fits properly.",
      "content": "Wear a band that fits properly . A watch should appear comfortable, natural, and certainly not sloppy. It may be necessary to adjust it as needed, to accommodate natural fluctuations in wrist size. Some watches, such as dress watches and sports watches, have a prong and notch system that allows you to easily move the prong up or down a notch to tighten or loosen. Casual or formal watches can have a more complicated fastening system that requires you to adjust the size by adding or removing links. Consult the instruction manual, or ask your jeweler for help or advice on adjusting the length of your watch. A man should never wear his wristwatch loose around his wrist. It should move about an inch up and down your wrist as you move. The face of the watch should not slip to the side of your wrist. As a general rule, you should be able to fit a finger snugly between your wrist and the watch band. A wristwatch should not be worn too tightly. If the watch leaves an imprint on your wrist, it is too tight and should be loosened. Women's watches may be worn snugly, or loose around the wrist like a bracelet."

      "content": "Match your watch to your shoes. As a general rule, if you are wearing dress shoes, a dress watch would be appropriate. If you are wearing sneakers, then a sports watch would be appropriate. If you are somewhere in between, such as boots, boat shoes, or flip-flops, an everyday casual watch is your best bet.

      "content": "Choose a go-to, everyday watch that can be worn with casual clothing .

      "content": "Wear a formal watch to events that require formal wear. This includes weddings, christenings, funerals, formal dinners, opera and theater performances, and other formal events. Formal watches add a finishing touch to a well-polished outfit. Formal watches are usually made of a precious metal (silver, gold, or platinum), and can be incredibly expensive, depending on brand and materials. Many people prefer a formal watch that is made of the same metal tone as the rest of their jewelry or accessories. For example, a woman who's wearing a platinum necklace might prefer to wear a platinum, silver, or white gold watch, while a man who's wearing gold cufflinks will usually prefer to wear a gold watch. [3] X Research source Formal watches can be incredibly expensive, and are seen as a status symbol among men. If an expensive formal watch is not in your budget, consider foregoing the formal watch altogether; a cheap watch can carry a negative perception, while there are no consequences for not wearing a watch during these occasions."

      "title": "Wear a sports watch.",
      "content": "Wear a sports watch. You can wear it as an everyday watch, or as a functional tool for running or working out. Sports watches can be made with rubber, plastic, or even fabric bands that are meant to be durable, sweat-resistant, and often water-resistant. Pay close attention to the instructions that come with the watch—they will tell you how far under water your watch can safely go. Wear your sports watch when you will need to keep time, measure depth or speed, consult a compass, or when you will use other special features included. Outside of athletic endeavors, you can wear your sports watch with a long sleeve shirt or even a tie to casual events. Never wear a sports watch with a suit—this is the fashion equivalent of wearing sneakers with a tuxedo! It is considered to be in poor taste."

      "content": "Wear a dress watch for business dress or business casual. This would be appropriate with something slightly more dressed up than khakis and a polo, such as a shirt and jacket. Dress watches are usually more plain and simple than formal watches, and generally won’t have the same level of adornment that formal watches can have. [4] X Research source Choose one with a thin black or brown leather band to wear at events that require semi-formal wear , business professional wear, or even business casual wear , including blazers with slacks or jeans, dresses, and trousers with a nice blouse or jacket. Match your shoes and belt to your watch band. If your shoes are black, then don’t wear a watch with a brown band. Buy multiple bands for your watch, so you can easily and inexpensively make your watch match your shoes and belt. Or, look for a band that is a mix of brown and black."
