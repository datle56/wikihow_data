      "content": "Ask Alexa to disable an alarm before it goes off. If you set an alarm with Alexa but don't need it anymore, say, Alexa, stop alarm . If you have more than one active alarm, Alexa will list them for you by their time and you can select which one you would like to stop. This also works the same with timers. You can stop a particular timer you have named by saying its name. For example, \"Alexa, stop kitchen timer.\" If you keep hearing the news at 7am each morning but Alexa says that you have no alarms set, you might have a routine scheduled . Go to your Alexa mobile app and select More > Routines . You can tap the three-dot menu icon there and select Delete if you don't want to use that routine anymore. [1] X Research source"
