      "content": "Over text, WYD means “What (are) you doing?” Typically, WYD is an informal way to start a convo with a friend or crush, similar to “What’s up?” The sender wants to know what you're actively doing right now. They may also be checking to see if you’re free to chat or hang out. [1] X Research source You may see WYD with or without a question mark. Either way, WYD is always a question. The sender is expecting a response. You might see WAUD or WUD (which also means “What are you doing?”) but these abbreviations are a lot less common. When sending WYD through texting, the person is usually trying to keep it simple and act like they're not putting too much investment into the moment, even though they are reaching out."

For example: Your bestie: \"haaaay WYD right now?\" You: \"Just listening to music and reading! 📚 🎶 HBU?\" Someone you’re avoiding: \"WYD today?\" You: \"Super swamped with homework. TTYL\" Someone you're flirting with: \"WYD?\" You: \"You know what I'm doing. 😉\""
