      "content": "Validate their feelings of grief. Don't try to compare experiences. Even if you’ve lost a loved one before and you feel equipped to say anything along the lines of, “I know exactly how you feel,” it would be best if you removed your feelings from the situation all together. [3] X Research source Although you think you understand your friend’s loss, everyone’s grief is unique to them, so steer clear of empathizing by sharing your own experiences.

It’s easy to neglect ourselves when consumed by grief, so offering to do tasks for them could be a huge help. Ask if you can make them a meal, or help clean the house. Even taking their dog for a walk or changing their cat’s litter box could provide them with a little relief. Whatever you can do to help will be highly appreciated.

I’ll make it and bring it over!” ”Why don’t you go lay down while I tidy up the house?” ”Is there anything I can do to lighten your load?”"

      "content": "Avoid issuing cliches and talking about the afterlife with a grieving person. In your efforts to comfort a grieving friend, you may have the urge to use a cliche that could do more harm than good. Putting one’s foot in one’s mouth is understandable when trying to find the exact right thing to say, but the following phrases should not be uttered. [6] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source “He’s in a better place now.” Unless your friend is very religious and truly finds comfort in the prospect of a peaceful afterlife, saying this to a grieving friend could come off as dismissive of the reality of the situation. Try not to imagine or speak on where their deceased loved one has gone, and instead focus on allowing your friend to process their emotions. “Time heals all wounds.” This is another empty statement you should avoid, as it may not even be true for every person or every situation. Although it’s mostly accepted that the passage of time does act as a kind of salve for grief, slowly but surely reducing the open wound to a scar, you don’t want to assume that this will be the case for your friend. “It was God’s plan.” Again, unless your friend is deeply religious, try not to mention the divine or the supernatural in this situation. It may sound insensitive, implying that God designed for their mother or father to die in the specific manner and time that they did. Your friend probably doesn’t want to hear this, as it may cause them to feel even more helpless and hopeless in the grand scheme of things."
