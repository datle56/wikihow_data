      "content": "Raise your hand. Put your hand up to answer questions and don't be afraid to ask some yourself if you don't understand.

Answer only when you have something meaningful to contribute, but make sure you’re recognized. This way you can be held accountable when you start to doze off."

      "content": "Start a routine. It might be hard at first but the best way to always get the right amount of sleep is through routine. Going to sleep at the same time every night will help your body know when it’s time to shut off and refuel for the next day.

Even with routine you might not get your full nights rest to keep those daydreams at bay. Embrace that you might have a tough day ahead of you and put your best foot forward."
