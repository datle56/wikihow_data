It grows quickly and can thrive even in slightly damp soils, but it typically won’t regrow the next year. [1] X Research source Blade: Narrow with a pointed tip and smooth edges Color: Bright green Growth: Fast-growing and seasonal with a clumping growth pattern Water: Water once or twice a week once the ryegrass is established [2] X Research source Maintenance: Because it grows mostly in winter, not much maintenance will need to be done, although you may need to mow it frequently in the spring, as it will start to grow quickly in milder temperatures.

In fact, Bahia grows so rapidly that it can be difficult to control. Because Bahia thrives in multiple soil types and is extremely drought-tolerant, it’s a good ground cover for areas where other grasses don’t thrive. [3] X Research source Blade: Wide with hairy edges and a pointed tip Color: Light green Growth: Fast-growing, spreads via underground rhizomes Water: Water during droughts to avoid brown patches Maintenance: Trim it frequently in spring, summer, and fall to control rapid growth Cool season or warm season?

      "content": "Bermuda Bermuda grass is an aggressive grower that can quickly overtake a yard. That said, it’s drought-resistant and hardy, making it a favorite in southern states with hot summers. It’s also especially well-suited to high-traffic areas and will quickly recover from stress or damage. [4] X Research source Blade: Narrow with rough edges and a pointed tip Color: Light to dark green Growth: Spreads aggressively with both stolons and rhizomes Water: Water during droughts to avoid brown patches, but otherwise not much irrigation is needed. Maintenance: If you have Bermuda grass in your lawn, keep it mowed short—try to avoid letting it get longer than about 2.5 in (6.4 cm). Otherwise, it can be difficult to control. Cool season or warm season? Warm season. Growing zone: USDA Zones 7-10."

It grows best in full sun, but it may look patchy or sparse in shaded or heavily traveled areas. [5] X Research source Blade: Narrow with hairy edges and a pointed tip Color: Gray-green or blue-green Growth: Moderate growth speed, spreads by above-ground stolons Water: You almost never need to water buffalo grass. In fact, buffalo grass can grow in areas that get less than 1 in (2.5 cm) of rain over a whole summer. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of Missouri Extension University of Missouri program dedicated to research-based, practical public education Go to source Maintenance: If you want a low-maintenance lawn, mow buffalo grass every 3–4 weeks, keeping it at a length of about 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm). For a more manicured look, mow once a week to maintain a length of about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm).

[8] X Research source If you have shady areas in your yard, you may want to mix in a grass like zoysia or St. Augustine. Blade: Medium-width and hairy near the base with a pointed or boat-shaped tip Color: Light green Growth: Slow grower, spreads through above-ground stolons Water: Water centipede grass during periods of drought to avoid brown patches. [9] X Research source Maintenance: Try to keep it cut down to about 2.5 in (6.4 cm)—but since it grows so slowly, you’ll probably only need to cut it a couple of times during the growing season.

It’s frequently used on golf courses, but because it’s fairly high-maintenance, it’s somewhat difficult to care for in home lawns. [10] X Research source Blade: Narrow and flat Color: Bright green but loses color early in the fall and is slow to regain it in the spring Growth: Fast-growing, spreads by stolons to form above-ground mats Water: Should be watered frequently Maintenance: Must be mowed and dethatched regularly to keep it looking green and to avoid matting.

Blade: Narrow with smooth edges and a pointed or boat-shaped tip Color: Medium to dark green Growth: Fast-growing with a clumping growth pattern Water: Water during droughts to avoid browning Maintenance: Because it’s fast-growing, you’ll probably need to mow fine fescue once a week to prevent clumping overgrowth.

But perennial ryegrass may survive from one year to the next, especially in areas with colder winters—and over the next year, it can sometimes start to grow in difficult-to-control clumps. [15] X Research source Blade: Medium-width with rough edges and a pointed tip Color: Bright green Growth: Faster grower with a clumping growth pattern Water: Water once a week once grass is established.

Blade: Narrow with rough edges and a pointed tip Color: Medium to dark green Growth: Moderately fast growth, clumping growth pattern but may have some rhizomes Water: Tall fescue rarely requires irrigation Maintenance: Tall fescue can become clumpy over time, so you may need to re-seed your lawn each year to keep your grass looking lush, green, and even.
