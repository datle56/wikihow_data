An offensive player can’t run when they have the disc, so they have to pass it to a teammate to move it down the field. The defense gets the disc if a pass is incomplete, dropped, or flies out of bounds. When a player catches a disc in the defender’s end zone, they score a goal for their team. [1] X Research source"

The central play zone is 70 yards (64 m) long, and the endzones at each end are 25 yards (23 m) deep.

Once players on the receiving team and the throwing team raise a hand in the air to signal they’re ready, the player with the disc throws it down the field toward the opposite endzone. [13] X Research source After the throw is released, players can run in any direction. The receiving team gets the disc where they catch it or wherever it lands in bounds. If a pull goes out of bounds, it’s brought back to the closest brick mark and the game resumes. If you don’t have brick marks, then play the disc from where it went out of bounds."

You cannot run with the disc, but you can pivot on one foot to reposition yourself for a throw. [14] X Research source Any person on the offense can be the thrower.

There are no referees in ultimate frisbee, so players are responsible for calling fouls. If you think another player has fouled you, loudly say “foul” to let the other players know and pause the game. [19] X Research source Players can contest fouls that are called on them if they believe they didn’t commit one. Players stay in place until the foul is resolved. The result of a foul depends on who called it and if it’s disputed by another player. Usually, fouls result in a redo of the play or getting the disc where it would have been caught.

The type of throw you use usually depends on where other players are located and getting past the marker. The most common throws are: [25] X Research source Backhand Place your thumb on top of the disc and curl your 4 fingers underneath. Twist your body and keep the disc level when you release it. Use this during pulls or passing at any distance. Forehand Hook 2 fingers under the disc’s rim and place your thumb on top. Snap your arm forward and flick the disc like you’re skipping a rock. Use it when the marker is defending really close or for passing at any distance. Hammer Put 2 fingers around the disc’s rim and pinch the top with your thumb. Hold the disc vertically and slightly tilted to the left to throw it over your head. Use it for medium-distance passes when you’re heavily defended. Scoober Hold the disc upside-down so 2 fingers hook around the rim and your thumb is on top. Turn your back so it faces where you want to throw. Hold the disc at a 45-degree angle and toss it upward. Use it for short-range passes when you’re close to the endzone."

      "content": "What are the different ultimate frisbee positions? While there aren’t any official positions in ultimate frisbee, some offense and defense players can take on different roles. The common positions are: [26] X Research source Offense Handlers: Handlers usually have the best throwing and catching skills so they’re in charge of moving the disc down the field. Cutters: Cutters play downfield and are responsible for positioning themselves well for catches. Defense The Cup: 1 marker and 2 other players who stay near the thrower to prevent passes. Short Deep: The short deep stays near the middle of the field so they’re able to field plays and be in a good position for a turnover. Deep Deep: The deep deep stays near the endzone to intercept or block potential goals. Wings: Players guarding along the sidelines."

When you’re on the field, keep an eye on what other players are doing so you can adapt your strategy. [27] X Research source Defensive strategies Stand on one side of the thrower to force them to throw in the other direction. Follow the person you’re guarding to prevent them from catching the disc. Offensive strategies Make hard cuts to run into an open position for a catch. Use short passes to a nearby player when you’re running out of throw time.

With fewer players, you also play on a smaller field and for a shorter amount of time. The main changes are: [28] X Research source Use a field that’s 53 by 25 yards (48 m × 23 m) and has 8 yd (7.3 m) endzones. Throwers have 7 seconds to throw the disc after they catch it. Teams have 1 timeout for the game. Games are played as a best of 3. The first 2 games are 20 minutes each, and the last game is 10 minutes long."

If the offense calls the foul before a throw or if the foul causes an incomplete pass, the thrower gets the disc back. If the disc is in the air, the game continues if it’s caught. If it’s an incomplete pass not affected by the foul, then it’s a turnover. If the defense calls the foul, the game continues unless the foul affected the play.
