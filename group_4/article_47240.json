The Space Marines, also known as Adeptus Astartes, are one of the most well-known and popular factions of Warhammer 40k . They are warrior-monks who wear mechanised armor and have modified genomes that give them superhuman strength and endurance. They are also sometimes called the Angels of Death. [1] X Research source Strengths: good at both shooting and melee (making them effective in all rounds of the game), have strong basic stats and armor (making them difficult to kill), have varied playstyle Weaknesses: often targeted by enemies to weaken your forces, long list of options for list design and unit choices (making it difficult to narrow down what you want to play), aura reliant (making it difficult to spread characters across the board) Gameplay: Space Marine vehicles and dreadnoughts are incredibly tough and have lots of fire power. Maximizing these allows you to shoot harder than your opponent and survive their return fire. Space Marine troops also punch and shoot effectively against almost any target."

[5] X Research source Strengths: Unique combinations of models and rules in Kill Teams, super specialization, solid alien-killing technology Weaknesses: Low model count, narrow focus, reliance on Kill Teams Gameplay: Use Mission Tactics to choose your Combat Doctrines in any order rather than following the Space Marines codex. Reroll hit rolls of 1 for melee attacks against certain enemy units, like Tyranids, Aeldari, Orks, Necrons, and the T’au Empire. Use Kill Teams to deal damage, double up on Stratagem usage, and ride in transports and interact with terrain like Infantry."
