      "content": "Use “that’s fine” to accept or agree with a suggestion. When someone makes a suggestion or asks you if something is acceptable, use “that’s fine” to let them know you agree. In some cases, it’s the answer a person gives to say “yes” when someone is asking permission. [2] X Research source When you use the term in a positive way, keep your tone upbeat and your body language relaxed and open. Smile, make eye contact, and nod to show the person you genuinely agree. “Dinner at 7pm?” “That’s fine! I’m looking forward to it.” “Would you like to meet in the lobby?” “That’s fine. I’ll see you there!” “Should we get the blue curtains?” “That’s fine. I like that color, too.”"

      "content": "Use “that’s fine” to mean you don’t agree, but you’ll go along with it. Try using “that’s fine” if you’re not completely happy with a situation but are willing to accept it or move forward to avoid conflict. In these cases, use a more neutral tone and body language to communicate that you aren’t excited about the situation but are willing to compromise. This might mean a polite tone of voice and nodding without smiling or frowning. “Oh…that’s fine. We can do it the way you suggested.” “That’s fine. I guess we can reschedule next week when you’re back.” “That’s fine. I’ll just print new documents.”"

      "content": "Say “that’s fine” when you don’t care one way or the other. When you genuinely don’t have a preference or don’t care about the outcome, use “that’s fine” in a neutral or casual tone. You don’t necessarily need to nod or even make strong eye contact. However, if you don’t make any eye contact at all, your answer might come off as dismissive or rude. “That’s fine. Either restaurant works for me.” “That’s fine. Whatever time works best for you.” “That’s fine if that’s what you want. I don’t have a preference either way.”"

      "content": "Respond by confirming what they’re agreeing to. When someone answers you with “that’s fine,” it technically doesn’t require a response. However, it’s polite to confirm the plans with them. This makes sure that everyone is on the same page about taking the next steps. Just remember to keep your response clear and upbeat to keep a positive vibe. When someone says, “that’s fine,” say something like: “Great! I’ll send you a calendar invite for next Tuesday at 11 AM.” “Perfect! I’ll see you at the movie theater tonight at 7 PM.” “Awesome! I’ll make dinner reservations for 6:30 PM on Thursday.”"

If someone says, “that’s fine” but their tone of voice sounds sad or even angry, try checking in with them to see if they really are okay with the plans. This shows consideration for their feelings and gives them a chance to express any concerns. When you speak, keep your tone calm and light to encourage them to share their thoughts. “Are you sure it’s okay? We can look into other options if you like.” “You don’t seem completely happy with this. Would you like to talk about doing something different?” “I feel like something is bothering you. Would you like to talk about it before we make a final decision?”"

      "content": "“That’s fine” is a polite phrase to use for agreement. While “that’s fine” is generally considered to be polite, it ultimately depends on the context or tone of voice you use. Because it’s a casual expression, try using a more formal phrase in professional settings, like at work or a work event.
