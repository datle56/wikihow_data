      "content": "Use a rectal, bladder, or mouth thermometer to check the person’s body temperature. The person’s body temperature is one of the most accurate ways to determine the severity of her condition. [2] X Research source A person with mild hypothermia will have a body temperature of 90°F to 95°F or 32°C to 35°C. A person with moderate hypothermia will have a body temperature of 82°F to 90°F or 28°C to 32°C. A person with severe hypothermia will have a body temperature below 82°F or 28°C. Often, a caregiver will notice if a person is suffering from symptoms of hypothermia, as the condition can cause poor judgement, confusion, and changes in behavior in the person. The affected person may not realize they have hypothermia and will need to be checked to confirm their condition."

These are all signs of severe hypothermia. Someone with severe hypothermia may appear to be dead, but it’s important to call emergency services right away to determine if they are in a state of hypothermia and can still be treated. This is a life-threatening situation. Medical treatment can still be used to resuscitate people with severe hypothermia, though it is not always successful."

Place the heel of one hand over the center of their chest. Put your other hand over the first and interlace your fingers. Keep your elbows straight and align your shoulders over your hands. Begin compressions. Push down on the center of their chest as hard as possible. Pump at least 30 times, hard and fast. Do this to the rate of at least 100/minutes. You can pump to the beat of the disco hit “Stayin’ Alive” to maintain a steady rhythm. Allow the person’s chest to rise fully after every pump. Tilt the person’s head back and lift their chin. Pinch their nose and cover their mouth with yours. Blow until you see their chest rise. Give two breaths. Each breath should take one second. CPR is to be continued for a prolonged period. There have been reports of younger patients with severe hypothermia surviving an hour of CPR. If there is another person present, try switching off performing CPR so you don't become exhausted."

Once the person arrives at the hospital, speak to the doctor about possible treatment options, especially if the hypothermia is severe. Cardiopulmonary bypass is when blood is withdrawn from the body, warmed up, and then returned to the body. This is also known as extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). [22] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This technique is only available at major hospitals that have specialist emergency services or units that regularly perform heart surgery. A person with severe hypothermia often stands a better chance of surviving if she is taken directly to one of these hospitals, even if it means bypassing a smaller hospital along the way. Alternatives to cardiopulmonary bypass include warmed iv fluids, chest tubes with warm irrigation, and/or warmed hemodialysis."
