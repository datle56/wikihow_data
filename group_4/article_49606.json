      "title": "Learn about your topic.",
      "content": "Learn about your topic. It is important to know as much as you can about the topic you'll be speaking on. If you aren't already well-versed in the subject (e.g. because it has been assigned to you), do some research and learn as much as you can. Especially if your topic is a controversial one, it's a good idea to know the arguments on all sides of the issue. [1] X Research source Whatever argument you are making, you'll be more persuasive if you can address the views of the opposing side. Spend some time reading books or articles about your topic. You can go to the library and ask a librarian for help finding books, or just go online and find some articles. Make sure to use reliable sources, like major news organizations, or academic books or articles. Opinion-oriented sources, like editorials, talk radio, or partisan cable news, can be valuable for finding out what other people think about your topic. But, don't rely on them as your only source of information. They can be very biased. If you use them at all, make sure to read a variety of viewpoints on the matter, not just one side."

    {
      "title": "Know your goal.",
      "content": "Know your goal. It's important to understand exactly what it is you are trying to achieve with your speech. This way, you can tailor your content to fit your goals. [2] X Research source For example, if your topic is recycling, it's important to know a lot about recycling. But, your speech will need to reflect exactly what you hope the audience will do. Are you trying to get people to vote in favor of a citywide recycling program? Or are you trying to convince them to sort out their glass and cans and put them in a separate bin? These will be different speeches, so having the goal spelled out early will help you craft your message."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understand your audience.",
      "content": "Understand your audience. It is also important to understand your audience and their views and knowledge about the topic. This will also influence the content of your speech. [3] X Research source An audience that knows little about your topic will need more background information and simpler language. An audience made up of experts on the topic would likely find such a simple speech boring. Likewise, an audience that already supports your view on a topic will be easier to persuade to take some action. You won't need to convince them you are right, but only that they need to do something. By contrast, an audience that does not agree with you will need persuasion to even consider your point of view. For example, imagine you want to convince your audience to support a city-wide recycling program. If they already think recycling is important, you only need to convince them of the value of this specific program. But, if they don't care about recycling or oppose it, you will need to first convince them that recycling is worthwhile."

    {
      "title": "Choose the right persuasive approach.",
      "content": "Choose the right persuasive approach. Depending on your topic and your audience, there are several ways you might try to convince people of your point of view. Since the days of ancient Greece, speakers have relied on three main persuasive approaches. [4] X Research source Ethos. These are appeals to the audience's ethics or morals. For example: \"Recycling is the right thing to do. Wasting our limited resources steals from future generations, which is immoral.\" Pathos. These are appeals to the audience's emotions. For example: \"Think of the animals that lose their homes every day because of trees being chopped down. If we recycled more, we could save these beautiful forests.\" Logos. These are appeals to the audiences logic or intellect. For example: \"We know that there is a limited supply of natural resources. We can make this supply last longer by recycling.\" You can rely on any one or some combination."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline your main points.",
      "content": "Outline your main points. Once you've chosen the best persuasive approach for your audience, brainstorm the main points you'll make during the speech. [5] X Research source The number of points you can make to support your position will be determined by how much time you have to speak. As a rule of thumb, three to four supporting points is usually a good number. For example, in the speech about recycling, your three main points might be: 1. Recycling saves resources, 2. Recycling reduces the amount of garbage, and 3. Recycling is cost-effective."

    {
      "title": "Write a strong opening.",
      "content": "Write a strong opening. Before you can begin persuading your audience, you need to open the speech in a way that will make them want to pay attention. A strong opening has five main elements: [6] X Research source An attention grabber. This could be a statement (or sometimes a visual) that gets your audience's attention. It can be a good idea to be a little startling or dramatic at the opening of your speech. For example, you might start with information (or pictures) showing how a nearby landfill is nearly full to capacity. A link to the audience. This is a means of showing that you have something in common with the audience. Show that you have a similar background or share an emotional connection of some kind. This will really depend on knowing your audience. For example, if you are a parent, speaking to other parents, you might emphasize the concern for your own children's future. If you share a common interest or ideological position with your audience, you can emphasize that. Your credentials. This is a means of showing that you are knowledgeable or an authority on the topic of the speech. Highlight the research you've done on your topic. If you have any personal or professional experience with the topic, be sure to emphasize that, too. In the recycling example, you might say \"I've invested many hours studying the recycling issue and the types of programs available in other cities.\" Your goal. Explain to the audience what you hope the speech will accomplish. For example: \"I hope by the end of my talk that you will agree that we need a city wide recycling program.\" A road map. Finally, tell the audience what the main points of the speech will be. For example, \"I believe we must start a recycling program for these three reasons....\""

    {
      "title": "Offer persuasive evidence.",
      "content": "Offer persuasive evidence. The main body of your speech should contain the points you outlined in Part 1. It should provide the audience with several convincing reasons to support your viewpoint. Arrange these points logically. Don't jump from one point to the next, and then back again. Instead, complete an argument, then move on to another that flows logically from it. [7] X Research source Use credible sources from your research to back the points you are making. Even if your point is more emotional (pathos), introducing some factual information will make your argument stronger. For example \"Each year, 40,000 acres of beautiful forests are destroyed to make paper, according to a study from the American Recycling Institute.\" Use real life examples that the audience can relate to. Even an argument based on facts and logic (logos) should relate to the audience's lives and interests. For example: \"In these hard economic times, I know many of you are afraid that a recycling program will mean a costly increase in taxes. But, the city of Springfield started a program like this one three years ago. So far they've seen an increase in revenue as a result of the program. Many residents have seen a decrease in their taxes as a result.\""

    {
      "title": "Address the counter-argument.",
      "content": "Address the counter-argument. Although it is not strictly necessary, your argument may be stronger if one or more of your supporting points addresses the views of the opposing side. This gives you a chance to address your audience's possible objections and make your argument stronger. Make sure that you describe opposing views fairly and objectively. Consider whether someone who actually holds that view would approve of the way you are describing their position. If you aren't sure, find someone who thinks that way and ask! For example, you would not want to say: \"opponents of recycling just don't care if we waste our precious resources, or our money.\" That's not a fair description of their opinion. Instead, you might say: \"opponents of recycling are concerned that the cost might be much higher than just using new materials,\" and then go on to offer an argument about why recycling might be the more cost-effective option."
    },
    {
      "title": "Conclude with a call to action.",
      "content": "Conclude with a call to action. The conclusion of your speech should remind your audience of what you have told them. It should also make it clear exactly what you hope they will do next. [8] X Research source Don't just restate, verbatim, what you've already said. Instead, use this as an opportunity to reinforce the way your main points support your call to action. For example: \"To sum up, I've shown you (points a, b, and c). These three undeniable facts point to a city-wide recycling program as the most sensible and ethical step we can take in helping create a more sustainable future. Please, join me in voting 'yes' on this program in November.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice your speech.",
      "content": "Practice your speech. When it comes to making your speech work in real life, the most important thing you can do is practice, as much as you can. Try practicing in front of a mirror, so that you can see how you are delivering the speech. This can help you notice your facial expressions and body language. These can help or hinder your ability to get your message across. For example, you might notice you are slouching, or that that you fidget with your collar. These actions suggest to an audience that you aren't confident. Better still, record yourself with a video camera and watch the tape afterwards. This can help you see (and hear) where your delivery needs improvement. It has the benefit of providing audio, and also won't distract you as much as a mirror when you're speaking. Once you've practiced on your own a few times, try giving the speech to a small group of friends or family members. Ask for their feedback on your message and delivery."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress appropriately.",
      "content": "Dress appropriately. On the day of the speech, dress appropriately for the venue and audience you'll be speaking to. Generally speaking, this will mean dressing professionally. But, the degree of formality will vary. A speech to a film club to convince them to show your film won't require the same degree of formality as speaking to the executives of a movie distribution company. For the executives, you would want to wear a suit. For the film club, that might be overdoing it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Relax.",
      "content": "Relax. Many people find public speaking intimidating, but try to relax and be yourself as you give your speech. [9] X Research source Be friendly and make eye contact with the audience. Move around, where appropriate, but don't fidget or pick at your clothes or hair. Don't read the speech. It's okay to use a few notes to keep yourself on track, but your speech should be mostly memorized. Roll with the punches. If you make a mistake, don't let it derail your whole speech. This might be an opportunity to use a little humor. Then, move on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Involve your audience.",
      "content": "Involve your audience. If there is something specific you'd like your audience to do, provide them with any resources you can to make it easier. It is difficult to motivate people to take action, but if you make it simple, they will be more likely to follow through. [10] X Research source For example, if you want them to contact the mayor, demanding a recycling program, don't just ask them to do it. Give them stamped, addressed envelopes to send a letter, or cards with the mayor's phone number and email address. If you do this, many more people are likely to follow through."
