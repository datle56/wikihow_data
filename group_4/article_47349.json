Try to find a shady location without direct sunlight to work as efficiently as possible.

Washing your car on concrete or asphalt forces your soapy water to run into storm drains, which can degrade your local water quality. [2] X Research source"

This includes the car wash soap that you will use for cleaning, a hose, 3 buckets (2 for washing, 1 for rinsing), sponges or mitts , and microfiber towels to dry your car. Get a stiff brush to scrub your tires and rims, and keep it separate from the rest of your supplies. [3] X Research source Be prepared to get wet and soapy!

      "content": "Fill 2 buckets with soapy water. The first 2 buckets will be your washing buckets: 1 for the body of your car, and 1 for the wheels. Grab your car wash soap and read the dilution instructions on the bottle, then fill a bucket with hose water and add in the soap. [4] X Research source Most car wash soaps will instruct you to mix 20 parts water with 1 part soap. However, different soaps may have different directions, so check your bottle before pouring. Some sites may tell you that using dish soap on your car is okay. However, dish soap can degrade your car’s finish or strip the wax off. When in doubt, it’s best to use dedicated car wash soap."

      "content": "Hose off the car to loosen and soften the dirt. Start from the top of the car and work your way downward, spraying every nook and cranny. Don’t use a strong jet of water, since this could scratch your car. Aim the water downwards so any dirt and grime runs off your vehicle. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your wheels with a stiff brush.",
      "content": "Wash your wheels with a stiff brush. Since your wheels are probably the dirtiest part of your car, it’s a good idea to tackle those first. Dip your stiff brush into 1 bucket of soapy water, then use the brush to clean the rims and tires. [7] X Research source Once you’ve scrubbed up your wheels, rinse them off with the hose. Remember, separate your bucket of soapy water that you use for the wheels, and don’t reuse it on the body of your car. Your wheels likely have small rocks or dirt chunks in them, and using the same soapy water on the body of your car could scratch your paint."

Grab your car wash mitt or sponge and put it into the bucket of soapy water that you haven’t touched yet. Get it nice and sudsy to clean your car quickly and effectively. [8] X Research source As you wash your car, dip your mitt or sponge back into the soapy water every couple of minutes. Mitts, unlike sponges, can also be washed in washing machines to remove all the grit. However, you can choose whichever works best for you."

Start on the roof of your car, rubbing your mitt or sponge in circular motions. Circle around your car several times, washing lower areas each round. [9] X Research source As you reach the lower parts of the car, be sure to focus on the crevices underneath the doors and the wheel wells. These parts of your car are usually pretty dirty, and they tend to trap dirt and grime."

After 1 pass over your car or after you scrub a particularly dirty spot, dip your mitt or sponge into the clean water to remove large objects.

[11] X Research source After you rinse, check your car again for any missed spots or bird droppings.
