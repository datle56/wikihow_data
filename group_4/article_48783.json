      "content": "You’ve used that side of your body more. This is the leading reason for one armpit smelling worse than the other. No one uses each side of their body the same way every day. You could be sweating more on one side than another, and that’s completely normal! For example, carrying something heavy in one arm or leaning against one arm for extended periods could cause one pit to sweat more. Stop armpit sweating by switching things up by using each arm equally. Maybe you swap which arm you hold your bag in or lean against your other arm."
