To help reduce frizz and add shine, find a shampoo and conditioner pair that is sulfate-free and made for curly hair. Check the label and make sure keratin is a top ingredient.

      "content": "Avoid brushing your hair. If you want to tame curly hair, don't brush it. This may seem like the opposite thing to do when trying to eliminate frizz, but it really works. When you brush naturally curly hair, the brush is essentially splitting apart those curls and turning them into individual hair strands, which can result in exaggerated volume. If you take a shower, then let your hair air dry without brushing it, those curls will stay compact and less frizzy."

Humectants can be helpful in keeping hair moisturized as well. A high dew point is anything over 60+ degrees. You may want to avoid using a leave-in conditioner. Stick to firm hold products like pomades to keep your hair manageable. You also may want to avoid humectants as there is lots of moisture in the air."
