      "content": "Keep headbands in color-coordinated containers to easily pick 1 out. If you have a collection of different colored headbands, using individual containers is a great way to keep them sorted and organized. Designate a container for each major color in your collection, and place your headbands into the correct one. Then, line the containers up one by one in a drawer, on a shelf, or in a cabinet for easy access. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Decorate an empty container to easily display your headbands.",
      "content": "Decorate an empty container to easily display your headbands. Choose an empty iced tea, hot chocolate, or oatmeal container, for instance. Clean out the container with a damp cloth or wipe, and cut a piece of fabric 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) larger than the size of the container. Wrap the container in the fabric, and secure it using several dabs of hot glue. Then, arrange your elastic, plastic, or metal headbands around the container. [4] X Research source Decorate your container with pieces of ribbon along the top and bottom if you’d like. Do this before you add the headbands so you can easily hang them over top. This adds a cute, personal touch to your organizer. To store the container in a drawer, use a tension rod. Cut a small “X” in either side of the container, and insert a tension rod through both sides. Adjust the tension rod to fit the inside of your drawer. [5] X Research source To store the container on a dresser, consider attaching it to a candle stand. Cover the top of the candle holder in hot glue, and secure it to the bottom of your container. While this is not required, it adds an attractive, decorative touch to your organizer."

After the wood is dry, apply 1-3 dabs of glue on the back of a clothespin, and arrange 6 clothespins across the wood. Space the clothespins out evenly as you do this. Then, hammer 1 hanging bracket into place on the back of the wood. Hang up the decoration, and clip your headbands with the clothespins. [7] X Research source To hang the wood, drive a nail into the wall, and place the board onto the nail. Use this to store elastic, plastic, and metal headbands."

      "content": "Bundle your formal headbands to use them when needed. Formal headbands come in elastic, plastic, or metal material, and they are often worn to dressy events.
