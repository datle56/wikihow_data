Mewing is a beauty trend that involves placing your tongue on the roof of your mouth against your teeth and swallowing, with the goal of making your jawline pop out by tightening the skin on your chin.

      "content": "Mewing originated in the 1970s as a jawline exercise. The term was coined by online users in 2018 in honor of Dr. John Mew, who founded this method of jawline exercise. He advised retraining your tongue to sit at the roof of your mouth in order to accentuate your jawline. His son, Michael Mew, helped him promote the practice. [2] X Research source Mewing doesn’t actually correct jaw issues, and it can be harmful if done too much. Dr. John Mew lost his dental license in 2019, although he still practices as an orthodontist. It's also theorized the word \"mewing\" may have originated from a cat's mew, as kittens make a similar movement with their tongue to mew."

      "content": "People mew in the hopes of attaining a sharper jawline. Though the practice has been around for decades, the term began trending as a way to strengthen your jawline on TikTok in 2023. People who mew may see mewing as an alternative to using filters or getting surgery. Even though mewing as an exercise is popular, the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) says that it doesn’t work, and in some cases can lead to undesired outcomes. [3] X Research source According to the AAO, mewing can disrupt the alignment of your teeth and worse bite problems and speech issues. If the damage is bad enough, mewing can result in the need for complex, complicated treatment."

      "content": "Some teens jokingly mew when they don’t want to answer a question. If asked a question they aren’t fond of, teens may purse their lips together and hold a finger to them, as if to say, \"Shh, I'm busy working on my jawline.\" Then, they may run their finger up and down their jawline to show off the results of their mewing. They don’t do this in seriousness, though. For instance, in a TikTok post by user @ashleyz360, she jokingly mews in response to the question \"Why don’t you guys talk in class?” Some adults find mewing to be disrespectful, specifically in a classroom, as it can disrupt learning and make it harder for teachers to teach.

      "content": "No, mewing doesn’t actually work. Although it may make your jawline pop, mewing won't restructure your jaw. It is mainly used to temporarily help your jaw pop out. If you want to permanently make your jawline sharper and more defined , the most effective method is cosmetic surgery. If your jaw is misaligned, surgery, tooth repair or removal, and orthodontics is the best way to correct it. [5] X Research source You can also practice jaw exercises like chin lifts and frequent smiling."

You can end up disrupting the alignment of your teeth, worsening existing bite problems, and worsening any speech issues you may have. Excessive mewing can even cause you to have trouble processing your food. [6] X Research source"

If you’re older than the person you’re mewing at, this might get a laugh out of them. Since the slang is mainly common among young people, it’ll come off as hilariously jarring to see their teacher or parent mewing. If you don’t want to put your tongue to the roof of your mouth, simply pucker your lips and put your finger to them in a \"Shhh\" motion. Then, run your finger up and down your jaw."

This will let them know that you aren’t kidding around. Explain that it doesn’t feel good to be ignored or shushed so they understand where you’re coming from. If they still don’t respond, try asking them why they won’t answer the question. Try to avoid arguing with them, as that can lead to power struggles and make the situation bigger than it needs to be.
