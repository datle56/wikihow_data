      "content": "Select a variety. The first thing to do when selecting a good peach to grow is to look at what varieties have the characteristics you want. This can include the taste of the peach, as well as characteristics like type of skin and fruit size. Just keep in mind that each variety has its strengths and weaknesses while growing. [1] X Trustworthy Source Virginia Cooperation Extension Publications and Educational resources from Virginia Tech and Virginia State University Go to source The most common variety is the 'Redhaven.' Try to use a locally grown variety so you know the tree will be able to survive in your climate. When you're choosing a variety, keep in mind that a seed taken from a peach won't produce fruit with identical characteristics to the original peach."

In the United States growing regions are broken up by the USDA into zones (this differs in other countries). Peaches typically grow in zones 5, 6, 7, and 8. You can also grow some varieties in zones 4, 9, and 10. Each zone has a variety the does particularly well: [2] X Research source Zone 4 - Hale Zone 5 - Madison Zone 6 - Saturn Zone 7 - Contender Zone 8 - Frost Zone 9 - Topaz Zone 10 - Florida Beauty"

      "content": "Remove all flesh from the pit. Once you select a type of peach, you need to separate the pit from the rest of the peach. You are off to a good start if you eat away the peach around the pit. Next, take a brush or rag and scrub off any remaining fruit. This will give you a nice, clean pit to start with."

      "content": "Peel away the outer layer, if possible. You can save yourself time and make the growing process easier if you remove the entire pit. The pit is the hard outer layer that protects the seed within it. Sometimes the pit will be split and you can separate it without damaging the seed. If the pit isn't separated or you think you'll damage the seed trying to remove it, just leave the pit in place. [4] X Research source You can use a knife or other slim object to pry the pit apart where it has begun separating. Handle the seeds with caution. They contain cyanide, which is toxic to humans and animals when ingested. Wear gloves and wash your hands when handling the seeds, and keep them away from children and pets."

      "content": "Keep the pits cold. Stratification is the process of chilling the pit so that it will begin germinating . This process mimics the winter months and signals to the seed when to grow. To stratify the pits, wrap them in a damp paper towel and place them in the cold for 8 weeks. You can do this outside if you live in a cold climate, or you can store them in your refrigerator for 8 weeks.

Gradually increase the time that they spend outside to allow them to develop a resistance to the effects of weather and pests. Start by placing them outside for one hour per day, and increase each day until they are staying outside all day.
