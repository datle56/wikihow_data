You may even feel shaking with no warning! Regardless, remember that earthquake early warnings give you limited time and do not predict earthquakes. You may get a warning anywhere from a few seconds to up to a minute before an earthquake hits."

      "content": "Get away from glass, large furniture, and other hazards, if possible. In the first few seconds after the shaking starts, try to quickly move away from anything that could fall and injure you. Get low and walk or crawl away from hazards such as windows, cabinets, televisions, and bookcases. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you're in a crowded public place, such as a store, do not rush toward the exits, even if you see lots of people doing so. Get away from display racks, glass, and exterior walls, and find a covered spot to take shelter. Remember the phrase “Drop, Cover, Hold on,” which is the course of action recommended by U.S. and international emergency management organizations. Fire alarms may sound as earthquakes can mess with fire alarm systems, but it is best to stay where you are and wait until the shaking stops."

Get down on your hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table until the shaking stops. [2] X Research source If you're in bed during an earthquake, stay there. Brace yourself, and protect your head and neck with a pillow. If you can't get under a sturdy table or desk, take cover in an interior corner of the building. Don't stand in a doorway. This was recommended in the past, but you're safer under a sturdy table or crouched in a corner. A doorway doesn't offer much protection from falling or flying objects, which cause the most earthquake-related injuries and deaths.

[6] X Research source In a strong earthquake, remember to cover your mouth to avoid inhaling dust, especially if you have a history of any respiratory diseases. If you're trapped, don't shout, as you'd risk inhaling dust.

[7] X Trustworthy Source Federal Emergency Management Agency Federal agency responsible for coordinating responses to disasters and states of emergency Go to source If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the main valve outside and call the gas company. Note that a professional will be needed to restore service. Look for signs of electrical damage, including sparks, broken or frayed wires, and burning smells. If possible, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you'd have to step in water to access the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician instead of approaching it yourself. Put out any small fires with a fire extinguisher. If there's a larger fire, call emergency services. Evacuate immediately if there's a fire and you smell gas. Don't drink water from the sink, bathe, or use the toilet until your local authorities have advised that it's safe to do so. Plug the drains in sinks and bathtubs to prevent sewage backflow."
