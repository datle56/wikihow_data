      "content": "Yes, it’s legal but there are some limitations. Drones are allowed to fly during daylight in uncontrolled airspace below 400 feet (120 m). They must not exceed a speed of 100 miles (160 km) per hour. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has exclusive regulation over all navigable airspace, meaning that, so long as the drones are abiding by the rules for either recreational or commercial use, it’s legal for them to fly over your home. [1] X Trustworthy Source Federal Aviation Administration U.S. government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation Go to source If a drone is flying over your property and taking pictures and videos of you without your consent, then it is violating the FAA’s privacy guidelines. However, you would need to be able to provide evidence that a drone is taking footage of you in order to prove that it has violated the FAA guidelines, and this is incredibly difficult to obtain. [2] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source There are some restrictions about where drones can fly, including stadiums and sporting events, airports, government-secured airspaces, and the greater Washington, D.C. area.

      "content": "Unfortunately, it’s currently illegal to take down a drone flying above your property. Because drones are privately-owned property flying in government-regulated airspace, they are federally protected from criminal destruction of all forms, even if they are flying above your home. [4] X Research source Interfering with drones that are following FAA rules and regulations by shooting them down or by any other method carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison. Not only is it illegal to remove a drone from FAA-regulated airspace, but you may be responsible for paying for any damages done to the UAS in any attempt to remove it wilfully. If the drone is operated in a reckless or careless manner or causes injury to property or a person, contact local law enforcement. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use signs to mark your property as a drone-free area. You can make or order your own signs that indicate you don’t want drones to fly in the airspace above your property. Hopefully, drone pilots will see and heed your warning signs. When making or ordering signs be careful not to claim that your property is a “no drone zone” as that is inaccurate to the FAA UAS regulations. You can be reported and asked to remove the signage.

Because drone pilots have to be within sight distance of their drone, you should be able to spot them in the area. [9] X Trustworthy Source Federal Aviation Administration U.S. government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation Go to source Politely request that the person does not fly the drone over your property. Unfortunately, a drone pilot does not legally have to comply with your request. Asking nicely definitely increases your chances that they’ll be persuaded to avoid your property in the future, though!"
