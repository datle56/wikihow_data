Back then you were carefree and happy to get up and begin all the fun activities the day held in store. It's harder to get out of bed when you aren't looking forward to going to work or school, but if you focus on the good things that will happen that day, you'll be able to wake yourself up faster. So, always look forward for a bright day. Try it tomorrow: as soon as you wake up, think about the best thing about the day, and let your heart race a bit in anticipation. This is easy to do on your birthday and fun holidays, but you'll have to get creative to wake up with a smile on rainy gray Mondays. Even if you don't have a big event to anticipate, think about the little things that make you happy on a daily basis: walking your dog. Drinking that first cup of coffee. An alternative to coffee is chocolate, (flavonoids) especially 70% cocoa and darker, but if eaten too late in the day sleep deprivation may occur. Talking on the phone with your best friend after a hard day's work. Getting your favorite takeout on the way home. Whatever it is, think about it first thing when you wake up."

When the sun streams through your windows in the morning, your brain naturally knows it's time to start moving. But if you have blackout curtains and don't get decent light in the AM, you're going to feel groggy until you go outside. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If you have thick curtains to block out lights from the street, try getting shades in neutral colors that effectively block most artificial light, but still let your room brighten up when the sun rises. You may also try waking up early and actually watching the sun rise. This gives you some time alone in the morning before the pressures of the day start. Watch the sun rise from your window, or take a walk outside early to clear your head."

      "content": "Drink a big glass of water. Going 8 hours without drinking water (while you're asleep) is enough time for your body to get a little dehydrated, which can make you feel sleepy. Wake up to a big glass of cool water to start your day off right. You'll feel more alert within minutes. [3] X Research source If you want to be able to drink water while you're still in bed, fill up a small thermos with ice the night before and keep it on your bedside table. In the morning the ice will be mostly melted and you'll have a cup of cool water ready to drink. Drink water before you grab coffee or tea. Wash your face with cool water, too. It helps lower your body temperature, lifting you out of your warm, sleepy state."

Brushing your teeth with peppermint toothpaste first thing is a great way to perk up. Do it before you have anything to eat, since brushing immediately after eating isn't very good for your teeth. Although some studies support the use of peppermint, more research needs to be done to determine its efficacy. If you don't like peppermint toothpaste, keep a bottle of peppermint essential oil or a few peppermints on hand and inhale the scent deeply. This will have exactly the same effect as using peppermint toothpaste."
