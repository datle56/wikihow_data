      "content": "Sunburns can turn into tans if taken care of properly, but not always. Even when you tan, your skin is being damaged. When the sun’s UV rays hit your skin, they damage the top layer of skin, and your body releases melanin, the pigment that makes your skin appear darker. [1] X Research source Sunburn occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough melanin fast enough, causing it to get red, inflamed, and flakey. For some, recovering from sunburn can ultimately lead to a golden complexion, but that isn’t always the case. Those with lighter skin often burn faster than those with darker skin and have trouble going from a red burn to a golden tan. Melanin acts as a protective layer between the sun and the skin. Although someone may not burn as easily, it doesn’t mean they’re not damaging their skin. [2] X Research source Recover from sunburn quickly by cooling, treating, and moisturizing the skin. While a tan after sunburn isn’t guaranteed, following these steps may improve your chances."
