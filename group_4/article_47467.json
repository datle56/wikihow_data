      "title": "Emojis mean he’s trying to be playful and flirty.",
      "content": "Emojis mean he’s trying to be playful and flirty. It’s true that deciphering emojis can be like trying to read a foreign language sometimes, but if he’s using tons of emojis and dropping a smiley or 2 into every message, then he’s trying to keep things light and make sure you’re comfortable chatting. Why? Because he’s definitely interested. Don’t be afraid to sprinkle the emojis into your own texts. A well-placed 😘 emoji is the perfect flirty response."

      "title": "A double text shows enthusiasm, not desperation.",
      "content": "A double text shows enthusiasm, not desperation. It’s time to lay the double-text stigma to rest. Who needs a guy who doesn’t care enough to text you more than once in a row? Maybe he’s got a lot to say, or maybe he’s just making sure you got the message. Either way, it’s a great sign. [1] X Research source Take the pressure off him by double or even triple texting yourself. There’s nothing more fun than an enthusiastic convo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Putting away his phone means he’s prioritizing you.",
      "content": "Putting away his phone means he’s prioritizing you. A guy who can’t be bothered to be present and in the moment with you is not a guy who’s worth your time. But if the phone is off and away and it’s just the two of you together? That’s a green light right there. [2] X Research source Show him the same courtesy by putting your own phone away. You don’t need to turn it completely off, but out of sight and out of mind."
    },
    {
      "title": "He can’t hang this time, but he definitely wants to hang.",
      "content": "He can’t hang this time, but he definitely wants to hang. Don’t worry, there’s a million valid reasons he can’t make it, and most of them have nothing to do with you. But if he reschedules, then he definitely wants to spend time with you, and he wants you to know that. [3] X Research source Take him up on it! Make new plans ASAP to secure the date."
    },
    {
      "title": "A quick reply means he’s eager to talk to you.",
      "content": "A quick reply means he’s eager to talk to you. If you spot those 3 “Typing…” dots right after you sent that last text, then he’s taking full advantage of any opportunity to talk to you. And even if he doesn’t text right back, dont worry—he might just be busy (super valid) or away from his phone (also valid). He’ll get back to you! Keep the conversation going , and try not to take too long to text him back, as well"

    {
      "title": "He goes out of his way to hang out with you.",
      "content": "He goes out of his way to hang out with you. If he likes you, he’ll want to be around you whenever he can. If he’s carving time out of his calendar or even canceling plans to hang out with you, that’s definitely a good sign. If you like him, then make the same effort, and tell him how much you like spending time with him."
    },
    {
      "title": "A guy who’s into you will want to know more about you.",
      "content": "A guy who’s into you will want to know more about you. He asks you about your background, family, what you get up to in your free time, which TV shows you watch. Taking a genuine interest in your personal life might mean he’s interested in you as a romantic possibility, too. Ask him questions about his own interests, like his friends, family, books, music, etc."

      "title": "Showing initiative is always a good sign.",
      "content": "Showing initiative is always a good sign. You don’t have to wait for him to make the first move, because he’s already made it. A guy who likes you won’t ever keep you waiting for that “You up?” text, because he wants to talk to you as much as you want to talk to him. [4] X Research source Don’t keep him waiting if he texts first, and also be the one to send that first text of the day every now and then to show him you’re enthusiastic."

      "title": "An attentive and caring guy brings up small things you told him.",
      "content": "An attentive and caring guy brings up small things you told him. He remembers your coffee order, no sweat, or you'll be having a conversation and he’ll bring up a detail you might not even remember telling him. He doesn’t just want to know about you; he’s storing that info for the long run. [5] X Research source Jot down details about him after you talk, and offer the same gesture."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’d rather move the conversation past the texting phase.",
      "content": "He’d rather move the conversation past the texting phase. Talking over the phone just isn’t enough for him; he’s dying to take you out. Even if it’s just for coffee or to hang at the park, it’s a sign the two of you are on your way to romance. [6] X Research source Make plans to meet in a public area that you’re comfortable in, and let someone else know where you’re going. If the date turns out to be a drag, you’ll have an escape plan."

      "title": "Getting closer to you is positive body language.",
      "content": "Getting closer to you is positive body language. He’s not just making sure you can hear him. When a guy likes you, he wants to be physically close to you, and talking to you is the perfect opportunity to do just that. If you’re into him, don’t shy away! You might even lean in yourself to match his energy."

      "title": "There’s a reason he can’t take his eyes off you.",
      "content": "There’s a reason he can’t take his eyes off you. You catch him staring from across the room, and maybe he even quickly looks away, blushing. He likes what he sees, and he just can’t help himself. [7] X Research source Give him a nod or a little wave to let him know you see him, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s making sure you see him, and that you know he sees you.",
      "content": "He’s making sure you see him, and that you know he sees you. We all know how it feels to talk to a guy whose eyes are wandering—he’s spacey and not all that interested. But if he’s holding eye contact, especially holding it for a bit longer than he might usually, he’s probably trying to get you to notice him as much as you want him to notice you. Hold that eye contact! Let him know you’re comfortable, and then break it with a sly smile and a wink."

      "content": "He wants to be the first thing you think about each day. This one’s a no-brainer. A guy who sends you a text the first thing in morning is one who’s definitely smitten.

      "content": "Open communication shows he’s serious about you. Sure, he may not come right out and say, “I like you,” but a guy who’s open about his feelings and sensitive about yours is a guy who trusts you, and wants you to trust him, too.

      "content": "Consistently liking your posts is a sure sign of a crush. He doesn’t want to miss a single update, and he wants you to know that, too. And if he’s commenting on your posts, too, then there’s almost no question—you’ve got an admirer. [9] X Research source Drop a like on his posts, and definitely drop a like on his comments to let him know you’ve read them."

      "title": "A guy who’s into you will brighten up when you’re around.",
      "content": "A guy who’s into you will brighten up when you’re around. He just won’t be able to help himself. Take note of how he looks before he sees you, and then watch how wide he smiles when he does spot you. If he’s into you, you’re probably the highlight of his day, and it’ll show on his face.

      "content": "Giving advice is a sign of a close bond, and that he’s paying attention. It takes a close relationship and a good listener to offer advice.

      "title": "Using your name often in conversation is a subtle sign he likes you.",
      "content": "Using your name often in conversation is a subtle sign he likes you. It’s a little bit of psychology: we like to hear our own names said, and we also love to hear the names of the people we love. If he’s using your name a bit more than usual in conversations with you, it means he likes the sound of it, and just can’t help saying it over and over. [13] X Research source Two can play this game: drop his name here and there in conversation and watch his face as you say it. A slight smile or a blush is a sure sign that he liked hearing you say it."

      "title": "He’s letting you into his social circle to keep you around.",
      "content": "He’s letting you into his social circle to keep you around. It means he’s decided you’re cool enough to be a part of the gang. And if you’re part of the gang, it means he plans to spend more time with you. After all, if the 2 of you end up dating, then there’s no point in keeping you away from them. [14] X Research source Introduce him to your own friends if you think the 2 of you have a future together. As a bonus, your friends are sure to tell you if they think he’s good enough for you."

      "content": "If he says he likes you, believe it! Some guys play games and getting past the will-they-won’t-they stage is exhausting. Other guys get right down to the point, and we’re big fans of those guys. Do you like him? Let him know! Life is too short to dance around love, you know?"
