If the person has a blank stare, seems confused, or doesn’t know where they are, it could be a sign of a brain injury.

      "content": "Watch for nausea or vomiting. If someone vomits, especially repeatedly, after being hit in the head or involved in another type of accident, this usually indicates a concussion.

      "content": "Look for symptoms over the next several days or weeks. While some concussion symptoms show up immediately, some don’t appear until days or weeks afterwards. Even if the person seemed fine after the incident, they may begin to show signs of a concussion later on. The victim may exhibit signs such as slurred speech, confusion, nausea or vomiting, impaired balance or coordination, dizziness, blurred vision, or headache. These symptoms could indicate medical issues other than a concussion, so it’s important to have the person examined by a healthcare provider."
