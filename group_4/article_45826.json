      "content": "Press the F3 key on your keyboard once you’ve found your spot. This will show you the coordinates of your position in the game. Look for the X, Y, and Z coordinates. [1] X Research source You will be inputting these coordinates into the /fill command. You can also pull up your coordinates by pressing the FN and F3 keys at the same time."

      "title": "Go to one of the corners of the rectangle you plan to create using the /fill command.",
      "content": "Go to one of the corners of the rectangle you plan to create using the /fill command. This will be one of your “endpoints” in the command. Write down the coordinates of the block on which you are standing, as this is the first part of your rectangle."

      "title": "Go to the opposite corner of the rectangle you wish to create.",
      "content": "Go to the opposite corner of the rectangle you wish to create. For example, if you’re on standing at the bottom left corner, walk to the top right corner. You could also do this with a cube. For example, if you’re standing at the back top left corner, move to the front bottom right."

    {
      "title": "Begin typing the command.",
      "content": "Begin typing the command. First, type /fill into the chat. The forward slash is required to make the command work. Next, type the XYZ coordinates you wrote down previously. Next, type the XYZ coordinates of the block on which you are standing now. [2] X Research source You can also do /fill <first set of coordinates> ~ ~ ~ <block> to fill from the first set to where ever you are standing without manually inputting coordinates. <block> is a stand-in for what you’re going to do in the next step. Don’t type it in the command. Don’t submit the command yet either."

Go into your inventory and hover over the block you desire. Under the block's name, there should be something in gray text that says \"yourobject\". Replace \"yourobject\" with the ID of the block you wish to place. You can also type \"minecraft:\" and then hit tab until you see your block. You can type the first few letters of your block (like you would while searching for it in the creative inventory) and hit tab to narrow down the search."

These modifiers include: hollow: makes the inside of the rectangle hollow replace: replaces all blocks of one type in the area with another, ie /fill <set 1> <set 2> minecraft:diamond_block replace minecraft:clay destroy: not only replaces all blocks, but breaks them and turns them into items you can pick up as if they were mined. keep: fills air and leaves blocks inside the rectangle unaffected outline:outlines the blocks already placed with the block you choose"
