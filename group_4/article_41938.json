      "content": "Apply a palmful of mousse to damp hair. Get your hair wet first—it can be straight after a shower or with water from a spray bottle. Pat it dry with a towel so that it is no longer soaking wet. Next, use your fingers to apply some mousse to your hair. Choose a mousse that will give your hair some volume. This will help create that much-needed lift."

      "title": "Blow dry your hair while combing it forwards and up.",
      "content": "Blow dry your hair while combing it forwards and up. Brush the hair on top of your head forwards while blow drying it. Next, brush your hair across the top of your head, towards the left side of your head, and blow dry it some more. After that, brush it towards the right and continue blow drying it. Keep doing this until your hair is dry. [1] X Research source At the end of this, the hair on the top of your head should be sticking upwards. It won't resemble a full mohawk just yet, but that's because you're not quite done styling it. If the hair on the back and sides of your head is long enough to brush into style, blow dry it downwards."

      "title": "Distribute dry shampoo or volumizing mousse through your roots.",
      "content": "Distribute dry shampoo or volumizing mousse through your roots. Use your fingers to distribute the product through your hair, then gently comb your fingers upwards. Focus on your roots; if you put too much product on the ends of your hair, you’ll weigh it down instead and lose the ‘hawk. [2] X Research source You are only applying to product to the hair on the top of your head, not the back or sides."

      "content": "Sculpt your fauxhawk into shape with some pomade or wax. Use your fingers to scoop out a small amount of pomade or wax. Rub the product between your palms until it disappears and your hands feel sticky. Press your hands together to either side of the fauxhawk, sandwiching it between your palms. Run your hands upwards to help shape your fauxhawk. [3] X Research source This will pull your fauxhawk up into a tapering wedge shape. You can also style your fauxhawk with hair gel, which will hold your hair in place all day. [4] X Expert Source Nick Arrojo Master Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 September 2021."

      "content": "Set your style with hairspray, if desired. At this point, your hair is done. The products that you used in your hair earlier should be enough to keep it in place. If you'd like something a little stronger, however, lightly mist your fauxhawk with hairspray. [5] X Research source A light-hold hairspray is all you really need. Focus on the top and sides of your fauxhawk."

      "content": "Section off the front part of your hair and clip it out of the way. Use the handle of a rat-tail comb to create a section that spans the width of your forehead. It should be about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) thick, or the distance between your front hairline and the front of your ears. Twist the section into a bun or secure it with a clip.

[7] X Research source Pull the section firmly enough so that it is nice and smooth. If you need to, mist your hair with water to help keep the flyaways down."

      "title": "Pin the section at the back of your crown.",
      "content": "Pin the section at the back of your crown. This is just like pulling your hair back for a half-up ponytail. Pull the strand towards the back of your crown, just before the side of your head starts to curve into the back of your head. Secure the strand with a bobby pin. [8] X Research source If you have thick hair, you may need to use 2 bobby pins instead. Cross them so that they form an X. Use bobby pins that match your hair color, if possible."

Grab another 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) section of hair from your hairline, and pull it towards the back of your head. Pin it just below the first section of hair. Keep doing this until you reach your nape. [9] X Research source If you are twisting your hair, make sure that you are twisting it upwards for each strand. The last strand should be pinned right on the edge of your nape."

You will have a gap between the left and right sides of your head. This gap will be filled with un-pinned hair, which is what creates the fauxhawk. [10] X Research source Keep the fauxhawk consistent. Its starting width should span your forehead, then it should taper down to the span of your nape."

If you want to, however, you can insert bobby pins to the left and right sides so that it doesn’t cover your temples.

Once you are happy with your style, mist it with hairspray, focusing on the sides of your head. [12] X Research source If you are using a curling iron, be sure to apply some heat protectant first. The bobby pins should not be visible. If you need to, manipulate your hair so that it covers them. Mist your hair with more hairspray to keep it in place."

[14] X Research source You can twist the section into a rope braid or bun, as long as it is out of the way."

Pull it towards the back of your crown. [15] X Research source Try to pull your hair back as tightly as you can, like making a ponytail. You want the stands to be smooth.
