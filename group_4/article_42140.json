      "content": "Move to an area far from the fighting if you can. Unfortunately, your home may become unsafe in the event of a war or invasion. If your area is no longer safe, do your best to relocate and find another place to live. Where you end up settling depends on the progress of the war. Stay updated on the fighting so you can know which areas are safer. Try to find areas that aren’t near the main fighting. These could be rural areas or strategically unimportant towns. There may be designated civilian safe zones set up. Travel to one of these if there is one nearby. Rural areas may be safer because fighting is often focused around cities and population centers. However, remember that you’ll need wilderness survival skills to stay safe here. It may also be more difficult to receive aid, since relief organizations also focus on cities."

      "content": "Gather information from trusted sources. Having information about what areas are free of active conflict, where you can get supplies or medical care, and how you can escape dangerous situations is crucial to your survival. Only believe information provided by trustworthy NGOs, journalists, or authorities in your region. [1] X Research source During an invasion, disinformation can be used as a tactic to frighten or otherwise destabilize the population. Be careful believing news you hear from unverified accounts on social media or by word-of-mouth."

      "content": "Take advantage of opportunities to learn how to protect yourself. During or preceding an invasion, there may be paramilitary groups or army personnel in your area that can teach you basic survival and combat skills. These skills can mean the difference between life and death, and joining a training session is an opportunity for you to learn new skills . [2] X Research source If you aren’t looking to learn how to fight, these groups can also give you survival advice tailored to the region you live."

      "title": "Identify escape routes from your country.",
      "content": "Identify escape routes from your country. If the invasion has or is likely to spread across the entire country, learn what neighboring countries are open to refugees. The vast majority of countries are obligated under international law to accept refugees who have a reasonable fear that they could be killed in their home country. Making your way to a country free from war can be safer than staying put. [3] X Research source The journey to a conflict-free country can be challenging. Ideally, your home country will provide transportation services to help you escape the invasion. Otherwise, you may have to drive, sail , or even walk to the border. When escaping your country, bring passports or other identification documents. It may also be wise to take small valuables that you can keep hidden and exchange for cash or supplies if needed. Without ID, other countries may prevent you from entering. Getting in touch with friends or family members who live outside of your home country can connect you to opportunities to escape your country."

      "content": "Find a strong, brick building with a basement for shelter. These buildings types can withstand the most damage and remain standing. Look especially for a building with a basement. This provides added protection and a hiding place if you have to stay out of sight. Search your area for suitable buildings like these and move into one as soon as possible. [4] X Research source Try to find a building that you can seal up in case there is a chemical leak or attack. Look for windows still intact that you can close and block off with damp towels. If there are multiple suitable buildings in your area, make a list of all of them and their locations. This will help if you have to flee your current shelter and find a new one quickly. If there are no buildings like this, then find any structure that has a basement to protect you from the fighting."

Construct a suitable shelter as soon as you enter a new area to protect you from the cold, rain, and sun. Maintain this shelter by fixing any problems right away. Locate the shelter in a spot that's easy to hide in, just in case hostile people pass through the area. To make the job easier, try to build your shelter around a natural feature. A fallen tree, for example, could provide support for a larger structure."

      "content": "Avoid confrontations as much as you can. While a war probably makes you think of fighting, in reality, civilians usually survive a war by avoiding fights as much as possible. Unless you’re in the armed forces, in most cases you’re much safer avoiding confrontations. Lay low and don’t start fights with people. Take care of your family, friends, and yourself, but try not to get involved in problems that don’t affect you. [5] X Research source If hostile troops enter your area, it’s best to hide or avoid interacting with them at all costs. Make it clear you aren’t a threat. Don’t try to steal from people or hurt anyone except in self-defense. This will lead to confrontations as desperate people try to defend themselves. Avoiding fights may also mean fleeing an unsafe area. Always be ready for this possibility to keep yourself and your loved ones safe."

This is much easier if you already have weapons in your home and know how to use them. If not, then gather any weapons you may find and learn to use them. Keep them close at hand in your shelter in case you have to use them. [6] X Research source If you have a gun, ammunition might be scarce in a survival situation. Shooting for practice may also draw attention to you. Learn to use the gun as well as you can without firing if you've never used it before. Don't neglect other potential weapons like bows , axes, bats, or knives. These can all help you fight off attackers. Train other members of your family or group to use the weapons as well. Your group is at a disadvantage if only one member knows how to fight."

If someone tries to hurt you or your loved ones, or steal supplies that you need to survive, fight back when you can. Try to drive off the people who are trying to hurt you. [7] X Research source Having some weapons at hand will help in this situation. Keep all weapons in a safe place, away from children, and grab them quickly if you need them. If you do have to defend yourself or your family, having a good personal relationship with your community is a big help. The community could unite to defend itself from bandits or other people who want to cause harm."

Do it to save your love ones, or save yourself and the innocent peoples. If you are in a critical situation, and you have a gun, look for a gas tank or a petrol tank and fire your gun to it. This will create a huge explosion that gives out a heavy damage. In a one-by-one confrontation, try to trick the hostile people to place down the weapon, then fight! If you are in a confront with a tank, don’t use your gun as it’s not effective on the armored tank, instead, try to trick the controller down and take over the tank. If you are near an abandoned car showrooms, that will be good luck, most showing cars have full fuel and are in a good condition, go ahead and chose those car. The heavy armored military vehicle and a weapon truck usually slow, so if you can take a sport cars, it will be a good luck. Drive away and see for places to hide if you can, as these troops will soon call for their reinforcements. Including helicopters and fighter planes, which you cannot run away from them. If a confront is with a helicopter, its weakest point is its tail propeller and the gear box, fire many bullets as you can at those positions. You can also aim to their explosives, as it will explode very effectively. Trick that you are the same side of the hostile peoples you are confronting, so you will be released and become safe."

If you're able to, go out and get as many supplies as you can. Don’t delay or everything could be gone by the time you need it. [8] X Research source Especially store your canned or wrapped food and bottled water. Save these resources for emergencies, in the event that clean water and fresh food become scarce. Look for medicine and hygiene products as well. These are important for maintaining your health in stressful situations. Remember to store all of your important documents as well.

As soon as the war starts, find all of the potential water sources in your area. Do the same for every new area you move into. Nearby lakes and streams are potential water sources, but you may have to purify the water before drinking it. If you live near the ocean, do not drink saltwater. It's difficult to resist, but saltwater will cause serious illness. If you do find a clean water source, use that and try to preserve your bottled water for emergencies. If no other water sources are near you, collect rainwater for drinking and bathing. Leave out buckets and tubs to catch the rain when it falls. Remember to purify all rainwater before you drink it."

Once you get news that war has broken out, gather as many canned and nonperishable items as you can. Get them from the store or any other source you come across. This ensures you’ll have a steady supply if food starts running out. After the war has been going on, canned items may be available in abandoned grocery stores. Whenever you find an unopened can, take it. You don’t know when you’ll come across more food. Try to avoid foods with high salt content that will make you thirsty. These will make you drink more water than you would normally. Ideally, you should have 3 days’ worth of nonperishable food in your home at all times in case of natural disasters or other emergencies. If you have a stockpile already, you can avoid the rush to the food store that will occur once the war starts."

Practicing good hygiene can prevent illness and infection, and also help you feel better. When you're gathering supplies, always include as many hygiene products as you can carry. Also look for more if you're scrounging or searching for supplies. Important hygiene products to have are toilet paper, hand sanitizer , toothpaste and toothbrush, soap or liquid soap , period products, and disinfectant. Less critical but important products include combs or brushes, razors, shaving cream, and deodorant. These won't necessarily save your life, but keeping up a good appearance can help you feel much better in stressful situations."

Study your local area and find these edible plants. Then gather them regularly for a steady supply of food. [11] X Research source If you don’t know what a plant is or if it’s edible, smell it first. If the smell is terrible, it’s a good bet that it’s not edible. Then hold the plant on your skin for 15 minutes and see if you feel any itching or burning. If not, place the plant on your lips for 15 minutes. Then take a small bite of the plant. If you don’t feel any burning or stomach pains after 15 minutes, then the plant is probably safe to eat. If possible, you could also start a garden on your property for extra produce. Try to keep this hidden, though. If food is short, people will almost certainly try to steal your produce."

You usually find out that a SIM card is unusable, that’s because no power at the antenna, so if you are in a village, head to the antenna at midnight, connect a solar panel near the antenna, then turn it on. The best way is to bypass the wire, so the enemy cannot cut the switch. If you can drive a plane, steal it in the airport, and drive it away.
