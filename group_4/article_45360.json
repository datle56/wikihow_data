      "title": "The Family Woman",
      "content": "The Family Woman This type of woman prioritizes her family above anything else. Family time is extremely important to her, and you might notice that she always spends holidays with her fam and frequently tells stories about her cousins, siblings, grandparents, etc. [1] X Research source This family-oriented gal may also be interested in political and equality issues, especially if they affect the people she loves and cares for. Key Traits: Loving, compassionate, nostalgic. Examples in Pop Culture: Violet Bridgerton ( Bridgerton ), Molly Weasley ( Harry Potter ), Meg March ( Little Women )."

      "title": "The Caretaker",
      "content": "The Caretaker Some women (or people in general) have a knack for that nurturing, motherly instinct—whether they have kids or not! These Caretaker individuals are genuinely caring and empathetic and always seem to know the right things to say when you need comforting or cheering up. [2] X Research source She probably demands that you shoot her a text once you’ve made it home safely, always has a first aid or sewing kit on hand for last-minute emergencies, and in many other ways, fulfills the stereotype of the “mom friend.” [3] X Research source Key Traits: Nurturing, prepared, wise. Examples in Pop Culture: Mary Poppins ( Mary Poppins ), Joyce Byers ( Stranger Things ), Katniss Everdeen ( The Hunger Games )."

      "title": "The Listener",
      "content": "The Listener No judgment, no interruptions—this woman is one of the best people to have a round when you need an ear to vent to or a shoulder to cry on. She’ll listen to you quietly and let you have your say, silently observing what you’re going to do and what you need. In fact, this gal is a silent observer in general, and while some may refer to her introvert or ambivert personality as a “wallflower” type, you know that she’s really just taking in everything around her (and her brain is probably running a mile a minute). [4] X Research source Keep in mind that this woman might feel more comfortable in a listening role than a sharing one—but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t need (or want) to express her own feelings as well. She may just need some extra time and a little gentle encouragement to open up! Key Traits: Empathetic, observant, quiet. Examples in Pop Culture: Luna Lovegood ( Harry Potter ), Anne Shirley ( Anne of Green Gables ), Willow Rosenberg ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer )."

      "title": "The Gossip Girl",
      "content": "The Gossip Girl You can go ahead and ditch your Alexa if you know one of these women because the Gossip Girl knows everything . And don’t let this moniker fool you—we’re talking about “gossip” in the general informational sense, not necessarily in a negative way. [5] X Research source So while this woman may know why the next door neighbor got fired or who at the office broke up with whom, she’ll also remember your best friend’s favorite restaurant, know the new laws going into effect in your area, and store a host of other key info in her encyclopedic brain. Her enthusiasm and social energy probably bring a lot of joy into your life, but you may occasionally struggle to engage in a deep, meaningful conversation with her or convince her to have a quiet night in from time to time. Key Traits: Social, clever, knowledgeable. Examples in Pop Culture: Kelly Kapoor ( The Office ), Lydia Bennet ( Pride and Prejudice ), Moira Rose ( Schitt’s Creek ). [6] X Research source"

      "title": "The Hustler",
      "content": "The Hustler This woman treats work as a top priority and is always doing what she can to succeed and thrive in her career. She might be motivated by intrinsic ambition and drive, or maybe she has dreams of financial stability or a big promotion. Whatever the case, she’s definitely a go-getter who takes pride in working toward and achieving her goals. [7] X Research source If you know a Hustler, try not to take it personally if she cancels plans because a “work thing” came up. Remember that we all have our priorities and responsibilities, and her job is hers! Key Traits: Hardworking, ambitious, passionate. Examples in Pop Culture: Jo March ( Little Women ), Miranda Bailey ( Grey’s Anatomy ), Elle Woods ( Legally Blonde )."

    {
      "title": "The Superwoman",
      "content": "The Superwoman As the name implies, the Superwoman personality basically comes off as superhuman when it comes to her skills, independence, and emotional maturity. Similar to the Hustler, she probably works super hard and puts in a lot of emotional labor to take care of everyone around you. Even when she’s exhausted, she’ll do everything she can to hide that from others and keep her emotions in check. [8] X Research source She probably also keeps calm during emergencies and multi-tasks like it’s her middle name. Despite the seemingly superhuman abilities of the Superwoman (or “Strong woman”) personality type, she doesn’t actually have mystical powers. No matter how strong she comes off (or truly is!), this woman still needs someone to look after their needs and provide support as needed. Key Traits: Independent, dedicated, selfless. Examples in Pop Culture: Leslie Knope ( Parks and Recreation ), Princess Leia ( Star Wars ), Olivia Benson ( Law & Order: SVU )."

      "title": "The Boss Lady",
      "content": "The Boss Lady She may or may not be the boss at her 9-to-5 (actually, she probably is), but she’s definitely a boss 24/7/365. This type of woman exudes a rightfully unapologetic “my way or the highway energy” and she can often be found making the decision for a group, assertively standing up for what she believes in, or defending her opinion with lawyer-level argumentative skills. [9] X Research source The Boss Lady may struggle to loosen the reins from time to time, but she’s also the perfect person to tell you what’s what and help you to get your life back on track when you’re feeling lost or confused. Key Traits: Assertive, powerful, decisive. Examples in Pop Culture: Edna Mode ( The Incredibles ), Annalise Keating ( How to Get Away with Murder ), Paris Geller ( Gilmore Girls )."

      "title": "The Perfectionist",
      "content": "The Perfectionist This type of woman is the type who’s always making a to-do list, always has a spotless home, and is impeccably dressed no matter the occasion—wrinkled clothing? Never heard of it. She’s probably super disciplined with a strict daily routine, hygienic habits, a nutritious diet, and a thought-out 5-year (or 20-year) plan. While these personality traits can be super positive in many ways, any perfectionist sometimes needs to be reminded that it's okay to let some slip go from time to time—the perfect is the enemy of the good! [10] X Research source Key Traits: Detail-oriented, meticulous, organized. Examples in Pop Culture: Rory Gilmore ( Gilmore Girls ), Amy Santiago ( Brooklyn Nine-Nine ), Monica Geller ( Friends )."

      "title": "The Panda Girl",
      "content": "The Panda Girl Panda Girl is the ultimate homebody—and we mean that as a total compliment! Just like a cuddly panda bear, this type of woman finds a lot of joy in the lazy Sunday vibe: snuggling up on the couch, disappearing underneath a giant hoodie, binge-watching a new Netflix series, and splurging on DoorDash deliveries. She’s a great person to hang out with when you need some downtime! Key Traits: Introverted, laidback, adaptable. Examples in Pop Culture: Lorelai Gilmore ( Gilmore Girls ), Liz Lemon ( 30 Rock ), Daria Morgendorffer ( Daria ). [11] X Research source"

      "content": "The Party Animal This social butterfly has extroverts written all over her—and she’s happy to shout it from the rooftops! Call her a party animal or Energizer bunny, but the meaning is the same: she loves nothing more than a night out on the town dancing with her pals or catching up with her nearest and dearest. She probably loves hosting parties as well, replete with meticulous themes and fun activities for every guest. These types of women also often have large groups of friends who are just as bubbly and energetic as they are! Key Traits: Extroverted, energetic, affable. Examples in Pop Culture: Shelly Darlingson ( The House Bunny ), Bridget Jones ( Bridget Jones’s Diary ), Queenie Jenkins ( Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams)."

      "title": "The Daydreamer",
      "content": "The Daydreamer *sigh* This hopelessly romantic, daydreaming type of woman really wears her heart on her sleeve. She prefers to think with her heart over her head when it comes to big life decisions, and she may see a lot of the world through rose-tinted glasses—and we can’t blame her! She has a lot of love to give, and she always extends her optimism and deep sense of empathy to others. Plus, she can probably often be found daydreaming about a cozy home, true love, and a future of happiness and contentment—whatever her goals are. [12] X Research source This type of girl can often be pegged as overly emotional or naive, but that’s really not the case. The daydreamer chooses to see the best in the world and can take it hard when she turns out to be wrong, but her non-cynical attitude is part of what makes her so special! Key Traits: Loving, wistful, optimistic. Examples in Pop Culture: Belle ( Beauty and the Beast ), Jamie Sullivan ( A Walk to Remember ), Marianne Dashwood ( Sense and Sensibility )."

      "title": "Alpha Woman",
      "content": "Alpha Woman The Alpha woman is often described as confident, dominant, assertive, independent, and ambitious. She likely has an extensive and energetic social life where she’s often seen taking a leadership role among friends—a role she probably takes naturally to in all aspects of life! The Alpha woman is extremely likely to hold a position of authority at work, speak out often confidently about her beliefs and ideologies, and be the extroverted center of attention (deservedly) in any room. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Key Traits: Confident, assertive, emotionally intelligent. Common Career Paths: Entrepreneur, CEO, engineer. Examples in Pop Culture: Black Widow (the Marvel franchise), Samantha Jones ( Sex and the City ), Wilhelmina Slater ( Ugly Betty )."

      "title": "Beta Woman",
      "content": "Beta Woman Beta women are more introverted and soft-spoken than Alpha women, but they have just as many strengths and influences to share with the people around them. Their empathy, modesty, patience, and empathy are traits that anyone should want to emulate, and they pair these kind qualities with an admirable strong-headedness. They approach tricky situations in a gentle and pacifist manner, but they still won’t back down from what they know is right. [14] X Research source Key Traits: Introverted, empathetic, loyal. Common Career Paths: Human resources, speech-language pathologist, CEO. Examples in Pop Culture: Liz Lemon ( 30 Rock ), Elizabeth Bennet ( Pride and Prejudice ), Buffy Summers ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer )."

      "title": "Delta Woman",
      "content": "Delta Woman The Delta woman’s personality can best be encapsulated by one word: practical! Delta women work hard to be impressively well-rounded and self-sufficient. They’re good at pretty much everything (especially when it involves communication), and they take on practically any task with confidence and aptitude. This attitude and skill level are similar to the Alpha woman, but Deltas also tend to have the Beta’s compassion, Gamma’s positivity, and Omega’s intelligence. [15] X Research source However, Deltas also tend to be highly self-critical, so it’s crucial for them to recognize their own strengths while also giving themselves grace to not be perfectly practical (and practically perfect) all of the time. Key Traits: Practical, headstrong, intelligent. Common Career Paths: Counselor, nutritionist, event planner. Examples in Pop Culture: Ellen Ripley (the Alien franchise), Mulan ( Mulan ), Leia Organa ( Star Wars )."

      "title": "Gamma Woman",
      "content": "Gamma Woman Gamma women are like a balanced mix between Alpha and Beta gals. They’re super extroverted (like the Alpha) but also incredibly empathetic (like the Beta). Rather than being driven by external factors like social hierarchy, status, or popularity, Gamma women shift their behavior based on their internal beliefs and priorities—which are often based around building community and connecting with others. [16] X Research source Key Traits: Extroverted, self-aware, collaborative. Common Career Paths: Social worker, personal stylist, teacher. Examples in Pop Culture: Jane Eyre ( Jane Eyre ), She-Hulk (the Marvel franchise), Michelle Renard ( Mercy by Julie Garwood)."

      "title": "Omega Woman",
      "content": "Omega Woman Omega women are similar to Beta women in that they’re very introverted and feel the most comforted and energized by their alone time. They focus on quality over quantity when it comes to their social life, so they only really need a few close friends to feel fulfilled in that area of life. In their free time, they’re really focused on self-improvement and growth, since they see that as a path to a successful future. They’re also extremely driven by their own emotions, and they can easily get hurt because they so vulnerably and bravely wear their hearts on their sleeve. [17] X Research source Key Traits: Introverted, growth-driven, soft-spoken. Common Career Paths: Therapist, artist, social worker. Examples in Pop Culture: Beth March ( Little Women ), Jane Bennet ( Pride and Prejudice ), Lexi Howard ( Euphoria )."

However, while Alphas can sometimes be motivated by social pressures or a quest for validation, Sigmas do things completely on their own terms and for their own reasons. They do what they want when they want to, and they don’t conform to other people’s expectations or desires. [18] X Research source Key Traits: Self-sufficient, assertive, independent. Common Career Paths: Small business owner, salesperson, scientist. Examples in Pop Culture: Lisbeth Salander ( The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ), Clarice Starling ( The Silence of the Lambs ), Clarissa Dalloway ( Mrs. Dalloway )."

      "title": "The Maiden",
      "content": "The Maiden The Maiden feminine archetype represents women who have the energy of youthfulness, purity, and innocence. In literature and mythology, the Maiden is often portrayed as the “damsel in distress” with naive, vain, and compliant qualities. However, the true Maiden archetype is all about exuding an eternally youthful and effervescent quality (regardless of whether the woman is actually young in age). Often, the Maiden is creative and compassionate but still has a big life lesson to learn or a hurdle to overcome. [19] X Research source The Maiden is one of the three figures in the Triple Goddess archetype used in religious traditions to symbolize the spiritual journey of the human life cycle. She represents the beginning of the cycle, as well as youth, creativity, and the waxing moon. [20] X Research source Key Traits: Playful, curious, creative. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: Mia Wallace ( Pulp Fiction ), Rapunzel ( Tangled ), Persephone (Greek goddess), Inanna (Sumerian goddess)."

      "content": "The Mother The Mother archetype represents the qualities of nurturing, caring, and protection. It’s also deeply connected to the power and wisdom of the divine feminine—a spiritual and psychological concept that represents qualities traditionally associated with femininity. If a woman is at a point in her life when she’s connected to the Mother archetype (which doesn’t necessarily mean she’s an actual mother), she’s likely feeling the instinct to foster life and provide emotional and physical sustenance to others. [21] X Research source The Mother is one of the three figures in the Triple Goddess archetype used in religious traditions to symbolize the spiritual journey of the human life cycle. She represents the maturation into maternal qualities, as well as wisdom, confidence, and the full moon. [22] X Research source Key Traits: Nurturing, persistent, compassionate. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: Carol Brady ( The Brady Bunch ), Morticia Addams ( The Addams Family ), Demeter (Greek goddess), Gwandusu (West African maternity figure)."

      "content": "The Crone The Crone, often referred to as the Wise Woman, is a feminine archetype that represents the wisdom, experience, and knowledge gained by women over their lifetimes. She’s often a source of guidance for others, and she may seem to possess a spiritual or other-worldly sense of knowledge and intuition. She’s lived through the ups and downs of life and can see things with ultimate clarity and understanding. [23] X Research source The Crone is one of the three figures in the Triple Goddess archetype used in religious traditions to symbolize the spiritual journey of the human life cycle. She represents the ending of the cycle, as well as acceptance, transformation, and the waning moon. [24] X Research source Key Traits: Wise, introspective, empowered.

      "title": "The Wild Woman",
      "content": "The Wild Woman The Wild Woman archetype represents the deepest and most authentic essence inside of a woman. When the Wild Woman is brought out, she is soulful, flawed, capable, and passionate. She pursues her own needs and interests without concern for morals or other people’s opinions, and she unapologetically stands in her power to explore her intellectual, emotional, and sexual self. Often, women are most in touch with their inner Wild Woman when they become middle-aged and realize how socialization has shaped their behavior—they’re no longer afraid of making mistakes if it means living their most authentic lives. [25] X Research source The Wild Woman is sometimes believed to encompass all three stages of the Triple Goddess archetype—which is used in religious traditions to symbolize the spiritual journey of the human life cycle. She represents a powerful feminine energy that integrates the full spectrum of female energy, tapping into the most untamed and primal feminine instincts. Key Traits: Dynamic, instinctive, unapologetic. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: San ( Princess Mononoke ), Cheryl Strayed ( Wild ), Diana (Roman myth), Durga (Hindu goddess)."

      "title": "The Lover",
      "content": "The Lover The Lover feminine archetype represents passion, sensuality, and a drive toward deep emotional connection. Women who fulfill the lover archetype often feel intimately connected to their own sense of pleasure, as well as their own creative spirit—they may often be found engaging in artistic endeavors, theorizing, or inventing. Psychologically, this archetype comes from some women’s primal urge to connect and create—in the sense of actually creating life and creating new art and meaning in the world. [26] X Research source Keep in mind that the Lover archetype has nothing to do with traditional sex appeal. Just because someone is highly sexualized or considered conventionally attractive doesn’t make them a Lover type. Key Traits: Passionate, sensual, extroverted. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: Samantha Jones ( Sex and the City ), Bridget Jones ( Bridget Jones’s Diary ), Aphrodite (Greek goddess), Xochiquetzal (Aztec goddess)."

She’s self-assured in the fact that she knows what she needs and deserves what she wants, and she’s not afraid to express those feelings to others. Women who embody the Queen archetype are often described as regal, stately, and confident, and they’re often drawn to meaningful and long-term romantic matches (sometimes for strategic or practical reasons). [27] X Research source Key Traits: Loyal, driven, sensible. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: Penelope ( The Odyssey ), Gertrude ( Hamlet ), Hera (Greek goddess), Isis (Egyptian goddess)."

      "content": "The Huntress The Huntress archetype represents the independent female spirit that highly values autonomy and free will. This type of woman is driven to achieve her own personal goals and live a life completely of her own choosing. She prides herself on her independence and the fact that she doesn’t need validation or approval from others. The Huntress is often depicted as an idealized feminist character, and she often will naturally come to the defense of other women, especially ones who have been victimized. [28] X Research source Key Traits: Self-reliant, courageous, goal-oriented. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: Carrie Soto ( Carrie Soto Is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid), Katniss Everdeen ( The Hunger Games ), Artemis (Greek goddess), Pinga (Inuit goddess)."

      "content": "The Sage As the name implies, the Sage archetype represents a woman’s pursuit of knowledge. Sage-like characters are often wise, strategic, and able to remain objective in the face of major emotional decisions. They often provide counsel to others, love to learn and try out new things, and may have been described as “mature for their age” over their lifetime. [29] X Research source Psychologically, the personalities of these “wise women” are often shaped by a strong paternal figure (or Sage-like maternal figure) and they often relate more to traditionally masculine qualities than feminine ones, but this is not always the case. Key Traits: Logical, worldly, intelligent. Examples in Pop Culture & Mythology: Olivia Pope ( Scandal ), Minerva McGonagall ( Harry Potter ), Athena (Greek goddess), Pele (Hawaiian goddess)."

    {
      "title": "Certain types of women are not more empirically attractive than others.",
      "content": "Certain types of women are not more empirically attractive than others. Attractiveness is highly subjective, so different people may be drawn to different personalities and different types of women. The best approach to deeming attractiveness is really to get to know someone on an individual level rather than assigning them to a category and judging them based on that. Women (and people of all genders!) are incredibly multi-faceted, so they may have many traits and characteristics that make them attractive in their own way."
