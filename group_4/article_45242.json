      "title": "Change direction by rolling around a curve with your skates parallel.",
      "content": "Change direction by rolling around a curve with your skates parallel. Start by spacing your skates apart by about 6 in (15 cm), lining up the back wheel of your front skate with the front wheel of your rear skate. Keep both skates parallel, and bend your knees as you go around the curve—this will help you keep your footing. Follow the curve as you skate, which will help you gradually change direction. [1] X Research source When you roll around a curve, you won’t slow down or pick up speed—you’ll just change direction slightly."

      "title": "Bend your knees as you roll around the curve.",
      "content": "Bend your knees as you roll around the curve. Bending your knees helps you stay balanced as you change direction. Keep one skate in front of the other, with the rear wheel of the front skate in line with the front wheel of the back skate. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Lean into the turn as you roll around a curve.",
      "content": "Lean into the turn as you roll around a curve. Bend your inner knee even more as you shift your weight into the curve. As you lean, angle your wheels toward the outside of the curve. Once you’ve cleared the turn, straighten your inner leg so it’s only slightly bent, and recenter yourself and your skates. [3] X Research source For example, if you’re leaning to the right as you turn, you’d shift your weight to the outer right edge of your right skate, and the inner right edge of your left skate. If you’re leaning to the left, you’d shift your weight to the outer left edge of your left skate, and the inner left edge of your right skate. The faster you approach the turn, the more you’ll need to bend your knee."

    {
      "title": "Try an A-frame turn.",
      "content": "Try an A-frame turn. Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, with both skates angled inward to form an “A” shape. Skate forward, shifting your weight to the inner edges of your skates. To turn right, apply a little extra pressure to your left foot. To turn left, put some extra pressure on your right foot."

    {
      "title": "Cross 1 foot over the other while slowly turning.",
      "content": "Cross 1 foot over the other while slowly turning. Stand upright on your skates, balancing your weight between both feet. Lift your right foot and cross it over your left, pointing your right foot in the direction you’d like to turn. Then, step forward with your left foot, angling your toes at a 45-degree angle away from your right foot. [4] X Research source If you’re very new to rollerblading, this technique might be tough to nail down at first. Crossovers can be extra challenging if your skates are very long."

    {
      "title": "Continue crossing your feet and stepping in a circle formation.",
      "content": "Continue crossing your feet and stepping in a circle formation. Cross your right foot over your left foot again, pointing your toes in the direction you’d like to turn. Then, step with your left foot once again, pointing your toes at a 45-degree angle away from your right foot. Repeat this pattern of crossing and stepping until you’ve moved in a complete circle. [5] X Research source For now, focus on shifting your weight from foot to foot and getting the basic movements down."

    {
      "title": "Try gliding your feet instead of stepping.",
      "content": "Try gliding your feet instead of stepping. Instead of physically lifting and planting your skates on the ground in slow, plodding steps, try gliding forward with your skates. Push off with 1 leg to get yourself moving. As you approach a turn, cross your right foot over your left, pointing your toes in the direction you’d like to go. Then, glide on your left skate, pointing your toes at a 45-degree angle away from your right skate. [6] X Research source It’s okay if your left skate isn’t exactly 45 degrees away from your right. As long as your left foot is angled, you’ll still be able to turn."

      "title": "Balance between your toe and your heel.",
      "content": "Balance between your toe and your heel. Plant your left heel on the ground, so only your rear wheel is touching the floor. Then, shift your weight onto the toe of your right skate, so only the front wheel touches the ground. Take a moment to find your balance in this position—it can be a little tricky, but don’t give up!

      "content": "Repeat this motion quickly to start spinning. Push your right toe out in a curved arc behind your left skate, spinning the rest of your body as you go. Then, push your toe back in toward your other skate. Continue moving your right skate out and in to maintain momentum as you spin. As you practice, try to keep your left heel anchored on the ground.

      "content": "Step backward with both skates angled inward. Bend your knees a little bit and take a step back with your right skate, pointing your toe toward the center of your left skate. Then, step back with your left skate, angling your toe in the middle of your right skate. Continue taking small steps, keeping your knees bent as you go. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Transition from stepping to gliding.",
      "content": "Transition from stepping to gliding. Start taking larger steps backward on your skates. When you take bigger steps, try gliding your skates in a smooth, fluid motion. As you get the hang of this, slowly point your skates forward instead of angling them inward. [12] X Research source Skating backward may feel pretty awkward at first. That’s okay! Take as much time as you need to practice stepping and gliding backward."

      "title": "Slow down by angling 1 skate sideways.",
      "content": "Slow down by angling 1 skate sideways. Angle your upper body about 45 degrees to the right, and turn your right skate out at a 90-degree angle. Rake your skate on the ground multiple times—this will help you brake. [13] X Research source This technique is easier to pull off when you’re skating slowly. You can also do this with your left foot, if that feels more comfortable. Just be sure to angle yourself 45 degrees to the left as you brake."

When you feel comfortable, try doing a 180 jump on your skates. [16] X Research source Skate backward for a few seconds, and then do another 180 jump so you’re facing forward again. [17] X Research source It may take many tries before you get the hang of this trick—that’s okay! Just keep practicing until you feel confident."
