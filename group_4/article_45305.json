If you're using a laptop or an external keyboard that doesn't have a separate numeric keypad section, you may still have a \"soft\" numeric keypad: Take a look at the right side of your keyboard, particularly the following keys: 7, 8, 9, U, I, O, J, K, L, M. Do you see smaller numbers printed on these keys? If so, you have a \"soft\" numeric keypad, which you can activate by using the Number Lock key. Some newer laptops don't have a numeric keypad at all. If this is the case for you, you'll need to try another method."

Whether you have a physical 10-key numeric keypad or a soft numeric keypad, you should have a key called Num Lock , NumLk , or similar somewhere in the upper-right area of the keyboard. Sometimes you'll find this key in another place, but start looking there. Once you find it, press it to activate Number Lock. If your Num Lock key is shared with another key, such as Screen Lock, you may have to hold down the Fn key as you click it to activate Number Lock. To test that Number Lock is working, press the U key—if you see a 4 instead of a U, it's working! If not, try pressing Num Lock again."
