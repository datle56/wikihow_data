      "title": "Search for missing patches of fur.",
      "content": "Search for missing patches of fur. Look over your cat for signs of missing fur. One of the first symptoms of malnutrition in cats is loss of fur, so bald spots signal that your cat may be missing something from its diet. [1] X Research source If you’ve found a stray cat or adopted a cat, also check for dark fur patches. When a cat loses fur due to nutritional deficiency, it grows back darker. This can help you better understand your new cat’s health history. Even if it’s not a nutritional deficiency, it’s important that you get to the bottom of what’s causing your cat’s missing fur."

      "content": "Look at your cat’s skin. While you’re petting your cat, part its fur to see if the skin is dry and scaly. Be sure to look at the skin all over your cat’s body, not just in one spot because it may have isolated patches of dry, scaly skin, especially if your cat is just starting to develop a nutritional deficiency.

      "title": "Check your cat’s claws.",
      "content": "Check your cat’s claws. Cats with nutritional deficiencies may have caved in or concave claws, meaning that the claws will look hollow in the center. Hold your cat and gently press on its paw to push out its claws. [3] X Research source Be careful not to hurt or stress your cat while you’re trying to check its claws. Be cautious when checking claws because you may get scratched. Consider wearing gloves to protect yourself. If your cat is a stray, you may want to hold off on checking its claws because it’s more likely to scratch you, and you don’t know its health history."

      "title": "Watch your cat’s grooming habits.",
      "content": "Watch your cat’s grooming habits. Cats with nutritional deficiencies will stop and reduce their grooming. If your cat is no longer licking its fur or has crusty patches because it hasn’t cleaned itself, then something is likely wrong. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Weigh your cat.",
      "content": "Weigh your cat. A nutritional deficiency is often linked to being underweight, so check to see if your cat has lost weight or falls under the healthy weight recommendation for its age and size. [5] X Research source If you can’t weigh your cat, see if you can see and feel its ribs and joints. It’s normal to be able to feel the outline of a cat’s ribs, but if they’re pronounced and noticeable then the cat is likely underweight. You can also look up a body conditions score chart online to get an idea of whether or not your cat is underweight."

      "title": "Check your cat’s gums.",
      "content": "Check your cat’s gums. Use your finger to gently open your cat’s mouth and check its gums for swelling. Swollen gums will look puffy and red. [6] X Research source Be careful not to put your finger all the way in its mouth because your cat may bite you. Try wearing gloves. If your cat is a stray, allow your vet and the trained technicians to check your new cat’s gums. They will want to check its teeth also, since stray cats can have damaged or broken teeth that require care."

      "title": "Check to see if your cat leaves food uneaten.",
      "content": "Check to see if your cat leaves food uneaten. If your cat’s food is unpalatable, it may not eat enough to meet its nutritional needs. Check the recommended feeding amounts to make sure that you aren’t overfeeding the cat before you determine that the food is unpalatable. Try a different brand of cat food if your cat doesn’t like what you’ve been feeding it. [7] X Research source Since cats have different tastes than humans, feeding a cat human meals can lead to nutritional deficiency since your cat may not like the food."

It may also stop playing with its toys, its family, and the other pets. If your cat just sits still staring at one spot for most of the day, then it may be depressed.

The cat’s muscles will be lean, and your cat will be unable to run and jump like a healthy cat can.

If your cat does suffer from malnutrition, then your vet can help determine why and can recommend a plan to help your cat, such as changing its food or adding a supplement. Taking your cat to the vet is especially important if you’ve taken in a stray cat. The vet can give you more information about the health issues your stray cat faces and can test for issues like Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and feline leukemia, which is essential if you’re going to let your new cat be around other cats. The vet can also update your cat’s shots."
