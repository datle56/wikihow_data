Bring it to a boil and put the beans in the water in batches. Let small beans boil for 2 minutes. Medium beans can be boiled for 3 minutes, and large beans can be boiled for 4 minutes.

After the beans have cooled, take them out of the ice water and pat them dry with a paper towel. Cool the beans for the same amount of time that you boiled them. For example, if you boiled small beans for 2 minutes, cool them for 2 minutes. You may need to add more ice to the ice water to keep it cold. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the beans from the hot water to the ice bath."
