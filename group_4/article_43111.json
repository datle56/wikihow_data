      "content": "A contact lens can move around the front of your eye but not behind it. It’s super common for a contact lens to drift off-center and get stuck in the corner or under an eyelid. The lens can’t actually move behind your eye or get permanently stuck in there, though! If that lens is still in your eye, you can get it out—we promise.

      "content": "Relax your eye and touch the eyelid to feel for the contact. Close your eye and gently press your clean fingertips to your top and bottom eyelids. Typically, you’ll be able to feel the shape of the contact underneath your fingers, even through the skin of your eyelid. [5] X Research source If you don't feel the lens with your fingers, don't worry! That can happen sometimes."

      "content": "Add 3-4 drops of contact lens rewetting drops to your eye. After you apply the drops, close your eye and gently massage the area to get the contact moving around again. Open your eye to see if the lens has moved into a place where you can easily get it. Blinking a few times in quick succession can also help. If you don’t have contact lens rewetting drops, use contact lens saline solution . Avoid using water, though! Non-sterile water from the tap (and other water sources) may have infection-causing microorganisms in it.

      "content": "Look in the opposite direction of where the lens is stuck. For example, if your contact lens appears to be (or feels like it is) stuck on the right side of your eyeball, move your eye to the left side and blink a few times to loosen it. This movement is typically enough to shift the lens back to the center of your eye. [7] X Research source If the contact is still being stubborn, apply a few more rewetting drops and repeat the movement."

      "content": "Flip your eyelid inside out and nudge the contact back into place. If the contact is stuck under your top or bottom eyelid and refuses to budge, look downward into a mirror and place a clean cotton swab against your lash line. Slowly tip your head backward (for the bottom eyelid) or forward (for the top eyelid) to turn the eyelid inside out. Use your free hand to grab the edge of the contact. [8] X Research source If this feels uncomfortable or awkward, get someone to hold the swab and help you out."

      "content": "If you still can’t find it, your contact lens probably isn’t in your eye. If you still can’t locate the contact after going through the removal steps several times, it’s highly likely that the lens fell out of your eye. In fact, it's probably on a nearby countertop or possibly even the ground, so gently feel around on nearby surfaces until you find your contact lens. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Mild irritation can sometimes make it feel like there's something stuck in your eye, even when there's not. If you're still worried or need additional peace of mind, make an appointment with your eye doctor."

      "content": "A contact lens usually gets stuck in your eye because of dryness. Dry eyes can be caused by a number of issues, of course, but if you're a contact lens wearer, the dryness is probably directly related to the way you clean or care for your contact lenses . To prevent stuck contacts in the future, try these tips: Follow your eye doctor’s recommendations for how long to wear your lenses. For example, if you have daily wear lenses, take them out every day. Be gentle when you rub your eyes and remove eye makeup carefully. Avoid sleeping in your contacts. Your eyes need time to rest and breathe between wearings. Clean and store contacts in fresh saline solution . It can be tempting to pop lenses back in their case with last night’s solution, but try to avoid doing this. Get a professional vision checkup and contact lens fitting every year.
