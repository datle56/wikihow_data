      "content": "Say it's a Star Wars reference and explain it if they ask questions. Some people may be good-natured about your Star Wars pickup line and ask you to explain its meaning.

If you say you're referencing Star Wars and your crush wants to know more, that could be a good opportunity to have a fun conversation about your favorite movies or pop culture. But if they say, \"Oh,\" and start talking about something else, you may want to avoid bringing up Star Wars to that person in the future."
