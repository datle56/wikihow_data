Make sure that the spool rotates in a clockwise direction as you unravel the thread. If it doesn't, you may need to change the way it sits on the spool pin, Wrap the thread around the front of the disc first. It should pass over the left side of the disc, then cross back over toward the front of the machine."

Hold the bobbin case so that the hook of the latch rests on your thumb. Hold the bobbin so that thread appears to wrap around in a clockwise rotation.
