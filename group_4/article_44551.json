      "content": "Seek medical attention if you think you have dry gangrene. Gangrene can result from skin problems or changes, or in some cases from of limb ischemia (blockage of the arteries to lower legs and feet). All types of gangrene require professional medical treatment. If you suspect that you have dry gangrene, even if it is a mild case, then you should call your doctor as soon as possible. Symptoms of dry gangrene include: [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Dry and shriveled skin that sloughs off easily Bluish or blackish colored skin Cold, numb skin Pain (sometimes, but not always present)"

      "content": "Go to an emergency room if you have wet gangrene. While all types of gangrene require swift medical treatment, wet gangrene is more likely to be accompanied by an infection, which can be difficult to treat if it gets into your blood. Injuries may also cause wet gangrene, so you may require immediate treatment for that reason as well. [2] X Research source hhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/gangrene Seek emergency medical treatment if you notice any of the following symptoms of wet gangrene: [3] X Research source Swelling and pain in the infected area Skin that has changed from red to brown to black Blisters or sores accompanied by a bad-smelling discharge (pus) Fever Feeling sick in general Crackling sound when you press on the affected area"

If you determine that you have gangrene, there are some symptoms may indicate that the gangrene has infected your blood, which requires immediate medical attention. If you notice any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to an emergency room right away.

      "title": "Take antibiotics and other medications as instructed.",
      "content": "Take antibiotics and other medications as instructed. Your doctor may give you an intravenous antibiotic or instruct you to take antibiotics orally as part of your treatment. You may also be administered medications to regulate your blood sugar since blood sugar regulation and short term glycemic control improve long term outcomes when it comes to healing and preventing infection. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking antibiotics and any other medications that your doctor prescribes to help treat your gangrene. [5] X Research source If you have side effects or feel like you do not need the medication anymore, call your doctor before discontinuing them. Do not stop taking antibiotics until you have taken the entire prescription. Otherwise, they may not be effective and the infection may be harder to treat in the future."

      "content": "Undergo wound debridement and irrigation. Wounds with devitalized tissue, contamination, or residual suture need debridement before any other work is completed. Irrigation is important in removing the bacterial load and removing loose material. In surgical debridement, a scalpel or scissors is used to remove devitalized tissue or unwanted debris. Enzymatic debridement involves applying various enzymatic agents to the wound."

      "title": "Undergo oxygen therapy.",
      "content": "Undergo oxygen therapy. Sometimes oxygen therapy may be used to help promote healing of damaged tissues. For this treatment, you will be placed in a special chamber that is filled with oxygen. The concentration of oxygen will be much higher in this chamber than in the normal environment, which is thought to help you heal faster and more effectively. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Oxygen therapy may assist in wound healing and help to reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be amputated. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oxygen therapy has also been found to be extremely useful in surgical wound infections involving the Clostridium species that cause “gas gangrene,” which is a form of gangrene that develops inside the body.

      "title": "Consider other therapies.",
      "content": "Consider other therapies. Biologic therapy such as maggot therapy has been used to treat ulcers, chronic venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and other acute and chronic wounds. Recombinant human growth factors are now being examined as potential treatments for wound management. These factors include platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Your doctor may recommend trying one of these treatments to promote healing. Try to keep an open mind about maggot therapy. Sterile, lab-raised maggots are often used to treat gangrene. Because maggots will only eat dead tissue, they can be applied to the affected tissues and allowed to eat away the dead skin. This process can also help your body to heal itself and help to prevent infection. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Discuss amputation with your doctor.",
      "content": "Discuss amputation with your doctor. Surgery may also be required to remove the affected tissues from your body. If not removed, the gangrene is likely to spread and cause further harm to the rest of your body and possibly even death. Therefore, it may be necessary for your doctor to remove a finger, toe, foot, or limb in order to treat the gangrene. [10] X Research source Keep in mind that even when interventions are successful to open up an artery and reestablish blood flow to the affected area, surgical removal of dead tissues is still used for gangrene in almost every case."

Causes of gangrene include diabetes, atherosclerosis of the limbs, peripheral artery disease, smoking, trauma, obesity, and Raynaud's Disease.
