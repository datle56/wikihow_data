      "content": "Read the DSM-5 and ICD-11 definition. These manuals will give you a general sense of what autism is like, although they do not go into great detail. It can be a helpful starting point in understanding the basics of autism. The definition does not completely fit everybody—every autistic person is different! Some autistic people may have problems with sensory processing, while others don't. Some autistic people communicate nonverbally or with AAC, while others communicate verbally (and may have a rather large or sophisticated vocabulary for their age). If you know an autistic person who does not fit all the diagnostic criteria, don't assume that they're lying or \"faking it\"—autism is a spectrum disorder, so not everyone has every piece of it."

      "content": "Watch your sources carefully. Not every source is credible, and not every source that claims credibility is a good one. Many scammers and people with questionable agendas claim to understand autism, and myths spread easily (even among people who meet well). Too many sources use scare tactics, worst-case scenarios, and offers of expensive \"quick fixes\" that don't help. Not all large groups are trustworthy. For example, Autism Speaks spread vaccine myths for years despite clear evidence [1] X Research source and promotes restrictive diets with no scientific backing. [2] X Research source It's not the only group that promotes questionable ideas, either. Some people paint deeply negative pictures that may scare you or lead you to wrong conclusions. If someone paints themselves as a martyr or victim, don't assume you're getting the full picture. Life can be hard for autistic people, but there's also lots of good in it, especially with the right supports."

These organizations can help with many things—whether it's dispelling rumors about autism, advertising any events that are in support of autism acceptance, or simply giving a perspective on something. These organizations may talk about painful subjects from time to time, such as abuse of autistic or other disabled people. If you feel like you're unable to handle hearing about those kinds of subjects, avoid them."

      "content": "Consider the \"types\" of autism. Autistic people are diverse and people have long tried to sort them into subcategories. However, these attempts can be tricky. Trying to sort people into groups like \"has more skills\" and \"has more needs\" risks ignoring traits and taking away their agency. Many people just use the label \"autistic.\" In past years, autism was separated into \"classic autism,\" \"Asperger syndrome,\" and \"PDD-NOS\" (atypical autism). These terms were later merged since there was no objective difference. The term \"Asperger syndrome\" has fallen out of favor since it was discovered that Hans Asperger sentenced some autistic children to death. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source The \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" labels are sometimes used to describe autistic people. However, both autistic advocates and experts warn that these labels overlook the complexities of people's needs and skills. They often do more harm than good.

Go to source [6] X Research source Some people now use \"levels\" of autism, with Level 1 requiring the least support and Level 3 requiring the most support. These labels are supposed to define needs (not skills) and be subject to change. However, there's still the risk of overlooking the person's abilities or needs based on how you sort them.

Autistic people can be born to wonderful parents as well as terrible ones. Many parents love their autistic children dearly. On the flip side, autism will not be erased by the efforts of a \"warrior parent,\" a parent who pours all their energy into various therapies and treatments. Negligent parents may lead to Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which shares some traits with autism, but is completely different. Do not mistake RAD for autism."

Their social development may be particularly slow. Some autistic people learn to speak late. Some are unable to speak. Some autistic children meet their milestones later than average, leading to a diagnosis. Others meet them early, or out of order. Some meet them \"on schedule\" at first, then slow down as meeting the demands of life becomes harder, which can lead to a later diagnosis.

Many (though not all) autistic people want to have friends, even if they're introverted. [47] X Research source Unfortunately, communication struggles can make this harder.

Stimming can help autistic people self-regulate, making it easier to manage stress and difficult environments. Don't tell someone not to stim. Stopping someone from stimming isn't healthy for them.

Meltdowns look similar to a tantrum, but are not done on purpose. They may involve crying, screaming, lashing out, throwing oneself on the floor, et cetera. The person is too upset to fully control themselves. Shutdowns happen when an autistic person's brain can't process things, and they may stop being able to do tasks like cleaning up, talking, driving, et cetera. The autistic person may become very passive, and look sad or emotionless. Sensory overload is caused by an overwhelming environment. The only cure is time and a quiet place to rest."
