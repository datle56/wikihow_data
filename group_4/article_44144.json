You can generally approximate the location and/or type of phone that the person is using, but in order to pull up an accurate, up-to-date version of their number, you'll need to use a paid service. There are a couple of other downsides to tracing a phone number: If the person whose phone number you want to trace has requested that their phone number be removed from services such as WhitePages, you most likely won't be able to look up their number. If the phone number has recently been deactivated or transferred to another user, the search may not be accurate."
