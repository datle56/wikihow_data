      "content": "Make a loud noise. Say “NO” in a strong and loud voice or another loud noise. Dogs often get into a trance as they hump, but a loud noise might be enough to startle your dog out of that trance. [1] X Research source Your tone should be assertive, but you need to keep anger out of it since anger can heighten a dog's energy instead of lowering it. Try using another source of noise, like a whistle or air horn. Make sure that these noise makers are far enough away from your dog to prevent damage to the ears. Make the noise when the dog is starting or in the middle of doing the behavior, not afterward."

      "title": "Ignore the behavior.",
      "content": "Ignore the behavior. Dogs sometimes mount people to get attention. Push the dog away or turn away from the dog so they don't get attention. You may also sit down or move away from the dog so they can’t mount you.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source To push the dog away, gently take the dog by its front legs and set those paws back on the ground. Move yourself. Turning away from the dog or walking a few paces in another direction can work well as long as you remain calm."

      "content": "Put your dog in \"time out.\" You may need to physically remove your dog from the area if they won’t stop humping. Say “No!” or “Nope!” when the dog humps. Then, lead the dog out of the room and into a quiet, closed room for a few minutes. Let the dog stay in that room alone for a few minutes until they calm down. When you take your dog to a \"time out\" area, make sure that there are no toys to play with. Leave the dog for 30 seconds to three minutes. Make sure that your dog is calm before releasing them, and when you release them, stay calm and act as though nothing happened."

      "title": "Keep your dog on a leash.",
      "content": "Keep your dog on a leash. When humping is a persistent behavior, you will likely need to work with your dog every time another person or dog visits your house. Put a short leash on your dog and let them wear it around the house. When the dog needs to go to time out or you have company, you can direct your dog as needed. The leash can also help you remove the dog from aggressive situations. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source You could either use a tab or a drag-line. A tab is a short piece of leash measuring 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.25 cm). A drag-line is a 4 to 6 foot (1.2 to 1.8 m) nylon cord."

      "content": "Redirect your dog's energy. After you get your dog to stop its initial humping, redirect that energy into an acceptable behavior, like playing fetch or other games or activities. Aside from toys, you could also distract and redirect your dog by giving him or her an interactive toy that dispenses treats or by asking your dog to perform a previously learned trick. You may also be able to train your dog to hump a pillow instead of people or other dogs."

      "title": "Block your dog from the temptation.",
      "content": "Block your dog from the temptation. When you break your dog away from another dog or person it's been humping, you need to keep your dog away. If your dog moves back toward the target while displaying dominant behavior, put yourself in between your dog and the target to physically block your dog from returning. Dominant behavior may include growling or aggression, nudging, pawing, standing over another dog, or taking things away from the other dog. Stay calm as you step in front of your dog. If possible, consider leaning forward or gently knocking your dog with your hip or knee to send a message. Remember that the purpose is not to hurt your dog, but to snap it out of its fixation and let it know that you are taking command of the situation."

      "content": "Exercise your dog . When a dog has too much energy, they can direct that energy toward an unwanted behavior, like humping. If you can thoroughly drain the dog's energy each day with structured exercise, you can help prevent your dog from using their energy on that behavior. [4] X Research source Walking your dog is crucial. You can drain a lot of energy by letting your dog run around in a backyard on their own, but walking forces your dog to exercise physically and mentally."

      "content": "Avoid encouraging the behavior in any context. Some pet owners think it's cute when their dog humps something like a stuffed animal, but if you want your dog to stop humping other dogs or people, you need to stop the behavior in all forms. Encouraging or allowing the behavior in one form will create an inconsistency in your training, making it less effective. [5] X Research source You may end up encouraging the behavior without even realizing it. For example, if you laugh or show signs of happiness whenever your dog mounts their favorite plush toy, you are indirectly praising your dog for the behavior."

      "content": "Distract your dog before it starts. Watch your dog and observe how they act immediately before starting the mounting behavior. When you start to notice these signs, immediately distract your dog with a toy or game before it can engage in the behavior itself. Common signs that your dog may start humping include panting, licking, whining, pawing, or rubbing against something."

      "content": "Teach your dog an acceptable behavior. Some dogs will start humping for attention when guests visit. If you suspect that this might be an issue, teach your dog an acceptable trick to perform for company, like sitting or begging, and make sure that this trick earns your dog the same amount of attention. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source If the trick receives positive attention while the mounting receives negative attention, your dog is more likely to want to perform the trick.

      "content": "Keep your dog away from excessively stressful situations. Humping can also be a response to stress. If you notice that your dog displays this behavior when faced with a source of anxiety, avoid putting your dog in that stressful situation.

If visitors are your dog's trigger, keep the dog in a room until the initial energy and excitement of the visit calms down. Let the dog out once it and all of your visitors are calm."

      "content": "Work on standard obedience training. If your dog frequently humps you, they are trying to exert dominance over you. To stop this behavior, you need to let your dog know that you're the boss. Standard obedience training is a healthy and effective way to establish this. [9] X Research source Obedience training can also help dogs focus and release their energy on something more productive and welcome than mounting. Standard obedience training includes basic commands like “heel,” “sit,” “down,” and “stay.” The overall goal of an obedience training program is to train your dog to listen to you no matter what the command might be."

For instance, if a dog is displaying other signs of anxiety, like obsessive licking or destructive behavior, he or she might have a serious anxiety issue that needs to be addressed."
