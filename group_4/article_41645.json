      "title": "Try to store the bottle upright.",
      "content": "Try to store the bottle upright. When you've decided where to put the vodka, check to see if you can store the bottle so that it stands upright. If you have to store the vodka bottle on its side, it's more likely to leak so think about storing it somewhere else. [1] X Research source If your bottle of vodka is stopped with a cork, it's even more important to store it upright. If the vodka is on its side and comes into contact with the cork for a long time, the alcohol can slowly eat away at the cork and cause your bottle to leak."

      "title": "Find somewhere with a consistent temperature.",
      "content": "Find somewhere with a consistent temperature. Regardless of if you're storing the vodka for short-term or long-term use, you should store it at a consistent temperature. The temperature shouldn't fluctuate throughout the day from hot to cold. Instead, aim for a constant temperature of 60 to 65Â°F unless you want to store it in the freezer. [2] X Research source If you want to store the vodka for the long term, the basement is a good choice (unless it's right next to a boiler). Avoid storing in extremely hot areas like attics."

      "title": "Use the freezer if you want chilled vodka.",
      "content": "Use the freezer if you want chilled vodka. Although alcohol will actually freeze at very low temperatures, your home freezer won't be able to get that cold. You can store vodka in your freezer if you'd like chilled vodka for drinks. However, freezing the vodka may cause it to seem thicker, though the flavor shouldn't be affected. [3] X Research source Vodka that's been chilled and slightly thickens may actually be better for drinking since it fully coats your mouth. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid storing your vodka in direct sunlight.",
      "content": "Avoid storing your vodka in direct sunlight. This is especially important if it's in a clear bottle. Not only will sunlight speed up evaporation once the bottle is opened, but it can change the taste of the vodka if it's stored in sunlight for a very long time. For the best storage, keep your vodka in a dark place. [5] X Research source If you're storing your vodka (and any other liquors or wine) in a dark place, make sure you have good lighting when you need it. This way, you'll be able to turn on the light and see your collection. If you have to store the bottle in some sunlight, wrap the bottle in black cloth. This will minimize the amount of light reaching the vodka."

      "title": "Select a place that's easy to access.",
      "content": "Select a place that's easy to access. You'll need to find a convenient dry place to store your vodka if you'll be using it frequently. If you're considering long-term storage, the place you choose doesn't necessarily need to be convenient. Decide if you want to store the vodka along with other liquors or if you only need space to store a bottle or 2. Popular ways to store vodka include: [6] X Research source A shelf or cupboard in your kitchen A liquor cabinet A small or full bar"

      "title": "Keep the bottle sealed for as long as you can.",
      "content": "Keep the bottle sealed for as long as you can. An unopened bottle of vodka can be stored indefinitely. Because of this, you should wait to open a bottle until you're actually ready to start drinking it. The alcohol in the vodka starts to slowly evaporate once the seal is broken and the bottle is opened. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source It will take several decades before the opened vodka becomes undrinkable because the alcohol is a preservative."

    {
      "title": "Ensure the seal on your bottle is intact.",
      "content": "Ensure the seal on your bottle is intact. If your vodka is sealed with a cork, make sure the cork is firmly in place since a loose seal could speed up evaporation. If your bottle has a screw top like a cap, make sure it is tightly closed. [9] X Research source If the cork or screw top doesn't seem like it will be secure, you may want to store your vodka in a different bottle or container."

      "title": "Transfer opened vodka to a smaller container.",
      "content": "Transfer opened vodka to a smaller container. If you've opened a bottle of vodka and decided that you want to store it for a prolonged period of time, transfer the remainder of the bottle to a new clean bottle. The new bottle should be small enough that the rest of the vodka fills the bottle and leaves very little room for air in the bottle. [10] X Research source If you continue to store small amounts of vodka in a large and mostly empty bottle of vodka, the vodka is exposed to more and more air. Transferring vodka to a smaller container will slow down oxidation and evaporation."

      "title": "Keep vodka in a flask for a very short term.",
      "content": "Keep vodka in a flask for a very short term. If you'd like to take vodka with you when you're out and about, store vodka in a flask. Most flasks come with small funnels so you can easily transfer the vodka to the flask. Just be sure to use the vodka or remove it within 3 days since prolonged exposure to the metal in the flask can make your vodka taste metallic. When you've emptied the vodka, rinse out your flask and let it air dry."

      "title": "Check the vodka before drinking it again.",
      "content": "Check the vodka before drinking it again. Chances are your bottle of unopened vodka is fine to drink after storing it for an extended period of time. If you've already opened the bottle and it's been a long time since you drank it, check the vodka before mixing up a drink. Throw out the vodka if: [11] X Research source You notice a strange smell It has an unusual or noticeably bad taste It looks different (cloudy or simply looks different than when you bought it)"

      "title": "Clean out your alcohol cabinet periodically.",
      "content": "Clean out your alcohol cabinet periodically. Pure vodka will last for years if stored properly. But if you have vodka that's flavored with natural ingredients, you should be checking it periodically to make sure it's not going bad. It's a good idea to clean through your entire liquor cabinet every 6 months or so. This will encourage you to use up alcohol that has a limited shelf life or throw out alcohol that's no longer good. [12] X Research source Liquors with dairy or natural flavorings often have an expiration date listed on the bottle. Some of these may even benefit from being stored in the refrigerator instead of in the cabinet."

      "content": "Keep beyond the reach of children. If you have young children in your house, you should take extra care to make sure your vodka is out of their reach. Although your children might not go looking for your alcohol, young children are curious and may find it. To prevent accidents, keep alcohol in a high up place and lock the storage container or liquor cabinet. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even if you trust your older children, locking the liquor cabinet is a good idea. If your teen is being pressured by a friend to take your alcohol, a locked cabinet gives your child a good excuse for not giving in to the pressure."
