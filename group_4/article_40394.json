      "title": "Check the height of your boots against the official boot heights.",
      "content": "Check the height of your boots against the official boot heights. Fake boots are taller than real ones; you might only be able to tell this if you have a real pair to compare them to, so either hold an old pair next to this new pair or compare to authentic images online. Real Classic Tall II boots have an 11 ¾ inch (29.845 cm) shaft height, and fake boots can be up to 2 inches (5.08 cm) taller. [1] X Research source The opening of your boots should be wide enough to fold down. If the opening is narrow, your UGG boots are most likely imitations. The Classic Mini II Boot has a 5-inch (12.7 cm) shaft, and the Classic Ultra Mini Boot has a 3 ½-inch (8.89 cm) shaft."

      "title": "Compare the heel label fonts & stitching with images on the UGG website.",
      "content": "Compare the heel label fonts & stitching with images on the UGG website. The heel label, also called “The License Plate,” features accurate fonts and tidy stitching. If the font is large and stylized incorrectly, the boots are counterfeit. The threads on the heel labels of fake UGG boots may also be mismatched and asymmetrical and have wide, sloppy stitching around the perimeter. Since 2016, UGGs brand no longer uses AUSTRALIA as a part of their brandmark."

    {
      "title": "Check to see if the boots were made in China.",
      "content": "Check to see if the boots were made in China. Real UGG brand boots are made in China, not in Australia or New Zealand, as many fake boots claim. This information should be displayed clearly on the label. Some authentic UGG brand boots are also made in Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic. There’s some confusion over where UGGs are made and where the company was founded. The idea for the popular UGGs brand came from Australian surfer Brian Smith when he realized comfortable sheepskin boots from his homeland were not available in his new home of Santa Monica, California. [2] X Research source Smith trademarked the name UGGs, which was the generic name for sheepskin boots in Australia and founded the American company in 1978. While UGGs brand boots were originally imported from Australia, since the early 2000s, most UGGS brand products have been manufactured in Asia. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the box for a separate lid and proper UGG branding.",
      "content": "Check the box for a separate lid and proper UGG branding. Fake UGGs will come in bulky boxes that are hinged and have handles. They may also feature different artwork on their boxes or be very plain. Real UGG boots are delivered in a cardboard box with a separate lid that displays the sun logo on the front and the company name: “UGG” printed on its side. Inside the box, real UGG boots are wrapped in thick, crinkly paper with “UGG” printed on it. Counterfeit UGGs are wrapped in thin plastic with no branding. Authentic UGG products don’t come in a bag unless you buy them in person at an official UGG store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the label on the box for a picture of the product.",
      "content": "Check the label on the box for a picture of the product. Real labels display an accurate picture of the product, and the top half of the barcode is colored. Fake labels may state that the boots were made in New Zealand or Australia and will have a completely black-and-white barcode. [4] X Research source Official UGG packaging is very distinct, with the UGG and Sun logos."

    {
      "title": "Check your boots for any type of hanging tag.",
      "content": "Check your boots for any type of hanging tag. Hanging tags are not used on real UGG products. If you notice a tag, the boots are almost certainly fake. Australian flags displayed on the packaging also indicate that the UGGs are fake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check that the suede and lining are real sheepskin.",
      "content": "Check that the suede and lining are real sheepskin. Synthetic fur is slippery, silky, and feels like plastic. Real UGG boots use fur that is thick, fluffy, and soft to the touch with a creamy color. Counterfeit boots have thin, grey-colored, synthetic fur on the inside that cannot be seen from the top opening. There is a layer of foam between the inner and outer lining of the boot. With genuine sheepskin, the fur is naturally attached to the suede. [5] X Research source Boots marked “machine washable” are counterfeit. Real sheepskin isn’t machine washable. Real sheepskin and wool often have no scent or a light lanolin smell when new. Fake products smell strongly of plastic or other synthetic materials."

      "title": "Bend the sole of your boot and check for the sun patterning.",
      "content": "Bend the sole of your boot and check for the sun patterning. Real UGG boots are easy to bend and walk in, while fake ones are stiff and unyielding. Gently try to move the sole of your boot to see how flexible it is; if it’s difficult to move, the boots may be fake. [6] X Research source Real UGGs feature a logo and sun pattern on the sole, while cheap counterfeits have stiff soles with generic patterning. Real UGG brand boots have comfortable cushioning. Fakes may have thinner soles with less cushioning."

      "title": "Look at the security labels for holographic suns and a QR code.",
      "content": "Look at the security labels for holographic suns and a QR code. Check the foil strip on the label behind the shoe size and the materials label on the left boot. If there isn’t a sewn-in-label, there should be a security sticker on the sole of the left shoe. Turn your boot over to see the holographic UGG label with a sun symbol. If the boots are real, when you turn the boot 90 degrees, the sun will change from black to white. [7] X Research source The sticker also features a scannable QR code that takes you to a page on the official UGG website that verifies the product is genuine. The security label also features different colors in the serial number and QR code."

    {
      "title": "Check the boot for straight seams and even stitching.",
      "content": "Check the boot for straight seams and even stitching. Real UGG boots have high-quality stitch patterns that are uniform without any fraying. Low-quality fakes have crooked seams with sloppy and uneven stitches. Additionally, the fabric covering the join between the upper and sole is smooth around the shoe on real UGGs, but fakes may have bumps."

    {
      "title": "Compare the logos to the ones on the official website.",
      "content": "Compare the logos to the ones on the official website. The logos on the packaging, labels, and License Plate have thin, well-defined letters that overlap slightly, with the middle “G” appearing larger and standing out from the other letters. Check images of the genuine product on the official UGG website to get a good idea of how the real logos look. [8] X Research source According to the UGG website, newer authentic products may not have a registered trademark symbol ®. As of 2016, UGG no longer includes AUSTRALIA in the logo on the product or packaging."

      "title": "See if the toe box slopes down to touch the ground at the front.",
      "content": "See if the toe box slopes down to touch the ground at the front. Genuine UGG brand boots gradually slope down from the instep to the toe. The tip of the boot touches the floor at the very tip of the boot. [9] X Research source Fake UGGs often have a pointier toe and the front of the boot curves up slightly at the toe."

    {
      "title": "Try on the boot to check for generous sizing.",
      "content": "Try on the boot to check for generous sizing. Real UGG boots are notorious for running large. Because they stretch and mold to your feet as you wear them, it’s better to buy a smaller size. If you buy a pair of UGGs in your regular shoe size and they feel snug, they may be counterfeit. [10] X Research source Sizing can vary from brand to brand, so it’s best to combine sizing with other red flags to determine authenticity."

      "title": "Check the website address for misspellings and encryption.",
      "content": "Check the website address for misspellings and encryption. Look for “https” before the web address to determine if the website is legitimate . The “s” in “https” means the site uses encryption to protect your data. Also, look for numbers taking the place of words or letters, as in www.uggs4sale.net. [11] X Research source Misspelling official product names is a common sign that a website is not selling authentic UGG brand products. For example, they may call a boot the Classic Shorty instead of the Classic Short Boot II ."

      "title": "Scan the website for blurry images and grammatical issues.",
      "content": "Scan the website for blurry images and grammatical issues. Scam websites selling fake products can look less professional than real webstores. Check out product descriptions for misspelled words or bad grammar. Legitimate websites have well-lighted, high-quality images. A website with blurry, low-res images of UGG products is not an authorized retailer. Sharp images aren’t always a sign of a legitimate website. Counterfeit sites often use images stolen from the official UGG website."

    {
      "title": "Read customer reviews for any mention of fake products.",
      "content": "Read customer reviews for any mention of fake products. Legitimate websites have a mix of reviews ranging from 5 stars to 1. Take any site that has all 5-star reviews with a grain of salt. Many scam retailers pay for people to post fraudulent reviews to make their business seem legitimate. [12] X Research source Look for the website on a third-party review site like Trustpilot to see if they are trustworthy."

    {
      "title": "Review the Contact Us area for real contact information.",
      "content": "Review the Contact Us area for real contact information. Legitimate online businesses have a contact page with a specific email address and working phone number. If there’s only a contact form, the site probably isn’t very responsive to customers having issues. This signals they aren’t really concerned about customer service. [13] X Research source Legitimate online businesses often have multiple ways to contact their customer service department. Sometimes fraudulent websites list a phone number that isn’t in service. If you see a phone number, give it a call to see if anyone answers."

      "title": "Compare pricing with what’s on authorized websites.",
      "content": "Compare pricing with what’s on authorized websites. Because of the quality materials and careful craftsmanship used to create authentic UGG brand products, they cost more than low-quality fakes. While retailers may offer sales on real UGGs, significantly lower prices may be fakes."

      "content": "Authorized stores and websites also sell authentic UGG products. UGG also works with authorized retailers and affiliate online stores to sell authentic products. Most of these authorized retailers also sell UGG boots in their online stores. Authorized retailers include stores like Nordstrom , Macy’s, Footlocker , and DSW . Find authorized stores in your area by visiting the UGG locations page. Zappos and Amazon are also affiliate online stores. Just remember, when you buy from Amazon, only buy from the official Amazon UGG store . Amazon allows many different sellers to offer products, watch for counterfeits as you shop."

      "content": "How can you make sure you’re buying a real UGG brand product? The only way to be absolutely certain you are purchasing authentic UGGs brand products is to buy from UGG, the official website, and authorized retailers and their websites. While UGGs brand does everything they can to limit the number of counterfeits on the market, there are still websites that sell fakes. [15] X Research source Counterfeits are most often purchased online through auction sites and trade boards. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "What should you do if you bought boots from an unauthorized seller?",
      "content": "What should you do if you bought boots from an unauthorized seller? Ask for an exchange or refund . If you bought the item from an auction site or trade board, the seller may not have known they were selling a fake. If they don’t respond, report them to the auction site and dispute the charge with your bank or credit card company. [17] X Research source If you believe the seller is knowingly selling counterfeit goods report the fraud to the authorities."

      "title": "What if my boots don’t have a registered trademark symbol ®?",
      "content": "What if my boots don’t have a registered trademark symbol ®? If your UGG brand boots are newer than 2016, they may not have a registered trademark symbol ® next to the logo. According to the official UGG website, as they update their styles and design concepts, the labels, outsoles, interior tags, and boxes may change to reflect their new direction. This means that some products may not have the ®."
    },
    {
      "title": "Does buying from an unauthorized seller mean the boot is fake?",
      "content": "Does buying from an unauthorized seller mean the boot is fake? UGG brand boots purchased from unauthorized retailers, auction sites, and trade boards aren’t necessarily counterfeit. However, the chances of finding a counterfeit in those places are greatly increased because the seller doesn’t have an official relationship with the UGGs brand. [18] X Research source Remember, even though Amazon is an authorized seller for UGGs brand products, they allow others to sell through their platform who may sell counterfeit products."
    },
    {
      "title": "Is the product counterfeit if my order shipped from China?",
      "content": "Is the product counterfeit if my order shipped from China? While most UGGs brand products are manufactured in China, the company does not ship from that country. The official website states that all products must go through a quality control process, so they ship from their warehouses in the United States."
