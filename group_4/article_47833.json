      "content": "If you're covered in pockets, everyone knows you're a tourist. Cargo pants, cargo shorts, travel vests... if the goal of your outfit is storage space, you're going to stick out. Similarly, safari clothes and hiking clothes are great for the grand outdoors, but not so much for the center of Vienna. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "These are instant tourist markers. If you need to secure your documents and cash, hide it under your clothing in a money belt or a subtle neck pouch instead. If you have a lot to carry, an over-the-shoulder bag stands out a bit less than a backpack. [3] X Research source Pickpocketing is mostly a risk in the biggest, most tourist-filled cities, so those are where a subtle storage option is most important. If you're in a low-crime area, wearing a backpack might make you blend in a bit less, but it's not disrespectful or risky."

      "content": "Wear shorts only in informal outdoor settings. The etiquette around shorts varies a lot from place to place, but they are increasingly normal summertime wear for an outdoor stroll, especially in southern Europe. That said, you'll look out of place if you wear them to a museum or as a guest in someone's home, and may not be allowed into a nice restaurant. [4] X Research source Many places of worship won't let you in if your clothing doesn't cover your knees, shoulders, and most of your chest. Definitely plan around this if you want to see the many impressive Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim holy sites (mostly in southern and Eastern Europe)."

      "content": "Don't wear gym clothes outside. Europeans almost never wear sweatpants or yoga pants out on the street, and even white athletic socks aren't too common. A sweatshirt or hoodie isn't a complete \"no,\" depending on the city and your age, but aim for \"smart casual\" instead if you want to look closer to the average pedestrian. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Sports jerseys and athletic shorts are only worn in some regions. In northern Europe especially, people don't often wear clothes you could play sports in while they're off the field. In some southern countries like Spain, athletic clothing is a lot more common, but it does tend to be on the nice side—not the same scuffed items you actually wear to games. [6] X Research source Tracksuits have a unique history in Eastern Europe and the UK. You might see them on the street, but wearing one yourself sends out some fairly complicated class and subculture signals! [7] X Research source"

Plenty of Europeans wear a T-shirt and jeans, but compared to the USA, these clothes tend to be a much snugger fit (for all genders). [8] X Research source If you want a simple outfit that still fits Europe's \" smart casual \" style, think slim or skinny jeans (often dark-colored or grey and undistressed), and a T-shirt that fits your frame.

Feel free to pack a comfortable pair of tennis shoes, as long as they aren't too shabby. [10] X Research source There is a stereotype that sneakers (especially white ones) are \"American\" and \"touristy,\" but that's getting more outdated every year. [11] X Research source Don't go too far in the other direction and only pack high heels! Getting around European cities can mean a lot of walking over cobblestones, so comfortable, broken-in shoes are important. [12] X Research source"

Europe is more muted in its clothing choices than, say, Latin America, but what exactly that means can vary a ton by country and season. In general, if you're used to wearing outfits with bright colors and bold patterns, consider paring it down a bit—unless you want to have fun startling the Swedes! [14] X Research source In general, northern countries and colder seasons lead to duller outfits. A Scandinavian crowd in winter can look nearly monochrome. [15] X Research source Southern regions and summer weather means brighter clothes. A Spanish summer might feature warm but muted colors, stripes, and simple patterns. [16] X Research source"

There are a few famous teams (like the Yankees) that have made it abroad as a generic symbol of US coolness—not a sign of any personal connection.

A big Old Navy or Abercrombie logo across your chest is a pretty clear sign that you didn't buy your clothes from the shop around the corner.

Announcing that you're from abroad may not make a good first impression, especially in places where locals can be tired of tourists. Even local flags and symbols could be a bad idea depending on regional politics, or just local custom. For example, wearing a German flag in Germany could be seen as a bit weird.
