Fill up a spray bottle with water, and spray a 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) spot on a piece of red clothing. Blot the wet spot with a paper towel, and inspect the paper towel to see if any dye transferred. If your paper towel is red, your clothing may bleed. To release the additional color, soak your clothing in a bowl of cold water for about 30 minutes. This should get rid of the remaining pigment. Then, wash the clothing with other red garments. If there is no red on the paper towel, it is safe to wash with other colors like orange, pink, and purple."
