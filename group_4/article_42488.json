Using these ties makes it easy to secure the contents of the bag. Gather the entire opening of the bag, close and place the twist tie around it."

Be sure to follow the rules for bin placement and pick up. You should set the trash out on time so that it does not pile up. You can find your neighborhood’s trash pick up schedule with a quick online search. Most residents receive this information by mail from their local waste management service. It is generally provided when the trash pick up service is first scheduled. If you place your trash in a community dumpster, replace the lid after dropping your trash bag into it. This will prevent rodents and animals from entering the dumpster."

      "content": "Keep trash bags on hand. You can find trash bags at the grocery store and most retail establishments. Trash cans are standard in size, especially those used in the kitchen.

      "title": "Press down the contents of the bag (optional).",
      "content": "Press down the contents of the bag (optional). Compress trash into the trash bag as much as you can while it is still in the trash can. This process maximizes the amount of available space so that you can place more trash into the bag. Compacting the trash can yield cost savings because you will buy trash bags less often. Be careful not to tear the trash bag when compressing the contents. Do not use your hand to compress trash. This could result in injury if there are unseen sharp objects in the trash. You can use a hand held compressor instead. Use an electronic trash compacter to reduce the volume of your trash. An electronic trash compactor can turn six bags of trash into one bag.

      "title": "Remove overflowing trash.",
      "content": "Remove overflowing trash. If you are unable to compress overflowing trash, place the overflow into a new bag. If there is a lot of room left in the overflow bag, it may be best to place it into the trash can until it is full. If you have a trash can that is not lined with a bag, place a bag over the top of the trash can, then turn the can upside down. This will allow the contents to fall into the bag. Take your time so that you do not drop trash all over the floor."

      "title": "Remove sharp or other hazardous objects.",
      "content": "Remove sharp or other hazardous objects. Keep a look out for hazardous items, such as broken glass, knives, and toxic substances. These items require special handling for disposal. Put on gloves. It is a good practice to use gloves when handling trash. This is especially true if the trash contains liquids. Secure sharp objects so that they do not harm you or anyone else who may encounter them. For example, place broken glass in a labeled and puncture resistant container. You can use a box as the container. Place the box labeled “broken glass” in the designated trash pick up location. Biohazardous medical waste (such as sharps and needles), must be disposed of in separate containers and returned to a drop-off centre (such as a pharmacy) because they can spread disease. Electronics, acids, paint, pesticides, empty chemical containers (due to residues), light bulbs (especially fluorescents due to their mercury content), and batteries are examples of hazardous items that must be recycled. These items should not go in the trash or curbside recycling. You can contact your local waste management company or government for questions about toxic substance disposal."
