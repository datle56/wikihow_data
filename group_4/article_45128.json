You can receive Time Sensitive Notifications within the Messages app and from third-party social media apps such as Snapchat . You can even receive these notifications while in a Focus mode . Since the app developers decide what qualifies as an urgent notification, there's no way to label or tag a notification as urgent yourself. When you have a Focus mode enabled, such as Do Not Disturb or Sleep mode, all notifications are paused by default. However, you can allow critical alerts or urgent messages to be delivered normally. If you find all notifications distracting, you can turn off Time Sensitive Notifications while you're in a Focus mode."
