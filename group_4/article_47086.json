If you aren't sure, list all possible email addresses you may have used. The first and last name connected to the account. Your date of birth. The country and postal or ZIP code at the time of registration. A detailed description of one or two images you remember in the account. If you remember any album or sub-album names, list them. List the new email address to connect to your account. Take a clear selfie while holding up a sheet of paper that displays today's date, and attach the photo to the message. If Photobucket can confirm that you're the account owner, they'll add your new email address to your account, which will allow you to reset your password and regain access to your photos."

      "content": "Although Photobucket removed their site-wide search tool, you can use Google to find someone's Photobucket username or address. The Photobucket search bar now only searches your own photos, which can be handy if you have lots of photos with unique titles, keywords in their descriptions, or image tags. But if you're trying to find a Photobucket user and don't remember their account name, the Photobucket search tool won't be helpful. But don't worry—you can use Google! Go to https://www.google.com in any web browser. Type the person's name—either the username you suspect they use on Photobucket, or their first and last name. You might also try the username they use on another social media platform like Instagram or Twitter. Type a space, and then type + \"Photobucket\" . For example, if you're looking for Kim Kardashian's Photobucket, you'd type Kim Kardashian + \"Photobucket\" . [7] X Research source Look for search results that begin with https://app.photobucket.com/u/ , as these are Photobucket accounts. If you were looking for your own username, you'll find it after the /u in the URL. Searching Google will also be helpful if you've forgotten your Photobucket username and need help getting back in to your account."
