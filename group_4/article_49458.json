    {
      "title": "Make a list of everyone you want to thank.",
      "content": "Make a list of everyone you want to thank. This is a great first step to take so you don't forget someone important. If you will be talking to a large audience, feel free to be vague about who you are addressing. For example, say \"I want to thank all my teachers\" rather than listing their names, and say “I want to thank my friends” rather than naming everyone. This is quicker and less likely to make some feel left out. If you are talking to close friends or family, address the people you are thanking by name. Write down every person or group of people that comes to mind. You can edit this later on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down why you want to thank those people.",
      "content": "Write down why you want to thank those people. Unless you have a very short amount of time to speak, you should expand your speech to include why you are thankful towards these individuals. Write down words or phrases about why you are thankful towards these friends, family members, coaches, professors, and so on. [1] X Research source Be honest about why you are thanking someone. The reasoning here can be very simple. For example, “My history teacher always made me laugh,” or “My mom woke me up every morning” are good reasons to thank someone. The more heartfelt the gratitude, the better. Take time to reflect on your feelings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write down any other thoughts you have about this topic.",
      "content": "Write down any other thoughts you have about this topic. Freewrite about the topic of graduation and being thankful. Jot down any thought that relates to being thankful and graduating from your school or program. You may find some interesting ideas or things you want to say that didn’t come up before. Remember, there is no wrong way to brainstorm. Just keep writing. Continue to freewrite until you cannot think of anything else to say, and for at least 30 minutes. Now, you’ve brainstormed about your speech, so it is time to write it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the introduction of the speech.",
      "content": "Write the introduction of the speech. The introduction of the speech should be interesting and engage the audience. Some strategies you can use are: beginning with a rhetorical question, a quote, or a short anecdote. Any strategy is fine as long as it relates to being thankful and graduating. Try to keep this to 2-5 sentences (or 2 paragraphs for a speech longer than 5 minutes). [2] X Research source A few examples are: “What are you thankful for?” This is beginning with a rhetorical question, since the audience will not answer. As Willie Nelson once said, \"When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around.\" This is beginning with a quote. “It was the first day of high school, and I stood outside the door of my first class, scared to go in. On the last day of high school, I left that same door feeling thankful.” This is beginning with an anecdote."

    {
      "title": "Write the body of the speech.",
      "content": "Write the body of the speech. This is where you get to thank your friends, family, teachers, and so on in depth. Look at your brainstorming notes, and write 1-2 paragraphs where you say who you want to thank and why in complete sentences. (2-3 for a speech longer than 5 minutes). Don’t spend more than 2-3 sentences talking about a single person unless you really want to emphasize being thankful towards them. For example, you can say, “I would like to thank my friends and family for always inspiring me when I felt hopeless.” Another example is, “I want to thank Professor Z for helping me choose a major.” The body of the speech comes immediately after the introduction. Avoid insulting or offending those you are speaking to. Do not vent about problems or criticize others during this speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the conclusion of the speech.",
      "content": "Write the conclusion of the speech. Write 1-2 sentences (1 paragraph for a speech that is longer than 5 minutes) that summarize everything you just said. Make sure to refer back to your theme and tie everything together in these 1-2 sentences. The conclusion comes after the body of the speech, and it can be very simple. For example, you can just say “Thank you again.” Another simple example is, “Once again, I am so lucky to have such great friends and family. Thank you.” You can end on thanking someone by saying, “The last person I want to thank is my grandma. She was always there for me. Good night.” An anecdote is a great way to end a speech, as well as a wonderful quote from the Romans, Victorians, or a world-famous leader. You could also end the speech with your own words of hope and well wishes. Keep the audience engaged by inviting them to do something physical. You might say \"Can we all stand up?\" or \"I want you to shout 'I love this life!'\""
