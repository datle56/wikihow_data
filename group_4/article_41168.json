      "content": "Look for round patches of hair loss with a flaky scalp. The most common cause of pediatric hair loss is tinea capitis – also called “ringworm,” this is actually a fungal infection of the scalp. Look at your child’s scalp. Suspect ringworm if they have round or oval patches of hair loss with some broken off hairs visible just above the skin of their scalp. Hairs can look like little black dots on the scalp. Other indications of ringworm are gray flakes or scales on the scalp. The child may also have ringworm on other parts of their body. Look for a small, red ring with a clear, flaky center."

Look for broken hairs or small black spots on the scalp that indicate hair follicles are still present. 1 in 1,000 children experience alopecia areata – complete balding with total hair loss in round or oval patches. This may be due to an immune response, and can happen overnight."

      "content": "Recall if there are recent traumas in the child’s life. A physically or emotionally traumatic event can interrupt the natural growth process of a child’s hair and cause total or partial hair loss. Even taking some medications can affect the body in this way. This is a disorder called telogen effluvium . Hair loss can occur 6-16 weeks after the traumatic event. Think back to 1-4 months ago, and note whether your child experienced any of the following: High fever Surgery during which general anesthesia was used Severe emotional distress, such as with death of a loved one or abuse Severe physical injury Use of the medication Accutane for acne"

      "content": "Take your child to their doctor. Get pediatric hair loss diagnosed by your doctor so it can be accurately treated. There are several tests the doctor can do to determine the cause of the problem. They will check for ringworm with a Wood’s lamp – a UV lamp that shows fungus on the skin. Other problems can be diagnosed with a physical exam, history, and possibly a blood test."

      "content": "Treat ringworm with oral medicine and shampoo for 8 weeks. Ringworm is treatable, but takes a while to go away completely. Depending on how severe the infection is, your child may have to both take an oral medication daily and use an antifungal shampoo (selenium sulfide or ketoconazole) 2-3 times a week. Use the shampoo as indicated on the bottle or as directed by your doctor. If your child uses the shampoo and takes their medication properly, they shouldn’t be contagious. There’s no need to keep them out of school. It is very important to use both treatment methods for the full 8 weeks! Otherwise it’s likely the ringworm will return and you’ll have to start treatment from the beginning."

Do positive, fun, distracting activities with them like reading, playing outside, and providing warm physical contact."

      "content": "Work with a behavioral therapist to ease problematic hair pulling. If your child is constantly pulling on their hair or pulling their hair out, they may have a disorder called trichotillomania . The child may also eat the hair they pull out. This is a habit similar to but not the same as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that causes the child to pluck or twirl their hair. Trichotillomania is more common in those with OCD, but not necessarily related. Consult a behavioral therapist like a counselor, psychiatrist, or psychologist if you notice these symptoms. They can use talk therapy and behavioral modifications to help ease your child’s symptoms. Hair will usually re-grow normally once the child stops pulling on it."

      "content": "Telogen effluvium is a relatively rapid loss of hair related to stress. A sudden stress, such as a high fever, the death of a loved one, surgery under general anesthesia, severe injury or after the use of certain medications, can cause the hair growth cycle to shift, which results in unusual thinning or shedding of the hair. After the stress stops, a full recovery of hair growth can be expected within 6 months to a year. If hair shedding persists, more medical attention will be needed to see if it is related to other disorders.
