    {
      "title": "Check the wording or spelling.",
      "content": "Check the wording or spelling. This is one of the quickest and easiest ways to tell if the glasses are fake. A fake pair might say \"inspired by\", \"like\", or simply misspell the word \"Gucci.” Look at every part of the sunglasses to check for misspellings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the inner side of the sunglasses.",
      "content": "Look at the inner side of the sunglasses. All Gucci eyewear is made in Italy or Japan. [1] X Research source Sunglasses are made by the Safilo Group. There should be a CE (\"Conformité European\", which means \"European Conformity.”) after the manufacturer location, which will say \"Made in Italy\" or \"Made in Japan.\" [2] X Research source Scratch the paint that says “Made in Italy” or \"Made in Japan.\" If the paint comes off, then the sunglasses are likely fake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for the model number.",
      "content": "Check for the model number. After the letters GG (stands for Guccio Gucci) there should be a model number. The model number will have four numbers followed by an “S” for sunglasses. Look up this model number on the internet . The sunglasses that come up in the search should look like your sunglasses. Sometimes, counterfeiters will put a model number on the glasses that matches a different type of glasses. [3] X Research source You can also look for the color code. The color code should have five digits/numbers, which can be all letters, all numbers, or a mix."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the nose pads.",
      "content": "Look at the nose pads. If there are nose pads, inspect them. The Gucci logo should be engraved on the metal piece in the middle. Many fake Gucci sunglasses do not have this on the nose pads. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Do a polarization test.",
      "content": "Do a polarization test . Sunglasses may not be polarized, even if they are dark. Put on the sunglasses and look at your computer monitor from different angles. If the glasses turn dark at some point, then they are polarized. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the hinges.",
      "content": "Inspect the hinges. Hinges on real Gucci sunglasses should not be made of plastic or have screws attaching the hinges to the frame. In fact, there shouldn’t be any screws at all on your sunglasses. After you’ve checked the hinges, test their movement. They should move fluidly without getting stuck. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the weight.",
      "content": "Check the weight. Fake sunglasses are typically made of cheaper, lighter materials. Real Gucci sunglasses should have a not heavy, but significant weight when held in your hand. You can look up online at the Gucci store what the weight for your particular model of sunglasses should be. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure you have a certificate of authenticity and warranty.",
      "content": "Make sure you have a certificate of authenticity and warranty. Real Gucci sunglasses come with a certificate of authenticity and warranty that can be found inside of the packaging. The certificate of authenticity should come as a card in an envelope. The back of the card should have information about the color and style of the sunglasses. Compare the information on the card with your sunglasses to make sure they match. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the retail box.",
      "content": "Check the retail box. Real Gucci sunglasses should come in a Gucci box. The box should say “Gucci” in a logo and font that matches the Gucci on your sunglasses. Newer models of boxes are usually brown with gold lettering, but older models will vary the color and style of the packaging. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that fake sunglasses can be put into real packaging."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look at the carry case.",
      "content": "Look at the carry case. A carry case should come inside of the box. The logo and font should match the box and glasses as well. Inspect the carry case to make sure that the stitching is even and straight. Newer carry cases are usually brown with gold lettering, but older models will vary in style. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the brown cloth.",
      "content": "Inspect the brown cloth. A dust cloth should come with the box and carry case. The cloth should have the Gucci logo in the center that is consistent with the logo and font of the sunglasses, box, and carry case. Even if you have an older model, the dust cloth should be consistent in style with your other accessories."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the plastic bag.",
      "content": "Check the plastic bag. The sunglasses should come packaged inside of a plastic bag. The plastic bag will have a manufacturer’s sticker placed on top of the plastic. Check the sticker to make sure that the details match up with your sunglasses."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy from a Gucci store.",
      "content": "Buy from a Gucci store. The best and most reliable way to make sure you’re purchasing real Gucci sunglasses is to buy directly from a Gucci store. This way, there will be no doubt or need to check the sunglasses to make sure that they’re real. Not every area has a Gucci store, but Gucci does have a store that you can purchase from directly online. [11] X Research source If ordering from Gucci online, make sure that your package has not been opened or tampered with in any way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Purchase glasses from upscale retailers.",
      "content": "Purchase glasses from upscale retailers. If you can’t buy directly from Gucci, the next best way to assure that the sunglasses are real is to buy from a reliable retailer. For example, Bloomingdale’s, Neiman Marcus, or Nordstrom are some reliable luxury department stores that sell Gucci products. These department stores are sometimes found in standalone locations, but often they are found in malls."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure the online store has a return policy.",
      "content": "Make sure the online store has a return policy. If you must buy from an online retailer that is not Gucci or an upscale department store, then make sure a return policy is offered. Only buy the sunglasses if there is a conditional return policy, and if the seller is trusted and has good ratings. This will give you the chance to inspect the sunglasses for authenticity before deciding to keep or return them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid buying from street vendors.",
      "content": "Avoid buying from street vendors. You will often see street vendors selling what they claim to be “luxury” items on busy streets. More often than not, the goods will be fake. You can tell this by the price of the products and by a quick inspection. Unless you are okay with fake goods, avoid street vendors."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the price.",
      "content": "Check the price. Gucci sunglasses are known for being notoriously expensive. The price is usually at or above $200. It's unlikely that an authentic pair of sunglasses will be much cheaper than that price."
