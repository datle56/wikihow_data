      "content": "No—you cannot transfer your iTunes credit to another person. Existing balance and credit in your Apple account cannot be transferred to another user while it's in your account. If your balance was redeemed from a gift card and you haven't spent the original amount, you can request to have the balance returned to the original gift card. After replacing the balance, you'll be able to give the gift card to someone else. The new recipient will then be able to redeem the gift card balance on their own account. [1] X Research source To do this, you must contact Apple to request a return of the balance to the original gift card, and the full balance must be unspent. You can always check an Apple gift card balance . iTunes credit cannot be traded in for cash or added to your Apple Pay cash balance."
