      "content": "Identify the 6 pieces. There are 6 pieces to this puzzle. For clarity, the piece that has a partial notch in the middle with a square protruding underneath the notch will be #1. The piece with 1 short, rectangular notch and L-shaped sides will be #2. The piece that has 1 square notch and 1 small rectangular notch will be #3. The piece with 1 long rectangular notch will be #4. The piece with a partial notch in the middle that makes an L-shape will be #5. The long rectangular piece with no notches will be #6.

Then find the piece with 1 short, rectangular notch with L-shaped sides. Fit them together so the piece with the square fits horizontally into the vertical piece with the L-shaped sides. The notch on the vertical piece should face toward you and the square shape on the other piece should face to the left and toward the vertical piece. [2] X Research source"
