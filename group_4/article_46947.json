This means no communication whatsoever—no seeing them in person, texting, chatting on the phone, emailing, or messaging on social media.

Whether you're using the no-contact rule to move on from your relationship or to win your ex back, it's a good idea to let your ex know that you won't be talking to them for a while. [2] X Research source Here are some ways you can phrase it: [3] X Research source If you’re trying to win your ex back : “I really like you, but I need time to think about everything” or “I think spending some time apart would be good for both of us.” If you’re trying to move on: “You’re important to me, but this doesn’t feel right anymore. I need some time to think about me” or “I want us to be friends, but I need some space before I can do that.”"

Here are some signs that your ex has changed and wants you back after 30 days of no contact: [5] X Research source They start showing that they're worried about you by sending texts or leaving voicemails. They apologize for hurting you. They express that they want to make things up to you by saying so or surprising you with gifts."

Write down any fears or insecurities that are popping in your head and list ways you can soothe them. Write a letter to your future self about the situation.
