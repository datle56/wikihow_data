A second-degree burn typically causes blisters to form. If this happens, call your doctor’s office and ask for advice. They may want to examine the burn to determine if it needs treatment. [1] X Research source If you notice blisters at the burn site, leave them alone. Your doctor can safely drain the blisters for you if they think it’s necessary."
