In the story, the Prophet Muhammad travels from Mecca to Jerusalem to heaven in one night. In the end, Allah tells him to pray five times a day. [1] X Research source In Islam, the Prophet Muhammad is believed to be the last in a long line of prophets, including Moses and Jesus, and was chosen to be the messenger of Allah. His sayings are written in the Hadith, where the story of Isra and Mi’raj are. [2] X Research source When Muhammad first reaches heaven, Allah tells him to pray 50 times a day.

      "content": "Daily prayers purify Muslims and provide spiritual rejuvenation. Muslims use time in prayer to reflect on their actions earlier in the day, seek forgiveness for sins, and renew and rejuvenate their spirit. Allah knows what you do, so prayer is a way to take away wrongful or immoral actions from their record before Allah weighs their good deeds against their sins after death. [4] X Research source For example, the first prayer allows them to reflect on what they did yesterday and ask for forgiveness for what they’ve done or ask for strength before they start their day. [5] X Research source Daily prayers are also important because they allow Muslims to follow in the footsteps of the prophets and give their gratitude to Allah. [6] X Research source"

Daily prayers (Salat): Muslims pray five times a day facing the direction of Mecca, the birthplace of Muhammed, and where the Ka’ba (or Kaaba) holy site is located. Giving alms or charity (Zakat): Although this pillar isn’t defined in the Qu’ran, Muslims believe they are meant to share their wealth with those less fortunate and often donate a fixed portion of their income to community members in need. [34] X Research source Fasting during Ramadan (Sawm or Saum) During Ramadan, healthy adult Muslims refrain from eating or drinking from dawn to dusk. This practice is not only to show gratitude for all that Allah has provided, but it’s a reminder of the religious duty to help those who are in need.
