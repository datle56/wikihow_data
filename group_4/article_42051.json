      "content": "Choose an activity that he wants to try so you can spend the day with him. Pick a time on or near his birthday when you’re sure you’re both free, and select an activity that he likes or has mentioned wanting to do, such as skiing or go-karting. Purchase any necessary passes or tickets in advance, and don’t tell him where you’re going until you get there! For example, you can take your boyfriend to the batting cages to hit baseballs, or go see a movie that he’s been dying to see. If he likes outdoor activities, you might plan a trip to a local state park for a day of hiking and biking as well as a picnic. On a rainy day, you might have to stay inside. If that's the case, opt for a day at the museum, visit a new restaurant, or have a movie marathon at home."

      "content": "Plan an outing with his friends for the day if you’re busy. Send his close friends a quick message and let them know that you want to plan a surprise for him. Invite them over for a day of movies or sports, or plan an outing for them that includes dinner and an activity that they like to do together.

      "content": "Prepare a romantic dinner for a nice night at home. If your boyfriend works or goes to school all day on his birthday, get home before he does and make a special meal for him. Choose all of his favorite foods, light some candles, and get dressed up. Send him a text in the middle of the day to let him know that you’re making dinner for his special day so he has something to look forward to! [2] X Research source It might be helpful to check beforehand to make sure that he doesn’t have any plans that evening. If you know he doesn’t, you can keep it a surprise until he gets home! Try to select a meal that you know he likes, or pick a type of cuisine that you both love to eat. For a great Italian dish, you can make chicken parmesan, or chicken alfredo. If he likes spicy food, try making some Thai food or a new Indian curry dish . If you don’t live together, make dinner at your house and transport it to his house, or plan with a roommate or family member to let you into the house so you can prepare dinner there."

      "content": "Pick one of his interests to base your gift around if he has a specific hobby. If your boyfriend has a special hobby or interest that he spends a lot of time doing, pay attention to what he needs. If you’re not sure what to get, try asking one of his friends with the same interests what he would be interested in, since they’ll have a bit more insight. [4] X Research source For example, if he likes to listen to music, you could invest in a pair of high-end, noise-cancelling headphones. If he likes cooking, you can get him a professional set of knives and a cookbook."

      "content": "Choose an item that he’ll use a lot if he likes practical gifts. Opt for a utility item, like a wallet, a backpack, or a tool if your boyfriend likes gifts that he can use over and over. Select a durable item that gets great reviews, and ask for recommendations from friends and family. He’ll be reminded of you every time he uses that item, and you know he’ll be able to enjoy it for a long time. [5] X Research source For instance, you could get a leather belt for your boyfriend if he has to wear business clothes to work. If your boyfriend travels often, you could get him a durable piece of luggage or a duffle bag."

You can also include “coupons” in the book for things like a movie night, a massage, or an offer to get out of a chore for free. Let your boyfriend know he can use them any time! [6] X Research source This is a great way to give a thoughtful gift without breaking the bank, since you only need pictures, cardstock, markers, and a scrapbook."
