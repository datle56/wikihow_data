      "content": "Instead of leaving your fingers there, move your two fingers over to the right. Make sure your fingers are relatively close together. Your fingers can either be positioned so that your middle finger runs along the seam, or so that the seam runs directly in the middle of both fingers. Experiment with what works best for you.

      "title": "Move your thumb over so that it's diametrically opposed to your top two fingers.",
      "content": "Move your thumb over so that it's diametrically opposed to your top two fingers. Diametrically opposed just means that if you extended both fingers in the same direction, they would eventually form a perfect circle. Think of the ball like a clock. If your thumb on a normal two-seam grip is at 6 o'clock, your thumb now should be at a 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock position."

      "title": "Turn in your wrist slightly in the direction of your thumb.",
      "content": "Turn in your wrist slightly in the direction of your thumb. For right-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the left. For left-handed pitchers, this means turning your wrist slightly to the right."

      "title": "Lead with the middle finger.",
      "content": "Lead with the middle finger. When throwing a two-seam fastball, [2] X Research source put extra pressure on your middle finger. This will create a natural spin on the ball that will help it cut."

      "title": "Start off by gripping the ball as would a four-seam fastball.",
      "content": "Start off by gripping the ball as would a four-seam fastball . A four-seam fastball is gripped with the index and middle fingers going perpendicular across the U-shaped seams. Your two fingers should touch the seams of the baseball in four places: the bottom of both fingers and the top."

      "title": "Move your two fingers together and slightly to the right, placing extra pressure on your middle finger.",
      "content": "Move your two fingers together and slightly to the right, placing extra pressure on your middle finger. This will help create the cut in your fastball, as the last finger that touches the ball will be the middle finger."

      "title": "Keep your thumb in the bottom position, or perhaps up on the inside of the ball, anchoring.",
      "content": "Keep your thumb in the bottom position, or perhaps up on the inside of the ball, anchoring. Your thumb and your top fingers may not be exactly diametrically opposed, but they should be pretty comfortable."

      "content": "Hide the cut grip in your glove going into the windup. You don't want to telegraph your pitch until the exact moment you release the baseball. Tipping the hitter off early could ruin the surprise of the pitch. [3] X Research source"

Extend your arm fully as you deliver the pitch."
