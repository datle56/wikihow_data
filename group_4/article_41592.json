      "content": "Store ripe, cut mangoes in the fridge in an airtight container. As Dulaney explains, once a mango is cut, the fruit will start to oxidize (or turn brown). This is a natural process, but it can make the fruit look unpleasant. To prevent this, Dulaney recommends storing pieces of cut mango in an airtight container, or only cutting the amount of mango you need, and then wrapping the rest of the whole fruit in Saran Wrap before refrigerating."

Add a banana to the paper bag to help the mango ripen even faster. [4] X Research source If you don’t have a paper bag, place your mangoes in a ventilated container in a dark space. Check on your mangoes every 2 days until they are ripe. Depending on when you bought your mangoes, they can take up to 8 days to ripen."

      "content": "Cut mangoes into cubes or slices to freeze . Have a ripe mango but don’t want to enjoy it just yet? Try freezing it! Cut the mango into smaller pieces so they’ll freeze evenly. Aim to make the pieces small enough that you can keep them in a plastic freezer bag or container. [6] X Research source Gray recommends cutting the mango parallel to its large seed, then scoring the flesh from the skin into small cubes using the tip of a knife. Most people peel the skin off mangoes when freezing, but this isn’t absolutely necessary. The only difference is that the mangoes may take longer to freeze and thaw. Try using a potato cutter or apple peeler if you’re not comfortable peeling mango skin with a knife."
