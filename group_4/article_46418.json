      "content": "Trim your pubic hair to ¼ in (0.6 cm) long, then wash your bikini area. Depilatory, or hair removal, creams work best on short hair. Just sit in a comfortable position and hold a hand mirror to see your pubic hair. Then, cut your pubic hair ¼ to ½ in (0.6-1.3 cm) long with a clean pair of nail or mustache scissors. Wash your bikini area with soap and water and then pat it dry. [1] X Research source Sit on paper towels or a bath towel to catch the excess hair as you cut. Patch test a small area of skin with Veet 24 hours before you use it. If your skin gets irritated or you develop an allergic reaction, do not use Veet. Exfoliate your bikini area with a sugar scrub or exfoliating glove 24 hours before you use the cream. Exfoliating removes dead skin cells and reduces your risk of ingrown hairs.

Whether you’re cleaning up your bikini line or going entirely bare, squeeze the Veet onto the tip of the applicator that came with the cream. Then, smooth it over all of the pubic hair you want to remove. If your cream didn’t come with an applicator, just slather on the cream with your fingers, making sure not to rub it in.

This can cause an adverse reaction as this area is extremely sensitive. [6] X Research source If you have sensitive skin, use Veet Cream for Sensitive Skin .

Just take a damp washcloth to wipe away a small spot of cream. If your hair comes off with the Veet, wipe off the rest of the cream. If your hair still isn’t budging, let the cream sit for 1 more minute, then check it again.

Simply set a timer to make sure that you don’t leave the cream on for longer than 6 minutes, even if your hair isn’t coming off. If you leave the cream on longer than instructed, it can burn or irritate your skin. [8] X Research source Check the label on your product to verify how long to leave it on your skin."

[9] X Research source Alternatively, use the applicator that came with your product to remove the cream. Just rinse it off first and then swipe off the cream. If you’re removing the cream in the shower, rinse off the washcloth between swipes. If you trimmed your pubic hair, this shouldn’t clog up your drain. If you don’t want to rinse off your washcloth in the shower or sink, get a new washcloth when the first gets covered with Veet and hair."
