      "content": "Understand how the closing mechanism works. A typical bra has two horizontal straps that fasten in the back. One strap has several pairs of eyelets. The other has one pair of hooks that attach to the eyelets. To undo a bra, you must pinch both sides together and slide the hooks out of the eyelets. [1] X Research source Occasionally you may come across a bra that only has one eyelet and one hook, or five eyelets and five hooks. While two or three eyelets and hooks are standard, all of the eyelet-hook bras can be undone in the same way."

      "content": "Know that some bras attach in the front. While these types of bras are not as common as bras that clasp in the back, they do exist. [2] X Research source These types of bras have cups that connect with a clasp at the front. So, if you’re trying to undo a bra and can’t seem to find eyelets and hooks at the back, chances are the bra connects in the front."

    {
      "title": "Place one hand on the end of each strap.",
      "content": "Place one hand on the end of each strap. One hand should be on the eyelet side, one hand on the hook side. Pull the straps slightly away from their back to give yourself room to work with. If the person is facing you, you’ll have to take their bra off without being able to see. Don’t worry! Place one hand on each strap so that one hand can feel the eyelets and the other can feel the hooks. Push the straps slightly away from her back to give yourself room to work with."

      "content": "Push both sides in towards one another to relieve the tension on the connectors. Think of this like a finger trap--if you pull the two straps away from each other, nothing will happen (except for you maybe ripping their bra.) Instead, the key is to push the two straps together.

      "content": "Slide the right side (i.e. the side with the hooks) toward you. Keep the other side stationary to free the hooks from the eyelets. Occasionally one hook might come undone while the other stays connected to the eyelet, especially if you are facing them so you can’t see the bra. Don’t panic! Simply repeat the same motion with your focus concentrated on the remaining hook."

      "content": "Place your fingers on one side of the clasps and your thumb on the other. Keep your fingers and thumb very close to the closing mechanism.

      "content": "Slide the right side (i.e. the side with the hooks) across the left strap. This will free the hooks from the eyelets. It may help to wedge your fingers (if right-handed) or thumb (if left-handed) in front of the eyelets to keep them stationary while you remove the hooks."

      "content": "Put your arms behind your back, reaching from the bottom up. Grasp either side of the hooks/eyelets area and pull the straps slightly away from your back to make room to work with. If you don’t have very flexible arms or think it would be easier to take your bra off at the front of your body where you can see the clasp, take the arm straps off. Once they are off, rotate the bra so that the clasp is in the front. You’ll be able to see what you’re doing which will make taking the bra off easier."
