This is based on your personal preference.

Set your machine to the zigzag stitch setting before you begin sewing. [2] X Research source [3] X Expert Source Seleh Rahman Professional Tailor & Furrier Expert Interview. 25 June 2021. It is fine to keep the defaults in place for the zigzag stitch on your machine. If your machine does not automatically adjust the width and length of the stitch for you, then start with a stitch length of 1.4 and a stitch width of 5.0. Switch out your traditional sewing machine foot with a \"zigzag\" foot. This can prevent your needle from breaking.

Start by using light pressure on the pedal and check the stitches to see if they are coming out how you want them to. [6] X Research source If you are unhappy with the placement of the stitches, then stop the machine and adjust the position of the fabric. If you are unhappy with the length and/or width of the stitches, then adjust the length and/or width to your liking."

      "content": "Trim away the excess fabric. Unless you are using the zigzag stitch for a hem, it is a good idea to trim away the excess fabric after you stitch the edge of the fabric. This will help to reduce fraying when you wash and wear the garment. Trim along the edge of the zigzag stitch, but be careful not to cut into the stitching. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use an overcast foot. A useful tool for stitching the edges of fabric is an overcast foot. This makes it easy to line up the stitch so that it is right on the edge of your fabric. If you have an overcast foot, then use it in place of your regular presser foot for this project. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that an overcast foot is optional. You can also zigzag stitch along the edges of fabric without one."

      "content": "Try a few different stitch lengths and widths. The length and width of your stitches will change the way your zigzags look. If you are not sure how you want your zigzags to look, then try experimenting on some scrap fabric before you begin sewing your project. Try short, medium and long lengths and widths to find a zigzag setting that you like. It may be helpful to write each setting directly onto the scrap fabric so you know what each one will look like. This will make it easier to decide on a preferred setting and serve as a helpful reference for future projects."

The zigzag edge that you sew into the hem will be decorative and functional. However, finishing raw edges with the zigzag stitch is also a good strategy.
