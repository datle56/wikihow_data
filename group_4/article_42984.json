      "title": "Inspect the tiles’ finish to see how smooth it is.",
      "content": "Inspect the tiles’ finish to see how smooth it is. You can visually inspect the tiles’ top surfaces or run your fingers over the top of the tiles. Porcelain tiles have a fine-grained finish that is smoother than the finish on ceramic tiles. So, if the finish is slightly bumpy or coarse when you touch it, you’re dealing with non-porcelain (ceramic) tile. [1] X Research source If the tiles are already glazed, flip them over and look at the unglazed underside. Porcelain will be smooth all around, while the unglazed side of ceramic will be coarse. Check the roughness of the edges, too. Porcelain edges are smoothly cut while ceramic edges can be more coarse or rough."

      "title": "Look for chips in the glaze to identify ceramic tile.",
      "content": "Look for chips in the glaze to identify ceramic tile. Look closely at the glaze—if it’s chipped, you will be able to see the tile’s white or tan base, which may be a different color than the glaze. This is a sure sign that the tile is ceramic. [2] X Research source Porcelain tiles are sometimes, but not always, glazed. Most high-quality porcelain tiles will have a consistent color that goes through the top, body, and bottom of the tile. Ceramic tiles, on the other hand, are nearly always glazed. The glaze can be any color compared to the base of the tile. Glazed porcelain tiles are much harder and are more resistant to wear and damage than non-porcelain ceramic tiles."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the sides of the tile for a white, tan, or red color.",
      "content": "Examine the sides of the tile for a white, tan, or red color. While porcelain tiles can be colored, ceramic tiles will always have a natural white, tan, or red color from the clay they’re made from, with a colored glaze on top. So, if you see that the sides (and base) of the tile are any other color other than white, tan, or red, you can be sure that you’re dealing with a porcelain tile. Some cheap, low-quality porcelain tiles may not have the color mixed through the body of the tile. Avoid purchasing these tiles."

      "title": "Compare the costs of the two tile types.",
      "content": "Compare the costs of the two tile types. In nearly every scenario, porcelain tiles are more expensive than ceramic tiles because they take more time to produce, are more versatile, and tend to last longer. If you’re looking at two types of tiles in a hardware or home-supply store, non-porcelain (ceramic) tiles will almost always be cheaper. [3] X Research source As a broad rule of thumb, porcelain tile usually costs approximately 60% more than ceramic tile."

      "title": "Hold 2 equally sized tiles to see which is heavier.",
      "content": "Hold 2 equally sized tiles to see which is heavier. Porcelain is much denser than ceramic, so a porcelain tile will be noticeably heavier than a ceramic one of the same size. This is because porcelain is made of a finer material than ceramic and fired at a higher temperature, making for a denser, more compact tile. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look at the back of the tile or its packaging for a label or certification mark.",
      "content": "Look at the back of the tile or its packaging for a label or certification mark. If you’re looking at loose tiles in a store, look at the packaging or shelf label to see if it’s marked as porcelain or ceramic. However, since porcelain is technically a type of ceramic, the label may refer to real porcelain as ceramic anyway. Since this labeling can be confusing, double check the packaging and/or the back of the tile for a Certification Mark from the Porcelain Tile Certification Agency (PTCA). [5] X Research source The Certification Mark looks like a gray-green logo that says “Certified Porcelain Tile 0.5% Water Absorption” (although the mark is subject to change). Some real porcelain tiles may not have this marking, but all tiles that have this marking are definitely porcelain. You can also check the PTCA’s list of certified product lines on their website before you shop so you know which brands are porcelain ahead of time."

      "content": "Note the location in which the tiles have been installed. Ceramic and porcelain tiles are each better suited to distinct locations in a home. Porcelain is often installed in laundry rooms, bathroom floors, bathroom walls, shower stalls, around bathtubs, and outdoors. Porcelain tile is more durable than ceramic because of its hardness, and porcelain is also more resistant to moisture. [6] X Research source Ceramic tile, on the other hand, is most often installed as flooring in high-traffic areas such as an entryway or a heavily-used hallway."

      "title": "See if the tiles are stained or discolored.",
      "content": "See if the tiles are stained or discolored. If so, they’re almost certainly ceramic. Porcelain tiles are very dense and have been designed to be impervious to stains. So, most staining substances (e.g., red wine) can be wiped off of them easily. Ceramic, on the other hand, is light, porous, and can absorb staining materials relatively easily. [7] X Research source Stains on ceramic tiles could also come from foot traffic (dirt, mud, snow, etc.) if the tiles are located in an entryway."

      "title": "Inspect the faces of the tiles for uniform size and shape.",
      "content": "Inspect the faces of the tiles for uniform size and shape. The “face” of the tile is the top portion which faces upward or outward on installed tiles. Porcelain tiles have sharply-formed faces which are all exactly uniform in size. Due to their durability, porcelain tiles can be “rectified,” or cut to highly specific dimensions for complete uniformity. This also allows the porcelain tiles to be grouted together with only small gaps between tiles. [8] X Research source If there is any discrepancy between the size of the tiles, you’re most likely dealing with ceramic tile."

      "title": "Pour a few drops of water on the tile to see if they get absorbed.",
      "content": "Pour a few drops of water on the tile to see if they get absorbed. One of porcelain’s defining features is how not porous it is—AKA, it will absorb very little water and any droplets will roll right off the surface. Ceramic, on the other hand, is made from loosely packed clay and fired at a lower temperature than porcelain, meaning it’s more porous and will absorb water. Any tile with water absorption of 0.5% or less is considered porcelain, while absorption above this rate is non-porcelain. [9] X Research source Pour just a few drops on the surface of the tile. If they soak into the tile and appear to leave a wet mark, the tile is ceramic. If the water pools on top of rolls off, it’s porcelain."

      "content": "Porcelain tiles Porcelain is a popular, durable, and aesthetically pleasing tile that can be used in a wide variety of spaces in and around your home. If you’re torn between porcelain and ceramic, here are some advantages and disadvantages to consider: Pros: Porcelain is much harder and more durable than ceramic. Porcelain can be used indoors or outdoors. [10] X Research source Porcelain is water-resistant and can be used in spaces where moisture is common. [11] X Research source Porcelain is easier to rinse and clean than ceramic. Cons: Porcelain is more expensive than ceramic. It’s harder to cut porcelain tile and it requires special tools (typically a wet saw with a porcelain diamond blade ). [12] X Research source Porcelain is fairly simple from a design point of view compared to ceramic, which features geometric patterns and designs more frequently. [13] X Research source Porcelain may be too heavy for some old floors and walls."

      "content": "Glazed ceramic tiles Ceramic’s lower cost and design possibilities make it a popular choice for many home remodeling projects. Here are some pros and cons to keep in mind if you’re considering ceramic tiles: Pros: It’s much easier to cut ceramic tile and it can be done manually or with a wet saw. [14] X Research source It’s easier to install ceramic tile yourself compared to porcelain. Ceramic tiles come with more pattern and design options than porcelain tiles. Ceramic tiles can have textured finishes that add visual depth to your wall or floor. Ceramic is cheaper to make and buy than porcelain. Ceramic is easier and cheaper to install. [15] X Research source Ceramic is softer and more comfortable to walk on than hard porcelain. Cons: Ceramic is less durable and more prone to cracking with overuse or extreme temperatures. The tiles can chip or crack while they’re being cut. Ceramic can’t be used outdoors since it’s porous. Ceramic tiles are lighter than porcelain but may still be too heavy for old floors (especially on an upper floor). [16] X Research source"

      "title": "How are porcelain and ceramic made?",
      "content": "How are porcelain and ceramic made? Porcelain is technically a subtype of ceramic, and both materials are made in a similar way. Porcelain is made from a fine clay that contains kaolin or kaolinite as the main ingredient, as well as feldspar, glass, steatite, quartz, petuntse, or alabaster. The clay is dense and fired at a high heat of 2,200–2,600°F (1,200–1,400°C), which causes the porcelain to vitrify (become strong, smooth, and waterproof). [17] X Research source Ceramic, on the other hand, is made of a more loosely packed clay and fired in a kiln at a lower temperature than porcelain (about 1,700°F–2,100°F (900°C–1,150°C)). This leads to a more porous, less durable final product. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Where should you install porcelain tile?",
      "content": "Where should you install porcelain tile? Porcelain tile is great for both outdoor and indoor use. Use porcelain in high foot traffic areas like hallways, kitchens, or commercial spaces. They’re also ideal for shower floors and walls because of their water resistance (this also makes them a smart choice for patios, pool decks, and other outdoor areas where moisture protection is important).

      "title": "What is the best place for ceramic tile?",
      "content": "What is the best place for ceramic tile? Ceramic tile is only recommended for indoor use. In terms of floor, ceramic is great for low- to moderate-traffic areas like entryways, living rooms, and bedrooms. Although they’re not as water-resistant as porcelain, they can be used for kitchen backsplashes or bathroom walls when properly sealed and grouted. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "How do you decide between porcelain and ceramic tiles?",
      "content": "How do you decide between porcelain and ceramic tiles? First, consider where you want to place the tiles. If they’re outdoors or in an area with lots of moisture (like around a tub or shower or sink), then porcelain is the way to go. Also consider your budget—porcelain is more expensive than ceramic tile. Last, think about your design preferences. Ceramic is more versatile than porcelain and can be used to make patterns or designs on the wall or floor."
