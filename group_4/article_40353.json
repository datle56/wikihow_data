      "content": "Spleef is a Minecraft minigame where you break blocks under players. Spleef became a popular game to play inside of Minecraft to keep players entertained. Players start on a large, flat arena floor with a large pit underneath. When the game begins, players rush to break the blocks underneath their opponents so they fall into the pit. The objective of the game is to be the last player standing after all the other players fall down. [1] X Research source Spleef was created in 2009 by the players Greenslimy, Pentaclam, and Maulrus, and it gained popularity after Notch, the creator of Minecraft, shared the rules on his blog.

      "content": "Spleef is the combination of “splat” and “grief.” The first part of the name comes from the noise your character makes when they hit the ground. “Griefing” is a term gamers use to describe when players are trying to annoy or ruin another player’s game. [3] X Research source Because you’re destroying the blocks that players are standing on to make them fall, the words got combined and the game became known as Spleef."

You can either play 1-vs-1 for a head-to-head game, in teams of any size, or as a free-for-all to make everyone compete against each other. Spleef arenas can vary in size depending on how many people are playing, but they’re usually made of blocks that are easily destroyed, like snow, wool, leaves, or clay. [4] X Research source Spleef arenas usually have a pit of lava underneath them to eliminate players, but it may also be water or another type of block."

      "content": "Give each player a shovel. A shovel breaks blocks quicker than hitting them without a tool, so make sure every player has one in their inventory. In Creative mode, type in /give @a iron_shovel to give every player in the server an iron shovel to use. [5] X Research source If you’re playing in an arena using wool or leaves, give all the players a pair of shears instead. Some spleef games use projectiles, like snowballs or arrows, to destroy blocks instead."

Jump between blocks and be careful not to get cornered by another player, or else they’ll break the blocks underneath you first."

The lone survivor wins the game! [7] X Research source There’s a chance that multiple people are left in the arena but the holes in the floor make it so there’s no way to reach the other players. If this happens, whoever is in the area with the most blocks is the winner instead."

Spleef arenas are usually around 40 x 40 blocks, but you can make them larger or smaller depending on how many people you plan on playing with. Build out the arena floor out of snow, dirt, or another block that’s easy to break and place, and clear out a pit underneath them. Then, just host your server , invite your friends, and start playing! [9] X Research source Be sure to provide a chest with shovels so players can easily add one to their inventory. After you finish a game of spleef, you’ll have to manually replace all the floor blocks that were destroyed. However, you may program command blocks to rebuild the floor automatically."

To try out a game, build a stone or wood ceiling that’s just above the players’ heads to prevent them from jumping. If building a ceiling is too much work, just have all the players agree not to jump during the game. If anyone accidentally jumps, they’re out of the round."

Many times, the various arena floors are made with different materials to add fun visuals, or they have enemy mobs on them to make the game more challenging."

      "content": "Hard Block Spleef Instead of using snow or another block that’s easy to break, use materials like wood or cobblestone instead.
