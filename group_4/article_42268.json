If your Smart Remote or OneRemote does not have working batteries, this will not work. They take 2 AA batteries that you'll need to insert according to the guides. [1] X Research source The Smart Remote and some others, like the Samsung Smart Touch Remote, use both IR and Bluetooth technologies. In this case, these remotes will turn on your TV, so the \"Power\" button works with IR while pressing any other buttons will most likely do nothing until the remote is paired with your TV."

If you see an error that says \"Not Available,\" your TV might not support the use of the Samsung Smart Remote or the OneRemote and can only be controlled by the original remote. Check your TV's manual to see a list of compatible remotes. [3] X Research source If you see a keyboard icon, you may be trying to use an older Samsung remote that offers QWERTY functionality and is not compatible with your TV. Look at your user manual or look at https://www.samsungparts.com/ for the correct pairing."

If you see a colored light, then your remote is sending an IR signal. If it doesn't light up, it needs new batteries. If your remote has batteries and is still having issues connecting to your TV, continue to the next step. [5] X Research source If your remote is not a Smart Remote, turn on the TV with the buttons on the TV, then try controlling the TV with your remote pointed directly at the Samsung logo on your TV set. If your remote is a Smart Remote, try to manually pair it with your TV again (stand at most 1 foot away from the TV)."

To reset it, remove the batteries, wait for at least 8 seconds, then put the batteries back in (replace the batteries with new ones if you haven't done so recently as weak batteries could be an issue).
