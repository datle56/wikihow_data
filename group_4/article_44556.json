      "title": "Apply a topical analgesic to numb your tongue.",
      "content": "Apply a topical analgesic to numb your tongue. If you still feel discomfort after taking pain relievers, or you prefer to numb your tongue directly, then a topical analgesic gel will also help you manage your symptoms. Squeeze a bit of gel onto a cotton swab and rub it onto the irritated parts of your mouth. Repeat the treatment as often as the product instructions say you can. [4] X Research source Do not apply gels to your mouth with your finger. This can spread germs and infect the area. Check in the oral health section of your pharmacy for analgesic gel. Oral-B and Orajel are 2 brands that produce it. Make sure any product you use is designed for your mouth. There are analgesic gels that are only supposed to be used on your skin."

      "content": "Use an antihistamine mouthwash if your tongue is itchy. In some cases, geographic tongue is caused by an allergic reaction and causes itching.

      "title": "Take anti-inflammatory pain relievers to alleviate your discomfort.",
      "content": "Take anti-inflammatory pain relievers to alleviate your discomfort. Geographic tongue is harmless, but can still cause pain and discomfort. You can manage these symptoms with over-the-counter pain relievers. Use anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen or ibuprofen to reduce the inflammation on your tongue. You can continue taking this medication daily while your symptoms last. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Follow all the dosage instructions on any product you use. If you take medication regularly, check if there are any interactions with the pain relievers you use. Other pain relievers that aren’t anti-inflammatory, like acetaminophen or aspirin, will also work to reduce the pain. They just won’t cut down on the inflammation."

      "content": "Increase your vitamin B intake if you have a deficiency. In some cases, a vitamin B deficiency can cause geographic tongue.

      "title": "Avoid spicy or hot foods while you’re showing symptoms.",
      "content": "Avoid spicy or hot foods while you’re showing symptoms. Both of these foods can irritate your tongue, make the pain worse, and increase inflammation while you’re showing symptoms. Try cutting down on the amount of spice you use in your food until the symptoms clear up. Also, let your food and coffee cool down enough before eating them so you don’t make your symptoms worse. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try leaving your food and hot drinks in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool them down. That way, they won’t be hot enough to irritate your tongue. In some people, very spicy food can trigger a geographic tongue flareup.
