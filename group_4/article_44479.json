      "title": "Drink eight or more glasses of water a day.",
      "content": "Drink eight or more glasses of water a day. Constipation usually occurs because there is an insufficient amount of water in your stool, making it hard and difficult to pass. This happens when the peristalsis (muscle contractions) [3] X Research source of the intestines stops due to the effect of the general anesthesia used during hernia surgery. Increasing your fluid intake may help to soften the stool and prevent you from straining during a bowel movement."

      "title": "Eat a high fiber diet.",
      "content": "Eat a high fiber diet. Fiber-rich food prevents constipation by pulling water from the colon, which makes the stool softer and easier to pass. Make sure you have a daily fiber intake of at least 21 grams [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source by eating foods like: raspberries, apples, pears, bananas, oranges, figs, strawberries, raisins, popcorn, brown rice, barley, oatmeal, bread, lentils, almonds, pistachios, green peas, broccoli, turnips, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, carrots and potatoes. You can also take Metamucil, a fiber laxative and supplement. Metamucil can be taken after eating or on an empty stomach. Have a glass of water after you drink Metamucil for better absorption. Men, 19 years and older can take 38 g/day. Women, 19 years and older can take 25 g/day. Pregnant and lactating people should consult with their doctor before taking Metamucil. Pregnant people are usually prescribed 28 g/day and lactating people are usually prescribed 29 g/day. [5] X Research source If approved by their doctor, children can also take Metamucil. Children 1-3 years old can take 19 g/day; children 4-8 years old can take 25 g/day. Boys 9-13 years old can take 31 g/day; girls 9-13 years old can take 26 g/day. Boys 14-18 years old can take 38 g/day and girls 14-18 years old can take 26 g/day. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Do light exercise.",
      "content": "Do light exercise. Light exercise like walking will help to reduce the time it takes for food to move into the large intestine. This will ensure the water absorbed from the stool is limited. Exercises also stimulate the natural contraction of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. If these muscles contract efficiently, the stools will move out much quicker. Exercise an hour after a meal as this will force blood flow to increase towards the stomach and the intestines, which will then help your body to properly digest the food. [7] X Research source Walk for at least 15-30 minutes a day at a slow pace so you do not disrupt the surgical site. Do not do any strenuous activities like running, jogging, or playing contact sports during the first four weeks after surgery, as these actions can possibly rupture the surgical incision. Bedridden patients can dangle their feet on the bed and do arm and feet circling for at least 30 to 45 minutes daily to help promote the return of peristalsis (muscle contractions) in the gastrointestinal tract. [8] X Research source The early return of peristalsis can help reduce constipation."

      "title": "Stop smoking.",
      "content": "Stop smoking. Smoking cigarettes can further reduce the peristaltic movement of the intestines, which are already depressed due to the general anesthesia used during hernia surgery. The nicotine in cigarettes is a potent vasoconstrictor, which means it makes your blood vessels constrict or narrow, thus reducing blood flow to the intestines. If blood flow is reduced, then digestion and peristalsis or the rhythmic movement of the intestines are also reduced. This causes the digested food to remain in the intestines for a longer period of time. During this time, the colon continues to absorb water from the digested food, which will lead to a firmer or hard stool and constipation."

Some stool softeners can cause intestinal bleeding, dependency and can alter the normal environment of the gastrointestinal tract if they are used for too long. Consulting with your doctor will help you find the right stool softener to treat your constipation. Colace works by increasing the amount of water that the stool absorbs, making is softer and easier to pass. [9] X Expert Source Roy Nattiv, MD Board Certified Gastroenterologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. The ideal dosage of Colace is 50 to 500 mg once a day.

The prescribed adult dose (19 and older) for Senna is two tablets (17.2 mg) orally at bedtime once a day, with or without food. Do not exceed two tablets a day and do not take Senna for more than a week, unless otherwise prescribed by your doctor. These are known as stimulant laxatives. They work more quickly, but they have a higher addictive potential. [12] X Expert Source Roy Nattiv, MD Board Certified Gastroenterologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. Patients 2-6 years old should take half a tablet (4.3 mg) of Senna orally at bedtime, and not exceed half a tablet a day. Patients 6-12 years old should take one tablet (8.6 mg) orally at bedtime and not exceed one tablet a day. Patients 13-18 years old should take two tablets (17.2 mg) orally at bedtime and should not exceed four tablets a day. Senna should only used by pregnant and breastfeeding people if it is prescribed by their doctor. [13] X Research source The prescribed adult dose (18 and older) for Bisacodyl is usually 5 to 15 mg (1 to 3 tablets) orally once a day, with or without food. Do not exceed more than 15 mg a day. Children under 18 and pregnant and breastfeeding people are usually not prescribed with this medication unless otherwise prescribed by the doctor."

This leads to an accumulation of more stools in the impacted part of the intestines and can restrict blood flow, thereby killing the tissues in it. If this occurs, the surrounding pain receptors will be activated and you will likely experience unbearable or excruciating pain."

      "content": "Recognize the most common type of hernia, an inguinal hernia. An inguinal hernia is common in men because the inguinal canal does not close properly, creating a weakened spot that is prone to hernias. Normally, a man’s testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth and the canal closes almost completely behind them. An inguinal hernia develops when the intestines push through the inguinal canal. In men and women, the inguinal canal is found in the groin area. In men, it is the area where the spermatic cord, which holds up the testicles, passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. In women, the inguinal canal contains a ligament that helps to hold the uterus in place."

This type of hernia causes gastroesophageal reflux, a burning sensation that occurs due to the leakage of a person’s stomach contents back into their esophagus. A hiatal hernia is most common in people over 50 years old. Congenital birth defects may cause a child to develop a hiatal hernia."

      "content": "Get your infant checked for an umbilical hernia. Babies under six months old develop an umbilical hernia if their intestines protrude through the abdominal wall near the belly button. If you notice a bulge or swelling near your child’s belly button when he cries, he may have an umbilical hernia. Umbilical hernias usually go away on their own, once the child reaches one year old. If the hernia is still present after the child turns one, surgery will be required to correct the hernia."

However, there is a risk of hernia recurrence. This procedure uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia using small incisions. The hernia is repaired by sewing the hole to close the abdominal wall. A surgical mesh is also used to patch the hole."

A part of the scrotum or groin may be incised to retrieve and reposition the intestine. Then, it is closed using stitches. Open surgery requires a longer recovery process. But, the patient can resume his normal daily activities six weeks after surgery."

The surgeon repositions the herniated tissue and, if strangulation has occurred, removes the oxygen-starved part of the organ. The damaged muscle wall will frequently be repaired with synthetic mesh or tissue."
