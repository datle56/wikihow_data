      "title": "Assess the severity of the scratches.",
      "content": "Assess the severity of the scratches. If the injury to the eye is superficial and does not give your dog much discomfort, you can usually wait a few days to see the scratches heal on their own before setting up a veterinary appointment. However, if the scratches are severe, or the eye looks infected, then you should get a veterinary appointment immediately. If you are not sure about the severity of the scratches to your dog's eye, take it to a veterinarian. They can assess your dog's eyes thoroughly and can weigh the need for treatment versus the dog's ability to heal itself.

For example, corneal ulcers can develop in areas of the cornea that are damaged but do not heal. This damage to the clear exterior of the eye can progress deep into the eye, eventually damaging your dog's sight if it goes untreated."

[5] X Research source As with all surgeries, there are risks to your dog's health when being put under anesthesia for surgery. Be sure that your veterinarian has assessed your dog's overall health and made sure that it is fit enough to undergo surgery before your dog is put under. This usually includes a physical exam and blood tests to look for risk factors and health problems. [6] X Research source"
