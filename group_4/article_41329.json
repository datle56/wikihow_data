Gradually reducing your consumption of the drug before stopping altogether can help your body self-regulate and will reduce the pain and danger of withdrawal. The method of tapering will be dependent on the presence of other physical and mental conditions present. In general, tapering opioids consists of a reduction by 10% daily, 20% every three to five days, and 25% a week. It is never advisable to taper by 50% daily anytime during the tapering process. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re taking three pills per day, start your taper by taking two pills, one in the morning and one in the evening. In a week’s time, drop to only one pill in the morning, and stay there for another week. Stop taking it entirely once you have been taking a half pill a day for a week."
