      "content": "Ask a parent or other adult to turn the key, if possible. While you can turn your expander yourself, it’ll be trickier to see the inside of your mouth. Have a family member or other adult turn the expander for you to make the process easier. Try laying down on your back and having an adult turn your expander with the help of a flashlight if necessary. If you do have to turn the expander yourself, position yourself in front of a mirror with one hand shining light into your mouth while the other hand uses the key."

      "content": "Turn your expander according to your orthodontist's instructions. Your orthodontist will decide how many times a day you need to turn the key depending on your specific case. Follow your orthodontist’s directions for when to turn the key to make sure you’ll get the best results. [1] X Research source You might be told to turn the key once in the morning and once at night, or possibly just once a day. Turning your expander more than is recommended can be very dangerous for your mouth because it stretches out your jaw too quickly."

      "content": "Insert the key into the hole at the front of the expander. Pick up the expander key, which has a small bent piece of metal attached that fits into the hole. Look for the hole in your expander on the piece of flat metal at the roof of your mouth. Stick the key down into the hole at the front of your mouth until it’s firmly in place. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The key has a safety bend in it which prevents you from poking your mouth, making it impossible to push too far into the expander’s hole. Clear your expander's hole of any food using your toothbrush before putting the key into it."

      "title": "Push the key towards the back of your mouth until a new hole appears.",
      "content": "Push the key towards the back of your mouth until a new hole appears. When the key is all the way in the hole, turn it towards the back of your mouth. As you’re moving the hole with the key in it backwards, a new hole will start to appear in its place. Once you can see the entire new hole, you’ve done one full turn. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Whether you have an upper expander or a lower one, the key will always be turned towards the back of your mouth. If you're having trouble turning the expander, make sure there isn't any food around it and that the key is properly inserted. Never do more than 1 full turn at a time."

      "title": "Pull the key straight out to avoid reversing the turn.",
      "content": "Pull the key straight out to avoid reversing the turn. Once you see the new hole and have completed the turn, pull the key straight down if you have an upper expander, or straight up if you have a lower expander. Be very careful not to accidentally pull back on the key, turning the expander’s hole back to where it started. [8] X Research source hhttps://youtu.be/l_2xDpcxET8?t=155 Gently wiggle the key if you’re having trouble pulling it out without reversing the turn. If you accidentally pull the hole back the wrong way, slide the key back into the hole and fix the turn. Look for the new hole once the key is removed to make sure you did the turn correctly."

      "content": "Avoid eating sticky or hard foods. This includes popcorn, gum, crunchy chips, and most types of candy. Eating sticky foods will make it harder to clean around your expander, and hard foods may cause damage or pain if they get stuck underneath it. [5] X Research source Avoid caramel and taffy. Corn on the cob can be tricky to eat with an expander as well."

      "content": "Keep your expander as clean as possible. Practicing excellent oral hygiene is always a good idea, but it’s especially important to take care of your mouth when you have an expander. Take extra time to clean around your expander using your toothbrush, making sure no food is caught around or under it. [6] X Research source Wipe off the key each time you use it, if needed. Consider using a water flosser to gently blast water around the expander, dislodging any food that might have been stuck."

      "content": "Use a pain reliever if the pressure on your mouth is uncomfortable. Since the expander is making your palate bigger, it might cause you to feel pressure or pain in your mouth area or give you headaches. If you feel uncomfortable, take a mild pain reliever like Motrin or Tylenol to feel better.
