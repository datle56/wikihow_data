      "content": "Use isabgol to treat constipation. The primary benefit of isabgol is its ability to treat mild to moderate constipation. While it is believed to treat a range of other health troubles, these other uses are not approved for professional labeling purposes. [1] X Research source Isabgol increases the amount of bulk in your stool. This increase in mass promotes movement through the intestines. Isabgol also increases the amount of water in your stool. As a result, the stool becomes softer and easier to pass. Most studies suggest that isabgol contributes to an increase in stool weight or bowel movements per day, as well as a decrease in total gut transit time. This product has even been used as an ingredient in bulk laxatives."

      "content": "Treat diarrhea by mixing isabgol in curds. Mix roughly 2 tsp (10 g) of isabgol with 3 tsp (15 mL) of fresh curd until well combined. Eat this mixture directly after a meal. Be sure to consult your doctor, though, before you try using isabgol in a curd form. [4] X Research source Follow your curds with a full glass of water to prevent choking. Do this twice daily to see positive results. The consistency of curds causes the isabgol to react differently in the gut. Instead of softening the stools further, the isabgol adds bulk and helps solidify loose stool. The combination of curds and isabgol also gives your stomach a good dose of probiotics, which can help heal the underlying cause of diarrhea. In professional medical settings, this product is commonly used to treat diarrhea in patients who are tube fed.
