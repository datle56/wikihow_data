Make sure the slurry is completely combined to prevent lumps in your cream sauce. Once you’ve thoroughly combined the cornstarch and water, whisk the slurry into the sauce 1 tablespoon or 15 mL at a time. Continue stirring the sauce over medium heat for about two minutes to thicken the sauce. [7] X Research source You will need about 2 tablespoons or 30 mL of slurry for each cup of sauce.

Drop the ball into the sauce while rapidly stirring the sauce. Continue stirring until you reach the desired consistency. [9] X Research source You can add multiple balls of kneaded butter to reach the consistency you desire. Make sure you only add one ball of kneaded butter at a time."
