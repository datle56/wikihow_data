      "content": "The transom is the flat, vertical structure at the stern, or back of the boat. A transom is typically rectangular and sits at the very end of the boat. While its height can vary, it usually acts as a sort of wall to the back of the boat. Most motors are attached to the transom, which can make it easy to identify. [1] X Research source Lots of boaters put the name of their boat on the transom, which is another great way to tell where it is. Transom and stern are separate things, though they’re often used interchangeably. The stern is a direction, while the transom is a structure on the boat. Transoms can come in many different shapes and sizes. Depending on the type of boat and its size, they might be rounded or square. They also aren’t all flat, as some are angled upwards or downwards."

      "content": "Reinforces the back of the boat Because the transom is a structural piece, one of its main purposes is to protect and support the back of the boat. Mainly, it acts as a barrier that helps prevent water from entering the boat. [2] X Research source If the boat has a motor, the sturdiness of the transom also helps to absorb the motor’s energy."

      "content": "Holds the outboard motor Most recreational boats like fishing boats, bowriders, and consoles have motors that propel the boat. Motors need a sturdy place to hold onto that can withstand their power, which the transom provides. [3] X Research source The size of the transom often depends on how many motors are on the boat. A boat with 2 or more motors puts a lot of stress on the transom, so it needs to be thicker."

      "content": "Supports other boating accessories The support of the transom also makes it a great place to install ladders, rear doors, and swim platforms on recreational boats. This gives passengers an easy way to enter and exit the boat from the back. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cracks and loose sealing allow water to leak in your transom, damaging it.",
      "content": "Cracks and loose sealing allow water to leak in your transom, damaging it. Constant stress from the motor and supporting the back of the boat can cause cracks to form. Along with natural wear to the sealants and bolts, this allows water to enter the transom. With time, that water can cause your transom to rot. Your transom is a main support for your boat, so it can be dangerous for water to leak into it. [5] X Research source Any damage to your hull can damage your transom, too. Scratching the bottom of your boat when you’re in too shallow water or hitting debris at high speeds can crack your transom."

      "title": "The best way to repair a damaged transom is to replace it altogether.",
      "content": "The best way to repair a damaged transom is to replace it altogether. Unfortunately, once water rots the transom, its structure is compromised. Even if you are able to dry it out, the transom no longer functions like it’s supposed to. [6] X Research source Replacing your transom with a professional can cost around $1,500 to $5,000, depending on the size of your boat. While that’s certainly not cheap, it’s super important that you have an undamaged transom to boat safely!"

      "title": "You can replace your transom yourself, but it is a more difficult process.",
      "content": "You can replace your transom yourself, but it is a more difficult process. This typically involves removing the rotting wood and fiberglass exterior, outlining the shape of the transom on 1.5-inch (3 cm) thick marine plywood, and cutting it. You then apply resin to the back of the transom to adhere the plywood to the boat. Then, apply fiberglass over the plywood to finish the repair. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Check your transom regularly for damage. It’s always best to catch any problems with your transom before they develop. Every time you take your boat out and bring it back in, inspect your transom. Look for any cracks, leaking, or peeling seals around bolts and screws, and any loose fittings, bolts, or screws.

      "content": "Look for signs that your transom is wet. If you think your transom might have a leak, the best way to make sure is to get a professional to take a sample and see if it's wet. However, you can check yourself by knocking on the transom. If it sounds hollow, you might be dealing with rot. [9] X Research source Rust stains below screws and bolts, warping, and cracks are also common signs your transom is rotting."

      "content": "Protect your transom as you travel with a transom saver. If you keep your boat at home and transport it to a marina, your transom can also get damaged from road bumps and potholes. A transom saver is a small bar that you attach to your trailer, lifting the bottom of your boat further from the road. This relieves the pressure on your transom and protects it from any potential damage. [10] X Research source"
