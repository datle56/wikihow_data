If you don’t have any adhesive remover on hand, feel free to use something like WD-40, a common lubricant. [1] X Research source You can find adhesive remover at most stores that sell cleaning supplies. If your adhesive remover doesn’t come in a spray bottle, feel free to pour it into a spray bottle so it’s easier to apply. Double-check the safety instructions on the spray before you spritz anything onto your bike."

Hold the end of the hairdryer at least 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the surface of the bike, which will allow the glue from the sticker to start melting. Hover over the sticker for at least 5 seconds—if you’re dealing with a large sticker or decal, you may need to apply heat for a few more seconds. seconds.

Keep in mind that some stickers may come off easily, while others may need a bit more elbow grease—it all depends on the size and manufacturer of the sticker.
