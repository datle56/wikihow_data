      "content": "Bring a urination device. Before you pack and leave for your automobile trip, buy a urination device to take with you. A disposable urinal is the best option because they are the easiest to use. If you have not used one before, it might be a good idea to buy a few different types and bring them all with you. You can also just pee in a bottle . There are a lot of urination devices on the market for both men and women. [1] X Research source If you do not want to spend money on a disposable device, you can use materials you might already have. A lot of men will use a milk jug, but milk jugs can be bulky and take up space in the car. [2] X Research source Gatorade bottles and Core water bottles have a wide mouth opening, so they are preferable for many women. [3] X Research source"

If you do not want to invest much money, get the travel size. To pre-soak your paper towels: Take a dry paper towel and place it under running water until it is soaked. Pump one or two drops of liquid hand soap onto it and rub it in until you see the soap lather. Squeeze out any excess water, and fold it into your desired size."

      "content": "Find a discreet place to urinate. If you are in a location that is remote (near a wooded area or close to shrubs), walk several feet from your car and find a spot that is semi-to-fully obstructed. This way nobody walking or driving by will be able to see what you are doing. Standing behind a tree or large shrub, in the middle of some tall grass, or behind a fence are all good options. Once you find a good spot, go ahead and do your business. If you are female, pull your pants down around your ankles and squat behind a tree or shrub. If there is no discreet area available, stand behind your open passenger door. Face away from the road. If you are female, pull your pants down around your ankles and squat behind the passenger door. Squat as close to the body of the car as possible for the most privacy. As a female, if you can't squat because you have a knee problem, or the area seems gross, you can stand by referring to Urinate Standing Up as a Female . Remember that this takes practice, so if you still have a few days before you go to the automobile trip, start the practice right away! Be careful not to get caught, you could be fined for disorderly conduct. Depending on where you are, fines range from $50 to $500. [7] X Research source"
