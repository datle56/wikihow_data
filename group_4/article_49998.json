      "content": "Focus your mind and set your intention. Your intention, or “niyyat,” is the intention in which you do an act, in this case praying the Zuhr. Take a moment to center yourself and focus on the prayer at hand, quieting your thoughts and preparing yourself to pray with sincerity to Allah. [2] X Research source Niyyat is done silently, but if you like you can repeat the word “Bismillah” (“in the name of Allah”) in your head to help you focus."

      "content": "Stand facing the direction of Makkah and say “Allahu akbar.” If you’re in the US or the UK, face about southeast. Raise your hands to your earlobes and say the Takbir, which is “Allahu akbar” and means “God is the greatest.” Then place your right hand on your chest and say, “A’oothu billaahi minash-shaytanir-rajeem,” which means, “I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the accursed.” When you pray, face the direction of Makkah (also known as “qibla”). If you’re outside the US or UK, find Makkah (or “Mecca”) on a map or visit a Muslim prayer website that will tell you which direction to face. After saying the Takbir, refrain from talking, laughing, drinking, eating, visiting the restroom, or anything else that would disrupt your state of prayer."
