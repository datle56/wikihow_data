      "content": "The initial pain and burning subside after 10 minutes or so. When a fire ant stings you, it feels a bit like a less-painful bee sting. The painful sensation goes away on its own and after that your skin starts to feel itchy. This itchiness can last for weeks after the sting.

Avoid scratching the bite, as well, as this can cause it to break and expose it to potential infection. [7] X Research source If the blister does break, cleanse the area with soapy water and monitor it for signs of infection. You can also apply an antibiotic ointment to any open stings. These ointments are available over-the-counter from most drug stores and pharmacies. If the area becomes discolored or starts leaking pus, it may be infected. Seek medical attention immediately."

      "content": "It’s very rare, but it’s possible. Symptoms of a fire ant sting allergy include hives, itching and swelling in areas other than the place where you were bitten, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, tightness in the chest and difficulty breathing, and swelling of the throat, tongue, and lips, or difficulty swallowing. If you experience any of these symptoms after being stung, get to an emergency care center or hospital immediately. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually occur within 30 to 40 minutes of being stung. In the most severe cases, people with an allergy may experience Anaphylactic shock, which can lead to dizziness, blackout, and cardiac arrest if not treated right away. If you know yourself to be allergic to fire ant stings (or bee stings), you might already be carrying an epinephrine shot, commonly called an epi-pen (epinephrine) . Inject yourself or have a friend help you, then proceed to the hospital."
