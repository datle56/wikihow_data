    {
      "title": "Take both positive and negative feedback into consideration.",
      "content": "Take both positive and negative feedback into consideration. Talk about problems detected in past classroom evaluations and how those issues were not improved upon subsequently. Report on specific situations and in which the teacher displayed a lack of proficiency. Review letters of complaint addressed to the teacher from students, other teachers, administrators or parents. Recognize the teacher's strengths as a way to show encouragement that he or she can and will improve with the right strategy employed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Note these problem areas in a single column.",
      "content": "Note these problem areas in a single column. Create concise, yet detailed notes about what the teacher could do better. For example, if the teacher is having difficulty disciplining their students, write \"Classroom behavior management\" as an area that needs improvement. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Collaborate with the teacher to come up with a plan.",
      "content": "Collaborate with the teacher to come up with a plan. For example, if a teacher is having difficulties with classroom behavior management, a set of action steps could look like this: \"1) Shadow another educator within the same grade who displays excellent classroom behavior management, 2) Participate in an informative workshop, 3) Create an individual discipline plan for your classroom, 4) Implement your plan.\" [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Come up with a way for the teacher to show their progress.",
      "content": "Come up with a way for the teacher to show their progress. Come to an agreement with the teacher about the evidence necessary to prove progress. With the behavior example, a fair measurement might be a decrease in students sent to the principal's office or a decrease in unruliness during classroom observations. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a reasonable timeframe for the teacher to implement changes.",
      "content": "Create a reasonable timeframe for the teacher to implement changes. Discuss this with the teacher, and notify them of the consequences if they do not improve within the agreed upon timeline. Make sure the teacher is aware of and understands the timeframe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Help guide the teacher throughout the plan.",
      "content": "Help guide the teacher throughout the plan. Include in-school mentors, teacher improvement centers, and handbooks that might be helpful. Be willing to answer any questions the teacher may have or direct them to someone who has the answers they need."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the teacher sign it, as well.",
      "content": "Have the teacher sign it, as well. Be sure to read over the plan together after the draft is complete. Make sure you both understand all the details before signing. Remember to make copies of the plan, as well. [4] X Research source"
