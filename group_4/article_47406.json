The person streaming the movie to others will not be able to do so using Safari for macOS. You'll need to install either Chrome or Microsoft Edge. It's against Netflix's terms of use to share content from your subscription with others, including by streaming through Discord. [14] X Research source Because you'll be sharing copyrighted content, it may also be illegal.
