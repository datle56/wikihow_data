[1] X Research source While it can mean you’re texting someone a little agro, it can also be a joking way to respond to an unfair request or some teasing. ”Smd dude I’m not actually trying to date your mom.” ”Smd what do you mean I failed the test?”"

Them: \"You wanna play basketball later, or are you tired of me beating you?\" You: “Smd bro I’ll see you on the court.” Them: “I saw you hanging out with Connor, he your boyfriend now or something?” You: “Smd you know we’re just friends.”"

Look at emojis and other acronyms to help determine context. If “smd” is followed by a wink or “lol,” that could point to flirting. You: \"Do you want to go out tomorrow night?\" Them: “What, like on a date?” You: “Smd don’t get ahead of yourself ;-).” Them: “You got me something for my birthday?
