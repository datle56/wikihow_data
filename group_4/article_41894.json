      "content": "Shampoo your hair only when necessary. Shampooing your hair when it's dirty or greasy, as opposed to every single day, will keep your curls from drying out and frizzing. [1] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Use moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo for the best results. Aim for shampooing your hair 1-3 times a week. Avoid silicone, which can prevent moisture from penetrating your hair."

      "content": "Condition your hair frequently to help lock in moisture. While you don't need to shampoo your hair every day, conditioning your hair daily (especially your ends) will lead to healthy, hydrated curls. Look for products that help reduce frizz and lock in moisture. Avoid putting lots of conditioner on the roots of your hair so that your curls aren't weighed down. Deep-condition your hair once a week for even softer curls."

      "title": "Use cold water for the last rinse of your hair.",
      "content": "Use cold water for the last rinse of your hair. Here's the secret to taming your frizz: rinse out your conditioner with cold water instead of warm. Hot water is hard on the hair shaft, while cold water seals the cuticle, making curls look sleek and shiny when the hair is dry. [2] X Research source If you can't bear the idea of taking a cold shower, try washing your hair in the sink instead of running the cold water over your entire body. When you're in the shower, use a shower cap to protect your curls from the warmer water."

      "title": "Detangle your hair using a wide-tooth comb.",
      "content": "Detangle your hair using a wide-tooth comb. If you need to brush your hair, it's best to do this while you're still in the shower to avoid frizz. [3] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Use a wide-tooth comb and start detangling from the bottom of your hair upwards right after you apply conditioner. [4] X Research source Avoid brushing curly hair when dry because it will make your hair poof and frizz."

      "title": "Remove excess water using a cotton T-shirt instead of a towel.",
      "content": "Remove excess water using a cotton T-shirt instead of a towel. The towel is rough on your hair, causing it to frizz much more easily. Sponge out the excess water using a clean, soft T-shirt to protect your curls. [5] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. [6] X Research source Microfiber towels are also great options, as they're gentle on curls."

      "title": "Use a curl-enhancing product.",
      "content": "Use a curl-enhancing product. Experiment to find what works for you: an inexpensive anti-frizz serum may be adequate, or you might want to splurge on a more expensive curl-styling cream that moisturizes and adds definition. After washing, add a bit of product to wet hair and work through with a wide-tooth comb, working from the ends to the roots to prevent breakage. [7] X Research source Make sure each curl gets a little of product from root to tip. When you're finished, use your fingers to scrunch the curls to give them extra definition."

    {
      "title": "Let your hair air dry.",
      "content": "Let your hair air dry. The healthiest way to dry curls is to let them dry on their own time. Don't wring out or rub your hair; this causes hair to become rough and frizzy. After you've applied the needed products, sit back and let your hair dry naturally. Avoid using a hair dryer unless it's a special occasion."

    {
      "title": "Dry your curls with a diffuser if you're in a hurry.",
      "content": "Dry your curls with a diffuser if you're in a hurry. The diffuser attachment spreads out the heat so that it doesn't flow in a direct stream on one part of your hair. Work your way around your head with the diffuser, using its prongs to lift and dry your curls around the scalp, down the back and sides, and down to the tips. Continue until your hair is slightly moist, rather than completely dry. [8] X Research source Set the diffuser to the highest heat and a low speed. If you'd rather have waves instead of tight curls, don't push your curls up with the diffuser; point it straight at them instead."

    {
      "title": "Finish with a touch of product for hold.",
      "content": "Finish with a touch of product for hold. Use a medium-hold spray to keep your look in place throughout the day, or add a drop of serum or wax to your curls to create definition. Only use a small amount to avoid weighing down your curls with product. [9] X Research source Stay away from sprays that contain alcohol, as this dries out your hair."

      "title": "Keep curls fresh throughout the day.",
      "content": "Keep curls fresh throughout the day. If you notice your curls starting to fall or frizz, wet your hair a bit and apply whatever product you like to use (curl cream, gel, mousse, or another product). Use your hands to scrunch your curls up, making them look as fresh as they did in the morning. Fill a bottle half with water and half with leave-in conditioner for a quick hair solution during the day."

      "title": "Braid the front of your hair",
      "content": "Braid the front of your hair to keep curls out of your face. Start the braid where you part your hair, pulling the front section into a French or Dutch braid as you go along your hairline. Start finishing the braid once you near your ear, using a bobby pin to secure it. [10] X Research source Clip the curls using a bobby pin, either pinning them to the side of your head or lifting a section of your curls and hiding the bobby pin underneath. Instead of trying to separate your curls as you braid, which can result in frizz, pull in the entire curl as you braid if necessary."

      "title": "Twist your curls away from your face for a quick style.",
      "content": "Twist your curls away from your face for a quick style. Select the section of hair that you'd like to pull back and twist it a several times. Use bobby pins to pin the strand to the side of your head, or hide the bobby pinned section by securing it under a section of curls. [11] X Research source This works well for both long and short curly hair."

      "title": "Create a rolled headband style for fast elegance.",
      "content": "Create a rolled headband style for fast elegance. Put the headband on over your hair so that it rests at the curve in the back of your head. Tuck your hair into the band in 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) sections, starting from behind your ears. After passing a section through, you'll then re-tuck it so that it gradually forms a roll. Work your way towards the back of your head, until all the hair is tucked. [12] X Research source Secure the roll with a few bobby pins if needed. The band will be exposed at the top of your head."

      "title": "Gather the front of your hair into a top knot if it's short.",
      "content": "Gather the front of your hair into a top knot if it's short. Pull together the middle-front section of your hair, twisting it into a small bun that sits on the top of your head. Secure the bun using bobby pins or small hair clips. [13] X Research source You can loosen the bun before pinning it so that it lays flat on your head. For longer hair, try pulling up the rest of your hair into a ponytail once the bun is secured on top of your head."

      "title": "Celebrate loose curls with a half-crown braid.",
      "content": "Celebrate loose curls with a half-crown braid. Braid a 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) section of hair starting from above your left ear. Angle the braid to wrap back around your head and secure it with a small, clear elastic. Repeat this same process using a strand from above your right ear. Once both strands are braided and secured, cross them behind each other before pinning. [14] X Research source Wrap the left braid back and around, towards the right ear. Secure with a few bobby pins. Repeat with the right braid, crossing it over the first braid and tucking the end underneath it before pinning it."

Curly hair can be notoriously difficult to cut, and hairdressers need to understand the needs of different kinds of curls in order to give you a great cut. Ask around or go online to find a great hairdresser for your hair needs. Ask a friend with curly hair if they have a recommended hairdresser. Try doing an Internet search of salons or individual hairdressers in your area that specialize in curly hair. Read reviews and check prices to find the best options.

      "content": "Go to your haircut with freshly-washed curls. It's important for the stylist to see your hair in its fluffiest, curliest state: this helps them best assess what kind of cut you need. Wash your hair that morning or the night before, and let it air dry. Ask the hairdresser to cut your curls dry so that each curl can be individually assessed."

      "content": "Opt for long or short layers, depending on your desired look. If you want long, curly hair, ask your stylist to add long layers, which prevent it from getting too heavy at the end. Shorter layers will give your hair more volume and bounce. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim your hair regularly to avoid split ends. Split ends will make your hair even more frizzy, and the damage can be difficult to hide. Whenever you start to notice split ends, head to your hairdresser or give your hair a trim to ensure your curls stay healthy.

      "title": "Color your hair with caution.",
      "content": "Color your hair with caution. Curly hair tends to be more fragile than straight, and the caustic chemicals in hair dye can wreak havoc on it, compromising curl structure and resulting in lots of frizz. If you want to color your hair, choose a gentler color and proceed gradually. For example, instead of going from dark brown to platinum blonde, consider adding in some highlights to start."
