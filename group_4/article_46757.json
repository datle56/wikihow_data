      "title": "Acquire your smoker.",
      "content": "Acquire your smoker. Electric, charcoal, gas and water are popular types of smokers that are used with everything from jerky to turkeys. Electric and gas smokers will generally cook meat slightly faster than the other types. Some experts believe that an offset smoker can give an ideal result, while a pellet smoker gives only a decent one. Assemble your smoker if you have just purchased it. Pay careful attention to the fire box and the air vents. These are essential parts of the smoker, which can result in fire or ruined meat if broken."

      "title": "Cure your smoker before you use it to cook.",
      "content": "Cure your smoker before you use it to cook. You will need to start a fire in the fire box. Get it up to a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) and then turn it down to 225 (107 degrees Celsius) to smoke for several hours. You will remove contaminants and have a layer of seasoning in the smoker."

      "title": "Buy your wood chips or charcoal.",
      "content": "Buy your wood chips or charcoal. Wood chips are generally used with a smoker to create the smoke flavor, and they come in varieties like oak, alder, cherry, hickory, mesquite, and apple. Make sure the wood you choose is free of any chemicals. This is true of charcoal smoking as well, since the fumes from the chemicals will go directly on your meat. It is a good idea to begin with pre-soaked chips, instead of making your own."

      "content": "Insert the wood chips, if you are using them. Make sure that you have more nearby to restock the smoking chamber. If you are using a gas smoker, you will want to place the chips inside a foil packet. Poke holes in the top of the packet 6 or more times. Place the packet very close to the heat so that it will produce smoke. [3] X Research source If you are using a water smoker, you can place fresh herbs in the water to give the meat extra flavor."

    {
      "title": "Start your fire.",
      "content": "Start your fire. You will need to ensure air can get around the wood or charcoal, so open up the air vents wide. Then, let it heat for at least 20 to 30 minutes. While your fire will reach high temperatures of 400 degrees at the beginning, you will want it to cool down to a lower temperature. After 30 minutes, turn the air vents nearly closed to discourage fire and encourage smoldering coals or wood."

      "content": "Aim for a temperature between 180 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit (82 to 135 degrees Celsius). The temperature should be adjusted according to the type of smoker, the type of meat and the size of the meat pieces. For example, fish should be smoked at a lower heat than beef. A large pork shoulder can use a higher heat than small pieces of beef jerky. Electric and gas smokers tend to cook hotter, so turn the heat down to a lower setting."
