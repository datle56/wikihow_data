      "content": "Keep a regular sleep schedule . Create a sleep schedule where you wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday, even on weekends or days off. Sleep requirements vary from person to person, but on average, you should be getting seven and a half to eight hours of sleep to function during your waking hours. However, some people need as much as ten, due to sleep efficiency (how long is spent asleep) and . [1] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source Teenagers sleep schedules are later in the day than adults, by about 2 to 3 hours. Teenagers also need more sleep than adults (about 8 to 10 hours). Young bodies need more rest while growing during adolescence and optimising brain connections. Some people require more sleep than others. A minuscule few people survive on as little as six hours a night, due to a rare genetic anomaly. Everyone else requires 7 to 8 hours to be truly rested. Respect these differences; a person needed more sleep is not lazy or bad. Some people think getting just one less hour of sleep will not greatly affect their daily functioning. Another belief is that sleep can be made up on the weekend or a day off. This is not true, and should be avoided, due to knock on cognitive, memory, immune, and other effects. If this happens a lot, your sleep schedule will suffer, leading to oversleeping or being overly tired when you wake up, as your brain tries to recover partially from sleep debt. [2] X Research source It is a myth that the human body adjusts quickly to different sleep schedule. While most people can reset their biological clock, this can only be done by timed cues, and even then, only by about one to two hours per day, depending circadian rhythm. It can take more than a week for your body’s internal clock to adjust to traveling across several time zones or switching to a night shift, especially when moving to an earlier time schedule. Extra sleep at night may not cure you of your daytime fatigue. The quantity of sleep you get every night is important, but so is the quality of your sleep. You may get eight or nine hours of sleep a night but will not feel well rested if the quality of your sleep was poor. Sleep quality, or efficiency, refers to the amount of time actually asleep during the night, which can be affected by sleep conditions like sleep apnea and insomnia. It also refers to the proportion of deep sleep to light and REM sleep."

The type of light these screens emit can stimulate your brain, suppress the production of melatonin (which helps you sleep), and interfere with your body’s internal clock. [4] X Research source Another option is to shut down your computer on a schedule. This will automatically sleep your machine and prevent you from working on your computer too late or too close to your bedtime. There are sleep features on both PCs and Macs that you can activate. As well, if you want your computer to be ready to go in the morning, once you wake up, you can schedule a startup time too."

      "content": "Do a relaxing activity before bed. This could be a warm bath , reading a good book, or having a quiet conversation with your partner. Relaxing hobbies or activities are also an excellent choice. Doing a restful activity will help to trigger your brain to start relaxing and shutting down. [5] X Research source Playing on the computer or your device is not a good activity - your body is quiet, but your mind may be overstimulated and the light of the screen triggers the mind to be awake. Likewise with television: this device triggers \"awake\" signals in the brain. If you find yourself tossing and turning in bed in the dark, avoid staying there awake for prolonged periods. Instead, just getting up or doing something calming can help to get your mind off to sleep. Getting anxious about not being able to sleep, and dwelling on it will actually make it less likely you will be able to get to sleep. [6] X Research source Again, do not turn on the television, gaming system, computer, or other electronic device. Light reduces the sleep pressure which helps you sleep more easily. Try things like reading , washing the dishes , knitting , running a load of laundry, doing origami, or the like."

If you find yourself waking up too early or sleeping too early, you can try altering your body clock by reducing sunlight (i.e. with sunglasses) in the morning, then later expose yourself to brighter light (the sun is best). Contrary to popular belief, older people still benefit from a similar amount of sleep, but may struggle to get the same amount."

Though you may be tempted to sleep for just five more minutes in the morning for some extra sleep, hitting the “snooze” button on your alarm will in fact make you more tired. When you hit snooze, your brain goes even deeper into your sleep cycle. By the time you hit “snooze” several more times, and finally wake up, you will feel groggy and even more tired than if you got up with your alarm. If possible, get an alarm without a snooze button. Or disable the snooze option on your existing alarm."

Rather than having your alarm close to your bed, where you can easily hit the snooze button or shut off your alarm, put your alarm clock somewhere that forces you to get out of bed. That way, you will be forced to get out of bed in the morning to shut your alarm clock off. For example, you could place your alarm clock on a dresser that is on the opposite side of your room. Or, if you think you will still be able to hear it, you might even place your alarm in an adjacent room, such as a bathroom."

The types of food and liquids you consumed before bed and the amount of food and liquids you consumed. Your feelings and moods before bed, such as “happy” “stressed” “anxious”. How long it took you to get up the morning, and how often you hit the “snooze” button on your alarm. Any drugs or medication you took, such as sleeping pills, including the dose and time of consumption. Notice any triggers that start to repeat themselves in your sleep journal and see if there are ways you can prevent or limit these triggers.

      "content": "Get tested for sleep disorders. There are many medical conditions and disorders that can interfere with sleep. Let your doctor know about specific symptoms or patterns in your sleep issues. If you can’t get up in the morning due to oversleeping, have difficulty staying awake while sitting still, fall asleep while driving, and require caffeine every day to stay awake, you may have a sleep disorder. There are four main types of sleep disorders: [16] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Insomnia : The most common sleep complaint and a major cause of oversleeping. Insomnia is often a symptom of another issue, such as stress, anxiety, depression, or another health condition. It can also be caused by lifestyle choices, like medication you take, a lack of exercise, jet lag, or your caffeine intake. Sleep apnea : This occurs when your breathing temporarily stops during sleep due to a blockage in your upper airways. These pauses in breathing interrupt your sleep, leading to many awakenings throughout the night. Sleep apnea is a serious, and potentially life threatening sleep disorder. If you suffer from this disorder, it’s important to talk to a doctor and get a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine. This device delivers a stream of air to your airways while you sleep and can successfully treat the disorder. Restless leg syndrome : (RLS) is a sleep disorder caused by an irresistible urge to move your arms and legs. This urge usually occurs when you’re lying down and is due to uncomfortable, tingly sensations in your arms and legs. Narcolepsy: This sleep disorder often involves excessive, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. It is caused by a dysfunction of the mechanism in your brain that controls sleeping and waking. If you have narcolepsy, you may have “sleep attacks” where you fall asleep in the middle of talking, working, or even driving."
