      "title": "Raise your shirt collar and drape the tie around your neck.",
      "content": "Raise your shirt collar and drape the tie around your neck. Position the wide end at the length you'd like it ultimately to be, as you will primarily use the narrow end for tying. The narrow end will be lower than the wide end because this knot uses a significant amount of fabric. One inch (2.5 centimeters) above your waistline is a great spot for the wide end.

    {
      "title": "Pinch the wide side of the tie to form a dimple.",
      "content": "Pinch the wide side of the tie to form a dimple. While pinching is not essential, it does make working with the narrow end easier without the fabric bunching up. The area you should pinch is somewhere between your shirt's first and second buttons."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the narrow end over the wide end.",
      "content": "Cross the narrow end over the wide end. Make the cross distinct so you don't accidentally mistake one end for the other. Then, bring the thin end up through the neck opening and down toward the right side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross the thin end under the wide end and bring it to the other side of your tie.",
      "content": "Cross the thin end under the wide end and bring it to the other side of your tie. Then, bring the narrow end up through the necktie and pull it down, to the right. [2] X Research source At this point, there should be a v- or heart-shaped loop around your neck."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move the narrow end across the v-shaped loop.",
      "content": "Move the narrow end across the v-shaped loop. Bring the narrow end up through the neck loop and pull it through the loop. Keep this top loop of the knot loose, and move the narrow end behind the thick end to the other side of your shirt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the narrow end up through the loop one more time.",
      "content": "Lift the narrow end up through the loop one more time. Adjust the loose loop for tightness until it is secure. Once the loop looks symmetric, tuck the end under the neckline to finish the trinity knot. [3] X Research source Fold your shirt collar down to complete the look."

      "title": "Wear a trinity knot at lighthearted occasions.",
      "content": "Wear a trinity knot at lighthearted occasions. Trinity knots are not the best idea if you're making an important impression, like at a job interview or court hearing. Reserve trinity knots for special occasions with friends or family. A wedding reception, for example, is the perfect reason to wear a trinity knot. A political dinner is not."

    {
      "title": "Pick a trinity knot when you want your tie as a focal point.",
      "content": "Pick a trinity knot when you want your tie as a focal point. Understated shirts or suits work best with the trinity knot so it becomes your outfit's centerpiece. Your outfit should draw the eye to your tie. Do not wear shirts with distracting patterns or neon colors. Pastel colored shirts accentuate trinity knots well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose trinity knots when wearing plain ties.",
      "content": "Choose trinity knots when wearing plain ties. Loud patterns with cartoon characters or paisley patterns will detract from the beauty of the knot. Choose a simple pattern that will highlight the knot rather than drown it. If you want a pattern, choose a light one like little polka dots. [4] X Research source Solid color ties are ideal when wearing a trinity knot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear a narrow spread collar.",
      "content": "Wear a narrow spread collar. Wider collars tend not to frame the trinity knot favorably, so choose a more narrow shirt. You can spot a narrow spread by the collar opening, which is flatter than most shirts. Cut-away collars, club collars, and rounded collars are equally unflattering for trinity knots."

    {
      "title": "Tie a trinity knot after you've mastered easier knots.",
      "content": "Tie a trinity knot after you've mastered easier knots. Trinity knots are a bit more complicated than your average Windsor knot. Because trinity knots aren't always user-friendly for beginners, work through easier knots before you attempt it. [5] X Research source"
