      "title": "Turn off the child lock.",
      "content": "Turn off the child lock. Samsung washers come with a ‘child lock’ feature, which prevents the door from being opened even when the cycle is complete. Activating the child lock requires pressing and holding two buttons on the machine (usually the ‘Temp’ and ‘Rinse’ buttons.) [1] X Research source You’ll know if it’s activated if a light looking like a smiling lock or baby’s face is on. To turn off the child lock, press and hold the same buttons until the light blinks, then again to turn it off."

      "content": "Wait until the cycle is complete. If you aren’t actually concerned about the load, and are instead just trying to open the door after a normal cycle, you may just be trying to open it too early. Even when the drum stops spinning, it can take a moment for the door to unlock. [2] X Research source Wait for the alarm to stop beeping and the ‘Door Locked’ light to turn off before opening the door."

      "content": "Unplug the washer and plug it back in. The tried and true method of many a technological malfunction. If the door refuses to unlock after a cycle has completed or just in general, unplug the entire unit and wait one hour. Plug it back in and turn it on again, and it might do the trick!

      "content": "Make sure the washer is on. We know—it sounds obvious. But check and make sure the washer is actually on before trying to wrench the door open. If the washer suddenly turns off because of a power outage, it may take up to five minutes for the washer to unlock the door. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the washer drum for a high water level.",
      "content": "Check the washer drum for a high water level. On Samsung washers, the same button that starts a wash cycle also pauses it. That being said, the washer will not pause the cycle if the water level is beyond a certain point. If it’s been more than five minutes, the drum is likely filled with water and cannot be paused. But, if you are quick to realize the sweater you threw in is definitely cashmere, you can still save it."

      "content": "Pause the cycle. Assuming the cycle just started, click the pause button once to pause the cycle. The door will unlock and you can take out or toss in whatever you forgot.

      "content": "Press and hold the ‘Spin Only’ button. If you were too late to pause the cycle, the washer is filled with water and can’t be opened normally. To remedy this, you can drain the water by placing the washer on a spin cycle. Press and hold the button for three seconds until the spin speed selection appears on the screen."

      "content": "Repeatedly press ‘Spin’ until you reach your desired speed. The best draining speed depends on the type of clothes you’re washing. The Extra High speed is for large loads with lots of water, like the Bulky Items cycles. Don’t use this if you have anything delicate in there! [7] X Research source High speed is for sturdy cottons and casual sets of clothing, like tee-shirts and such. Medium speed is for jeans, wrinkle-free items, and synthetic fabrics. Low speed is for delicate items that can take a bit of spin. No Spin simply drains the water from the drum without spinning at all. This is only necessary if you’re really worried about the clothes inside getting beat up! Avoid the ‘Rinse Hold’ speed, since that is the opposite problem and won’t drain any of the water in the drum."
