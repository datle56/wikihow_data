      "title": "This strange shark looks more like a shark-shaped pancake.",
      "content": "This strange shark looks more like a shark-shaped pancake. That’s because angelsharks have very flat bodies—almost like a cross between a shark and a ray! They have large fins that fan out on both sides, with smaller dorsal fins on their tail. Angelsharks are ambush predators, so being flat is quite beneficial; they lie in wait, buried in sand at the sea bottom, for prey to swim by.

      "content": "Barreleye fish have distinct see-through foreheads and rotating eyes. Its eyes are tubular (thus the name “barreleye”), and because they rotate, the fish can look directly up through its see-through forehead to detect nearby predators (or oncoming prey). Handy, right? Its distinctive eyes also have a yellow pigment that helps distinguish bioluminescence from sunlight!

      "content": "Black swallower fish have large mouths and expandable stomachs. Using their considerable mouth and jaws, they can swallow prey up to 4 times their size and 10 times their weight! These fish can even retract their teeth so prey can swim into their mouths. However, it’s rare to see a black swallower in the wild, since they live so deep in the ocean—usually between 700 to 3,000 meters, or 2,300 to 10,000 ft.

      "content": "This vibrant jellyfish is named for its bright scarlet stomach. Interestingly, the jelly’s stomach is intended to help it camouflage in its dark surroundings since red light gets absorbed and looks black in the deep ocean waters where the jelly lives. Bloodybelly comb jellies also have tiny filaments that propel them through the water—and when light bounces off them, it looks like the jelly is shining!

      "content": "Bobbit worms have an unnerving look and predatory traits to match. They bury themselves in sand and sediment, leaving only their tentacles exposed, waiting for prey to pass by so they can strike. Their sensory appendages detect nearby prey, and when ready, the bobbit worm can spring from the sand close its jaws around the unfortunate victim. Moreover, bobbit worms can grow up to 10 ft (3 m) long! [5] X Research source Latin name: Eunice aphroditois Lives in: Prey-rich coral reefs in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans"

      "content": "Brier sharks are also known as “birdbeak dogfish.” The latter name is definitely accurate, at least based on appearance! The brier shark has a long nose, wide eyes, and a slender gray-brown body; at lengths of up to 3.9 ft (1.2 m), it may look more like a fish than a shark. They’re found mainly off the southern coast of Australia and are sometimes caught for flesh and liver oil.

True to name, the cockeyed squid’s eyes vary in size and structure, with its left eye gradually growing to over twice the size of its right. The left eye’s lens also turns yellow, and the eye becomes semi-tubular; it faces upward (and can spot prey despite the natural light coming in), while the right faces down (and can spot bioluminescent creatures).

      "content": "The small cookiecutter shark attacks prey with serrated bottom teeth. It uses those teeth to latch onto prey (even prey larger than itself) and bite off pieces—despite the shark’s relatively tiny size, which is usually between 16.5 in (42 cm) and 22 in (56 cm). These sharks usually stay in deep water during the day, then swim up to hunt in the surface waters at night.

They spend most of their time grazing on algae—and, amazingly, they can perform a type of photosynthesis by separating chloroplasts within the algae and embedding them in their own tissues.

That means it’ll eat anything it comes across, even other members of its species—and it’s the deepest-dwelling superpredator in the world. This bizarre-looking critter lies in wait at the bottom of the ocean so it can catch prey swimming overhead—and its eyes are sensitive to detect bioluminescence.

Doto greenamyeri sea slugs only grow to about 15 mm (0.5 in) long, but they make up for their small size with chemical defenses. The protuberances on its body—or “cerata”—are toxic to predators and function as gills. Latin name: Doto greenamyeri Lives in: Indo-Pacific waters around Indonesia and Papua New Guinea"

Those fangs are also embedded with nanocrystals, giving female dragonfish a more substantial bite than some sharks! They also have a luminous barbel to attract prey (like anglerfish), although these barbel hang from their chins. Male and female dragonfish both have photophores, light-producing organs that can signal other dragonfish.

      "content": "Emperor shrimp are colorful creatures that live symbiotically on others. The relationship between the emperor shrimp and its host is mutually beneficial: the host (usually a mollusk, such as a sea slug) gives the emperor shrimp protection and a free ride, while the emperor shrimp cleans its host. Emperor shrimp typically have orange sides and a white back, with shades of red, orange, and purple on their legs.

Flapjack octopi often lie flat on the seafloor (like a pancake, or “flapjack”) but can swim or hover using their arms and fins. They’re a species of shallow-water octopus—but, unlike most species, they can’t change color and don’t have an ink sac.

Their appearance can be quite alarming, particularly since they can grow to nearly 20 inches (50 cm) long—which is much larger than a run-of-the-mill woodlouse.

That makes it the second-longest sea organism (after the bootlace worm), and it’s close in length to the largest sea mammal, the blue whale. Furthermore, the siphonophore is actually a colony comprised of tiny, individual zooids, each with a specific function within the siphonophore—from stinging and catching food to digesting it.

This shark has a long, flat snout and jaws that can extend out when it needs to lunge at prey, which scientists believe they hunt by detecting changes in electric fields. They’re large, often between 10 - 13 ft (3 - 4 m) or bigger, though they’re rarely seen because they live at least 330 ft (100 m) deep in the ocean—usually deeper.
