      "content": "Find a strapless bra that fits you comfortably. One of the biggest problems people have with off-the-shoulder tops is that they eliminate many of your bra options. If you already have a strapless bra that fits you well, great! You can wear it with your off-the-shoulder tops. If you don't have a strapless bra, try to find one that's super comfortable and nude-colored so that you can wear it with almost anything. [1] X Research source Many clothing and lingerie stores will help you get fitted for the right strapless bra."

      "title": "Pick an off-the-shoulder top that fits your height.",
      "content": "Pick an off-the-shoulder top that fits your height. The length of your off-the-shoulder top should correspond with your height. If you're on the taller side, you can balance your height out by wearing long tops. If you're shorter, it's better to stick to shorter off-the-shoulder tops, or tuck long tops into the front of your pants. [2] X Research source Longer tops are ones that can go below the waist of your pants or skirt, or ones that cover your butt when you wear them. Shorter off-the-shoulder tops could be crop tops or any tops that hit the waist of your pants or skirt or go above."

      "content": "Stick to styles that complement your figure. If you have a fuller chest, off-the-shoulder tops that are flowy or streamlined will look best on you. For smaller chests, you'll be able to pull off form-fitting off-the-shoulder tops. Whichever style is right for you, try it on before making a final decision. [3] X Research source For fuller chests, wide shoulders, or a larger build, try out an off-the-shoulder top that flows out from the top as opposed to one that's skin tight. A cold shoulder top — a top with only the shoulders cut out — will also look great. For smaller chests and a more petite form, wear off-the-shoulder tops that show your curves and cling to your skin more. You don't want to look swallowed in fabric, so be careful when looking at flowy tops."

      "title": "Decide on an off-the-shoulder top that allows arm movement.",
      "content": "Decide on an off-the-shoulder top that allows arm movement. Off-the-shoulder tops can be restrictive when it comes to arm movement — moving around often causes the sleeves to scrunch up on your shoulders. If your top is too tight, you won't be able to move your arms at all. Look for an off-the-shoulder top that allows you to move your arms and is comfortable. [4] X Research source Clear elastic straps, such as the ones on bras, can be sold separately for $5-$10 and are found online. You can use these to attach to your top, if necessary."

      "content": "Wear your top with high-waisted jeans or a skirt for a relaxed look. Choose a soft, breathable off-the-shoulder top and pair it with high-waisted jeans. If you'd rather wear a skirt, choose an off-the-shoulder top that's a little more fitted. Wear shoes such as flats, sandals, or casual boots to complete the look. [5] X Research source Frilly, floral, or cropped off-the-shoulder tops look great with high-waisted jeans. If you're wearing a flowy skirt, choosing a top that's form-fitted will help balance out your outfit."

      "content": "Opt for a bodysuit off-the-shoulder top to wear with skirts. If you want to bare your shoulders while avoiding a loose top, try out a bodysuit. These cling right to your body while the rest of the off-the-shoulder top is styled normally. Since they're form-fitting, these tops are perfect for wearing with flowy skirts. [8] X Research source You can also wear this kind of top with jeans to avoid worrying about keeping your shirt tucked in."

Cold shoulder tops are tops that have only the shoulders cut out of them, with straps to go on your shoulders and sleeves covering a section of your arms. Cold shoulder tops can be worn anywhere, but since they're modest and elegant, they can be worn at the office as well.

If you do choose to wear a necklace, aim for one that stays close to your neck, such as a choker or short necklace. [14] X Research source You can also choose to just wear statement earrings or sunglasses to make your look dressier."
