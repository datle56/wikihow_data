      "title": "Join the wrestling team.",
      "content": "Join the wrestling team. Wrestling is great for fighting. It is probably the best way to fight in real life because you can avoid punching and kicking. Both of these things can lead to fractures, breaks, blood, and a lot of pain for both you and your bully opponent. If you know how to wrestle, you can just get in close to the guy, lock him up, take him to the ground, and then put him in a hold. There are some holds that can be pretty painful and uncomfortable for your opponent. They will be forced to submit. It will be very embarrassing for them and you won’t have harmed them very badly. Learning to wrestle is highly recommended. Wrestling is all about body weight, so you can beat someone significantly larger than you if you have the technique."

      "content": "Learn how to keep your balance. Playing basketball might even help you win a fight. The stance that you use to defend someone in basketball is similar to the athletic stance that you want to adopt in a fight. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Take a self-defense class. There are plenty of self-defense classes available that will teach you how defend yourself and get out of the situation. You can even take a short course over the weekend that will teach you basic moves and strategies. If you would prefer, you can take an offensive martial arts class like karate. If you're not sure what kind of martial arts or self-defense classes you'd like to take, see if you can watch a lesson without participating so you can get a sense of the instructor and atmosphere of the place.

      "content": "Recognize when you need to fight. Violence should always be a last resort. If you aren’t capable of winning a fight you might end up getting hurt much worse if you try to fight back. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try making peace.",
      "content": "Try making peace. Some bullies will see this as a form of weakness, but it’s something that you have to do. If you can stop the bullying and future confrontations, you should. Try saying something like, “listen, I’ve got nothing against you. I’m not sure why you have something against me, but let's just let it lie. Thank you.” Don't underestimate the importance and usefulness of verbal deescalation as a combat strategy. You win one hundred percent of the fights you don't engage in.

    {
      "title": "Ignore them.",
      "content": "Ignore them. If the bullying only includes words, don’t escalate the situation. Just walk away silently. Don’t even acknowledge the situation. Don’t act scared, just never even make eye contact with the bully. Act as if they did not exist. If they can’t torture you, they probably will lose interest. When they try to interact with you try to keep a completely blank look on your face and continue whatever you were doing. This will really frustrate them, and you’ll be putting yourself in a powerful position."

      "title": "Turn the tides.",
      "content": "Turn the tides. Most people don’t like bullies. If you are in a public place and the kid is bullying you, don’t be afraid to call them out calmly and firmly. Tell them that picking on other people isn't cool, and you're not sure why they do it. Hopefully, others will agree with you and let the bully know too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Assess the situation.",
      "content": "Assess the situation. Never enter a fight that you can’t win. If the bully has a lot of his friends around don’t try to get physical. Avoid a fight at all costs."

      "title": "Pack your knuckles.",
      "content": "Pack your knuckles. If you know the bully is stronger than you, try packing your hands. Keep two rolls of quarters in your backpack. When the bully confronts you, take them out and hold one in either hand. Your punch will be much more powerful with the weight of the quarters behind it. You can also throw the quarters at the person if you are in a desperate situation. Holding quarters will also prevent fractures. Make sure that you don’t grip your thumbs when you punch. You might break them."

      "title": "Attack unexpectedly.",
      "content": "Attack unexpectedly. [6] X Research source Don’t wait until you’re in a position of weakness. If the bully has pushed or mocked you, he probably won't have his guard up. If this is something he does commonly, you are entitled to fight back. Hit/kick him hard in a weak spot as hard as you possibly can, and then follow that up with multiple other hits. One of the biggest mistakes that people can make in a fight is throwing one punch, and then backing off. As soon as you enter the fight you have to stay on the offensive to avoid retaliation. You can end the fight quickly. [7] X Research source Don’t pull your punch. Hitting someone isn’t a good feeling. We have a natural tendency to pull our punches, which means not following through on your momentum. You need to punch hard. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your distance if the bully attacks you first. Unless you’re trained in wrestling, try to avoid going to the ground. If he rapidly punches, keep dodging. You cannot effectively block punches in a real fight. Duck his punches, or just otherwise avoid them. By staying light on your feet, you can evade attacks and put yourself in a more favorable position for counterattacks.

      "title": "Avoid kicking.",
      "content": "Avoid kicking. Unless you’re trained to kick, avoid kicking high. You’ll put yourself off balance and it will allow the other person to grab your leg and potentially put you to the ground."

      "title": "Be confident and stick to the plan.",
      "content": "Be confident and stick to the plan. You’ll have adrenaline coursing through your body. Your legs might shake and your teeth might be chattering. Just keep telling yourself that you have to be the aggressor. Don’t pause until you’re sure you have won, and then get out of there quickly. Do not be the aggressor so much that you seriously injure them. Just make sure that you have ended the fight and you can get away."
