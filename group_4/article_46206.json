Try the dual n-back task and remember that the more challenging it is, the more it is likely to improve cognition. [3] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source Another way to do this is to read a very hard book. Try to find a book that contains about 20 percent new vocabulary. As soon as that becomes easy, find an even harder author to read."
