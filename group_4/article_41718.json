      "content": "Sit on a rolled towel to make it easier to feel your muscles. Take a hand towel and roll 1 of the short ends across to the opposite end. Place it on the seat of your chair and sit directly on it so it's parallel with your legs. Raising yourself up on the towel helps you feel the muscles of your pelvic floor. [1] X Research source If it's more comfortable, sit on a large exercise ball instead of the rolled towel."

      "content": "Sit up straight so you can fully contract the pelvic floor muscles. If you're slumped over with your shoulders hunched, you won't be able to fully contract and expand the muscles. Instead, sit tall so your spine curves in near your tailbone. [2] X Research source If it helps, sit in front of a mirror so you can check your posture."

      "title": "Imagine that you're urinating and stopping the flow.",
      "content": "Imagine that you're urinating and stopping the flow. You use your pelvic floor muscles to stop urinating, so imagine relaxing those same muscles. Then, try to imagine cutting off the flow of urine so those muscles contract and pull up inside you. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don't actually practice doing this while you're on the toilet because you could weaken your pelvic floor muscles."

      "title": "Repeat this while you pay attention to your lower body.",
      "content": "Repeat this while you pay attention to your lower body. Try to contract the pelvic floor muscles again. This time, ensure that you're not sucking in your abdomen, inner thighs, or bottom. If you've located your pelvic floor muscles, you shouldn't see these parts of your body move or lift. Relax the muscles so you don't strain them. [4] X Research source For example, if you see your abdomen bulging, you're squeezing those muscles instead. Remember that your pelvic floor muscles are the ones you use to hold back a bowel movement or prevent yourself from passing gas. You may have a hard time identifying and contracting the muscles if they're weak and you're just starting out. With practice, your muscles will strengthen."

      "content": "Insert a clean finger into your vagina to feel your muscles contract. Wash your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds and lay flat on your back. Slowly insert about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of a clean finger into your vagina. Then, contract your pelvic floor muscles. If you've identified them, you'll feel your vaginal muscles wrap around your finger while your pelvic floor lifts.

      "content": "Sit up straight or lie flat on your back. Choose whichever position is more comfortable for you. You can lie on the ground or on your bed and place your arms at your sides. If you're sitting in a chair, keep your feet flat on the floor and your arms down at your sides. [6] X Research source Try to relax before you begin your exercises. This helps you focus on breathing and contracting the right muscles."

      "content": "Hold the contraction for 3 to 6 seconds. Keep your muscles tightened during this time and breathe in again. Release the contraction as you slowly breathe out. Contracting your pelvic floor muscles strengthens them if you do the exercises frequently. [9] X Research source For a slightly different exercise, lie on your back with your knees bent. Position your feet so they're flat and hip-width apart. When you breathe in, lift up your hips. Then, lower them when you breathe out."

      "content": "Relax your pelvic floor muscles for 6 to 10 seconds. Once you've released your contraction, breathe in and out normally. This allows your muscles to fully relax before you contract them again. Then, you can contract the muscles again.

Do another 1 or 2 sets at different points during the day to strengthen the muscles. It may take up to a few weeks, but your muscles will become more responsive, especially if you've been experiencing incontinence.
