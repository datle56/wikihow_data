      "content": "Dry cleaning is the best, safest way to clean your Ugg comforter. Ugg comforters are made out of polyester microfleece, sherpa & fur fabrics that can all easily be damaged in the wash and are labeled as “dry clean only.” [1] X Research source Taking your Ugg comforter to the dry cleaner instead of washing it yourself maximizes the comforter's longevity and ensures that it stays as fuzzy and soft as the day you got it. That said, some people do machine or hand wash their polyester microfleece, sherpa & fur Ugg comforters successfully by using cold water, a gentle detergent , and hanging it to dry, which we’ll explain further below. [2] X Research source To find a reputable dry cleaning service, make sure to check out reviews online from places like Yelp and Google or ask your friends for any good suggestions. Alternately, you could use a home dry cleaning kit , though it's not guaranteed this option won't damage or ruin your comforter."

Pick up your comforter or blanket and give it a good shake before you throw it in the wash–this way, if there are any sneaky stain-causing particles on your bedding, they won't be spread in the wash. [3] X Research source Some people like to give their bedding a once-over with a portable vacuum cleaner for even more dust-busting. Just make sure the bottom of the vacuum isn't dirty!"

If you don't have a front-loading machine, or you have to shove the comforter in for it to fit properly, you might have to go to the laundry mat instead. [4] X Research source If your washing machine is too small, the comforter could cause your washer to overflow. To avoid this, ensure that your comforter fits in your washing machine without struggle and that the lid can close fully. Laundry mats have industrial-sized washing machines perfect for washing bulky items like your comforter. [5] X Research source"

While you might be tempted to use a capful of detergent as usual, too much can cause excess suds to form in your comforter and are incredibly challenging to wash out.

Some machines don't have a detergent slot, so in that case, you can just pour the detergent directly into the machine."

Go old school and hang your comforter on a line outside in the sun for the best results. [8] X Research source As a bonus, the sun will help to air it out, sanitize it, and make it smell oh so fresh. Depending on the weather outside and how thick your comforter is, drying should take anywhere from 1-3 hours. Be careful to monitor your blanket, as leaving it in the sun for extended periods could cause sun bleaching or fading. [9] X Research source Drying your comforter in a machine dryer will ruin the fibers of your blanket, so it's critical you hang it dry instead. If you're hanging your comforter on a railing, make sure that its surface is clean. You wouldn't want to stain it right after you freshly cleaned it!"
