      "content": "Cover cake pops in stands or containers with plastic wrap or wax paper. If you are displaying your cake pops on a cake stand or in decorative containers, simply drape a large piece of plastic wrap or wax paper over top, and gently tuck it around the container. [1] X Research source This adds a layer of protection to your cake pops, so you can easily store them at room temperature. This is a great idea if you are getting ready for a party but aren’t quite ready to serve your desserts. In addition, do this after your party to transport your desserts home."

      "content": "Put cake pops in their own plastic baggies to serve them individually. Purchase small treat bags, and put your cake pop into the bag cake-side first. Then, tie a ribbon or wrap a twist-tie around the stick about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) down from the cake. [2] X Research source The treat bag protects your cake pop, so you can store it at room temperature. This makes it easy to serve individual cake pops during parties or weddings, for example."

      "content": "Store your cake pops in a cool, dry place. The candy coating on cake pops keeps the cake fresh for up to 1 week if stored at room temperature. Place your wrapped cake pops away from direct or bright sunlight, and ensure they are not disturbed by placing them out of reach. [3] X Research source You can place them on a shelf in your pantry or on a table, for example. Your cake pops will stay fresh at room temperature for 1 week."

      "content": "Line a medium- or large-sized Tupperware container with paper towels. Locate a clean Tupperware container large enough to fit a good portion of your cake pops. You can store your cake pops in multiple containers, if you'd like. Place a paper towel in the bottom of your container. [4] X Research source This helps absorb excess moisture and protect your cake pops while they are in the fridge."

      "title": "Lay your cake pops flat inside the container on top of the paper towels.",
      "content": "Lay your cake pops flat inside the container on top of the paper towels. Place your cake pops side by side so they face the same direction. You can leave about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) in between each pop. [5] X Research source Be sure to place the cake pops down gently so you don’t damage them. Alternatively, if you are storing individually-wrapped cake pops, simply place them inside the container while inside their plastic wrapping."

      "title": "Make a second layer with your pops facing the opposite direction.",
      "content": "Make a second layer with your pops facing the opposite direction. Once you make 1 layer of cake pops facing 1 direction, flip them the opposite way and make a second layer. You can lay your cake pop directly on top of the stick from the first layer. This way, you can fit more cake pops in your container. [6] X Research source This way, you can fit as many cake pops in your container as you can."

      "content": "Cover your cake pops with another paper towel. Once you place all your cake pops in your container, drape 1 sheet of paper towel over top all of the pops. This adds a final layer of protection, and it also absorbs any remaining moisture from the container. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Place your containers in your fridge in a dry, undisturbed spot. Put your cake pops on a shelf towards the top of your fridge, and make sure there are no wet spots. When storing cake pops, you want to avoid any excess moisture. Ensure your cake pops will not be touched or bumped so they stay in their proper form. [8] X Research source Extra moisture can cause condensation, which can ruin your cake pops’ appearance and make them soggy. Your cake pops will stay fresh in the fridge for 2 weeks to 1 month."

When you are ready to eat your refrigerated cake pops, simply remove them from the fridge and place them on a plate. Leave them out at room temperature for about 30 minutes. If they are still too cold to eat, let them sit for an additional 30 minutes. [9] X Research source Your cake pops are ready to eat when the outer coating reaches room temperature."

      "content": "Rip a piece of wax paper about 2 in × 4 in (5.1 cm × 10.2 cm) big. Use enough wax paper to completely cover the cake pop and have enough room to cover some of the stick. You can rip many pieces at once or 1 at a time--whatever is easier for you."

      "title": "Wrap the cake pops loosely with wax paper.",
      "content": "Wrap the cake pops loosely with wax paper. After you’ve ripped your wax paper, place the cake part in the center, and cover the rest of the cake with the wax paper using your hands. Then, pinch the wax paper where the cake meets the stick, and gently twist it around the stick. This provides protection against condensation on the cake pop. You can also do this for shaped, uncoated cake balls for later use. Simply shape your cake ball and place it in the middle of your wax paper. Then, wrap the ball up completely in the paper."

      "content": "Place a sheet of bubble wrap into a large plastic bag for extra protection. Using scissors, cut a piece of bubble wrap to the size of your plastic bag. Lay the bag flat on your table, and put the bubble wrap inside so it lays flat. Smooth out any creases or wrinkles with your fingers. While this is not required, it helps protect your cake pops from breaking or cracking."

      "content": "Fill the plastic bag with a single layer of cake pops. After you have your bag lined with bubble wrap, place your wrapped cake pops in the bag, starting at the bottom. Place your cake pops in the bag so they all face the same direction. Set the cake pops immediately next to each other to save space. It’s okay if they touch slightly."

      "title": "Alternate the direction of your cake pops to make a second layer.",
      "content": "Alternate the direction of your cake pops to make a second layer. After you’ve laid cake pops in 1 direction, fill in the open spaces with another layer of cake pops. Place them down the opposite way of the first layer. Continue adding cake pops until your bag is nearly full. If you placed the cake pops in the bag starting with the stick, then this time start with the cake itself. This helps save space in your bag, so you can store as many cake pops as possible."

      "title": "Put another piece of bubble wrap on top and close up the bag.",
      "content": "Put another piece of bubble wrap on top and close up the bag. After you fill your bag with cake pops, place another piece of bubble wrap inside the bag. Lay this piece on top of all of your cake pops. Make sure all the cake pops on the outside are protected with bubble wrap. Then, seal the bag up by sliding your fingers across the top. This adds another layer of security to help preserve your cake pops while they are in the freezer."

      "title": "Place your bags in the freezer so they lay flat and undisturbed.",
      "content": "Place your bags in the freezer so they lay flat and undisturbed. Pick a flat spot out of the way to place your cake pops, and lay them inside the freezer horizontally. This keeps your cake pops in tact. Make sure nothing is stacked on top of your cake pops. For example, you can place your cake pops on the bottom shelf of a multi-level freezer. In addition, you can place them in the top right corner of your freezer, so they are out of the way. If your freezer is full, you may have to move around or consume items to make room for your bags. Your cake pops will stay fresh in the freezer for 1-3 months."

      "title": "Let your cake pops sit at room temperature for 1-3 hours before serving.",
      "content": "Let your cake pops sit at room temperature for 1-3 hours before serving. When you are ready to thaw your cake pops, take out your bag and place it on a flat surface. Leave the bag untouched for at least 1 hour. After that, you can take them out of the bag and check their temperature. Touch the outer coating with your fingers outside of the bag. If they are still hard, let them sit for another 1-2 hours. Avoid unsealing or unwrapping your cake pops until they are completely thawed. This prevents condensation."
