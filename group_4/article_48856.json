      "content": "The error indicates a router IP and wireless adapter IP mismatch. Keep in mind that the router connects your network to the internet (it's also called an internet gateway) and the wireless adapter is a device on your router that allows you to connect wirelessly (Wi-Fi). So your router assigns a private IP to your wireless adapter; some circumstances can cause this to get mixed up (like an OS update, or a random glitch)."

      "content": "Restart your router. This is most likely where the problem stems from, so restart your router to clear any temporary and random glitches. It may seem like it's too easy of a fix, but it's most likely the right one. Here's how you restart your router: unplug it from power for a few minutes, then plug it back in. Give your router plenty of time to reset (think 30 minutes), then see if the error is gone. A static IP address may be causing the issue if you have it set up. In that case, turn it off. You'll find the steps to do so in Network and Sharing Center (Control Panel) > Change adapter settings > Your Internet Connection > Properties > Internet Protocol version 6/4 (TCP/IPv6 or TCP/IPv4) > Properties > Obtain an IP address automatically ."
