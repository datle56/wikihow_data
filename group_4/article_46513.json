      "title": "Divide the amount of CBD by the size of the package to find the concentration.",
      "content": "Divide the amount of CBD by the size of the package to find the concentration. Look for the total amount of CBD on the oil’s package listed in milligrams. Then look for the size of the container, which is usually near the bottom of the package and listed in milliliters. Set up your equation and use a calculator to find out how many milligrams are in a milliliter dose of the oil. [1] X Research source If you need to acquire CBD oil with a dropper bottle, you can find options online here . For example, if you have a 30-milliliter bottle of oil that contains 750 mg of CBD, your equation would be 750/30 = 25 milligrams of CBD per 1-milliliter serving. [2] X Research source Some CBD oils will list the amount of CBD per serving on the bottle as well."

      "content": "Take the lowest dose of CBD oil recommended by the manufacturer. There's no standardized dose for CBD oil, so figuring out the right dose can take a little trial and error. Start by reading the label to see how much they recommend that you take, and take the smallest dose. Then, gradually increase that amount until you find the dose that's effective for you.

      "content": "Keep a log of how dosages affect you to find out what works best. CBD oil affects each person differently, so while a low dose may work for you, another person may need a higher dose to feel the same effects. Keep track of the size of your dose, how you felt after taking it, and any side effects you felt. As you try different dosages, make note of which ones make you feel the best so you can keep taking the same amount. [4] X Research source The amount of CBD oil you need may change as you get older since your body processes it differently as you age."

      "title": "Take the dropper out and squeeze the bulb.",
      "content": "Take the dropper out and squeeze the bulb. Unscrew the dropper cap from the bottle and remove it from the CBD oil. Keep the dropper above the surface of the oil and pinch the rubber bulb between your fingers. Any oil or air left inside the dropper will come out from the end so it’s completely empty. You can buy CBD oil at health food stores and online. Be sure to research the product you're using to ensure it's safe ad comes from a reputable company. Don’t squeeze the bulb while the dropper is still submerged since you’ll get air bubbles inside and the dosage may be inaccurate."

      "title": "Submerge the end of the dropper in the CBD oil.",
      "content": "Submerge the end of the dropper in the CBD oil. Keep pinching the bulb as you put the end of the dropper back in the oil. Make sure to submerge the entire tip of the dropper so you don’t get air inside of it. Avoid touching the bottom of the bottle with the dropper since it may not pull the oil as efficiently."

    {
      "title": "Release the bulb to draw the oil into the dropper.",
      "content": "Release the bulb to draw the oil into the dropper. While the end of the dropper submerged, let go of the rubber bulb. The pressure change from inside the dropper will pull the CBD oil into the dropper barrel and fill it. Pull the dropper out of the oil once the bulb returns to its original shape to ensure that you don’t get air inside of it. Most CBD oil droppers fill up to 1 mL, but it may vary depending on the brand. Make sure to check the package’s instructions so you know the correct dosage. A standard full dropper holds about 20 drops of liquid, .5 mL contains 10 drops, while .25 mL holds 5 drops."

      "title": "Put any excess oil back in the container.",
      "content": "Put any excess oil back in the container. Hold the dropper vertically and compare the level of the oil to the measurements printed on the side. If you have the correct dosage, then you don’t need to make any adjustments. If you want to take a smaller dose, place the tip of the dropper over the bottle and gently squeeze the bulb to force some of the oil back out. Check the measurement again to see if it’s the dosage you want. Some CBD oil droppers don’t have measurements printed on the side. Check the package label to see if it lists the size of the dropper so you can use a correct dosage."

      "title": "Place the drops under your tongue for 60–90 seconds.",
      "content": "Place the drops under your tongue for 60–90 seconds. Raise your tongue so it touches the roof of your mouth. Hold the dropper above your mouth, and squeeze the bulb to dispense the oil underneath your tongue. Hold the oil under your tongue for at least 60 seconds before swallowing it. You should start feeling the effects within 20–30 minutes, and they usually last about 4–6 hours. [5] X Research source Holding the CBD oil under your tongue allows it to absorb into your body easier so you feel effects more quickly than if you swallowed it immediately. Don’t put the dropper in your mouth since you could get bacteria on it and contaminate the rest of the CBD oil. If you don’t feel any effects from the CBD oil, you may need a higher dosage. You can also try mixing the oil with other foods or drinks, but it will take 1–2 hours to take effect."
