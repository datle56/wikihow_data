      "content": "Find someone to dance with. This dance is done with a partner, so you need to find someone to dance with. Your partner, boyfriend, or girlfriend is a great choice, but if you're single, ask someone at the club to dance with you. [2] X Research source While this dance isn't always done with a partner, it often is."

      "content": "Pick someone you don't mind getting personal with. Yiking isn't exactly a hands off dance, so if you're going to yike with someone, make sure it's someone you don't mind getting up close and personal with. It involves some grinding and touching of each other's bodies, so make sure you're comfortable with that. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Be ready to step up from twerking. If you know what twerking is (moving your butt up and down to the beat), yiking takes it to the next level. Partially, it's more intense because it involves a partner, but you also include more movement (side-to-side). [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Stick your butt out.",
      "content": "Stick your butt out. Start by bending over a bit and sticking your butt out. You can place your hands on your knees if that helps. Also, try to arch your back a bit so your butt sticks out. Your legs should be about shoulder-width apart. [5] X Research source With a partner, your butt should basically be up against the other person's front."

      "title": "Sway to the beat.",
      "content": "Sway to the beat. Once you get in position, it's time to swing your hips to the beat. Lift your right leg up and step out a bit, though don't actually move over. Swing your hip to follow your leg, with your butt swinging out. Next, swing your left hip out, though don't step this time. Just move your hip and butt out to the left. [6] X Research source Your butt should follow your hip, not lead. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Come back to the middle.",
      "content": "Come back to the middle. Once you've swung right and left (to the beat), move your butt back to the center. Make a wave with your body. Dip your head down and bring it up. As you move, bring the wave along your back and up through your butt. The final point of the move is bringing your butt up. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try the tic toc.",
      "content": "Try the tic toc. If the music goes faster, you may not be able to dip fast enough to stay in time with the beat. If that's the case, you can change to the tic toc. With your butt still out and in the center, shift your weight back and forth by bringing each knee slightly forward in turn. That will shift your butt back and forth behind you. [9] X Research source Don't step forward, just shift your weight."

You want to keep your butt in the air, but you'll have your knees almost all the way to the ground (not on the ground) and your hands on the ground. Keep swaying your butt back and forth. [10] X Research source Either person can do this move!"

However, instead of your knees close to the floor, you'll keep your legs straight, lifting your butt into the air towards your partner. You'll continue to sway in time to the beat. [11] X Research source You should pivot on the balls of your feet to move back and forth."

      "content": "Move in time with your partner. When your partner dips, dip your hips into it as well. You want to stay connected with your partner through the whole dance. When your partner tic tocs, you don't need to tic toc at the same time, but you should still have your hands on the person's hips or butt to move along with them. [14] X Research source You can also add your own moves while your partner is dipping, such as dipping your shoulders or bringing a leg up."
