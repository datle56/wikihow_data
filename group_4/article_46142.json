      "content": "Include the author’s last name for in-text citations. Print sources include magazines, books, newspapers, and scholarly journal articles. When citing these kinds of sources that have a known author, cite the author’s last name and a page number. If you use the author’s last name within the text, you don’t need to repeat it in the citation; just include the page number within the parentheses.

      "content": "Cite the name of the corporation as the author’s name. Some sources have a corporate author (the individual writer is not specified)—in these instances, simply use the name of the corporation as the author’s name. In cases in which the corporation has a long or complicated name, use its abbreviation to make for more fluid reading.

      "title": "Cite the article’s title if the source does not have a given author.",
      "content": "Cite the article’s title if the source does not have a given author. Follow this with the page number the passage was taken from. This is common for smaller website pages, which often do not list an individual author. (For long titles, instead of using the title in its entirety, use a condensed version.) [3] X Research source If the source is a short work—like a journal article, book chapter, or poem—put the title in quotations when citing. If the source is a long work—like a book, play, or even a television show—italicize the title."

      "content": "Include information about the edition when you cite classic literary works. Well-known literary works—especially those written before the 20th century—will have multiple published editions. In order to avoid confusion between the different editions, in addition to providing the author and page number in your in-text citation, provide more information about the source such as the volume (vol.), chapter (ch.), book (bk.), part (pt.), or section (sec.) number. Use a semicolon to separate these from the page number. [4] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source In-text citation: “Smith and Jones conducted the experiment with the help of their colleagues (30; vol. 2).” Parenthetical citation: “The results of the experiment were inconclusive (Smith 30; vol. 2).”"

      "content": "Include first initials when you cite two (or more) authors with the same last name. If you find that two or more authors within a source share the same last name, use their first initials for differentiation. If two or more authors share both the same last name and first initial, use their full names. [5] X Research source In-text citation: “Some scientists believe the results of the experiment were inconclusive (A. Smith 13), while others found them to be quite grounded in research (B. Smith 30).” Parenthetical citation: “Scientists conducting this experiment had differing views on the evidence, some believing the results to be inconclusive and others finding them grounded and quite conclusive (Alex Smith 13; Adam Smith 30).”"

You may use just the first author’s last name, followed by “et al.” (This is a common Latin phrase which means “and others”), or you may use all of the authors’ last names in your citation. In cited works with a longer list of authors, consider using the “et al.” option. [7] X Research source In-text citation using et al.: “Jones et al. counter Johnson and White's argument (30).” In-text citation using all last names: “Jones, Smith, White, and Johnson counter Jackson, McMahon, and Kent’s argument (30).” Parenthetical citation using et al.: Legal experts counter Smith, Jones, and White's argument by noting that the current evidence suggests otherwise (Marks et al. 4).

      "content": "Cite the Bible. There are many common translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, English Standard Version, and New International Version. As such, you want to distinctly identity which Bible translation you are referencing and then be sure to name the book, chapter, and verse within your citation. [10] X Research source When stating the version of the Bible, italicize or underline the title. When stating the specific book from the Bible you are referencing, do not italicize or underline its title. Example of citation: Ezekiel saw “what seemed to be four living creatures,” each with faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle (King James Holy Bible, Ezek. 1.5-10)."

When citing within the text, the names are joined with the word “and,” followed by the date of publication in parentheses. For parenthetical citation, use an ampersand, followed by a comma and the year of publication, all within parentheses. As in MLA, the parenthetical citation should appear after the sentence has ended, but prior to the period. For example, “(Smith & Jones, 2001).” [13] X Research source Name both authors every time you cite this source.

When this is the case, use the source’s title; if the title is lengthy, you can shorten it and include only the first word or two within the parentheses.
