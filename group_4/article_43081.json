      "content": "Tell him that you know about the lies. In order for a conflict to be resolved, you must first define the specific terms of the conflict: in this case, that you are concerned about his lying behaviors. [4] X Research source It is best if the accusation is made swiftly and directly to give you both time to resolve the issue. There is no need to beat around the bush. Simply tell him that you know he hasn't been truthful, and that this worries you. Keep your voice level and calm, and maintain eye contact. Rather than calling him a \"liar,\" consider using specific examples of lying behaviors that you find unacceptable. For example, try using phrases such as: \"I have noticed recently that you tell me you are working late, even though you are not answering your work phone. This makes me think that I am being lied to.\" \"When you told me that you liked my new haircut, I had the feeling that you weren't being entirely honest.\" \"Lately I have been worried about whether you are being honest with me. For example, I have seen you check your texts when you think I am not looking. Is there something you would like to tell me?\""

Or perhaps he didn't lie at all and there is a reasonable alternative explanation for the evidence you gathered. It is also possible that he feels sorry for the lies he told and that he genuinely wants to change his behavior going forward. For example, people often lie when they are under time pressure or stress, but they might tell the truth after they have been given some time and space to think. [8] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Even if he is a liar, he deserves to have his say. And if you want to repair the relationship, it is important that he be allowed to speak his piece. [9] X Research source Remember that people can be easily hoodwinked, especially by a lover. This is known as \"truth bias,\" which can make us believe irrational things about those we care about. Your partner might have had a good reason to lie, but don't let yourself get caught up in unbelievable excuses or outlandish stories. If he says that a stranger who looks just like him happened to steal his phone and use it to send nude photos to your best friend, do not be fooled: he is probably still lying to you."

Be observant moving forward, but remember that everybody makes mistakes sometimes. Seek counseling.

You no longer care what he does: this conversation is all about you and your needs. This frees you from having to read his body language or maintain eye contact during an in-person conversation. All you have to do is say what you need to say, however you feel comfortable saying it. You can confront the liar: In person. It will mostly likely be safest to do so in a public place. Consider telling a close friend or family member where this meeting will take place, so that you have back-up if the conversation escalates. This is a riskier option, but it also gives you the pleasure of seeing his face when you tell him that you know he lied to you. Over the phone. Consider writing yourself notes or bullet points so that you remember to cover everything you want to say. Remember: this will hopefully be the last time you contact him, so you don't want to leave anything important unsaid. This option also gives you the opportunity simply to hang up the phone if he begins making up silly excuses or yelling. Through an email. An email will allow you to express yourself clearly and concisely. This option is especially useful if you do not want to see that liar's stupid face again. Consider having a close friend read the email before you send it to make sure that it is legible. If the liar responds, you have the option of reading his reply or simply sending it to your spam folder. Though there might be a stigma against ending a relationship over email, sometimes it is the safest method, especially if your soon-to-be-ex has exhibited other concerning behaviors."
