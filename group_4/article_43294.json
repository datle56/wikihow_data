      "content": "Avoid zucchini with dark or soft spots, wrinkles, or mushiness. These signs can indicate that your zucchini is past its prime, and it may be safest to throw it away: Mold or black spots : If your zucchini has a few dark spots but no mold, cut off the damaged areas and use the zucchini right away. [1] X Research source If your zucchini does have mold, toss it. [2] X Research source Wrinkly skin : A spoiled zucchini’s skin may look wrinkly or shriveled like a prune. [3] X Research source Discoloration : Yellowing or browning on zucchini are signs of aging and spoilage. [4] X Research source Soft spots : Pick up your zucchini and assess it for firmness. If it feels very soft or mushy when you squeeze it, it has likely gone bad. [5] X Research source Mushy texture : A spoiled zucchini has a mushy or stringy texture when you cut it, and it may feel slimy to the touch. [6] X Research source \"Off\" smell or taste : If your zucchini smells sour or foul in any way, or if it tastes unusually bitter, it has likely gone bad. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose vibrant green, firm, blemish-free zucchini to ensure freshness. When you’re picking out zucchini at the store or the farmer’s market, carefully assess it for signs of aging or spoilage, so that you’re not disappointed when you try to use it later. Here are the things to look for: Bright green color : Look for zucchinis with vibrant, shiny, deep green skin. This indicates that your zucchini is fresh and was recently picked. [8] X Research source Intact stem : The stem should not be shriveled, and it should bend slightly (but not snap) when you push on it. [9] X Research source Smooth, blemish-free skin : Inspect the zucchini to make sure there are no dark spots, mold, wrinkling, or shriveling. [10] X Research source Avoid zucchinis with any nicks or cuts, as this can speed up spoilage. [11] X Research source Firmness : Pick up the zucchini and gently squeeze it to make sure it’s firm. It doesn’t need to be rock hard, but it shouldn’t be mushy or soft when you press on it. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for small or medium-sized zucchinis (about 6 in (15 cm) long). Bigger doesn't mean better when it comes to a zucchini’s taste. When zucchini grows for too long on the vine, it develops a mushier center, tougher skin, and a more bitter taste. [13] X Research source Smaller zucchinis tend to be more tender and flavorful. [14] X Research source Choose zucchinis that are around 6 in (15 cm) in length for the best taste and quality. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Store zucchini in the freezer to keep it fresh for up to 6 months. Before freezing your zucchini, chop and blanch it . This ensures that your zucchini will have the same delicious taste and firm texture when you eventually thaw it. [19] X Research source Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and fill a large bowl with cold water and ice. Carefully drop your zucchini slices into the boiling water. Cook for 1-3 minutes. The slices should be bright green and still firm. Take the zucchini out of the boiling water and immediately place it into the ice bath. Gently stir the water to cool the zucchini, then pour into a colander to drain. Lay your zucchini out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and blot with paper towels until they are completely dry. Place the baking sheet in your freezer for 2-4 hours, until the zucchini is frozen solid. Transfer the zucchini to Ziploc bags, and squeeze out as much air as possible. Seal the bags and store them in the freezer. [20] X Research source"

      "title": "Blossom-end rot",
      "content": "Blossom-end rot If you’re noticing dark, spoiled-looking spots when you grow your own zucchini , blossom-end rot may be to blame. This occurs when homegrown veggies are deficient in calcium, which causes the blossom end (or bottom) of the zucchini to become dark, softened, or bruised. [21] X Research source Blossom-end rot is caused by lack of water or inconsistent watering, which prevents the zucchini plant from accessing calcium in the soil. To avoid blossom-end rot, make sure your zucchini gets enough water consistently throughout the growing season. [22] X Research source"

      "content": "Poor pollination When the female flowers of a zucchini plant are not pollinated, the zucchini can’t grow and may rot quickly. Poor pollination occurs when there aren't enough bees in your garden due to pesticides, cold temperatures, rain, or plants being too spaced out from each other. [23] X Research source Try to plant clusters of flowering plants near each other in your garden. This attracts more bees. [24] X Research source If cold or rainy weather is keeping bees away, try to pollinate your plants by hand. Use a small paintbrush to collect pollen from the male flower’s stamen, then transfer this pollen to the female plant’s pistil. Repeat every other day for 1 week. [25] X Research source"
