      "content": "Use a mirror that frames either your face or your outfit. Pick a mirror that’s big enough to fit as much of you in the shot as you want. For instance, a small wall mirror works if you just want a selfie of your face, whereas a taller mirror is prime if you want to capture a full outfit. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that you can crop your selfies, too. If you just want your face in the picture, but you only have a giant wall mirror, crop the rest of your body out of the photo after you take it. Also use a decorative mirror to add some flair to the photo, or a mirror with vanity lights for some flattering, built-in lighting. Unconventional mirrors like a car’s rear view or the outside of a glass building also make for interesting shots."

If you’re taking your selfie in your bedroom or your own house, make sure the space that will be showing in the picture is organized and clean—put away any dirty clothes on the floor, make your bed , and check that anything potentially embarrassing, like your life-sized celebrity crush poster, is hidden.

      "title": "Set up the mirror in a spot with good lighting.",
      "content": "Set up the mirror in a spot with good lighting. Natural lighting is the most flattering for pictures. To take advantage of this, open the blinds or curtains on windows to allow more light in and try to take your picture during the day when it’s sunny outside. If it’s nighttime, recreate natural lighting by turning on soft, warm lamps instead of bright overhead lights. Also make sure the light is angled toward you, and not toward the mirror. [3] X Research source Avoid fluorescent or harsh white lights, which dull your skin. Make sure that the light isn’t directly at your back. Otherwise, you’ll just be a silhouette. Adjust the light if possible so that it hits you in the front."

      "title": "Look into the camera lens through the mirror for a more flattering pose.",
      "content": "Look into the camera lens through the mirror for a more flattering pose. Looking into the lens of your camera keeps you from concentrating too hard on the phone screen, which is handy when you want to avoid less flattering expressions like frowns or furrowed brows. It also lets your face and eyes be the focal point, which screams confidence! [4] X Research source To give a smolder worthy of a runway model, smile with your eyebrows raised, then drop the smile but keep those eyebrows up. This opens up your face and accentuates your natural facial contours."

      "title": "Look at the phone screen instead for a more casual look.",
      "content": "Look at the phone screen instead for a more casual look. If you’re going for a more low-key selfie, go ahead and look at your phone to line up and snap the pic, just make sure your phone is close to but not blocking your face. This pose gives off the vibe that you’re not taking this too seriously, and has a more spur-of-the-moment feel. [5] X Research source Give a slight smirk or a playful pout to get the perfect expression as you look into your phone screen."

      "title": "Hold your phone close to your face at a slight downward angle.",
      "content": "Hold your phone close to your face at a slight downward angle. Make sure your phone is no lower than chin height, and keep it closer to your face than to the mirror, which helps to flatten your face and avoid a fish-eye lens look. Then, create the illusion of length and height by tilting it slightly downward. This slims up your features and creates a more striking and flattering angle. [6] X Expert Source Crystal Bear Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 21 January 2021. The higher you hold your phone, the longer and slimmer you’ll look. Play around with different angles and heights to determine what works best for your selfie."

      "content": "Hide your face with your phone to focus on your outfit or setting. If you don't want your face showing, hold your phone directly in front of it so that everything but your hair is covered. Place your phone under your chin and angle it downwards until you can’t see your head in the shot. These let people know that this pic is more about your fit, and less about the mug. [7] X Research source Hide your face in a selfie if you don’t want to worry about what your facial expression looks like."

      "title": "Use the front camera for a cool double shot.",
      "content": "Use the front camera for a cool double shot. Lean against the mirror and switch your phone to the front-facing camera, which is the one you use to take a regular selfie. Hold the phone out in front of you so that the shot captures both you and your reflection for an artsy effect."

      "title": "Hold your phone out to the side if you don’t want it in the shot.",
      "content": "Hold your phone out to the side if you don’t want it in the shot. To snap a selfie without actually having your phone in the picture, stretch your arm out to the side and angle the phone in sharply towards your body. Check your screen to make sure the angle is correct and the phone is out of the view of the mirror before taking your picture. You can always crop the phone out of your picture afterwards. If you don’t want to outstretch your arm as far, stand more to the edge of the mirror. This makes it easier to angle the phone so it’s out of sight."

      "title": "Place one leg out in front of you for a longer figure.",
      "content": "Place one leg out in front of you for a longer figure. Finding the right pose is key to the mirror selfie. To get into one of these leg-lengthening poses, imagine that you’re taking a baby step forward. Step slightly forward out to one side or cross one foot in front of the other. Then, point the toe of your forward foot to lengthen your legs even more. [8] X Research source Don't step out too far in front or too far out to the side, which might look a bit unnatural in the final shot."

      "title": "Stand facing forward with your legs slightly apart to show off your outfit.",
      "content": "Stand facing forward with your legs slightly apart to show off your outfit. To highlight what you’re wearing, place your feet about hip-width apart and square your shoulders so you’re directly facing the mirror. Stand up straight with your shoulders back so you don’t look slouched over in the picture. This gives everyone a good look at what you're wearing, and lends you a dynamic, interesting stance. [9] X Research source Let your arm hang naturally at your side, or place one hand on your hip to give a little more attitude."

      "content": "Sit in front of the mirror for a laid-back selfie. Have a seat to let everyone know you’re just vibing here. For example, sit cross-legged on the floor in front of the mirror or pull up a chair and throw a leg over the armrest. [10] X Research source Keep your back straight to fight off an unflattering slouch."

      "content": "Put your foot on the counter to spice up a bathroom mirror selfie. Bathroom selfies are classic, but can be tricky to make interesting. To make your pose more dynamic, throw a leg up onto the counter and rest your elbow on that knee. The extreme pose draws in viewers, and as a bonus, shows off your footwear in the process.

      "content": "Pop a squat to show off your figure. Turn to the side, then lower yourself to the floor while remaining on the balls of your feet. Keep your back straight and extend the foot nearest the mirror out just a bit. This is another great pose for featuring your outfit of the day, and flatters your form for extra glam.

      "content": "Take a lot of pictures in a variety of poses and angles. More photos means more choices! Snap multiple photos in all different poses or while holding your phone at different heights and angles. This will ensure you have at least one that you like and gives you plenty of options to choose from. [13] X Expert Source Annie Tao Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 3 March 2021. To automatically take more than one picture at a time, use the burst mode by holding down the shutter button or the volume button on your phone. If you have one pose that you like, take multiple pictures in it, making slight tweaks each time. For instance, if you like your legs crossed, take one shot with your hand on your hip and another with your hand in your pocket."
