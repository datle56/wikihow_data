      "content": "Lusterless and shriveling exterior A ripe, safe-to-eat eggplant looks really shiny and has tight, smooth skin. If your eggplant has lost its luster and/or looks wrinkly, it’s past its prime and no longer good to cook with. [1] X Research source Keep an eye out for brown spots around your eggplant, too. These spots are another sign that your eggplant is on its way out."

      "title": "Dull coloring",
      "content": "Dull coloring Take a close look at the stem growing from the top of the eggplant. Is it green and vibrant, or is it starting to fade? A withered, unhealthy-looking stem could mean that the eggplant is damaged and not good to cook with. Examine the body of your eggplant, too; depending on the variety, it should be a shiny, bold white or vivid purple hue, rather than a faded, listless color. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Squishy texture",
      "content": "Squishy texture Press along the body of the eggplant with your finger. Does it have a tiny bit of “give” to it, or is your finger breaking through the surface? If the vegetable is mushy throughout, you’re better off throwing it out and using a firm, ripe eggplant instead. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Brown-spotted and slimy interior",
      "content": "Brown-spotted and slimy interior If you’ve already bought the eggplant, slice into the flesh and take a look at the color. Is it white throughout, or does it look brown? Tap the surface of the inner eggplant with your finger, too—if it’s discolored and slimy, the eggplant definitely needs to be thrown out. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Rotten smell",
      "content": "Rotten smell Take a quick whiff of your eggplant and see if you detect any bad odors. If it smells nasty, throw it out right away. [5] X Research source Rotten, smelly eggplants may also have bugs hanging around."

      "title": "Mold and mushiness",
      "content": "Mold and mushiness Most mold on your eggplant is a big red flag, especially if the plant is soft and mushy to the touch. If your eggplant is still firm and the mold spots are really small, it’s safe to cut off the affected spots and eat or cook with the rest of the plant. [6] X Trustworthy Source Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA Food safety information provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Go to source Make sure to leave a 1 in (2.5 cm) perimeter around the mold spot as you slice it out. That way, the contaminated part of the veggie can’t touch the rest of the plant."

      "content": "Yes, if the browning occurred after you cut it. Eggplants go through a process called “enzymatic browning” after they’re cut—in other words, the white-colored slices of eggplant start turning brown after they come in contact with the air. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Oxidized eggplant is totally safe to eat, as long as you store it correctly. [12] X Research source Drizzle some lemon juice over your eggplant slices right after you cut them. The acidity of the lemon juice helps prevent the produce from turning brown."

Unlike other fruits and veggies, eggplants thrive when they’re kept out of direct sunlight in a room temperature area. [13] X Research source Be sure to use your eggplant within 2-3 days, or else it’ll start to go bad. [14] X Research source Store your eggplant a safe distance away from any tomatoes, apples, melons, bananas, or peaches. These fruits create ethylene gas, which makes eggplants go bad sooner.

      "content": "Refrigerate the eggplant if you plan on using it within 5 days. Eggplants prefer room-temperature storage, so stick it in your vegetable crisper drawer for safekeeping. Loosely cover the eggplant with plastic wrap before sticking it in the fridge—this helps the plant stay closer to room temperature and prevents any “chilling injuries” from developing. [16] X Research source Chilling injuries are soft, wet sections of eggplant that pop up after refrigeration. Never stick an eggplant in a sealed plastic bag! This makes it go bad really quickly.
