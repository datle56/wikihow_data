      "content": "Give babies 3-12 months of age a sip of warm, clear fluid. If you have a baby who's at least 3 months of age and they have a dry cough, try warming up 1-3 tsp (5-15 mL) of a clear fluid like apple juice or lemonade. The warmth may help soothe the tickle in your baby's throat that's causing them to cough. [2] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source You can administer this up to 4 times a day while the cough lasts. Do not give warm fluids to a baby who's under 3 months of age. Be sure that the liquid you give your baby is not sweetened with honey. Honey sometimes contains botulism, and babies up to 1 year old don't have the immune system to fight the infection."

      "title": "Offer a teaspoonful of honey to a child who's 1 or older.",
      "content": "Offer a teaspoonful of honey to a child who's 1 or older. If your child is at least 12 months old, 1 ⁄ 2 –1 teaspoon (2.5–4.9 mL) of honey can help loosen the secretions in their nose and throat that might be causing them to cough. In fact, honey is often more effective than cold medicine at soothing a child's cough, with none of the potentially-dangerous side effects. [3] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source You can do this as often as you need to while the cough persists. Never give honey to a child under the age of 1, due to the risk of botulism. Some pediatricians only recommend giving honey to children over the age of 2."

      "content": "Let the child have a cough drop if they're 6 or older. Over-the-counter cough drops can be very effective at easing the urge to cough. However, they can be a choking risk for children under the age of 6, so it's best to avoid them before then.

      "title": "Use a saline nasal spray to help free their airways.",
      "content": "Use a saline nasal spray to help free their airways. Even if your child doesn't seem to have a stuffy or runny nose, there may be dried mucus in their airways that's causing your child to cough. Give your child a spritz of saline nasal spray 1-3 times a day. That will help moisturize the passages in their nose and throat, allowing their body to clear out any remaining mucus. [5] X Research source You can buy saline sprays over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Use the spray once or twice a day until your child's cough goes away."

      "content": "Avoid giving over-the-counter cough medicine to your child. OTC cough and cold medicines should not be given to children under 6 years old without consulting your child’s doctor first. However, they also carry some risks for older children. In addition, they only mask the symptoms without allowing you to determine the root of your child's cough, so it's best to try other remedies unless your pediatrician directs you otherwise. [6] X Research source If the child is over the age of 6, follow the dosing instructions on the package."

      "content": "See your pediatrician if the cough is persistent. In most cases, a child's cough will clear up on its own, although it might linger for a few weeks. However, if the cough lasts for more than 2-3 weeks, even if there are no other symptoms, it's probably a good idea to take your child in to see their pediatrician to try to determine the underlying cause. [8] X Research source A chronic cough might be caused by asthma, and in some cases, it can even occur because your child has aspirated a small object, such as a toy or piece of food.

Although in most cases a child's cough isn't anything serious, there are times when it can become an emergency situation. If you notice that your child is having trouble breathing, talking, or crying, call to have them seen right away by their pediatrician, or take them to the emergency room if their doctor isn't available. Other reasons to take your child to see a doctor right away include: [10] X Research source Ribs are pulling in with each breath Breathing is noisy or much faster than normal Lips or face start to turn blue A high fever, or any fever if they are under 3 months old Under 3 months old and have been coughing for more than 3 hours Coughing up blood Whooping sound when they cough Wheezing or stridor (noisy musical sound) when they breathe in and out Acting weak, cranky, or irritable Showing signs of dehydration, such as dry or sticky mouth, no tears when they cry, peeing less often or fewer wet diapers"

      "content": "Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids each day. One of the best things you can do to help heal your child's cough is to make sure they stay hydrated. This will help keep their mucus secretions from hardening, so your child will be able to expel them more easily. Over time, this can play a big difference in shortening the duration of their cough. [11] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital.

      "content": "Offer your child nutritious foods to help them recover. Avoid feeding your child anything unhealthy, greasy, or processed while they are sick. Stick with simple, healthy choices, such as fresh fruits, cooked veggies, whole wheat toast, brown rice, and homemade chicken noodle soup. If your child is reluctant to eat, stick with foods you know they like and don’t worry about introducing new foods until they recover. You can also try offering your child a simple diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (the BRAT diet) if they are having nausea or diarrhea along with their cough."

Turn on the hot water in your shower and close the bathroom door, then sit in the bathroom with your child, holding them upright so they can breathe in the steam. [13] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source If you plan to sit in the shower, adjust the temperature of the water first. Try to stay in the steam for about 15-20 minutes. This is a good option for babies 3 months or less who are too young for other remedies, but it's effective for children of any age."

      "content": "Run a cool-mist humidifier if the air in your home is dry. If you live in a dry climate, the low humidity can cause your child's airways to dry out, worsening their cough. Running a humidifier in your home can help add moisture into the air, which is another way you can help loosen any mucus that's causing your child to cough. [16] X Research source Both cool-mist and warm-mist humidifiers are effective at adding moisture to the air. However, warm-mist humidifiers can scald your child if they get too close or turn the humidifier over, and they may breed bacteria faster, so it's safest to use a cool-mist option. [17] X Research source Be sure to clean the tank in your humidifier each day to ensure it doesn't start to grow bacteria and mold. If those get into the air, they can cause even more respiratory problems for your child."

This will elevate your child’s upper body slightly while they rest and it may make it easier for them to breathe while they are sleeping. [18] X Research source Never place pillows or soft bedding into a baby’s crib."

      "title": "Avoid exposing the child to allergens or irritants.",
      "content": "Avoid exposing the child to allergens or irritants. Sometimes, a dry cough can be the result of your child being exposed to respiratory irritants like smoke, dust, chemicals, or other fumes. It might even be due to allergies, including pollen, dust, mold, cigarette smoke, or pet dander. Do your best to keep your child away from anything that might trigger their allergies, and keep them away from second-hand smoke or any environment with unclean air. [19] X Research source Re-exposure to any of these substances might cause your child's cough to return, even after it's cleared up. Get an air purifier that has a HEPA filter in it and place it in your child’s bedroom. Run it at night and any time your child is in their bedroom to help keep the air clean."
