      "title": "Wrap the ends of the anklet around your ankle.",
      "content": "Wrap the ends of the anklet around your ankle. Place the middle of the anklet at the front of your ankle. Then, take each end of the anklet and wrap them all the way around your ankle so that they both cross at the back of your foot and meet at the front of your foot. [1] X Research source This knot works best on anklets with at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of extra cord at each end. This knot will work with any type of string or cord."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a small loop 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the end of anklet.",
      "content": "Create a small loop 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the end of anklet. Take 1 end of the anklet in your hand and create a loop that is approximately 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter. If the rope is thick, make the loop slightly bigger so that there is a visible hole in the middle. [2] X Research source If your cord is short, make the loop 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the end of the cord."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the end of the cord around the base of the loop twice.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the cord around the base of the loop twice. Hold the loop firmly against the anklet string that is wrapped around your angle. Then, take the end of the cord and wrap it over the base of the loop and around the anklet string. Repeat this process to create a sturdy loop. [3] X Research source Use the end of the cord that has the loop in it to create the wrap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the end of the cord through the loop and pull it tight.",
      "content": "Pull the end of the cord through the loop and pull it tight. Push the end up straight up and through the loop. Pull it tight and push the loop down toward the anklet. This secures the knot and holds 1 side of the anklet in place. [4] X Research source If necessary, trim off the end of the cord so that you don’t trip over it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the same process on the other side of the anklet.",
      "content": "Repeat the same process on the other side of the anklet. Take the other end of the cord and create a loop. Then, wrap the end of the cord around the loop and tuck it through the loop to secure the knot in place. These knots are really sturdy and don’t come undone easily. [5] X Research source Once again, use a sharp pair of scissors to trim off any extra cord."

      "content": "Slide the knots back and forth to adjust the size of the anklet. To make the anklet smaller, simply pull the knots toward each other. If you want the anklet bigger or want to remove it, pull the knots away from each other. [6] X Research source This anklet knot is great if you are giving it is as a gift, as the receiver can easily adjust the anklet to the right size."

      "title": "Pinch the ends of the anklet where you want the knot to be.",
      "content": "Pinch the ends of the anklet where you want the knot to be. Wrap the anklet around your ankle and then hold the ends together. This allows you to decide how tight you want your anklet to be. Make sure there you can fit at least 1 finger under you anklet, as this gives room for your ankle to swell slightly in warm weather. [7] X Research source Hold the ends at the front of your angle so that they are easy to knot."

    {
      "title": "Tuck the ends loosely behind the anklet.",
      "content": "Tuck the ends loosely behind the anklet. Use 1 hand to keep pinching the anklet in place and use your other hand to pass the ends of the anklet underneath the end strings that you’re pulling forward from your ankle, creating a loop that looks like a \"4\". [8] X Research source It is easiest to use your dominant hand to loop the ends."

    {
      "title": "Pull the ends of the anklet up through the loop that you created.",
      "content": "Pull the ends of the anklet up through the loop that you created. Push both ends of the cord through the loop and pull them tight to secure the knot. Release your pinch on the anklet, as the knot is now holding it in place. [9] X Research source If necessary, trim the ends of the anklet to your desired length."

      "content": "Thread both pieces of thread through the loop. Wrap the anklet around your ankle and push both the threads down into the loop. Pull the threads taught so that the anklet tightens against your ankle. Allow the bottom thread to hang down below your ankle and hold the top thread above your ankle bone. [10] X Research source This technique works for anklets with a larks' head buckle or a half hitch knot buckle, both of which are loops woven loops at one end of your anklet. The other end should have two braids or threads to tie around the loop."
