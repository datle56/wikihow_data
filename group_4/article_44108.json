      "content": "Assess whether your lawn is due for aeration. [1] X Research source You should aerate your lawn every 2 to 3 years. This process removes small plugs of soil from the ground and allows new nutrients, soils, air, and water to get to the roots of the existing plants. If your lawn is large, you may want to break it up into smaller segments and do a different one each year."

If you have a small lawn, you can even consider aerators that strap onto your shoes. You just walk around your lawn and poke holes in it with the soles of the aerators."

Apply approximately 3 to 4 pounds (1.5 to 2 kilograms) of topdressing per square yard/meter. A good rule of thumb is to not have topdressing more than 1-inch thick in any spot."
