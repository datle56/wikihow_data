      "content": "Wrap the end halfway around the pole. Move from the front to the back and drag the rope over so the end is hanging off the other side of the pole. Create a length of about 6 inches (15 cm) to work with on the end rope, which should be on the other side of the pole. [1] X Research source You can leave a longer end if you want, but it will hang out at the end. You need enough to go around the pole at least twice. You may need to increase the length if you are working with a larger diameter. Always keep your eye on where the ends of the rope are in comparison to one another. That makes it much easier to follow."

      "content": "Wrap the end of the rope over the pole again. When wrapping, make sure the end stays crossed over the first rope, forming an \"X\" as you go back around the pole, the same one you made when you crossed the ropes in the last step. Go over the pole, not under. Push it halfway around the pole, though you'll bring it to the front again in a minute. [3] X Research source You should see 2 loops wrapped over the pole, making an \"X\" in front, the one you just created in the previous step."

Go under the loop you just made and pull the end out at the top. [4] X Research source With this movement, you'll create a second \"X.\""

      "content": "Place your rope in the carabiner clip. Grasp the rope coming off your harness. Slip the edge of it into the carabiner clip from the left or right, depending on how the clip is facing. The long end of the rope (the one running down to your harness) should be coming out on the side away from you. [6] X Research source When climbing indoors, carabiner clips are anchored in the rocks so you can tie your rope on them to act as a safety. You can use this in any climbing that uses anchors. One benefit of this knot is you can tie it with one hand."

Grab it on the side opposite the clip part of the carabiner and then twist it up on itself to make a small loop. It should look like a lowercase cursive \"e.\" The rope should come down from the clip, then go up and forward to make the loop."

Move down the rope 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) away from the end and twist the rope to the right to make a second loop. You should end up with 2 loops. On the left loop, the end leading away will be in front of the other part of the loop. On the right loop, the end leading away will be behind the other part of the loop. You can only use the quick method with something that has at least one end up to slip the loops over."
