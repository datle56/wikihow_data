[4] X Research source Nether waste areas are your best bet for finding soul sand—they’re common areas that appear all over the Nether. You may have to dig underground a bit to find some soul sand, though (beneath Y=34, if you have your coordinates pulled up )."

Killing the Wither is no easy feat—it has anywhere from 300 to 600 total health (depending on the difficulty you chose) and can do damaging attacks that apply the Wither status effect (which depletes your health like a poison). Once you’ve defeated it, though, you’ll receive a Nether Star, which can be used to craft a beacon . [6] X Research source Beacons are helpful tools that can be used to generate helpful status effects."
