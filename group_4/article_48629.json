      "title": "Both Scorpio and Aries are ruled by lusty Mars.",
      "content": "Both Scorpio and Aries are ruled by lusty Mars. Scorpions and Rams see each other as strong and aggressive—two traits they both admire. Things between these two can definitely get hot and heavy between the sheets, although they might find it more difficult to forge a romantic connection. Scorpio, remind yourself to keep things light and be on the lookout for new ways to spice things up—Aries loves new adventures. Aries, try to slow it down sometimes.

      "title": "Sagittarius and Aries are both spontaneous and adventurous.",
      "content": "Sagittarius and Aries are both spontaneous and adventurous. It's going to get steamy! These two fire signs are both very passionate and when they come together, they might not spend much time outside the bedroom. Their adventurous natures mean they'll never get bored, either—there's always something new to try. [3] X Research source Sagittarius, reassure Aries of your feelings for them from time to time. They might take your need for space as a sign you're over them. Aries, you might need to rein in your tendency to get jealous or possessive with a Sagittarius partner. They need space just like you do—it's not a bad thing."

      "title": "Aries needs space and Aquarius gives them plenty.",
      "content": "Aries needs space and Aquarius gives them plenty. Aquarians tend to be cool and aloof, which gives fiery Aries a challenge—and an Aries is never going to back down from a challenge! They're both creative and energetic in bed, so they'll have a lot of fun. These signs make great friends with benefits because they're both capable of separating sex and emotions. Aquarius, open yourself up to Aries emotionally and romantically. They understand your needs and can provide a lot of support. Aries, focus on friendship over romance. If love is in the cards, it will come, but Aquarius needs to know you're a friend first."

      "title": "Aries has a lot of chemistry with Libra because opposites attract.",
      "content": "Aries has a lot of chemistry with Libra because opposites attract. These two signs are directly opposite each other in the zodiac. They have different sexual styles and interests, but they mesh together perfectly. Where Aries is dominant, Libra is submissive. Where Aries loves to chase, Libra loves to be chased. These two have no trouble pleasing each other in bed. Libra, show Aries how to compromise and find the happy medium so you both get pleasure from every encounter. Aries, teach Libra how to let go of their fears and be more adventurous . They might even feel bold enough to take charge once in a while!"

      "title": "Pair an Aries with another Aries for a sexual explosion.",
      "content": "Pair an Aries with another Aries for a sexual explosion. Their competitive natures help heat up the sexual relationship between these two fire signs. The result? Very physical, very active sexual encounters that are likely to go multiple rounds. Aries, as hard as it may be, you've got to pick your battles in a relationship with another Aries and know when to let it go. It's just not possible for both of you to always be on top."

      "title": "Aries is likely to think Gemini is all talk and no action.",
      "content": "Aries is likely to think Gemini is all talk and no action. It's not Gemini's fault—to them, all the talking and flirting is highly erotic. But action-oriented Aries can quickly lose patience because they want to get to the main event as quickly as possible. Once they get there, though, they'll definitely have a great time. Gemini, tell Aries your favorite sexual fantasies and they'll do everything in their power to make those fantasies a reality for you. Aries, keep things positive and upbeat during sexual encounters with Gemini. They have a more playful approach to sex that you might not understand at first, but you'll dig it once you get going."

      "title": "Virgo can be too uptight for spontaneous Aries.",
      "content": "Virgo can be too uptight for spontaneous Aries. Virgo knows what they want sexually and they're not going to be satisfied unless Aries follows their plans to the letter. These two are great as long as Virgo is willing to step out of their comfort zone occasionally and let Aries run the show. Otherwise, they work better as a random hookup than a full-blown relationship. [4] X Research source Virgo, try to break free from your plans occasionally and just go with the moment. Aries will love it if you leave a little room for spontaneity. Aries, let Virgo win arguments every once in a while—they like to be right. If you disagree on something that's not that important to you, just let them have it."

      "title": "Cancer requires more of an emotional connection than Aries does.",
      "content": "Cancer requires more of an emotional connection than Aries does. As long as these two are on the same page emotionally, they can have an incredible sex life. Aries can show Cancer the fun side of sex and open them up to new adventures in bed. But if Cancer isn't feeling the love, sex just isn't happening. [5] X Research source Cancer, introduce Aries to the power of emotional bonding and you'll both reach new levels of sexual pleasure. Aries, allow Cancer to smother you a little bit and be close to you. Take time before and after sex to show Cancer love and affection."

      "title": "Aries is likely to get bored with the slow and steady nature of Taurus.",
      "content": "Aries is likely to get bored with the slow and steady nature of Taurus. The biggest problem for these two is pacing. Sexually, Taurus prefers slow, sensual encounters while Aries is more into the fast, rough-and-tumble action. They'll have a good time if they can figure out how to meet in the middle. [6] X Research source Taurus, look for new ways to keep things in the bedroom fun and exciting. Aries needs a little spontaneity to hold their interest. Aries, do things Taurus enjoys to get them in the mood, then take your time. If you can slow it down, you'll both be immensely satisfied."

      "title": "Capricorn and Aries have a hard time figuring out how to please each other.",
      "content": "Capricorn and Aries have a hard time figuring out how to please each other. This sexual relationship could be great—if they can just get it off the ground. These two don't communicate well to begin with, so they have a hard time agreeing on when, where, or how to have sex. Aries is all spicy spontaneity while Capricorn takes a more thoughtful, almost studious approach that tends to bore Aries. [7] X Research source Capricorn, try to let go of the idea that everything has to be a particular way before sex can happen. Be a little spontaneous and see what happens. Aries, allow Capricorn to take the lead from time to time and let them set the pace."

      "title": "Pisces doesn't present enough of a challenge to Aries.",
      "content": "Pisces doesn't present enough of a challenge to Aries. Pisces is a natural giver and loves to give Aries whatever they want—which seems great! But competitive Aries wants to pursue and dominate their partner and Pisces doesn't quite give them that chance. As much as they understand each other, they have a hard time matching each other's energy in bed. Pisces, play hard to get every once in a while if you want to keep the attention of an Aries. They want to chase you. Aries, be patient when Pisces is shy and emotional. They're naturally curious and love to try new things, but they might need a little gentle persuasion."
