      "content": "Fill your sink or a similar container with warm water. Turn on the faucet and wait for the water to heat up to a comfortable temperature before lowering the stopper. You want it to be warm to the touch, but not too hot. Run enough water to completely submerge the shirt you want to stretch. [1] X Research source Overheating polyester and similar synthetics, even in water, could cause them to warp or lose their shape for good. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a small amount of hair conditioner to the water. A good rule of thumb is to use about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of conditioner for every 1 quart (0.95 L) of water. Pour the conditioner directly into the water, then whisk the water gently with your hand until the conditioner is evenly distributed throughout. [3] X Research source Conditioner can be useful for softening clothing fibers, just as it’s useful for softening hair. If you’re fresh out of conditioner, you can also use an equal quantity of a gentle moisturizing shampoo. Baby shampoo is a good choice. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Soak your shirt in the water for 15-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak your shirt in the water for 15-30 minutes. Push the shirt down beneath the surface of the water to make sure that it’s thoroughly saturated. Set a timer for at least 15 minutes. As the shirt sits, the combination of warm water and conditioner will encourage the tense threads to relax and lengthen. [5] X Research source After about half an hour, the water will have mostly cooled down and won’t have as much of an effect."

      "title": "Remove the shirt and wring out as much water as possible.",
      "content": "Remove the shirt and wring out as much water as possible. Pull up the stopper and allow the water to drain out of the sink. Then, grab your shirt and press, squeeze, and twist it to coax out any lingering moisture. By the time you’re done, your shirt should be slightly damp, but not wet. [6] X Research source Don’t be afraid to get rough with 100% polyester shirts—all that force will also serve to loosen up the stubborn fibers. Avoid wringing or twisting blended garments that contain cotton or wool. Natural fabrics are less resilient, and doing so could stretch them out permanently. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stretch your shirt to the desired fit by hand.",
      "content": "Stretch your shirt to the desired fit by hand. Take hold of the edges of the garment and tug on them to stress the fabric in every direction. For an even greater stretch, you can also slip both hands inside the torso or sleeves and push the material apart from within. Basically, imagine that the shirt is a ball of pizza dough and you’re whipping up a family-sized pie. Just don’t toss it into the ceiling fan! [8] X Research source Pay particular attention to any parts of the shirt that fit too snugly, like the chest, shoulders, neckline, or bottom hem. If you start to get tired, look for other creative ways to loosen up your shirt. You might wrap the whole garment around a post, swing it around like nunchucks, or stand on one end and pull the other end up towards you."

      "title": "Use a few heavy items to keep your shirt stretched out as it dries.",
      "content": "Use a few heavy items to keep your shirt stretched out as it dries. Once you’re satisfied with the shape of your shirt, smooth it out nice and flat and set books or other flat, heavy objects along the edges. This will help the fibers retain their new shape while drying rather than shrinking the way they normally would. [9] X Research source Lay your shirt out on a towel to absorb any remaining moisture and cut down on its overall drying time."

      "title": "Allow your shirt to air dry before wearing it.",
      "content": "Allow your shirt to air dry before wearing it. Polyester dries fairly quickly, so you shouldn’t have to wait long. Garments made from blended fabrics may take a little longer. Once the shirt feels dry, put it on and see if you can feel a difference in the fit! It may keep its new shape for a few hours if it's pure polyester, or until the next time you wash it if it's a blend. [10] X Research source If you prefer, you can also try hanging your shirt up on a shower curtain or towel rack as it dries—weight and gravity will help keep the damp fabric elongated. You’ll get the best results when working with blended fabrics, as natural fibers tend to stretch more easily and stay stretched out longer. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash or condition your shirt as usual.",
      "content": "Wash or condition your shirt as usual. Assuming you don’t want to go to the trouble of stretching out your shirt manually, another option is to let your body do all of the work. Start by putting your shirt through a regular wash cycle, or soaking it for about 30 minutes in a mixture of warm water and hair conditioner. Afterwards, squeeze or wring out the excess water so that the shirt is just damp. [12] X Research source Anytime you’re attempting to stretch polyester or another synthetic fabric, always wash them with warm water. Heat plays a big part in softening and relaxing the fibers. Be careful not to handle garments blended with natural cotton or wool fibers too roughly, or you may end up permanently overstretching them. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the shirt on while it’s still damp.",
      "content": "Put the shirt on while it’s still damp. Rather than spending a bunch of time yanking on your freshly-wetted shirt, simply pull it on and wear it. Having a body inside of it will expand the material without the need for a lot of physical labor. Even better, it will have a chance to conform to your natural contours. If you’re trying to loosen up a button-down shirt, be sure to button it from top to bottom to create the maximum amount of stretch. Wearing a damp shirt may not be the most comfortable thing in the world, but it’s effective and can save you time and energy compared to stretching it by hand."

    {
      "title": "Move around in your shirt to stretch it out even more.",
      "content": "Move around in your shirt to stretch it out even more. Once you have the shirt on, bend, lean, twist, and reach to flex the fabric as much as possible. This is especially helpful for relaxing overly-snug areas, such as the arms, chest, and back. When it comes to stretching clothes in a way that looks natural, movement is your friend. [14] X Research source Try running through a short yoga session or stretching routine while wearing your damp shirt. Just avoid doing anything strenuous enough to make you sweat."

    {
      "title": "Continue wearing your shirt until it dries.",
      "content": "Continue wearing your shirt until it dries. Drying your shirt around your frame will prevent the threads from shrinking as quickly. The process shouldn’t take long, since your body heat will rapidly evaporate any moisture still trapped in the fabric. Once the shirt is completely dry (or close enough), it will be ready for a night out on the town! 100% polyester garments will always go back to their original size eventually. For this reason, it may be necessary to stretch out a too-small shirt each time you want to wear it."
