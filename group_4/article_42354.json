Typical types include (but are not limited to): Curly or Afro-textured hair probably wants frizz-minimizing or softening shampoo that is creamy and has natural oils in it. Straight or oily hair probably wants a gentle shampoo designed for daily washing. Coloured or treated hair probably needs a shampoo that's fortified with extracts or amino acids, because treating your hair is essentially damaging it. Dry hair probably needs shampoos with glycerin and collagen to fix dryness and help restore some moisture into the hair."

If your hair is afro-textured, make sure that your hair is damp and slippery with conditioner before detangling. Then, work in small sections."

Try not to use hairstyles that tightly pin or pull the hair back. Styles such as cornrows or tight ponytails can cause damage at the roots, or put stress on the follicles. Instead, experiment with up-dos: a simple ponytail or chignon looks clean and requires very few hair products. You could also just keep your hair down and wear a headband."
