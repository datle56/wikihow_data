      "content": "Use a stainless steel brush on synthetic wigs. Rather than using your regular hair bush, get one made of stainless steel. Use it to carefully brush the wig hair, starting at the ends and working your way to the roots. Brushing the wig will “wake up” the fibers. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Avoid using any styling products. Synthetic wigs are inexpensive and therefore aren’t made to last very long. However, using styling products can cause the wig to deteriorate even faster! Don’t use any products, like hairspray or heat protectants, on synthetic hair."

      "title": "Use steam and other heatless methods rather than heat tools.",
      "content": "Use steam and other heatless methods rather than heat tools. Heat tools, like a curling iron or straightener will ruin the synthetic fibers. However, you can use steam and heatless methods to remove kinks or set a style. If you often wear synthetic wigs, you should invest in a handheld steamer, like the ones used to get wrinkles out of clothing. For example, if you want to add curls to the wig , Hair Augmentation Specialist Nikia Londy suggests that you \"apply bendy rollers to your hair to create curls of any size.\" Put the hair in foam rollers , then go over it with the steamer. Let the wig cool and dry, then remove the rollers. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Bleach the knots or lace on your wig to hide them.",
      "content": "Bleach the knots or lace on your wig to hide them. Bleaching the knots and or lace helps them blend into the color of your scalp by removing the black dots. Mix equal parts bleach and 20 to 30 volume professional developer in a bowl. Then, turn the wig inside out. Use the applicator brush that came with the bleach to carefully apply the bleach to the lace and knots. Wait about 15 minutes or until the knots turn blonde, then thoroughly rinse the wig out upside down. Immediately wash the wig with a neutralizing shampoo to stop the chemical process. Then, condition the wig to prevent the material from getting dried out. Allow the wig to air dry. Bleaching the knots will conceal the appearance of the black dots on the lace. Bleaching the knots isn’t only for lighter skin tones. Bleaching should be effective for any skin tone."

      "content": "Camouflage the lace on the wig with concealer. If the lace doesn’t quite blend in with your scalp or forehead, you can use concealer to color it. Take a concealer that closely matches your skin tone and apply a small amount of it onto a sponge. Use the sponge to blend the concealer into the lace front until it matches your skin tone.

      "content": "Use heat styling tools only on human hair wigs. Heat styling tools are typically okay to use on real human hair. You can use a flat iron or curling iron to style your hair as desired. Use a low heat setting and only style dry hair so that you don’t cause excess damage to the wig. [5] X Research source To straighten the wig, take a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section of hair and run the heated flat iron from root to tip. Repeat on each section until you’ve straightened all of the hair on the wig. To curl the wig, clamp the curling down on a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section of hair in the middle (between roots and tips). Then, wrap the bottom section of hair around the wand. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds and then let go. Repeat on each section until all of the hair has been curled."

      "content": "Style the wig in an updo, if desired. If you don’t want to leave the hair down, you can put it up in a ponytail or bun. Make a side ponytail by creating a deep part, then brush all of the hair to 1 side. Gather all of the loose hair and secure it with a ponytail holder. Create a top knot by gathering the hair into a high ponytail. Then, twist all of the hair around into a knot. You can secure the bun with bobby pins or a ponytail holder. Make sure the wig looks natural at the nape of your neck."

      "content": "Dye a human hair wig if you want to switch it up or add color and variety. According to Hair Augmentation Specialist Nikia Londy, \"dyeing your wig does not damage the hair if you do it correctly. It is especially important to make sure the temperature of the room is hot, due to the fact you will not have natural heat from the body.\" She adds the following pointers: \"Dilute the dye down if your wig is very curly, as curly hair can absorb the colorant more easily.\" and \"Apply the dye evenly across the hair so you don’t end up with darker patches.\" She also suggests doing an allergy test prior to using the dye, especially if you have a sensitive scalp."

      "title": "Trim the wig",
      "content": "Trim the wig to give it a more realistic look. If you didn’t buy a wig made specifically for a character, it’s typically a good idea to trim the hair on your synthetic wig. Hold a 1 inch (2.5 cm) section between your index and thumb at the point where you want to cut the hair. Hold a pair of sharp shears horizontally and trim the hair. Repeat until all the hair has been trimmed. Cut off little portions of hair at a time to avoid mistakes. [6] X Research source Cheaper synthetic wigs usually come with blunt cuts, so trimming the hair can give it a more natural appearance. You could also cut bangs into your wig. Keep a spray bottle full of water nearby to keep your wig moisturized as you cut it."

      "content": "Use gentle heat styling to add curls or volume. It’s okay to use minimal heat on a costume wig that won’t be used often. To add some volume and remove kinks, use a round brush and a blow dryer on a low setting. If you want waves, put the synthetic wig into hook-and-loop fastener rollers, and put it into the microwave for no more than 30 seconds. [7] X Research source Do not put the wig in the microwave if it has any metal clips attached to it."

      "content": "Apply dry shampoo to remove excess shine from the wig. Cheap synthetic wigs often have an unnatural shine. You can dull the shine a bit by using dry shampoo. Spray all of the wig with the dry shampoo of your choice. Then, use a stainless steel brush to brush through the wig. [8] X Research source It’s easiest to do this step when the wig is on a foam head."

      "title": "Braid your natural hair before putting on the wig.",
      "content": "Braid your natural hair before putting on the wig. Cornrow braids are recommended because they stay close to your head, so you won’t see a “bump” under your wig. The braids are also useful because you can add extra security to keeping the wig in place by using bobby pins to attach the wig to your braids. [9] X Research source Alternatively, you could put on a wig cap to hide your natural hair. If you have short hair, you don’t have to worry about doing anything to your hair before putting on the wig."

      "content": "Secure your wig with a chin strap to make finishing touches. Wigs will often move around when you try to brush them while wearing them. A chin strap clips onto both sides of the wig and will keep the wig in place as you complete your styling. Simply put on the wig, clip the chin strap to either side of the wig, and make sure it is securely under your chin. [10] X Research source You can find chin straps for $3 to $5 online or at a wig store."

      "title": "Use bobby pins or an elastic band to secure the wig to your hair.",
      "content": "Use bobby pins or an elastic band to secure the wig to your hair. The way you secure the wig depends on how long you plan to wear the wig. If you plan to wear it for a short amount of time, simply use bobby pins to attach the wig to your braids or hair. It’s also an option to put an elastic band around your head to hold the wig in place. [11] X Research source Some wigs may have drawstrings or clips inside of them to help secure them to your hair. Get yourself a wig grip band. It can be worn underneath your wig and attached to it using double-sided hook-and-loop fastener material that keeps it secure. Use a wig cap to prevent your wig from moving around or falling down. Wig caps will work regardless of if you have hair of your own or not. Though you can use adhesive glue or tape to attach the wig, it may cause an allergic reaction or damage your natural hair. See a professional stylist if you want to try these methods. You can also sew the wig into your natural hair"
