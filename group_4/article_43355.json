      "content": "Compliments are his way of saying he admires you. Of course, friends often compliment one another, so compliments in and of themselves may not be a way to tell if he’s interested in you . But if he’s recently upped his game, or if he compliments you more than he compliments other people, it’s likely he’s got a crush on you. [1] X Research source Giving you compliments also means he cares about you and wants you to feel good about yourself—who doesn’t feel good after hearing that they’re cute or funny or brainy? When he does compliment you, respond with a smile, or give him a compliment in return so he knows the feeling is mutual."

      "content": "We can’t help laughing at people we’re attracted to. Studies show that if a guy is into you, he'll chuckle at your jokes. If he's just a friend, he probably won't laugh unless your jokes are funny. So next time you tell a lame knock-knock joke, see what his reaction is: is he straight-faced, smirking, or doubling over in laughter? [5] X Research source If you like him and want to subtly convey it, try laughing at his jokes as well (yes, even the stupid ones)."

Alternatively, if he only talks to you when he sees you in person at work or school and doesn't text much outside of those contexts, he might only be interested in casual friendship. [7] X Research source If he likes you, he might text you “What’s the homework?” but he'll use it as an excuse to segue into a conversation. He might not be that big on texting, but if he likes you, he’ll find a way to talk to you after work, school, or wherever you traditionally see each other: for instance, he might call you on the phone or message you on social media."

Bringing up deeper subjects, such as his fears or family issues, may mean that he wants to take your relationship with him to a deeper level. It means he sees you as a partner—someone he can rely on.

      "content": "A guy who’s invested in you will demonstrate active listening. Observe his body language for signs he’s paying careful attention to what you’re saying. He’ll maintain good eye contact, nod while you speak, and remember little details about what you’ve said in the past. These are all signs he likes you and he’s interested in what you have to say. Note if he gets easily distracted. If someone else approaches him while you're talking to him, does he instantly abandon your conversation?

He might give you “friendly” hugs when you see one another as well. [9] X Research source"

There's a big difference between a lunch date and a dinner date, or morning coffee and an evening drink, and if he’s saving his weekends for you rather than just squeezing you in for lunch on a Monday, it’s a sign he sees you as more than a casual friend and may want to take things to the next level.

Do you engage in more date-like activities, like candlelit dinners, or relationship-like outings, like grocery shopping together? Or are you on the buddy system? Taking a long hard look at how you hang out can help you understand his real intentions. Are you doing couple-y things together without being a couple? Do you find yourself grocery shopping, cooking dinner together, or even going to the farmer's market with one grocery bag? These may be signs that he sees you as a girlfriend already. If you often do romantic things together, like picnics in the park or wine tastings, it could mean he wants to turn your friendship into a romantic relationship. Note how long you hang out for when you see him. Does your coffee date turn into a 3-hour discussion, or is he gone in the time it takes you to ask for the check? If he can't stop talking to you, this is a sign that he wants something more from you."

His friends may know for sure if he’s got the hots for you, but your friends likely also have valuable outsider insights if they’ve observed the two of you together a lot. Ask his friends if he's seeing anyone or if he has feelings for anyone. Pick a friend you really trust, though—otherwise, he might report to your guy immediately. You could also have one of your friends ask him if he has his eye on someone special. Your friend doesn’t have to be direct: they can pretend that they want to set him up with someone else, for example."
