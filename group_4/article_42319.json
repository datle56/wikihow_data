      "content": "Get a large aquarium. You’ll want a rectangular or square glass aquarium that is the right sized for your turtle when full grown, which will mean plenty of room for swimming, as well as space for a rock or shelf where the turtle can get all the way out of the water. The bigger the tank the better, but be sure to meet the minimum size requirements: [1] X Research source 30 gallons minimum for turtles between 4 and 6 inches in length 55 gallons for turtles between 6 and 8 inches 75-125 gallons for adults over 8 inches Minimum length: 3-4 times the length of the turtle Minimum width: 2 times the turtle’s length Minimum height: 1.5-2 times the length of the turtle, plus 8-12 inches above the highest spot it can reach in the tank"

      "title": "Place a water heater in the tank.",
      "content": "Place a water heater in the tank. Turtle’s cannot regulate their own body temperature, so you will need to keep their water at the appropriate temperature for them by installing a water heater. Most baby turtles will need water between 78° and 82° F, though you should check here to find the care sheet for your turtle type. Make sure the heater covering is plastic or metal, not glass, which turtles may break. Consider using two heaters to heat the water more uniformly and in case one malfunctions. Check the water temperature regularly with a thermometer. Be sure the heater is powerful enough: 75 watts for a 20 gallon tank 150 watts for 40 gallons 250 watts for 65 gallons 300 watts for 75 gallons."

      "title": "Install a UVB light and a basking light.",
      "content": "Install a UVB light and a basking light. Turtle’s need UVB light to synthesize vitamin D. It will also help them develop their shells. Without UVB light, they can get MBD (Metabolic Bone Disease.) They need basking lights for warmth because they are cold blooded, meaning they cannot regulate their own temperature. [2] X Research source You will need to install artificial lights to provide UVB (ultraviolet light B) as well as warmth. UVB Lamps – Come in compact and tubular. Use the 2.5% or 5% UVB lamp – aka Tropical UVB or Swamp UVB lamps. Desert lamps are too powerful. Place the lamp 12 inches from the water for a 2.5% lamp and 18 inches for a 5% lamp. Basking light – These are normal incandescent or halogen bulbs. The type of lamp does not matter so much as making sure it is the right distance to heat the basking area properly. For baby turtles, the center of the basking area should be close to 95° F, with the edges cooler. Use a thermometer to be sure the temperature is correct. Timer – You will need to turn off the lights 12 hours a day to mimic the natural cycle of light and day. Consider getting a light timer to do this for you. WARNING: Never look directly into the turtle light, as this can damage your eyes. Place it at an angle such that the bulb is not visible to people sitting in the room."

It is very important, since UVB bulbs will sometimes explode, particularly if splashed with water, and the glass can hurt your turtle. Make sure the screen is metal, since UVB light cannot penetrate glass or plastic."

      "content": "Provide a land area where your turtle can get completely out of the water. This can be a log, rock, or floating turtle dock. Make sure there is a slope so your turtle can crawl out of the water onto it, and make sure it is big enough: The land area should take up about 25% of the surface area of the tank. It should be 1.5 times the length of the turtle and it should be solid enough to not to break. The top of the tank should be 10-12 inches above the land to prevent your turtle from escaping."

      "title": "Keep the water the right depth.",
      "content": "Keep the water the right depth. For baby turtles, the water in the tank should be at least one inch deeper than the width of your turtle’s shell. This will allow them to swim freely. [3] X Research source As your turtle grows, you can provide deeper water."

      "title": "Use a filter to reduce how often you need to change the water.",
      "content": "Use a filter to reduce how often you need to change the water. Turtles are messier than fish; they pee and poop a lot. Without a water filter, you’ll need to change your turtle’s water daily to avoid disease. With a filter, you’ll still need to change some of the water every 2-5 days and replace all the water every 10-14 days. [4] X Research source There are special turtle tank filters, but you can also use a fish tank filter so long as you make sure to get one that is rated for 3 to 4 times the volume of your tank. Otherwise, it won’t be able to keep up with your turtle’s mess. There are several types of filter: [5] X Research source An internal aquarium filter – These filters, which usually attach to the side of the tank via suction cups, are too small to be the primary filter for tanks over 20 gallons. However, you can use them in larger tanks to help circulate the water. A canister filter – The best filters for turtle tanks, they usually mount under the tank and provide great filtration, often using an ultraviolet light sterilizer to kill bacteria and algae. Again, you’ll want to get one rated for 3 to 4 times the volume of your tank. Check here for a review of the most common filters. Hang-on-back (HOB) filters – These filters are designed to be set close to the water in a fish tank. Because water is lower in a turtle tank than a fish tank, you will need a filter cutout – i.e. a place where the glass is cut lower than the rest of the top of the tank – for these filters to function properly in a turtle tank. Again, you’ll need one rated for 3 to 4 times the volume of your tank. Under gravel filters (UGFs) – Reverse flow UGFs pump water up through the gravel at the bottom of the tank, allowing bacteria in the gravel to help filter it. For maximum effectiveness, they should be used with a gravel substrate of 2 inches of rounded pea gravel. Unfortunately, they will not filter large food particles, meaning these must be netted out regularly, and cleaning them is more difficult since they are under the gravel."

      "title": "Include a substrate if you are going to have live plants.",
      "content": "Include a substrate if you are going to have live plants. The substrate is the sand, gravel, or soil that covers the bottom of the tank. It is not necessary, and indeed will make cleaning the tank much harder. A simple painted bottom will do. However, if you are going to add rooted plants or want a more natural look, consider these substrates: Fine sand – Use fine grained sand, like that for children’s sand boxes. It is great for softshell turtles that like to dig in it. However, many turtle owners find it hard to clean. Aquarium gravel – A poor plant substrate, its use is mostly ornamental. Be sure to use gravel that is large enough that your turtle can’t eat it. Fluorite – A porous clay gravel, fluorite is the best choice if you are going to add rooted plants to your tank. It will make the water muddy when you first add it. Several days of filtering should clear the water."

      "content": "Add plants to the aquarium. Plants are not necessary, but some feel that a more natural environment makes for less stress on your baby turtle. Also, aquatic plants will help keep your tank clean by consuming pollutants and competing for the carbon dioxide that algae needs to grow. Just make sure you pick the right plants to match your turtle species: [6] X Research source Anacharis – Grows well in low light and inhibits algae growth. Good for mud/musk turtles. Plant-eating aquatic turtles like sliders, cooters, and painted turtles will destroy it. Java Fern – A hardy, low-light plant with tough leaves that turtles usually will not eat. Java Moss – A hardy, low-light moss that turtles usually don’t eat. Hornwort – A fine-leafed branching plant that grows in floating mats. It tolerates low light and grows quickly enough to survive alongside sliders, cooters, and painted turtles, though they will eat some of it. Red Ludwigia – A tough plant that turtles don’t eat, though they may uproot it from the substrate where it is planted. Requires additional light (2 watts/gallon). Good for small turtles like mud, musk, and painted. Anubias species – They are tough, low-light plants that turtles will not eat. Cryptocoryne species – These plants are low light tolerant and hardy, but must be planted in substrate and do not respond well to uprooting. They work best with smaller turtles in large enclosures. Aponogeton ulvaceus – This plant tolerates low life, is durable, and will not be eaten by turtles. It can grow in plain gravel substrate."

      "content": "Create a good environment for your plants. Plants need nutrients, light, and (usually) a place to put down roots. To give your plants the best chance to thrive: [7] X Research source If you use plants that need a substrate, try one of the clay gravels like laterite or fluorite. They provide plant nutrition with less mess. Add light or choose low-light plants. Most plants need 2-3 watts per gallon of water in the tank, while most aquarium lights provide on 1 watt. You can add more artificial light, but don’t put your turtle tank in a window, as this will overheat the tank and promote algae growth. If your plants do poorly, consider adding an aquatic plant fertilizer, which you can purchase at your pet store."

Aquatic turtles have to eat in the water because they can’t produce saliva. Unfortunately, leftover food quickly decays and makes for a messy tank. Use a net to clean up any leftovers when your turtle is done. Use a siphon-type aquarium vacuum to clean the substrate (i.e. the rocks or gravel at the bottom of the tank) every 4 or 5 days. Use a squeeze-bulb to start the siphon and put the hose end in a bucket below the tank. Gravity keep the water flowing from the tank to the bucket. For added efficiency, you can use your siphoning as a partial water change. Just be sure you siphon off enough water (see below) and replace what you have removed."
