      "content": "Some astrologers say it will begin in 2597. The Age of Aquarius occurs when the sun's location shifts from Pisces to Aquarius. This happens during a change in the earth's rotation called precession. As the earth wobbles slowly in a new direction, the sun shifts from 1 constellation to another according to the zodiac. It spends about 2,000 years in each constellation. Since the Age of Pisces began in 68 B.C.E., the Age of Aquarius will begin in 2597. [3] X Research source The entire period of precession lasts about 26,000 years. The point in which the age shifts from one sign to another occurs on the Vernal Equinox in March, A.K.A. the first day of Spring in the Northern Hemisphere. This describes the date in which the sun is directly above the equator. These numbers are based on the International Astronomical Union's calculations. Though the Age of Aquarius is an astrological event (not based in astronomy), the I.A.U. declared the borders for each constellation in the 1930s."

      "content": "Many astrologers suggest alternative dates, but there's no consensus. The I.A.U.'s dates and calculations are based upon the notion that the constellations are different sizes. Many astrologers disagree, believing that each constellation is of the same size. Because of this, the dates and calculations for when the Age of Aquarius will begin are much different. Some even believe it already happened, based upon their own interpretations of the zodiac calendar. Some astrologers believe the Age of Aquarius began in 2012. These astrologers' calculations suggest that the boundary between Pisces and Aquarius reached the Vernal Equinox point at this time. Others believe it occurred during the Great Conjunction of 2020, when Saturn and Jupiter met in Aquarius. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The term was introduced to pop culture in the 1960s. The 60s were defined by cultural change, brought about by the fight for civil rights, the sexual revolution, and protests against the Vietnam War. The musical Hair touched upon all of these ideas, and featured the song \"The Age of Aquarius.\" Though the Age of Aquarius didn't occur during this period, the period's promise of peace and transformation influenced the countercultural movements of the time. \"The Age of Aquarius\" was covered by the band The 5th Dimension, which made the song a smash-hit and the term a household name."
