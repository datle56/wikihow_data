      "content": "Tabarruj is centered around modesty. Aside from tabarruj focusing on outward appearances, it also includes flirtatious behaviors and attitudes, which are seen as immodest. Islamic teachings on modesty aim to shield women from objectification, harassment, and harm, while cultivating a sense of dignity and self-worth. [2] X Research source In Islamic teachings, the concept of tabarruj applies to both men and women. Men are equally obligated to lower their gaze and conduct themselves modestly. This mutual respect between the genders is essential for fostering a harmonious society. The way tabarruj is interpreted and practiced can differ across cultures and communities, yet its fundamental principles of modesty and propriety endure."

      "content": "Tabarruj is considered disobedience towards Allah. It is reported that Mu'awiyah gave a sermon in Syria and mentioned that the Prophet prohibited seven things, including tabarruj. [3] X Research source Abdullah bin Mas'oud reported that the Prophet \"used to dislike ten kinds of behavior,\" including \"Tabarruj by means of displaying beautification in an improper place.\" However, beautification for one's husband is not included in this prohibition. One passage from the Qur'an notes, \"And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves immorally (tabarruj) like that of the Days of Ignorance. And establish the prayer and give the Zakaat and obey Allah and His Messenger.\" [4] X Research source"

Umay'mah, the daughter of Ruqay'ah, is believed to have come to the Messenger of Allah to profess her belief in the message of Islam and to acknowledge him as the Messenger. In response, the Prophet said to her: “I give my acknowledgment that you must not set partners to worship besides Allah and that you don’t steal or commit fornication and adultery, that you don’t kill your child, that you don’t commit any falsehood before your hands and between your legs, that you don’t wail, and that you don’t make tabarruj like that of Jaahiliyyah.” [5] X Research source Qatadah said: \"The women would walk out, swaggering and flirting (with men) so Allah forbade them from doing that.\" [6] X Research source"

According to The Messenger of Allah, “There shall be, in the latter part of my nation, women who are dressed but (in fact) naked, on their heads are humps like those of Bukht (one kind of camel), curse them for they are surely cursed.” Muslims interpret this as a message of a curse and the expulsion of the mercies of Allah.

None of them will enter Paradise except as rarely as you see a red-beaked crow.” [9] X Research source"

Many women have revealed on TikTok that they find it difficult to wear anything that isn’t considered “tabarruj” and any feminine activities they partake in are automatically seen as sinful. While plenty of modern Muslim women have adopted the practice of wearing makeup and partaking in skincare, they often still keep tabarruj in mind as a guide to not go too far."
