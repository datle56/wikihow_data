They can also spawn in the Nether Creepers - A creeper is green and pixelated. When a creeper comes close to you, it will blow up. To stop the ignition process, you must be at least 7 blocks away from them, and you have 2 seconds to do so once the ignition process has started. The easiest way to kill them is to shoot them with a bow. Also, creepers don't burn in direct sunlight so be careful! Zombies - Zombies are slow and can only kill by punching . The easiest way to kill them is to fight back with a sword. They can pick up any dropped blocks, tools or armour which makes them stronger. They can shoot with a bow but only if a player has dropped it and they have picked it up. Sometimes, zombies don't give back collected items after killed. A zombie can hold an iron sword, shovel or some armour naturally. They can turn villagers into zombie villagers. Spiders - A spider can jump to blocks and only attack at night. During the daytime, they will not burn; however they will ignore you and do no harm. Enderman- a neutral mob that does not attack unless looked at above its torso or are attacked first. They can teleport around, do massive damage, and take damage from water. They can also spawn in the Nether. Slimes- They're hostile and will follow you no matter in which direction you are in. You can lead these mobs into a pit of lava or a hole. They spawn underground in specific chunks or in swamp biomes. Cave Spiders- They can fit in a 0.5 x 1 block gap, are normally in mineshafts, are more aggressive than normal spiders, and have venom. It leaves you with half a heart of life left, unless you drink milk. If you are in Hardcore, this can be the end of your world."

Here is a guide on the mobs of the Nether, all of which are immune to fire. Ghasts - Ghasts are flying mobs that hurl fireballs at you. These can deal between 1.5 - 5 hearts of damage, not including any fire damage. Kill them with a bow, or by smacking their fireballs right back at them. You can use any item, including you fists, to deflect a fireball. Wither Skeletons - Wither Skeletons are dangerous mobs that can inflict you with the Wither effect. This effect slowly causes damage over time, and cannot be prevented without milk. These mobs can deal between 2 - 4 hearts of damage. They cannot fit under 2 block high walls. Blazes - Blazes are mobs similar to Ghasts. They only spawn in or near a Nether Fortress, and consecutively shoot a trio of fireballs around every 10 seconds. These fireballs do not damage the terrain, but do light the terrain on fire. These mobs can fly, and have a similar shooting range as Ghasts. Magma Cubes- Magma Cubes are the Nether's variant to Slimes. All magma cubes do an extra heart of damage, and tiny magma cubes can deal half a heart of damage. Zombie Piglins- Zombie Piglins are the only neutral mobs. If you do attack one, all zombie piglins in a 50 block radius will go after you. Once all are defeated, they will become neutral again. Skeletons/Endermen - These are the only Overworld mobs that will spawn in the Nether. Skeletons are commonly found in Soul Sand Valleys sometimes in Nether fortresses, and endermen are found in Warped Forests. Piglins- Piglins are neutral/hostile mobs. They are neutral if you are wearing any piece of gold armor. They will become hostile toward you if attacked directly by a player, or if a chest is opened within their sight range. They can be used to barter via gold ingots, and can provide you with items such as ender pearls, fire resistance potions, and soul speed iron boots. They are aggresive to 'Zoglins and Hoglins' and do a kind of 'Victory dance' if killed on Java Edition (You won't see this on pocket edition). Hoglins - Hoglins are hostile mobs which have 20 hearts, and can deal around 9 damage. They are not fire resistant, and when killed, they can drop between 2 - 4 raw porkchops and 0 - 2 leather. They only spawn in Crimson Forests. If in overworld they become hostile to all (even zombies) and attack all undead mobs meaning creepers explode and cause damage. Striders - Striders can be considered as the \"horse\" of the nether. They can be used as a mode of transport across lava. They can be ridden the same way as a pig, except using a Fungus on a Stick to direct them. They are passive mobs, and move faster over lava than they do land."
