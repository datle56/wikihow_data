      "content": "Wear perfume. This is a good basic way to turn a guy on . You can kind of tailor your scent choice to something you know he'd like but it's always better to err on the musky side, as this most closely resembles the scents associated with sex. Avoid strong perfumes and perfumes with an \"old lady\" scent. Make sure you apply the perfume correctly."

      "content": "Show him that you're turned on. If he knows you're turned on, that's going to turn him on more than anything else. If he touches you in just the right way or says something that drives you wild, tell him. You can also send him texts or let him know in other ways as well. Try, \"God, I want you right now.\" or \"I cannot stop thinking about what I want you to do to me.\""
