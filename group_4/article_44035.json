      "content": "Grab a board you like, flip it over, and test the trucks by tilting them back and forth. The amount the wheels tilt back and forth depends on how tight the trucks are. If you have a board (or a friend's board) that you like, test the tightness on them and try to replicate it in your own board. The amount they wobble right and left relates to how tight they are."

It points directly to the ground when you're skating, and is found between the wheels. [2] X Research source Turn it clockwise to tighten the trucks, getting tighter turning. Turn it counter-clockwise to loosen the trucks, getting a softer turning feel. Make sure you tighten the trucks in very small increments (perhaps a quarter of a turn at a time before checking the board again), because a little bit of turning can affect it a lot.

      "content": "Bring your tool with you on your first few rides to make simple adjustments after testing. A hard day of riding will show you all the pros and cons of your new truck set-up. But that doesn't mean you need to be stuck with your set-up all day. A skate tool is small and easy to carry. Bring it along and make adjustments as needed. [4] X Research source The nut that holds the trucks is called the kingpin. It has a strip of nylon on top called a locking nylon, which should always be at least flush. Otherwise, if the nut rises above the kingpin, the locking nylon won't be attached and the trucks will eventually loosen and fall apart while you're riding.

      "content": "Know that truck tightness is a matter of personal preference. At the end of the day, there is no \"perfect\" amount to tighten your trucks. The tighter you turn the trucks, the more difficult the board is to turn. Too loose and you won't feel like you're stable, and your turns will be wide and difficult to control.The spot right in the middle of these extremes, your perfect tightness, is based on your own style and preference. Luckily, there is a large range of rideable tightness -- this isn't rocket science! Generally, tighter pins provide more resistance on turns, key for high-speed skating. Looser pins have a more forgiving feel on turns and landings. [6] X Research source If your trucks are looser, you can turn simply by leaning on your toes or heels.

      "content": "Re-pack your bushings to fit your skate style. The bushings can be tightly packed or loosely packed, with the former decreasing turning and the later increasing it. When tightening your trucks, you are actually compressing the bushings, so you can get similar results by changing the bushings altogether. [8] X Research source While not difficult, many skaters have this done at a local skate shop for the convenience."

      "content": "Try a new brand of trucks. Not all trucks are created equally, and each company has different specs and styles. A lot of it comes down to testing different boards out and finding out what you want, but there are some things to consider for all trucks: High or Low Kingpin: Higher pins are best for grinds, manuals, and other tricks. A lowered kingpin is best for popping ollies and kickflips. Wider Wheels: Most wheels are standard, but heavier riders might want wider trucks, as they distribute the added weight better for smoother control. [9] X Research source"

Furthermore, risers you will dampen landing vibrations, though the higher board will take some getting used. Higher trucks can make it harder, however, to grind. [10] X Research source"
