      "content": "Your account was reported by other users. The most common reason for an account suspension is that TikTok has received complaints or reports about your account. These reports are anonymous, and there’s no way to know why you’ve been reported without contacting TikTok. Typically, accounts are reported because other users feel like they’ve violated community guidelines."

      "content": "TikTok will add strikes to your account before suspending it. In most cases, TikTok doesn’t suspend or ban accounts willy-nilly—they’ll send you a few warnings first. These are called “strikes” and are received as a notification if and when your content is removed. TikTok keeps track of these strikes (with each ranging in weight depending on the severity of the violation) and will warn you if your account is on the verge of being suspended. [3] X Research source Strikes on your account expire after 90 days and will no longer put you at risk for suspension."
