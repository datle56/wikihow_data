    {
      "title": "Cover any dates and monetary agreements you came to with the other party.",
      "content": "Cover any dates and monetary agreements you came to with the other party. For example, if you are going to be hired at a rate of $23/hour for 40 hours/week starting 15 August 2019 for 6 weeks, clearly state those terms. Also, be sure to include any agreements you came to about who will cover incidental costs, transportation costs, or any other fees that may come up in the project. You can also list other terms of agreement, such as any supplies needed for a project that the recipient has agreed to provide, vacation or sick time, and insurance. List costs as both parties agreed to them. For example, if you quoted an hourly rate, don't switch to a daily rate."

List any conditions that you have already discussed that would lead to terminating the project earlier than agreed upon. [2] X Research source Some of these reasons could include unexpected costs, any unreasonable delays, or either party violating the terms specified in the letter.

      "title": "Keep it brief at 1-2 paragraphs.",
      "content": "Keep it brief at 1-2 paragraphs. A letter of undertaking should reiterate terms that you have already agreed upon with the other party.
