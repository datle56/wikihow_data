      "content": "Your social battery is the amount of energy you have for being social. Just like a phone battery drains after being used too much, a social battery can drain when a person uses up too much of their social energy. [1] X Research source The size of a person’s social battery completely depends on the individual; some people might be able to experience plenty of social engagement without getting drained, while others might feel drained right away. Having a “low social battery” isn’t an official mental health diagnosis—it’s just a term that helps people better express their personal energy levels."

      "content": "You’re introverted . Introverted and extroverted are common personality labels: introverted people feel more energized when they get to spend time by themselves, while extroverted individuals feel more energized when spending time around others. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Since introverts really value their “me-time,” it’s easy for them to feel drained from social interactions. This isn’t to say that only introverts can have a low social battery. However, extroverts naturally feel more energized by the world around them, so they typically have a larger pool of energy to draw from. Wondering if you could be introverted?

      "content": "You’re around people you don’t know well. Spending time with close friends and loved ones doesn’t tend to be as draining as socializing with acquaintances, colleagues, and the like. When you’re frequently forced to interact with people you don’t know well, like co-workers or distant relatives, it can start to take a toll on your social battery. [3] X Research source The context of the social interaction can play a part in how draining it is. Spending time with a client professionally, for instance, is more draining than a casual hangout with a good friend."

      "title": "You're social interactions are negative or low-quality.",
      "content": "You're social interactions are negative or low-quality. The attitudes and emotions surrounding a social interaction deeply influence its effect on you. For example, an argument with your parents might be more draining than a casual chat with a co-worker. Generally, the more positive a social interaction is, the less draining it will be. Power imbalances can also play a part in how draining an interaction can be. A member of a marginalized community, for instance, might feel drained after their concerns and struggles are downplayed by someone who doesn’t share their background."
