      "content": "There are a different versions of Liquid Nails, so choose wisely. Liquid Nails have a variety of different products that are designed for all kinds of unique purposes. For general purposes, the Heavy Duty or Fuze*It Liquid Nails products are ideal. [1] X Research source Liquid Nails are perfect for tiles, baseboards, drywall, backsplashes, crown molding, and basically any DIY job where you need to adhere two materials permanently together. For example, the Drywall Adhesive Liquid Nails are ideal if you’re filling in nail pops or combining pieces of drywall. There is a Subfloor and Deck Construction adhesive designed to prevent squeaky floors and bond lumber. You can find a list of all available Liquid Nails products here ."

      "content": "Use a utility knife to clip the tip of the nozzle off. Hold the tube firmly in your nondominant hand. Grab a utility knife and cut the tip of the nozzle off. The size of the opening determines how much adhesive comes out when you pull the trigger. For a smaller bead, you might cut 1 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.32–0.64 cm) off, but for a larger bead you might cut off 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) or more. [2] X Research source If you have Fuze*It Liquid Nails, you’ll need to unscrew the nozzle and cut the tip off of the bit with threading on it (but leave the threading itself). Then, screw the nozzle back in place. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert a nail or a pin in the nozzle to open the tube.",
      "content": "Insert a nail or a pin in the nozzle to open the tube. The adhesive won’t flow through the nozzle if you don’t break the opening at the base of the nozzle. To do this, grab a long nail or pin and slide it into the nozzle. Keep pushing until you feel the opening of the tube break open and remove the nail or pin. [4] X Research source Look on the underside of your caulk gun for a small metal nail. That nail is meant specifically for this."

      "title": "Use a traditional caulk gun",
      "content": "Use a traditional caulk gun to apply Liquid Nails. Press the trigger on the backside of the handle to depress the metal rod and pull it all the way back. Slide the tube of Liquid Nails into the middle of the caulk gun . [5] X Research source If the tube feels loose in your caulk gun, gently pull the trigger halfway to “lock” the tube in place. That trigger on the backside of the caulk gun locks the metal rod in place. When you press it, the rod moves freely. The trigger on the front of the caulk gun pushes the metal rod further. When the metal rod hits the back of the Liquid Nails tube, pulling this front trigger will push the adhesive out. If you don’t have a caulk gun: squeeze the back of the tube hard with your non-dominant hand and guide the tube with your dominant hand to push the adhesive out. It really does make a world of difference if you have a caulk gun, though. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Put the nozzle against the surface and pull the trigger.",
      "content": "Put the nozzle against the surface and pull the trigger. The Liquid Nails will come out surprisingly fast, so don’t repeatedly squeeze the trigger until you have a good sense for how quickly the adhesive comes out. Slowly pull the trigger once or twice. [7] X Research source Once you see the adhesive coming out of the nozzle, start moving the gun."

      "title": "A zigzag pattern will ensure a perfectly even coverage.",
      "content": "A zigzag pattern will ensure a perfectly even coverage. Lead the caulk gun by hand and make each zig in your pattern 4 inches (10 cm) away from one another. Cover the entire surface that you want to bind and push the surfaces together. If you want total coverage for heavier materials, use two zigzags that overlap in the middle. [8] X Research source If you start running out of adhesive as you’re moving the gun, just pull the trigger again. Aim to make each bead of adhesive the same size. If you’re binding really small materials together, like two decorative stones for your yard, feel free to stick with a single bead."

      "title": "Use the trigger on the back and hold the gun up to stop it.",
      "content": "Use the trigger on the back and hold the gun up to stop it. When you’re done applying the adhesive, take your finger off of the front trigger. Press the trigger on the back and pull the metal rod back. This will take the pressure off of the tube so that the adhesive stops coming out. [9] X Research source If you only want to put the caulk gun down for a moment, wrap the nozzle tip in a plastic bag or a rag and set it down."

      "title": "Liquid Nails dries after 15 minutes and cures after 7 days.",
      "content": "Liquid Nails dries after 15 minutes and cures after 7 days. Unless you’re using an instant-bonding version, you can still reposition or move the two materials you’ve bonded together for the first few minutes. After that it will be relatively difficult to undo the work. After 7 days, forget about it—the two materials are permanently bonded. [10] X Research source The Extreme Heavy Duty, Paneling and Molding, and Paneling and Foam Adhesive Liquid Nails offer instantaneous bonding if that’s what you need. The Ultra Quik Grip offers flexible holding upon contact, so feel free to make minor adjustments, but don’t expect the two materials to come unconnected. Every other version of Liquid Nails will be relatively wet and liquid for the first 15 minutes as it dries."

      "title": "If you get any Liquid Nails on your skin, rub spirits on it.",
      "content": "If you get any Liquid Nails on your skin, rub spirits on it. Wipe off as much of the adhesive as you can while it’s still wet. Then, pour mineral spirits over your skin to break up the remaining adhesive and get your skin back to its former glory. [11] X Research source If you need to remove Liquid Nails from a surface after it has dried, use a hair dryer to heat the dried-out adhesive and scrape it off with a putty knife."
