      "content": "Open the computer's BIOS/UEFI settings. Luigi Oppido notes the process usually involves pressing keys during the boot process, but those keys vary by manufacturer and model. Some manufacturers require pressing \"Delete,\" \"F2,\" or <alt>+ or other key combinations while the system goes through POST (Power On Self Test) or displays a logo on the screen. Alternatively, you can use the following steps to enter the BIOS/UEFI from within Windows: Open the Start menu and click the Power icon. Hold Shift as you click Restart . Wait for your computer to boot into Recovery Mode. Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > UEFI Firmware Settings . Click Restart ."

      "content": "Locate \"Frequency/Voltage Control\" settings. BIOS screens generally consist of several pages of settings, each relating to certain parts of the PC's operation. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the screen with frequency and voltage control options. Note: Not all computer BIOS have \"Frequency/Voltage Control\" settings. In some cases, the manufacturer may lock the clock speed."

To install MSI Afterburner: Go to https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards . Click the Final button at the bottom to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP file in your Downloads file. Double-click the setup file you extracted and follow the instructions to complete the installation."

Also, check to see if there are any performance problems while the benchmark test is running. If your computer restarts or you experience performance issues while using GPU-intensive programs or running a benchmark test, raise the clock speed by about 50 MHz at a time and see if this fixes the problem."
