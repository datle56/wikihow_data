If the logo is faded or faint, this is probably evidence of the logo being copied from another source and could indicate a fake check as well. If the logo seems legitimate, look for an address. You need to check the validity of the bank address, which you can do by going online to the bank's website or calling the bank. Make sure each part of the address is correct. If the check has no address or just a PO Box, the check is likely a fake."

If the check does not have a check number, the check is fake. The MICR line is the line of numbers at the bottom of a check printed by the issuing bank that gives all the relevant numbers for a check. From left to right, the long string of numbers contains the routing, account, and check numbers. The check number should match the numbers on the far right of the line. If it doesn't match, the check is likely a fake. [1] X Research source If the check number is low, from 101-400 on a personal check or 1000-1500 on a business check, the check may be fake.
