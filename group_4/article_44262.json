      "content": "Understand how cassette recording works. To record your cassette audio on your computer, you will need to connect your cassette player to your computer's microphone (or \"line-in\") port and then set your computer to record only the line-in audio. This will prevent your computer from recording external audio (e.g., background noise) while creating a clean, high-quality recording of your cassette. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. In addition to a cassette deck and a computer, you will also need a cable that connects your cassette deck to the line input on your computer. Almost all cassette decks have a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you'll usually only need a standard 3.5mm cable to connect the deck to your computer. Some cassette decks have unbalanced line outputs. You'll recognize those as having red and white ports. For these, you will need an RCA-to-3.5mm cable. High-end cassette decks may sport balanced line outputs, with dual 3-pin XLR-F connectors or balanced 1/4\" phone jacks. You will need to buy an adapter that fits both your computer's 3.5mm jack and the cassette deck's outputs."

      "title": "Find your computer's \"line-in\" jack.",
      "content": "Find your computer's \"line-in\" jack. On computers that have separate headphone and microphone ports, this jack will usually be pink. If your computer only has one 3.5mm headphone jack, it supports both line-in and line-out audio. [2] X Research source Desktop computer users will usually find this jack either on the back or the front of the computer's tower. Laptop computers almost always have a monophonic line-in and line-out jack. This means that, while you can use the jack for transferring your cassette deck's audio, you won't be able to record in stereo."

If you're connecting a balanced line output from your cassette deck to your computer, you'll need to plug the 3.5mm end of the adapter into your computer's line-in jack.

Depending on the cassette deck type, this process will vary: [4] X Research source 3.5mm — Plug one end (it doesn't matter which one) of the 3.5mm cable into your cassette deck's 3.5mm line-out (not headphone) port. Unbalanced — Plug the red RCA cable into the red port and the white RCA cable into the white port. Balanced — Plug the XLR or 1/4\" cables into their inputs on the deck."

Click OK on both open windows when you're done. Mac — Open the Apple menu , click System Preferences... , click Sound , click Input , select your cassette deck's input, and drag the \"Input Volume\" slider left or right to decrease or increase its volume. Start with a very low volume on the cassette deck or stereo, as your computer's input circuitry can be damaged by high-level input."

If the recording is too quiet or too noisy (the music is quiet but there's lots \"fuzzy\" noise), the output was too low and the recording did not have enough signal to offset the noise. If the recorded sound sounds like it's being played through a broken speaker or a meat grinder, your recording was too loud, and the sound's distorted. You can adjust your computer's sound settings to help offset the above issues."

Programs such as Audacity (available on both Windows and Mac computers) can perform basic editing, while more advanced paid programs may be able to clean up your recording. When editing, it is a good idea to keep the original file as a backup and change the names of edited files when you save them in case you find you made a mistake. When you're sure you like the edited file, you can delete the original to save drive space on your computer."

[7] X Research source Most audio-editing programs offer some form of normalization."

It works by keeping the loudest sounds about where they started while bringing up the level of the quieter passages. You lose the difference between the highs and lows—or dynamics —and in return, you get an apparently louder recording. When listening at home, this isn't necessarily desirable, but if you're making a CD for your car, it can be very useful. [8] X Research source"
