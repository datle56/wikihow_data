If you tend to always say “yes” to things even when you don’t want to or when situations cause you stress, start saying “no.” Sometimes, people pleasers have a fear of disappointing others that's rooted in insecurity. Remind yourself that you're awesome; people like you for you —not what you can do for them. There’s no need to make excuses or talk your way out of it. A simple “no” or “no thank you” will do.

Make sure to pay attention to how you feel each time you say “no.”"

This will give you some time to think it over, ask yourself if you feel pressured, and think about possible conflicts. [10] X Research source If the person needs a quick response, say no. Once you say yes, you’re stuck. Don’t use this as a way to avoid saying no. If you want to or need to say no, just say it without making the person wait.
