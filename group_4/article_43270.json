      "title": "Do you hang out alone?",
      "content": "Do you hang out alone? If he likes you enough to dedicate his time to you (and you alone) that's definitely a sign that he likes you. If the two of you mainly hang out in big groups, it might feel tougher to decode his feelings. But here's a trick: casually ask him to hang out along and see what he says. [1] X Research source \"Hey, I know you wanted me to tell you the next time I made my special brownie recipe. You're in luck! Swing by and grab a few if you want.\" If he accepts your offer and tries to hang around (alone) with you for as long as he can, that's a good sign. If not, that might be a sign that you're just pals. If he does spend time with you solo, pay attention to how he acts. If you notice he's a little different now than around the guys, that's a sign he's got a crush."

      "content": "What kinds of words does he use to address you? Are they friendly, or are they flirty? If he pretty much addresses you in the same way that he does his guy friends (\"bro,\" \"dude,\" \"man\"), that's a sign that he sees you as a friend. On the other hand, if he uses sweet or silly nicknames for you, that could mean that he's trying to create a bond with you (and relatedly, that he likes you!). [2] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. If he likes you, he may use obviously flirty nicknames, like \"cutie,\" \"love,\" \"honey,\" or \"babe.\" On the other hand, he may choose a teasing nickname, like \"killer\" or \"kid.\" You might even notice that he uses your name more than he does with others (\"Dana, how's it going?\"). This could be a sign that he's into you, too."

      "title": "Does he talk about deeper, emotional topics with you?",
      "content": "Does he talk about deeper, emotional topics with you? Pay attention to how he speaks to you, especially if you're ever alone. Does he discuss the same topics that he does with other friends, like sports, cars, school, or silly jokes? You might start to get the sense that he's not trying to impress you (fart jokes galore!) or that he treats you exactly like he does with friends. On the other hand, if he always asks about deeper, more meaningful topics, that's a sign that he likes you. [3] X Research source If he likes you, he might ask about your fears, insecurities, romantic history, or desires. You might also notice that he takes every chance to compliment you (\"You have really nice hair,\" \"I love how funny you are\"). Meanwhile, if he compliments other love interests around you instead, that's a sign that you're just a friend."

      "content": "Does he regularly start up 1-on-1 conversations with you? Is he constantly blowing up your phone with texts, calls, and DMs? This is a surefire sign that he's interested. When you to hang out in groups, he might try to find time alone with you if he has a crush. If you guys break out into teams, he wants to be on yours. If you're all driving home in different cars, he asks you to ride shotgun. [4] X Research source If he's texting you first thing in the morning and late at night, that's a sign that he's thinking about you when he's alone (AKA, he might like you!)."

      "title": "Does he ask you about your romantic life?",
      "content": "Does he ask you about your romantic life? Friends usually show an interest in their other friend's lives, so if he wants to know about your love life, it's not a definite sign. That said, if your friend is always asking about who you like, who you've dated, and more, he might be gathering intel. He could be trying to figure out if he has a shot and if he's your type! [5] X Research source Side note: if a man, friend or not, demands to know who you've been with or who you're seeing, that's not cool. Plus, it's a sign of jealous, controlling behavior. So some casual curiosity is great, but if he's obsessing or making you uncomfortable, try setting boundaries or cutting off contact."

If you feel comfortable, try sitting beside him or touching your leg and shoulder to his. Then, pay attention to how he reacts. [6] X Expert Source Laura Bilotta Dating Coach & Matchmaker Expert Interview. 7 July 2020. If you're just a friend to him, he'll probably show no acknowledgement because he feels comfortable. Or, if he moves away from you, that's another signal that he doesn't see you in a romantic way. It might be a bummer, but now you know! But if he encourages your contact (by putting an arm around you, leaning closer to you, or looking you in the eyes when you touch), that's sign the he likes it."

He might always try to sit next you at the group movie or dinner. And when you do sit next to each other, he might look for opportunities to establish contact (by touching knees, cuddling up close, you name it). [7] X Research source On the other hand, if he doesn't seem to care where you sit, that's a sign that he sees you as a pal. He might even offer to remove an eyelash from your face or brush loose hair behind your ear. In this case, he might be trying to create more intimacy."

He might fiddle and fidget because you make him nervous. In this case, he might play around with objects in the room, have a shaky voice, or have sweaty palms. On the other hand, if he wants to charm you, he might have open body language. Open body language means spread legs, shoulders rolled back, and open palms.

If he nods along to what you are saying or gestures out towards you, then he's trying to engage you even more in conversation. Or, if you notice that gestures seem to mirror yours (so if you cross your legs, so does he), then his body language signals that he's trying to charm you. [10] X Research source On the other hand, if his body language is the same with you as it is with other pals, that might be a sign that you're more of a friend to him."

I also feel like you’re my best friend, and I want to make sure that we can remain friends. I’m just glad we were able to talk to about this.” Your friendship may not be exactly the same as it was before, and there may be some initial awkwardness.
