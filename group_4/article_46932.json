The SR22 is a slower plane and easier for beginners while the F-16 is for more intermediate to expert users. In this guide, we are using the F-16 as an example. Start Position : If you set a destination in the second step, select Current View . Otherwise, you can select an airport or your last position on the flight simulator. Beginners should use the New York airport. Joystick : Check the box if you are using a joystick to control your airplane."

At the top center, you'll see a compass . On the right, you'll see your vertical speed (ft) per minute. If it goes negative, it means you are going down. Below that is your altitude (ft) above sea level. The arc in the center from the screen is your main HUD. The arc is your bank angle. The parallel lines are the pitch angle in degrees; if it says 90 then you're pointed straight up and are stalling. On the bottom left corner, you'll see a box. The left side is the throttle, the top side is the aileron, the right side is the elevator, and the bottom is the rudder. Above the box, you may see your flap indicator and landing gear status. If you're using the SR22, you won't see this."
