      "title": "Purchase a cast cover.",
      "content": "Purchase a cast cover. This is probably the easiest means of waterproofing a cast, as it takes care of some work for you. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist about cast covers. Many companies sell covers designed to protect casts from water. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Cast covers usually have long sleeves made of waterproof material to pull over your cast. They come in different sizes to fit various types of casts. The main benefit of a cast cover is that they're far sturdier than other options, making tears less likely. Some cast covers come with a pump that sucks air out of the cover. This forms a tight seal surrounding the cast, adding extra protection."

      "content": "Wrap the cast in two plastic bags. If you don't have a cast cover, household items can help. Sealable plastic bags can be fit over a cast to keep it safe from water. Newspaper bags, bread bags, or small trash bags usually work well. Simply pull a bag over the cast and seal it using medical tape or rubber bands. Then, do the same with a second bag to ensure your makeshift cast cover is entirely watertight. [2] X Research source Make sure to check the bags for any holes before using them to waterproof your cast."

      "content": "Cover the cast with plastic wrap. If you wrap plastic wrap tightly enough, it can also effectively waterproof a cast. Wrap the plastic wrap around your entire cast, making sure there are no gaps where the cast is exposed. Then, secure the plastic wrap in place with some medical tape or rubber bands. [3] X Research source Keep in mind plastic wrap may be less effective than other methods. While inexpensive, you may end up with gaps where the cast is exposed. After applying plastic wrap, you could also place a plastic bag over the cast and secure it with medical tape to create a second watertight layer."

      "content": "Wrap a washcloth or towel near the top of the cast. Choose one of the methods above to cover your cast, then do this regardless of the method you use—it’s important.

      "content": "Have some kind of chair in your shower. You’ll need to sit down if you're showering with a broken leg. Many people consider lawn chairs a good option, but you should check with your doctor beforehand. Get a suggestion from a medical professional about the type of chair to put in your home shower. [5] X Research source Make sure your chair is secure. If a chair slips and slides in the shower, this could cause further injury. You may have to lay a bathmat down to prevent sliding. Have someone without a broken leg test the chair's security before you attempt to get into the shower."

      "title": "Lower yourself into the shower stall.",
      "content": "Lower yourself into the shower stall. If you have a cane or walker, use that for support as you walk towards the shower. Turn your back to the shower stall and lower yourself into the chair, using whatever you can hold onto for support. If it is secure, try holding onto the sides of the shower or the shower bar. [6] X Research source Remember that some shower bars are not drilled into the wall. Test to see if the bar is secure before using it as support. Gently sit down in the chair and situate your leg away from the shower's running water. Turn your body so you're facing the shower controls."

      "content": "Use a detachable shower hose to clean yourself. This will give you a lot more control when showering seated. Direct the water on the body parts you want to wash, and keep the shower hose away from your cast. [7] X Research source If you do not have a detachable shower hose, you can try showering with the main shower head and a wet washcloth. Just be extra cautious to keep water away from your cast. You should always wrap your cast in a protective covering before showering."

      "content": "Keep your cast out of water. Even with excellent protection, there's always a risk of water seeping through onto your cast. Try to keep your cast away from water entirely after an injury by taking a bath instead of a shower; you can prop a broken limb (like an arm or leg) on the edge of the tub to keep it dry while washing the rest of your body. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you prefer a shower, keep your cast away from running water. You may have to keep the broken limb outside the shower as you wash. However, don’t bathe or shower without a cover, even if you keep your cast away from the water. Even a small amount of water can be harmful to a cast."

      "content": "Try sponge baths instead of showers. In addition to risking getting your cast wet, navigating a shower can be difficult after an injury. This may be especially tricky if you have a broken leg. If possible, opt for sponge baths instead of showers. [12] X Research source If you have a child in a cast, you may be comfortable simply sponge bathing your child until they feel more comfortable with their cast. If you're an adult, you can try sponge bathing yourself near a sink. If you have someone you're comfortable asking, see if that person can provide a sponge bath."

      "content": "Ask your doctor if a waterproof cast would be appropriate for you. A waterproof cast can usually be safely submerged in water. If you feel like you're at a higher risk of getting your cast wet, ask your doctor about a waterproof cast. Waterproof casts can be made with several different materials; some may work better than others, so ask your doctor which materials would work for you. [13] X Research source Keep in mind a waterproof cast is not 100% waterproof. While it can withstand water better than most casts, you should still take precautions when bathing, showering, or swimming. Try to get the cast wet infrequently. A waterproof cast may not be appropriate if you have a fracture that requires mobility to heal."
