      "content": "Shampoo your hair 2 to 3 times a week to prevent your hair from drying out. Wavy hair tends to dry out easier than straight hair and it needs the moisture from natural oils on your scalp. Wash your 2B hair whenever it's dirty or greasy instead of every day. This way your hair is less likely to become frizzy. [1] X Research source You might find that your wavy hair looks best the day after you wash it."

      "title": "Use a sulfate-free shampoo to prevent damage and frizz.",
      "content": "Use a sulfate-free shampoo to prevent damage and frizz. Harsh ingredients like sulfates, silicones, and alcohol can really dry out your hair. To protect it and prevent frizz, reach for a shampoo that contains hydrating ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil, argan oil, or elastin protein. [2] X Research source Look for sulfates on the ingredient label. The most common ones are sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate. Read labels when you're buying shampoo and look for a product that says it's moisturizing or hydrating. Some products designed for wavy or curly hair may be labeled \"low poo.\" This means that they don't contain the harsh ingredients that create rich lather like in most shampoos.

      "content": "Apply a moisturizing conditioner and leave it on for 5 minutes to absorb nutrients. Work a silicone-free moisturizer into your hair and pay extra attention to the tips since these tend to dry out easily. Then, let it sit for5 minutes before you rinse it off with cool water. The cool water helps close the hair cuticle to lock in moisture. [4] X Research source If you're not a fan of cold showers, you can finish taking a hot shower. Then, rinse your hair in the sink using cool water. You don't need to apply moisturizer to your scalp. Since your 2B hair tends to be straighter near the roots, moisturizer on the scalp can actually weigh your hair down even more so it looks less wavy."

      "content": "Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair if you want to detangle it. Your wavy hair probably tends to tangle easily and you may find knots when you're washing or conditioning. Take the time to gently break apart each knot with your fingers. Then, comb through your hair with a wide-toothed comb or your fingers just to check for more tangles. [5] X Research source In general, if you've got 2B hair, you should always use a comb instead of a brush if you're detangling your hair. Brushes contain many tiny bristles that create friction. This is a huge cause of frizz."
