These materials explain the different plans available for Medicaid recipients. [3] X Research source You may be able to choose a plan yourself, or the Medicaid office may choose a plan for you based on the information you provided to them when you signed up. If you don't like your initial plan for any reason, you are always free to change your plan any time within the first 90 days you are enrolled in Medicaid. If you didn't receive an introductory packet or confirmation letter in the mail, contact your local Medicaid office for assistance. Make sure they have your correct address and contact information."

You might also be able to change your plan through healthcare.gov, if you initially enrolled there. [6] X Research source If you have internet access but you haven't yet set up an online account, it's a good idea to do so. You will need your Medicaid ID number to set up an online account.

Let them know that you're within your first 90 days of Medicaid and want to change to a different plan. [8] X Research source If you have questions about the available plans, or aren't sure which one will work best for you and your family, a Medicaid counselor in your local office will be able to help you. For example, you might want to make sure you can still see the same doctors. The counselor would be able to help you identify plans that your doctors accept. If you or your children have a particular medical condition, such as diabetes or asthma, let the counselor know so they can identify the best plan for you that has programs to help manage those conditions."

If you don't report them within 10 days, you could lose your Medicaid benefits. The reporting requirement applies regardless of whether the life change would entitle you to switch Medicaid providers. Changes that must be reported include a change of people in your household, change of address, change of employment or amount of income, and pregnancy. You may be able to report any changes online or over the phone. You can also go to your local Medicaid office and fill out a paper form describing the change. You may be asked to provide proof of the change you report. For example, if you've reported that you're pregnant, you may be asked to provide a statement from your doctor."

Make arrangements to go to the Medicaid office in person if you don't have time to wait. Make an appointment to speak with a counselor if you're not sure whether you qualify for a special enrollment period, or if you don't understand the eligibility guidelines. A special enrollment period typically only lasts 60 days from the date of the event of life change that triggered it.

They will decide whether you're eligible for a special enrollment period based on the information you provide. In some circumstances, you may receive a notice automatically that your special enrollment period has already started and you need to choose a new plan. For example, if you move to a different county in the same state and change your address with Medicaid, that might trigger a notice if your current plan isn't offered in your new county."
