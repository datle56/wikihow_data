Identify the things you are saying to yourself and about yourself, and replace those statements with positive affirmations. [10] X Research source For example, if you often find yourself thinking, “I’m stupid, there’s no way I can do this,” try reframing that thought into something like, “It’s okay that this is hard, and I can do hard things.” If you tell yourself bad things about your body or personality, try instead to focus on the things about yourself that you love or want to love. For example, instead of saying, “I’m unhappy with my appearance,” say, “My body is capable of wonderful things. I’m grateful for it.” It can take a long time to stop talking about yourself negatively, so be patient with yourself. Incremental baby steps will eventually add up to a big change in your life."
