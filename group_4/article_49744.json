      "content": "Address the scholarship donor by their title and last name. Look for the name of the scholarship donor or organization on the acceptance letter you received. Write the word “Dear” followed by the person’s appropriate title and last name. If the donor is anonymous or you’re unable to find the name, then use “donor” or “benefactor” instead of a title and name. [1] X Research source Dear Mr. Smith Dear Dr. Martin"

      "title": "Thank the donor and express your gratitude in the first paragraph.",
      "content": "Thank the donor and express your gratitude in the first paragraph. Right away in the first line, say thank you for the scholarship. Be specific about what you’re thanking them for by including the full name of the scholarship. If the scholarship doesn’t have a name, then just thank them for their support in general. Avoid including any dollar amounts or thanking them for choosing you since the donors may not have selected the scholarship recipients personally. Thank you so much for supporting my education with the Washington Memorial Scholarship and helping me continue my career path. I’m so honored to be a recipient of a scholarship from Arizona State University."

      "title": "Give a brief paragraph on your personal background.",
      "content": "Give a brief paragraph on your personal background. Take a few sentences to cover basic information, like your hometown, high school experience, family background, or any other important life events that led to the education path you’re taking. The donor reading the letter will appreciate learning more about who they’re supporting with the scholarship funds. [2] X Research source I’m from a small town in rural Wisconsin, and I had to make up my own games to entertain myself. It became clear very early on that I wanted to pursue game design, and I took programming classes throughout high school, leading to getting accepted into UW-Milwaukee’s game design program. I’m a New York City native and have been writing since I could hold a pencil. My grandfather was a published author, and I always aspired to follow my dream of writing as well. Short stories I wrote were published in the school paper and local magazines throughout my teenage years."

      "content": "Talk about activities or pursuits you’re currently involved in. If you’re currently studying at a university, inform the donor about what your major is or what you enjoy about the college experience. If you’re still in high school, explain what you’re looking forward to. List any organizations or volunteer opportunities you’re involved in as well. [3] X Research source During my first year at UCLA, I’ve begun my major in Social Work and have gotten involved in local outreach programs for unhoused neighbors. Every week, I organize and volunteer in local communities to provide basic supplies while fighting for housing reform. I’m eager to start the Journalism program at NYU, and cannot wait to learn from professionals in the field. I have been a regular contributor to the school newspaper and submitting stories to our local gazette, and cannot wait to improve my reporting skills. If you’re sending a thank you note for a renewable scholarship, give updates on what has changed in your life since you sent the last letter. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Explain how the scholarship will help you reach your goals. Let the scholarship donor know how you’re going to utilize the funds they’re providing to improve your education. Mention classes or experiences you’re looking forward to and be specific about the goals you want to achieve and interests you’re going to pursue. With this scholarship, I’m excited to continue to keep taking film classes that I normally wouldn’t be able to and continue honing my craft. I’m especially eager for the short film class to get more experience producing and directing. Coming from a lower income, I normally would not have the opportunity to take these classes, but through your generous scholarship, I’m able to continue exploring my passion for graphic design and learning from industry experts."

      "content": "Write your letter by hand if the donor accepts handwritten submissions. Some scholarship funds request that you send a handwritten letter because it shows that you’ve put more time and effort into it. If the scholarship letter says to use a handwritten note or if it gives you the choice, opt to write out your note on a nice piece of stationary. [6] X Research source If the scholarship donor only accepts digital letters, attach your thank you note to an email instead."
