But this is more common if you are already established in Hollywood. If you're unfamiliar with writing a TV script, learn how to write scripts on your own or through script-writing classes at your local community college. Hay tells TV screenwriters who want to hone their craft to \"read a lot of screenplays\" by other writers (both professional and amateur ones) and think about the concept, but also the structure and plotting of that story, and whether or not it was successful at what it set out to do.

[11] X Expert Source Lucy V. Hay Professional Writer Expert Interview. 16 July 2019. There are a lot of nuances to choosing a genre, but when in doubt, look up the genres of your favorite shows for guidance. For example, Arrested Development is a single-camera sitcom, meaning there is no studio audience like there is in classic, multi-cam sitcoms such as Cheers. This difference, though subtle, makes a huge difference when pitching your show, because some networks only want certain genres and styles of shows."

Round characters have multiple facets and aren't just \"an angry woman,\" or \"a strong hero.\" They have strengths as well as weaknesses, and therefore they can grow and adapt as the series continues. Desires and fears. A character's ability or inability to get over their fear (of being poor, of being alone, of space aliens, of spiders, etc.) drives their conflicts in each episode and helps the overarching plot of the series progress. Agency. A good character makes choices that seem natural for their personality but still push the plot forward. They make mistakes, try and fix things, embrace the consequences, etc. because it's something their character would do, not something the writer needs them to do. [13] X Research source"

The best ideas, or at least the ones that get through, share a few traits: Originality: Has this been seen before? Is it similar to anything else and, if so, is it different enough to stand on its own? Projected Cost: Few studios will risk hundreds of millions of dollars on an unproven writer or filmmaker. It's difficult to sell big concepts like The Walking Dead when you just started working in TV because of the high financial risk involved. A Screenplay/Proof of Concept: This means writing a treatment, script, and possibly even shooting some sketches. Your idea alone may get you in the door, but you need some work to prove to executives that the show is ready to greenlight. [14] X Research source"
