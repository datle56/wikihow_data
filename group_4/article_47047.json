      "content": "A glitch can be affecting your router and causing the blinking white light. Although turning it off and back on again might seem like a fix that's too simple to work, many times it does! To power cycle your router, take these steps: Unplug your router from power. Wait 60 seconds, or one minute. Plug the router back in. Wait 1-3 minutes for the router to boot. If the white light is still blinking after 3 minutes, move on to the next troubleshooting step.

Make sure that the power cable is plugged snuggly into the router and that the other side isn't too loose connecting to the wall outlet.

      "content": "Resetting will ensure any personal settings or configurations are deleted. This is a last resort, as resetting will restore the router to how you bought it. Use a small tool (like a pin or straightened-out paperclip) to push the recessed button on the back of the router. Continue holding the button for 15 seconds and your router will reset and restart. [7] X Research source This erases all of your customized settings (like any Wi-Fi passwords you created), and reverts the router username and password to defaults (which you can find on your router)."
