      "content": "Select a modest, semi-formal dress. While wearing a formal pantsuit is acceptable in some communities, it’s frowned upon in others. If you’re unsure which community your host belongs to, you can either call them to ask or check out their synagogue’s website. Otherwise, play it safe and opt to wear a conservative semi-formal dress that is knee-length or longer. What qualifies as a semi-formal dress? A semi-formal dress is classy and elegant, often made with a fancy material such as silk, lace, or satin. If you’d wear the dress to a dance club, it’s likely either too much like a cocktail dress or too casual. If it could be mistaken for a ball gown, you’ve gone too far! Aim for understated sophistication. [1] X Research source While there’s no traditional color for bar mitzvah dresses, it’s common to wear clothing with a neutral or dark color palette. In some ultra-Orthodox communities, women are discouraged from wearing bright shades. [2] X Research source You should fit in nicely if you choose a dress that’s navy blue, black, burgundy, ivory, or brown."

      "content": "Cover your shoulders. In most synagogues, showing your shoulders would be considered immodest. You’d certainly stand out in a strapless or sleeveless dress, but probably not in the way you want. If your dress doesn’t have sleeves, put on a cardigan or shawl while in the synagogue. [3] X Research source In Orthodox communities, women are expected to wear dresses with sleeves that are at least elbow length. When in doubt, wear a long-sleeved dress or bring a cardigan.

[5] X Research source The synagogue may provide lace doilies to wear, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared by bringing your own scarf or shawl. [6] X Research source There really isn’t a right or wrong way for a woman to wear a head covering, so however you choose to wear it is fine."

      "content": "Balance looking nice with feeling comfortable. A bar mitzvah ceremony is between 1-2 hours long, and there will be a meal or celebration afterward. Consider your physical comfort when selecting an outfit, because you’ll be wearing it for several hours. For ultra comfort, pair a flowing or A-line dress with a pair of satin flats."

Select the same type of clothing you would wear to an important business meeting.

Skip the flashy colors and stick with a conservative color scheme. Dark colors like black, navy, and gray are best."

It’s best to avoid loud prints and gimmicky clothing choices. [8] X Research source When it comes to accessories, pass on the cufflinks and pocket square.

A kippah is a head covering that is a non-denominational sign of respect. You don’t need to be Jewish to wear a kippah, and putting it on when offered is considered polite. [10] X Trustworthy Source Chabad.org Online resource for information related to Chabad-Lubavitch and Jewish culture Go to source To wear a kippah, place it on the crown of your head. It should only cover the back or top of your head, not your forehead.

However, bowing has more religious significance, so you can skip that part if you want. It’s okay if you don’t do everything perfectly, nobody expects a visitor to know exactly what to do. Simply trying is enough to demonstrate respect."
