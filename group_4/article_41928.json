      "content": "Spray your hair with a detangler. A detangler will help lubricate knots and tangles so you can run your fingers through your hair easily. Hold the detangling spray about 6 inches (15 centimeters) away from your hair, and spray about 4 to 6 squirts onto your hair. [1] X Research source You may consider spraying a few more squirts if your hair is long or has a lot of texture. Be sure to spray not only the top layers of your hair, but also the under layers as well."

Take the remaining two sections on the left side of your head, sections 3 and 1, and twist them so section 3 twists over section 1, and section 3 is the new leftmost section of hair. Mirror and repeat this process from the right side of your head: Take the second section of hair from the right, section 4, and cross it over the two left side sections of hair, sections 3 and 1. Keep holding section 4 all the way over to the left. Take the remaining two sections of hair that are on the right side, section 1 and section 2, and twist them so section 1 twists over section 2.

      "content": "Be careful with hair ties. Tying your hair back with hair ties can also cause damage if you're not careful. Be sure to choose the right kind of hair ties and try to keep your hair bands a little loose, especially when your hair is wet. Never use rubber bands to tie back your hair, as these can cause a lot of damage. Always use seamless ponytail holders to avoid snagging your hair. You put a lot of stress on certain sections of your hair when you tie it up in the same style frequently. Try switching up your style frequently to avoid damage. Hair ties cause even more damage to hair when it is very wet. Ideally, you should not use hair ties until your hair has dried at least somewhat. Tying up damp hair is fine. If you don't have time to dry your hair at all, you may want to consider using clips and bobby pins to hold your hair back instead of elastic ties."
