The higher the amount of contrast, the sharper the edges will look. Radius determines how many pixels around an edge in your image will be affected by the sharpening. The sharpening effect will be more obvious if you choose a higher radius number. Reduce Noise lets you minimize camera grain, which can become much more obvious when sharpening an image."

[5] X Research source If you’re trying to get rid of motion blur, you’ll need to adjust the Angle in the text field next to the Remove menu.

Otherwise, look for these controls under the main Smart Sharpen controls. [7] X Research source The Fade Amount slider specifically targets the amount of contrast in the highlights and shadows of the image. Tonal Width adjusts the range of dark or light tones that are affected by the sharpening process. If you use a smaller number, then your adjustments will be restricted to just the lightest and darkest areas of the picture.
