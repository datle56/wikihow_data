      "content": "Use an inversion table as part of a treatment program recommended by your doctor. Inversion therapy is rarely used to treat chronic pain, so it is only useful for mild relief. Anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, an exercise routine, epidural injections and even surgery may also be used to treat your condition. Inversion tables only decompress your spine while you're using the table. Once you return to a regular position, gravity pushes everything back together again and creates the same pressure on the nerve."
