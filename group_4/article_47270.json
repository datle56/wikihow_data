      "title": "Wait at least 24 hours to wash your hair after getting it colored.",
      "content": "Wait at least 24 hours to wash your hair after getting it colored. It’s important to give the hair time to absorb the dye into the cuticle. After the initial washing to remove the excess dye, you should wait 24-72 hours before cleansing your hair again. Washing it sooner could lead to a dull, faded color. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your hair every other day at most.",
      "content": "Wash your hair every other day at most. Frequent washing fades color faster than anything else. You should only wash your hair 2-3 times a week, and no more than every other day. You can still shower, just keep your hair dry using a shower cap, or give it a quick rinse to remove excess oil. [2] X Research source Try washing your hair with just conditioner once in awhile. That will help protect your color longer. [3] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 November 2020."

      "title": "Add a little dye to your conditioner.",
      "content": "Add a little dye to your conditioner. If your hair is all 1 shade, you can preserve the color by putting a small amount of dye into your conditioner. Reserve a little bit of the dye from the box, or ask your stylist to send you home with a small amount to add to your conditioner. Mix or shake the container thoroughly to evenly distribute the dye. Use it each time you shower to brighten the color while moisturizing the strands. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Condition your hair after each wash.",
      "content": "Condition your hair after each wash. Choose a moisture-rich conditioner containing oils like Obliphica, coconut, or jojoba. Thoroughly coat each strand of hair from the mid-point down to the ends with conditioner each time you wash it. Avoid rubbing conditioner into your scalp or roots, as it can make your hair look oily. [5] X Research source You can even apply conditioner on days you shower but don’t shampoo your hair to keep it strong and smooth."

      "title": "Rinse your hair using cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse your hair using cool water. Hot water opens up the cuticle and allows the color to bleed out. Cool water, on the other hand, seals the cuticle and keeps the color in. Always rinse your hair using cool water to preserve the color and vibrancy. [6] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 November 2020."

      "title": "Choose a color-protectant shampoo and conditioner.",
      "content": "Choose a color-protectant shampoo and conditioner. In this case, any old shampoo and conditioner won’t work. Look for products formulated specially for color-treated hair. These are gentler and are free of harsh chemicals that fade color. If you are overwhelmed by the options, ask your stylist for a suggestion. [7] X Research source Avoid using a clarifying shampoo, which will quickly strip the color from your hair. [8] X Research source This is particularly important when you have colored your hair in dark or bright shade, like black, purple or green ."

      "title": "Use color-safe dry shampoo in between washes.",
      "content": "Use color-safe dry shampoo in between washes. Since you won’t be washing your hair as often as you may have in the past, you can use a dry shampoo to soak up oil, add texture, and keep your hair looking and smelling fresh. Spray it about 6 inches (15 cm) from your hair, concentrating on the roots. Massage your scalp to rub it in then brush your hair to evenly distribute the product. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure your hair products are sulfate- and alcohol-free. When choosing shampoo, conditioner, heat-protectant, gel, mousse, hairspray or any other product, read the ingredient list carefully. Sulfates and alcohol strip color and dry out your hair, so steer clear of anything containing these harsh chemicals. Also, avoid anything containing salts or detergents, which can also fade your color. [10] X Research source Look for products containing natural oils, like coconut or jojoba, and gentle cleansers such as sodium myreth or trideceth. Check the ingredient list to be sure the products don’t contain sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, or ammonium laureth sulfate."

      "content": "Apply deep conditioner once a week. To keep your hair healthy and shiny, you can deep condition it on a regular basis. Choose a deep-conditioner formulated for color-treated hair, such as one containing aloe vera, argan oil, and panthenol. Apply it in the shower after washing your hair by coating your strands from just below the roots to the tips. Leave it on for 10 minutes before rinsing it out with cool water. [11] X Research source You can put a shower cap on to allow the heat from your scalp to intensify the results, if desired."

Find one formulated for your hair type or ask for a recommendation from your stylist. Be sure to apply it every time you use a heat-styling tool.

      "content": "Blot your hair dry gently with a microfiber towel or T-shirt. Avoid rubbing or scrubbing your hair with a regular towel, which can fade the color and weaken your hair. Instead, use a microfiber towel or soft T-shirt to dry your hair. Gently squeeze out the excess water; don’t wring or twist your hair. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit your use of heat-styling tools. Heat is another factor that can make your hair fade quickly. To keep your color from fading, reduce your use of blow dryers, curling irons, and flat irons. Let your hair air dry instead, and go for styles that don’t need heat, like braids and beachy waves. You can also use rollers to create curls , or straighten your hair using a mask . [14] X Research source"
