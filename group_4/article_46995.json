      "title": "Attach a telescopic pole and a vacuum hose to a pool vacuum head.",
      "content": "Attach a telescopic pole and a vacuum hose to a pool vacuum head. A telescopic pole is an extendable pole that screws onto various attachments. Screw the vacuum head onto the pole and then push 1 end of a vacuum hose onto the raised round opening for the hose. [1] X Research source Make sure the hose is long enough that you will be able to walk around the perimeter of your pool and cover all the surface area of the bottom of the pool. A pool vacuum head is a simple vacuum head that has a hole to screw a pole or other attachment into, as well as a cylindrical opening for the hose that sticks up from the head that you push the hose onto. They come in a variety of shapes, from rectangular to triangular. You can get one online or at a pool supply shop."

      "title": "Submerge the vacuum head to the bottom of the pool.",
      "content": "Submerge the vacuum head to the bottom of the pool. Hold the pole and extend it so it is long enough to reach the bottom. Push the vacuum head down slowly into the pool until it reaches the bottom. [2] X Research source Start at the edge of the pool near a return jet, which is the jet that pushes water back into your pool after it gets filtered, so you can easily reach it with the hose."

    {
      "title": "Hold the other end of the hose against a return jet to fill the hose with water.",
      "content": "Hold the other end of the hose against a return jet to fill the hose with water. Place the open end of the hose against the return jet so it covers the jet stream. Watch the bubbles coming up from the vacuum head at the bottom of the pool and remove the hose from the jet when bubbles stop rising from the vacuum head. [3] X Research source Don’t lift the open end of the hose out of the water yet or you might end up spilling out the water you just filled it with."

      "title": "Take the basket out of the pool skimmer.",
      "content": "Take the basket out of the pool skimmer. The pool skimmer is what sucks loose debris off the surface of the water and filters it out before it has a chance to sink to the bottom. Locate the intake for the skimmer at the edge of the pool near the top of the deck, remove the plastic cover from the pool’s deck near the intake, and lift out the basket. [4] X Research source This will expose the skimmer’s suction hole that you need to use to vacuum your pool."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the open end of the hose into the open suction hole in the skimmer.",
      "content": "Place the open end of the hose into the open suction hole in the skimmer. Hold your hand over the open end of the hose and aim it upwards to keep all the water in it as you lift it out of the pool. Lower it into the water where the skimmer basket was, keeping your hand against the opening until it is under the water, and place the opening of the hose in the suction hole. [5] X Research source This will supply suction to the vacuum hose that will allow you to vacuum the bottom of your pool with the vacuum head."

    {
      "title": "Start vacuuming at the shallow end and work towards the deep end.",
      "content": "Start vacuuming at the shallow end and work towards the deep end. Stand at the edge of the shallow end and slowly work your way along the pool, ending at the deep end. This will allow you to extend the telescopic pole more as you move deeper into the pool and you won’t have to constantly change the length of the pole. [7] X Research source Make sure to keep an eye on the pool filter’s pressure gauge while you vacuum. If you see the pressure start to rise above the normal operating level, then backwash the filter to remove debris that is clogging it."

    {
      "title": "Vacuum with long, slow, sweeping strokes.",
      "content": "Vacuum with long, slow, sweeping strokes. Go slow and steady so you don’t stir up debris into the water where you won’t be able to actually vacuum it up. Overlap your strokes so you don’t miss any sections. [8] X Research source If you start disturbing debris that clouds up the water, then stop and wait for 1-2 hours to let the debris settle down before continuing to vacuum."

      "title": "Disconnect and rinse everything when you have vacuumed the whole pool.",
      "content": "Disconnect and rinse everything when you have vacuumed the whole pool. Unscrew the telescopic pole from the pool vacuum head and pull the hose off. Hold the hose up vertically to drain any remaining pool water out. Rinse everything with fresh water from a garden hose and let it air dry before storing it. [9] X Research source Remember to vacuum your pool whenever you start to notice debris such as dirt and leaves accumulating at the bottom of the pool. It’s also a good idea to vacuum your pool every time you backwash the filter. You should vacuum the pool once a week to keep it in good shape. [10] X Research source Vacuuming helps to maintain the color of the pool water. Otherwise, it may become Tahoe blue or gray. It is an affordable method because most vacuums cost less than $200.

      "title": "Turn the filter’s on/off switch to the off position.",
      "content": "Turn the filter’s on/off switch to the off position. Locate the on/off switch on your pool’s filter, usually near the pressure gauge, and switch it off. Always do this to turn off the filter before you move the multiport valve to backwash the filter or you could break the diverter gasket inside the valve. [12] X Research source When the pressure gauge on your sand filter reads 10 psi above its regular level, or the level it operates at when you first set up the filter, then you need to backwash the filter. If you aren’t sure what the normal operating level is, then consult the owner’s manual."

      "title": "Connect the backwash hose to the backwash nozzle with a hose clamp.",
      "content": "Connect the backwash hose to the backwash nozzle with a hose clamp. Slide the hose clamp over the end of the backwash hose and put the end of the hose over the backwash nozzle of the filter system. Turn the screw on the hose clamp clockwise with a screwdriver until it is tightened all the way to make a secure connection. [13] X Research source There will be a lot of water pressure when you backwash the filter system, so it’s important to make sure the hose is very tightly attached to the backwash nozzle so it doesn’t pop off during the procedure and spill pool water everywhere."

      "title": "Turn the multiport valve from the filter position to the backwash position.",
      "content": "Turn the multiport valve from the filter position to the backwash position. Locate the multiport valve on the filter system, in other words the valve labeled with different functions, and turn the handle to the position labeled “backwash.” This will change the function of the filter to allow you to drain water through the backwash nozzle. [14] X Research source Double-check the filter’s on/off valve to make sure it is off before you move the multiport valve to avoid damaging the filter system."

You are done backwashing when the water in the sight glass looks clear. [15] X Research source This usually takes about 1 minute, but the time can vary depending on how dirty the filter is."

Let it run for around 30 seconds to flush out the last of the dirt and debris through the backwash hose. [17] X Research source The water will look clear at this point, so just count to 30 and then you are done rinsing."
