      "content": "Add full-body volume to flat hair with a volumizing texture spray. Separate your hair into 1-inch sections. Spray texturizing spray onto your hands and work it into one section of hair with your fingers, beginning at the middle of the length of your hair and working to the ends. Repeat this process for each section. Once you’re finished, flip your head upside down, shake out your hair with your fingers, then do a hair flip to create volume at your roots. [1] X Research source For a full-bodied blowout look, choose a texturizing spray formulated for straight hair. To achieve a smooth, straight look, it’s easiest to use naturally straight hair since texturizing spray can exaggerate the natural pattern of your hair. If your hair isn’t naturally straight, you can straighten your hair with a flat iron before following the rest of the steps."

      "content": "Create salty beach waves by messing up curls with texture spray. Begin by curling your hair in 1-inch sections, being careful to leave the ends of each section uncurled. Once you’ve curled all of your hair, allow the curls to cool before flipping your head over and shaking out the curls with your fingers. Spritz texture spray onto your palms and work the product through your hair with your fingers to give the waves some separation and lift, just like natural beach waves. For some extra volume, work the remaining product into your roots. [2] X Research source If you want looser waves, use a brush to separate your curls instead of your fingers. For added texture that looks like you just came from the beach, use a sea salt texturizing spray."

      "content": "Scrunch your hair to enhance its natural shape and texture. Spritz texture spray onto a section of hair, then scrunch, twist, or shape it with your fingers. The texture spray will enhance your hair’s natural texture and hold the shape you give it. Use smaller sections of hair to create more definition and volume. [3] X Research source Since the goal of this style is to look a bit messy, don’t worry about sectioning your hair evenly. Feel free to play around with the size and shape of hair sections to achieve your desired look!"

      "content": "Wake up to beach waves by braiding your damp hair before bed. Using damp hair, flip your head over and gather your hair into a ponytail at the crown of your head. Braid your ponytail using the simple three-strand method, then sleep on it. When you wake up in the morning, gently unravel your braid and shake out the waves with your fingers. Use a texture spray to separate the waves and give them some body and volume. [4] X Research source If you are starting this process with wet hair, gently towel dry it until it is damp. If your hair is dry, use a spray bottle to wet it until it is dampened. For added waves that look like you just came from the beach, use a texturizing spray that includes sea salt in the formula."

      "content": "Use texture spray before braiding to create waves on the go. This method is ideal if you don’t have time to wait for your hair to dry before styling it. After washing or wetting your hair, towel dry until damp. Spitz texture spray throughout your hair then put your hair into a braid using the same method outlined above. Secure the braid with an elastic, or let it hang a bit loose for a more subtle wave pattern. Once your hair has air-dried completely, flip your head upside down and gently shake your hair out of the braid with your fingers. [5] X Research source For more volume and defined waves, braid your hair into several tiny braids instead of one larger one."

      "title": "Texture spray is a volumizing spray that exaggerates the shape of your natural hair.",
      "content": "Texture spray is a volumizing spray that exaggerates the shape of your natural hair. It maximizes volume by allowing air to get to each strand of hair, which creates a separated, lifted look. Unlike other aerosol hair products that can also create volume, texture spray is specially formulated to be used generously throughout all parts of your hair. [7] X Research source Texture spray isn’t dry shampoo. Although many aerosol shampoos and texturizing sprays are both marketed as “dry” or “volumizing,” dry shampoo is created specifically to clean up oil on your roots. [8] X Research source Dry shampoo has a matte formula, so using it on your ends can create a dull finish, which is why texture spray is the better product for creating volume in the shafts and ends of your hair. Texture spray isn’t hairspray, either. If you’re looking for a powerful finishing hold, hairspray is still your go-to product. Texturizing spray doesn’t have the same lasting hold as hairspray, but it does create a bit of grip so that styles like waves and curls can hold their shape. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "For oily scalps, look for a dual-action texture spray that doubles as a dry shampoo. Oil weighs down your hair, which makes it almost impossible to add any lift to limp locks. Dual-action texture sprays will give you lightweight volume while also soaking up any extra oil that could weigh down your style. [11] X Research source"

If you plan to use texture spray multiple times a week — or multiple times a day for any touch-ups — use a lightweight spray that can be layered without any of the residue build-up that can hold your locks down. Bonus points if it comes in a travel-size bottle so you can refresh your look on the go! [12] X Research source"
