      "title": "Challenge negative thoughts.",
      "content": "Challenge negative thoughts. Self-consciousness often stems from our worry that others will confirm our negative self-talk or fixate on those things about which we feel insecure. If your negative thoughts tell you you're overweight, and you believe them, then you're going to feel deeply hurt and self-conscious if someone says you should drop a couple pounds. This is because your negative thoughts have convinced you that you are overweight and that being overweight is bad . When those negative thoughts come, don't fight them, but don't accept them, either. Instead, act as thought the thought has proposed something utterly ridiculous, such as \"You are a flying unicorn,\" something you don't believe to be true, nor do you believe to be a bad thing. Do a \"mental shrug,\" saying, \"Yeah, whatever, brain.\" Remember that your inner critic, the part of you voicing these negative thoughts, is neither a reliable nor reasonable voice. It is not the voice of reality, as many self-conscious people believe. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Realize that people aren't paying as much attention to you as you think. People are usually too busy thinking about themselves to start honing in on your little quirks and differences. If you are self-conscious about the size of your nose, you can convince yourself that everyone you meet is staring at it. While you may believe everyone is focused on this one feature, it's extremely unlikely they noticed or are thinking about it at all."

      "content": "Examine criticism from others. Whenever you think that someone is \"better than you,” pull that self-criticism up and examine it. It is highly likely that you're overrating an aspect of that person and downgrading something not-so-perfect about her or him."

If you wouldn't think or say such things about a best friend, why do you think or say them about yourself? Try to be a good friend to yourself, too. Some ways to be your own best friend include the following: Even if you don't feel it at first, at least act like there's no need to worry. In time, it'll also feel that way too. Your greatest strength lies in between stimuli and your response to it, so try to take control. Always picture yourself like you know you look and feel good in front of others, but don't think about it too much because it will already be embedded. Catch yourself putting yourself down or comparing yourself to others. [8] X Research source Don't scold yourself; simply notice it and tell yourself it's time to stop and find more constructive ways of thinking about yourself instead. Reader Poll: We asked 392 wikiHow readers to tell us how they stop negative thinking and build their self-esteem, and 72% of them said that it’s most helpful to avoid comparing themselves to other people.

When you feel that doing something will make you feel confident and excited, but can't do it because of anxiety or self-consciousness, then at the same time, challenge yourself. For example, say to yourself \"I dare you to put yourself in an awkward situation.\" Another example would be, \"Go to that girl/guy and talk to him/her, even if it doesn't make any sense.\" Remember, don't curse or beat yourself even if you fail the challenge, in fact give yourself a reward for even trying."

After you drop a jar of peanut butter in front of someone you fancy and watch in horror as it shatters into pieces and splatters peanut butter chunks on the floor, burst out laughing at your inherent clumsiness, cracking a joke that you should be required to wear double-sided tape on your hands––and then apologize and help clean it up."

Note the feelings as if you're observing them rather than experiencing them and let them wash over and through you without staying. Be like the famous people, leaders or friends you admire; those people who make a mistake but get up again and keep on going without carrying the burden of others' expectations or criticisms with them. A word about criticism: Learn to discern between the useful, constructive things that caring people say and the hateful, destructive things that uncaring, jealous or simply spiteful people say. Learn from the former and let the latter simply drop; you don't need haters in your life, so don't take their meanness on board. Practice comebacks against criticism. For mean-spirited criticism, keep some stock-standard responses in your head for maneuvering out of the situation without letting yourself down or causing the other person pain. That way, you won't be put on the spot or left gasping for a witticism that won't come during your shock at their audacity. Think as kindly as you can and say something simple like: \"I am surprised you feel the need to say that. It's not okay with me to be spoken to that way.\" \"I need you to know that's not okay with me to be criticized so harshly. I did my best and I do not accept your interpretation."

This helps to give you the motivation to keep going and it lets the people you care about continue supporting your efforts. Be circumspect––don't share things with people who can detract from your progress––it someone is not supportive, then don't put yourself in their way. Bear witness to your achievements. Celebrate when good things happen; go out to dinner, call a friend, go for a hike or buy yourself an online album. Recognize the good things with greater regularity than mulling over the misses."

It is your birthright. Understand that no one is better or more important than you. That said, you do owe it to yourself and others to be your best self.

If you try to remember your childhood, and try to think about your \"I\", the \"I\" was always the same irrespective of age or situations. The \"I\" does not depend on anything. It doesn't grow big or small, only apparently you feel that it changes or that it depends on anything. So understand deeply that your existence does not depend on anything or anybody. Such thinking itself is a big boost to self-confidence. As Judy Garland once said: \"Always be the first rate version of yourself, instead of a second rate version of someone else\". Try your best to live up to that."

Don't allow the mind to harp on these thoughts. The same thoughts repeated create a channel, and then you are forced to go through that channel when the opportunity arises. Read some self-help books; ask your favorite teacher about this subject, do a Google search, go to your local library and eventually to a bookshop if you're that earnest."

[10] X Research source What color is it? How many legs? Anything that turns the attention away from yourself will do the trick; distraction will bring you back to the present and your surroundings. If you become self-conscious while speaking to people, then change your focus to listening to what the other person is saying. Focus on the words, not on how you look or what you will say next, and that will do the trick."

Don't let other people tell you who you are. This is your life, not theirs. And while it is hard to stand up for what you believe in and to be your whole self, doing so is part of what defines your very best self. Surround yourself with people that make you happy. Being around negative people only drags you down. This may sound like a cliché, but think about how you feel when you're around positive people and how you feel when around negative people. It's two opposite extremes and you know how you'd rather be feeling."
