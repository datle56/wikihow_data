      "content": "A texting relationship might not be healthy if you’re looking for a more serious connection. Texting-only relationships don't give you a chance to see if you and the other person have in-person chemistry. You also miss out on things like tone of voice, facial expressions, and the chance to read a person's body language. If you find yourself falling for someone you've been texting a lot, ask if they want to meet. That way you can determine if you're a good match in person. [2] X Research source If the person doesn't want to meet up or keeps canceling on you, that's a sign that they don't want to move the relationship past texting."

      "content": "A texting relationship can become something more if you make plans in person. Ask the person you've been texting if they would like to go out for drinks, coffee, or a walk in the park. If they say yes and you have a good time, make plans to hang out again in the future. It's great to use texting to catch up with them, but prioritize your in-person communication. [3] X Research source If this person doesn't want to meet in person, the two of you are likely looking for different things. This can be hard to accept, but try your best not to take it personally. Sometimes people just aren't in the place to be in a relationship, and it likely has nothing to do with you."

      "content": "If you only text, you might fall in love with just the idea of the person. Maybe you talk to this person frequently about personal subjects, like your childhood or struggles you've gone through in the past. Though you may learn a lot about each other, neither of you will be as vulnerable as you would have been sharing these things in person. If you're really falling for someone over text, arrange to meet in person to see if you have a connection when you're face-to-face. [4] X Research source One study published by infographic designers Venngage found that sharing intimate details over text is easier than sharing them in person. Though it may be easier, the study also found that these texting interactions didn't foster as deep a connection as in-person conversations."

      "content": "The frequency that a couple texts depends on each of your texting styles. Some couples enjoy texting back and forth throughout the day. Others, though, might prefer catching up after work or on the weekends. Talk to your partner about how often you both like to text to figure out what works for you. If you're in a texting relationship and feel like you're texting too much, talk to the other person about it and see if you can start talking on the phone or through video calls. [5] X Research source Talking about your texting styles helps you avoid misunderstandings. You may think someone's long response time means they're uninterested, but it could just mean that they're swamped at work. It's a red flag if someone is constantly texting you to keep tabs on your whereabouts. This is a sign of controlling behavior."

A study conducted by the University of Alberta found that those who frequently sext in a relationship may be less committed to the relationship.
