      "content": "Grab both ends of the rope with your non-dominant hand. If the ends of your rope aren't knotted, knot each end individually to keep the ends of the rope from fraying. Then, hold the knots at the same height so that the rest of the rope hangs down to the ground. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the knots between your thumb and index finger on your non-dominant hand. Put both of the knots side by side and push them between your thumb and index finger, letting them rest under your palm. Keep your hand flat rather than curled in a fist. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Grab the hanging rope between your thumb and index finger of your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Grab the hanging rope between your thumb and index finger of your dominant hand. Hold your hands around 0.3 m (0.98 ft) apart so you have the knots in one hand and the 2 lines of rope in your other hand. Avoid curling your hands into fists; they should be flat with the rope pinched between your thumb and index finger. [3] X Research source The rest of the rope will hang free on the opposite side of your dominant hand."

      "content": "Lift your dominant hand above your non-dominant hand and catch the dangling rope in your non-dominant hand. Slowly bring your dominant hand up so you don't lose control of the rope or let it get too loose. When your dominant hand is directly above your non-dominant hand, grab the excess rope between your thumb and index finger on your non-dominant hand so they’re next to the knots.

Be careful and slow as you move your non-dominant hand so you keep maximum control of the rope. [5] X Research source When your non-dominant hand is above your dominant hand, grab the excess rope with your dominant hand between your thumb and index finger so it’s next to the rope already in your hand."

      "content": "Grab the center of the tied rope and wrap the excess around it. Tightly wrap the remaining rope around the center of the figure 8. When you’ve got about 30 cm (12 in) left, wrap the rope over your thumb so it’s in the middle of the bundle. Fold the tail end of the rope into a loop and tuck it under the wrapped rope where your thumb is. Pull the loop to tighten the binding knot. [7] X Research source When you're ready to use the rope, simply tug on the loop that you tucked under the wrapped rope. The entire hank will easily uncoil without tangling so you can access the rope quickly. [8] X Research source"

Grab one end of the rope between your thumb and your palm and use your other hand to wrap the free end of the rope around your palm repeatedly. [9] X Research source Try to wrap the rope tightly but not so tight that it cuts off the blood flow to your hand. For very thick ropes or ropes longer than 3 metres (9.8 ft), hold your arm so your bicep is parallel to the ground and your forearm is perpendicular to the ground. Wrap the rope over your hand and around your bicep/elbow to make a larger loop."

This excess rope is important in tying the rope together for storage. [10] X Research source Place the free end of the rope over the top of your palm to prepare for tying it. If the rope is particularly thick or long, you may need more than 30 cm (12 in) of excess in order to wrap the rope around the coils."

Depending on how and where you use the rope, materials like dirt and salt can work their way into the fibers and damage the material of the rope over time. Use freshwater to rinse the rope, and avoid using harsh cleaners, which could damage the fibers. Be sure to let it dry completely before coiling it up! Air-dry the rope in a spot out of direct sunlight, as heat and light can weaken the rope."

[16] X Research source Put your rope in a dark area where sunlight won't break it down over time, such as in a closet, garage, or shed. If the place where you store your rope is damp, the fibers will shrink and the rope will stretch more than it should, which could snap it."

Or, lay the rope on a shelf or table, if that works better for you. Before using the rope again, visually inspect it for fraying. You can also tug on the rope to determine if it has any weak points. If you find any issues, purchase a new rope to prevent injuries should the damaged rope snap."
