      "content": "Make sure your suit is tailored properly for your body size and proportions. Classic double-breasted suits have wide shoulders and snug hips. They also have peaked lapels and may be slightly shorter in length than a modern suit.

      "content": "Button only the middle 2 buttons when standing up. Double-breasted suits usually have a row of 3 buttons on either side of the jacket. When you put on your suit jacket, button the middle button and leave the top and bottom buttons open. If you sit down while wearing your suit, unbutton all of the buttons to give yourself room to move. [3] X Research source The middle button acts as a “corset,” so it can help to tighten up any loose areas in your stomach."

      "content": "Save your double-breasted suit for special occasions. You can wear a double-breasted suit anytime that a single-breasted suit would be appropriate, but it shouldn’t be your everyday suit. Double-breasted suits are slightly more formal than single-breasted ones and they call more attention to you than a single-breasted suit would. [4] X Research source Formal events, weddings, and work parties are all great times to wear a double-breasted suit. You can make your double-breasted suit less formal by foregoing the tie. That way you can wear it to slightly more informal events."

      "title": "Opt for a modern style double-breasted suit.",
      "content": "Opt for a modern style double-breasted suit. Older double-breasted suits have a slightly more boxy fit that might require extra tailoring. Modern double-breasted suits have wide shoulders but are not quite as boxy looking. [5] X Research source If you do buy an older double-breasted suit, set aside some money to get it tailored to a more modern fit."

      "content": "Add a conservative pattern to either your shirt or tie to make a statement. Double-breasted suits have so much style on their own that they don’t need much help from your underclothes. If you want to add a pattern to your look, choose one that isn’t outlandish or very large.

      "content": "Include a pocket square for a little extra flair. If you want to add some spice to your suit but you don’t want to overwhelm it, put a pocket square in your front pocket. Your pocket square can either match the color of your shirt exactly or add a pop of color and pattern on its own. [10] X Research source If your suit is patterned, stick with a solid-colored pocket square."

      "content": "Wear cufflinks to elevate your look. Double-breasted suits are classy, and you can play that up by adding cufflinks to your shirt. Use gold ones to make a statement or silver ones to downplay them a little more. [11] X Research source Cufflinks are pretty formal, so you should only wear them to formal events."

      "content": "Pair the jacket with khakis for a business casual look. If your office isn’t quite the full suit type but you’d still like to show off your double-breasted suit, wear the jacket with some trousers or khaki pants. This look works great if you have a bright-colored suit jacket, like cranberry or maroon. [13] X Research source Pair navy or black trousers with a gray or tan double-breasted suit jacket."

      "title": "Stick to darker, neutral colors.",
      "content": "Stick to darker, neutral colors. Offices are typically a little more formal than casual, so you'll want to wear colors that match this type of setting.

      "content": "Pair your suit with a turtleneck for a fashion-forward look. Turtlenecks are not classically paired with double-breasted suits, so this outfit is a modern take on an old-fashioned look.

      "content": "Add some patterned pants to stand out. Just like dark wash jeans can make a double-breasted suit casual, some checkered pants can make a suit jacket feel easygoing. Pair a navy suit jacket with some gray patterned pants or a lighter suit jacket with some black checkered pants. Try not to pair patterned pants with a patterned suit jacket. This can make your outfit look too busy."
