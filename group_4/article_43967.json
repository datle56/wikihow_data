      "content": "Place the middle of the belt on your belly button. You can find the middle of the belt by letting the 2 ends of the belt dangle to the floor. The 2 sides of the belt should be equal in length when you hold it up to your belly button. It's very important to have both sides of the belt be equally long in order to tie your knot properly."

Then, pull your hands forward to bring the ends of the belt back to the front of your body. The point where the 2 strands cross over each other should be located just above the small of your back."

      "content": "Cross the left end of the belt over the right end. Lay the right end of the belt over your belly button first, then lay the left end over top of it. The belt should resemble an “X” after you do this. [1] X Research source Make sure the 2 strands of the belt are still even in length before crossing them over each other here."

The end of the belt should end up above your belly button but still on your right side.

Having one end shorter than the other will give you enough extra length to wrap the belt around you twice. You don't want to leave the left end too long, since this will make your knot lopsided when you go to tie it later."

If they aren’t, you’ll need to start over from the beginning and adjust your starting lengths. The belt should be wrapped on top of itself in the back, with the left end of the belt crossing over the right end on the right side of the front of your body."
