Tip : Before applying the rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer all over your bag, test it on a hidden part to ensure it doesn’t stain or discolor the fabric. Warning: The only recommended cleaning methods are Longchamp’s official methods. The alternate stain removal options here are usually safe, but they are more likely to cause damage. So, use them at your own risk and proceed with caution."
