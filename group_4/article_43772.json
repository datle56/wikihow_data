      "content": "Use your intuition . Not all decisions are rational or carefully analyzed, and intuitive guesses can often be quite powerful. What feels right? What do you think will happen? When you use your intuition, you draw upon your experience and knowledge in a different way than when you make a rational analysis. [1] X Research source Listen to your first instinct. Intuition often works best before you've had time to study any details, so pay attention to it, even if you do not act immediately on it. Intuition may clue you into emotional factors and subtle cues that you might otherwise miss. If something feels wrong about a situation or you just don't like somebody, don't ignore it, even if you can't put your finger on the problem. Use intuition as a \"lead\" rather than as a solution. Investigate what might be causing your hunch or gut feeling and dig deeper until you find it."

      "content": "Consider what you already know. Prior knowledge comes from many places. Have you tried something similar before? Do you know how somebody is likely to react? Have you seen something done or could you read about others' experiences with a situation? Could you ask others? Can you try something out or gather data that might suggest what could happen?"

      "title": "Detect your own bias.",
      "content": "Detect your own bias. People tend to bias their guesses and actions in certain predictable ways. For example, recent events may play a larger role in influencing decisions than they warrant; or, you may be more likely to believe something just because everyone around you believes it. If you think this sort of thing is happening, start looking closely at hard evidence (like facts and numbers) and question your assumptions.

Could you clean up a mess, try again later, apologize , lose a bit of money, or cope with criticism or rejection ? Is the worst case something you could plan for, avoid, or mitigate?
