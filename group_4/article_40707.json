Then, consider how much time you have available in your day to dedicate to the business. Additionally, consider how much time the products or services you plan to offer will take to do well. Since it will likely take time for your business to become successful, it may be best to start out part-time. Some businesses may be more flexible than others.

Additionally, it’s helpful to survey your potential customers, either by phone or in person, to find out if they’d be interested in what you have to offer. This will help you determine if your business can fill a need that’s not currently being met. For instance, you might call local businesses to ask if they’d be interested in hiring a freelance marketing consultant to run their social media accounts. If you’re selling a product, you could show it off at a local market or to friends you think would be interested in it to see what type of response it receives.

Estimate how much money you’ll need to get the basic materials for your business. Additionally, there are a few general costs that are central to most online businesses, which you need to add to your budget: Website hosting – Chances are good your business will require a website. Web hosts are the services that keep your website up and running. They usually cost $7-$19 per month, depending on how much technical support they offer and the size of your site. Website design – This cost can vary because you can use an inexpensive template, build the site yourself, or hire a designer. You can create a basic site yourself or using a template for less than $100, but a designer may charge $1000-$5000. Shopping cart – If you are selling products and services that can be bought online, you will want an online shopping cart for your customers to put them in. You may be able to get a service that only charges you when you complete a transaction, but many services charge $5 per month. Email Marketing Service – Building an email mailing list is key to advertising your product and making money. The typical service costs about $20 per month.
