      "title": "Put 1-3 drops of argan oil onto your hands.",
      "content": "Put 1-3 drops of argan oil onto your hands. Squeeze a small amount of oil onto your hands and lather it into your palms. Rub your hands together for a few seconds, or until the oil feels sufficiently warm on your skin. Don’t worry if you used too much product by accident—you can always rub the extra into your scalp later. [2] X Research source Although argan oil is great for your hair and scalp, don’t use it more than 2 times a week. When used excessively, it can make your hair look extra oily. [3] X Research source That said, you can use a small amount of argan oil daily as a hair styling oil."

      "title": "Knead the oil into your roots and work your way down.",
      "content": "Knead the oil into your roots and work your way down. Work on small, 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) sections of hair at a time, using your fingers to massage the oil into your roots. Continue working your way down each section of hair, using the tips of your fingers to spread the oil to the ends. [4] X Research source If you have shorter and thinner hair, start with 1-2 drops of oil. [5] X Research source For individuals with thicker and longer hair, try using at least 3-4 drops of oil. If your hair is short but thick, try to use somewhere between 2-3 drops. [6] X Research source Feel free to rub the oil in larger or smaller sections of your hair at a time. Depending on your hair’s length and density, it might be easier to apply the argan oil in larger or smaller amounts."

      "content": "Rub any extra oil in and around your scalp. If your fingers and palms still feel oily after applying the product into your hair, use the tips of your fingers to knead any extra oil in and around your hair. Continue doing this until you’ve massaged all of your scalp. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Search for shampoos and conditioners that are made with argan oil.",
      "content": "Search for shampoos and conditioners that are made with argan oil. Look online or in stores to find products that include argan oil as an ingredient. Try to find a shampoo and conditioner that boasts argan oil as one of the primary ingredients. Keep in mind that these products might be a little more expensive than traditional shampoos and conditioners. [8] X Research source This is a good option for people with thinner, less coarse hair."

      "title": "Lather a coin-sized amount of shampoo into your hair before rinsing it out.",
      "content": "Lather a coin-sized amount of shampoo into your hair before rinsing it out. Squeeze a little shampoo onto the palm of your hand and rub both of your hands together. After you’ve worked the shampoo into a foam, use your fingertips to knead the product into your scalp and roots. Try to avoid scratching your scalp or pushing with your fingers too much—in the case of shampoo, a little goes a long way. [9] X Research source Spend at least 1 minute rubbing the shampoo into your hair. By massaging your head, you’re actually encouraging more blood flow to your scalp, which can subsequently encourage more hair growth."

      "title": "Massage some conditioner toward the ends of your hair.",
      "content": "Massage some conditioner toward the ends of your hair. Nourish your hair by rubbing in an argan oil-enriched conditioning product. Once you’ve lathered in the conditioner, let the product sit in your hair for at least 5 minutes. If your hair feels especially knotted or tangled, take a moment to comb through it with a wide-toothed comb. [11] X Research source At this point, you can wrap your conditioned hair in a towel and step out of the shower while you let the product soak in."

      "content": "Rinse out your hair and towel dry it. Make sure that all of the product is rinsed out before you towel off your hair. Rinse out the product with warm water, and check throughout your hair to ensure that you’ve washed out all of the product. [12] X Research source If you plan on straightening, curling, or blow drying your hair afterwards, consider applying a heat protecting product first."
