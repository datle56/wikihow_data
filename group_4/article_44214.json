      "content": "Get the right collar and leash. The collar and leash you choose for your dog is often a matter of aesthetics, but with bully breeds you'll need to keep practical considerations in mind. Remember that because bully breed dogs tend to be stout and muscular, collars and leashes made of strong, unbreakable materials are the best way to control your pet. Try a head collar like those made by Gentle Leader. These redistribute pressure so that your dog is not injured by pulling on the leash. Many dog training experts advise against the use of choke, prong, or shock collars, as these may seriously injure your pet."

Go to source It teaches dogs to expect a reward for good behavior until the dog eventually behaves on command without needing the reward. You can purchase a training clicker at many pet stores or through an online retailer. Use the clicker immediately after your dog displays good behavior and follows your command. The goal is to make your timing precise so the dog knows what's being rewarded. When you activate the clicker, you'll want to reward your dog almost simultaneously with a treat and verbal praise. The reward should come within three seconds of the position your dog holds on command. Start out with simple commands, like \"watch me\" or \"sit,\" then progress to more advanced commands like \"leave it.\" Eventually your dog will come to understand it's being rewarded for acting on your command and it will begin to follow your commands whether you have a treat in your hand or not."

You can teach this and other verbal commands at home, or have your dog learn commands from a trainer in an obedience class. Hold a treat in front of and slightly above your dog's head. Say your dog's name and the command \"sit\" while holding the treat above. When your dog sits, give it a reward and offer verbal praise."

Teaching the \"stay\" command is valuable for preventing undesirable behavior (say, to keep your dog from lunging at food that's fallen) as well as for protecting your dog (keeping it from running in the street or approaching an unfriendly dog, for example). Before your dog can learn to stay, it should already know and follow the \"sit\" command.

Hold up your hand with your palm open and say \"stay\" or \"wait.\" Wait a few seconds, but don't expect your dog to hold its excitement for too long. Use a word or phrase that indicates your dog is released, such as \"okay\" or \"good stay,\" then give your dog the treat. If your dog gets up before you've given the release, calmly return to where you were standing and go through the process with your dog again.

If your dog begins to approach you, give verbal praise and encourage your dog to keep coming to you. Use a happy and encouraging tone of voice as you call your dog. This will help reinforce that your dog is doing what you want by coming on command. If your dog doesn't come to you, attach its leash to its collar and lead your dog to the spot where you were calling from. Be sure to praise your dog while you guide your dog to that spot to reinforce that this was what you wanted. Once your dog gets good at coming on command you can add additional commands, like starting from a \"sit\" position."

You don't necessarily need to use the word \"heel\"; you can also say \"let's go,\" \"forward,\" or whatever command you prefer.

Extend the squeaky toy across the front of your body so that it's hovering above and slightly in front of your dog's face. Try to get your dog's attention with the toy, then give your verbal command and step forward confidently. Try to hold your dog's attention with the toy. Any time your dog gets distracted, you'll squeeze the toy to regain your dog's attention and give it verbal praise when it re-focuses or looks up at you. After about 20 to 30 seconds of focus and well-behaved walking, praise your dog and give it the toy to play with. You can gradually increase the walk time as your dog progresses in its training.

      "content": "Train your dog the right way. Training and verbal commands are highly effective at breaking bad behavior, but like teaching anything else they require consistency and patience. Make sure you train your dog the right way from the start so that your pet understands what's expected and learns to follow your command no matter what else is happening in your environment. Don't just give commands while sitting or squatting. Try standing or getting into other positions so your dog learns to respond to all types of body language and posture. Make sure your hands are visible. If you put your hands in your pockets, your dog will anticipate a treat and will respond to the reward instead of the verbal cue. Relying too heavily on treats in general will affect your dog's training. If you constantly have a whole bag of treats in your hand, your dog will learn that you only need to be obeyed when the treats are out."

Socialization can help your dog learn to play with other dogs without getting aggressive and get used to being around other people. Dogs should have some socialization with other dogs and people well before reaching 16 weeks of age. This can help acclimate your dog to being around other animals. Be sure to socialize your dog with a variety of other people so that it becomes used to different faces and body types. This includes men and women of varying ages and races, men with facial hair, and people wearing coats and scarves (if you live in a cold climate)."

You can also use playtime as an opportunity to teach or reinforce training commands. Start out having your dog play with a mellow, well-behaved dog to make the socialization playtime go more smoothly. Choose a dog that is roughly equal in size and energy level. Break up play time with commands every few minutes. These command intermissions should last roughly 30 to 60 seconds before playtime resumes. Have four or five command intermissions four or five times during each playtime session, then separate the dogs at the end and reward them with treats. If possible, schedule play sessions every day (but not more than once each day) with the same dog. Do this for a few consecutive weeks, gradually increasing the command intermissions each time until you reach about 90 seconds of intermission time."
