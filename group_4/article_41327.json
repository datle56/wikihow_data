Serotonin is a naturally occurring chemical “messenger” (neurotransmitter) that helps maintain mood balance. Research suggests that a deficit of serotonin is a contributing factor in clinical depression. [3] X Research source Prozac helps keep your receptors from reabsorbing too much serotonin, thereby increasing the amount available to your body. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Prozac is an SSRI because it’s “selective.” It seems to primarily operate on serotonin and not any of the other neurotransmitters that are also partially responsible for mood.

Because antidepressants alter your brain chemistry, discontinuing them without medical supervision can cause serious symptoms. [9] X Expert Source Padam Bhatia, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Longer-acting medications, such as Prozac, usually have fewer discontinuation symptoms. However, you may still experience side effects such as: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping Sleep issues, such as insomnia or nightmares Balance issues, such as dizziness or lightheadedness Sensory or movement issues, such as numbness, tingling, tremors, and lack of physical coordination Feelings of irritability, agitation, or anxiety Antidepressants need to be discontinued slowly over a period of time by gradually reducing the dose. This is known as “tapering.” Tapering can take weeks or months, depending on the antidepressant, how long you have taken it, your dosage, and your symptoms. Your doctor will determine the best way for you to taper Prozac. You may experience a relapse of depressive symptoms once you have stopped taking Prozac. To distinguish between discontinuation symptoms and a relapse, think about when the symptoms start, how long they last, and what type they are. Discontinuation symptoms usually develop quickly. They will usually improve over one to two weeks. They will often include more physical complaints, such as nausea or aches and pains. Relapse symptoms gradually develop after two to three weeks. They generally worsen over two to four weeks. If any symptom continues to last more than a month, consult your doctor."

Follow your doctor’s instructions to the letter to avoid serious side effects. [13] X Expert Source Padam Bhatia, MD Board Certified Psychiatrist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Prozac usually has fewer issues with discontinuation symptoms because it has a long “half-life.” Half-life refers to the time it takes your body to reduce the concentration of the drug by one half. [14] X Research source A longer half-life such as Prozac’s means that the drug stays in your body longer. This means that the drug concentration in your body will not suddenly decrease, and this leads to fewer discontinuation symptoms. If you have been on Prozac for a short period of time, such as six to 12 weeks, or are on a small maintenance dose (e.g., 20mg a day), your doctor may not recommend tapering your dose. Keep track of your tapering schedule. Write down the date and the dosage you took each day. This will help you ensure that you’re following your doctor’s orders."
