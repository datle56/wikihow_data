Don’t push her to talk about her feelings, but don’t tell her that she’s right, either. [5] X Research source If you encounter her saying something negative about herself, you could say, “Interesting. Why do you feel that way?” to open up a conversation. If you’d like to, you can gently disagree with anything negative she says about herself. However, be prepared for some pushback, as she might insist that she’s right and you’re wrong."
