      "title": "Soak the pants in warm water and baby shampoo.",
      "content": "Soak the pants in warm water and baby shampoo. Mix 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of baby shampoo into a sink or tub full of lukewarm water. Submerge the pants you want to stretch in the water and let them soak for at least 1 hour before you attempt to stretch them. [1] X Research source This will loosen the cotton fibers so that they are easier to stretch. Use this method if you need to stretch the pants out a lot in several different areas or all over."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang up the pants after soaking them to stretch them all over.",
      "content": "Hang up the pants after soaking them to stretch them all over. Use clothespins to hang the pants on a line by the waist or clip them to a clothes hanger. Let the pants hang until they are completely dry. [2] X Research source The weight of the water and gravity will stretch the pants out. However, you won’t have any control over how much the pants stretch and they might use their form. Try a different method if you want more control over which direction the pants stretch in."

    {
      "title": "Stretch the pants out on a flat surface or drying rack to help keep their shape.",
      "content": "Stretch the pants out on a flat surface or drying rack to help keep their shape. Lay your pants out flat on a drying rack or a flat surface, such as a laundry table. Stretch the pants legs out by pulling the fabric in the desired directions and let the pants air dry completely. [3] X Research source Put heavy objects like cans or jars of food on top of the pants where you stretch them to hold them in place while they dry. This method will give you more control over which way the pants stretch than hanging them. However, they likely won’t stretch as much."

    {
      "title": "Sit in a warm bath while wearing the pants if they are barely too tight.",
      "content": "Sit in a warm bath while wearing the pants if they are barely too tight. Fill a bathtub with warm water. Put on your pants and get in the tub. Sit there for at least 15 minutes so the pants have a chance to absorb the warm water and loosen up. [4] X Research source You can use this method before trying other stretching methods or on its own. If the pants are just a little too tight, they might stretch out just enough to fit you perfectly after you do this. Wear the pants until they are dry if you want them to form tightly to your legs. It would be best to do this on a warm day when you can go outside and let the pants dry on your legs in the sun."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray warm water on specific areas that you want to stretch.",
      "content": "Spray warm water on specific areas that you want to stretch. Fill a spray bottle with lukewarm water. Soak areas of the pants legs that you want to stretch if the pants are only too small or tight in certain places. [5] X Research source For example, if your pants are too tight in the calves or thighs, just spray these areas with the warm water to saturate them and loosen the fibers for stretching."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the fabric by hand if you want to stretch each specific area.",
      "content": "Pull the fabric by hand if you want to stretch each specific area. Focus on snug areas of the pants legs, such as thighs or calves that are too tight. Pull these areas up and down lengthwise and side to side width-wise to stretch them out. [6] X Research source Reapply more lukewarm water as needed to make the pants legs easier to stretch as you work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the pants to air dry when you are done stretching them.",
      "content": "Leave the pants to air dry when you are done stretching them. Lay the pants out on a drying rack or flat surface after you are happy with how you’ve stretched them. Leave them alone until they are totally dry. [7] X Research source You can hang the pants up to dry if you want, but keep in mind that they might stretch out more in certain areas if they are very wet when you hang them."

    {
      "title": "Wait until your pants are dirty to wash them.",
      "content": "Wait until your pants are dirty to wash them. Avoid washing your cotton pants after every use or they will wear out and shrink or lose their shape faster. Wait until the pants are visibly dirty before you wash them. [8] X Research source You can hang your pants up to air out if you want to get rid of odors. If there is just a small spot of dirt on your pants, spot clean them using cold water, mild laundry detergent, and your fingertips or a sponge. That way, you aren’t washing the entire pair of pants just to get rid of a small spot."

      "title": "Wash cotton pants in a washing machine with cold water on a gentle cycle.",
      "content": "Wash cotton pants in a washing machine with cold water on a gentle cycle. Never use hot water to wash cotton pants because it breaks down the fibers, causing them to shrink. Always use cold water and pick the gentlest cycle possible on your machine, such as a cycle labelled for wool or delicate items. [9] X Research source You can also wash your cotton pants by hand if you want to be extra careful and gentle."

    {
      "title": "Air dry your cotton pants to avoid shrinking them in a dryer.",
      "content": "Air dry your cotton pants to avoid shrinking them in a dryer. Always hang dry your cotton pants or lay them flat to air dry. Never put them in a dryer or you will end up shrinking them. [11] X Research source If you ever absolutely must dry your pants in a dryer because you don’t have enough time to wait for them to air dry, put them in the dryer on an air dry setting or moisture sensing setting to avoid drying them too much and shrinking them."
