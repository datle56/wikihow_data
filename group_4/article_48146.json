      "content": "Beetlejuice either appears or disappears if you say his name 3 times. This all depends on Beetlejuice’s current location on the spiritual plane. He can’t enter the physical world by himself, but if you say his name 3 times, he will be able to. If you say his name 3 times while he’s in the physical world, he will return to the spirit realm. When he’s trapped in the spirit realm, Beetlejuice is only able to occupy symbolic spaces, like a newspaper ad or TV screen."

      "content": "Say his name three times in a row. In order to summon Beetlejuice, you must say his name three times in a row. You can’t say any other words in between the summoning, or else it won’t work. For example, you can’t say “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, wherefore art thou, Beetlejuice?” You must say “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.” Once you do, he will appear in his full-sized form, ready to throw the physical world for a loop with his antics! Since Beetlejuice is a fictional character, you can’t actually summon him. But you can pretend like he’s there! Better yet, pull a prank on your friends by having someone dress up as Beetlejuice and hide, making your friends say his name three times, then having the person dressed up pop out and surprise them."

      "content": "There isn’t an official reason, but Beetlejuice says it’s to stay low profile. Although the film doesn’t provide a particular reason as to why Beetlejuice can’t say his own name, he tells Lydia that it’s because “if I tell you, you tell your friends, [then] your friends are calling me on the horn all the time, I gotta show up at shopping centers for openings and sign autographs and sh*t like that. And that makes my life a hell.” [1] X Research source Some Reddit users believe he’s prevented from saying it by “greater powers” that keep him from easily tricking someone into summoning him."

      "content": "In the film, 3 symbolizes the rules needed for the mythology to work. The Beetlejuice film follows a “three times” rule for most of the spiritual antics. Not only do you say Beetlejuice’s name three times to summon him, but Barbara also says “home” three times to transfer back home, and the Maitlands draw a door and knock three times so they can enter the afterlife. Although the significance isn’t explained, it’s clear that the number 3 is powerful in the Beetlejuice mythology."

It’s associated with joy, optimism, the beauty all around us, and creativity. According to numerologist Josh Siegel, 3 is a divine number, as gods and goddesses are often represented in threes. In religions like Christianity and Hinduism, powerful spiritual deities like the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are represented in threes. The number 3 also represents totality, as it encompasses the past, present, and future. The number 3 is also associated with the devil, as 3 a.m. is considered the Devil’s Hour. The devil also tempted Jesus three times when he was in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights."

The number 3 is all over mythology, from genies only being able to grant you three wishes to the animals in fairy tales being paired in threes (like the three bears from Goldilocks to the three little pigs). Shakespeare used three witches in his classic tale of Macbeth , too, showing how much the number 3 represents and is intertwined with mythology, spirituality, and the supernatural."
