      "title": "Choose a brown suit shade.",
      "content": "Choose a brown suit shade. If you don't have a brown suit yet, you may be wondering what shade of brown would work best for you. If you have dark hair and/or a dark or ruddy complexion, a darker shade of brown will complement your features. That said, a light brown or tan suit is better for professional use, especially in warmer climates. Dark brown suits are better if you like to incorporate color into your outfits. Lighter browns will go better with neutral features of an outfit, as well as pastel colors."

      "title": "Default to wool suits.",
      "content": "Default to wool suits. In terms of fabric, wool is best. It is natural and durable. It also breathes well, looks great, and can be woven into many different weights and textures. [1] X Research source The best type of wool will be labeled \"worsted\" and/or \"high-twist.\" Cotton is an acceptable material for men's suit as well, especially if you live in a warmer climate. Go for a cotton suit with a bit of lycra woven in for added stretch and color retention."

      "title": "Wear light blue or white with a light brown suit.",
      "content": "Wear light blue or white with a light brown suit. Crisp, clean white or a light shade of blue are the best colors for a button down shirt beneath a brown suit. For a bit more formal look, go with white. Light blue, meanwhile, balances many lighter shades of brown very well. [2] X Research source Beige and tweed can also be considered variations of light brown. As such, suits and jackets of these colors will also look best with light blue or white shirts."

    {
      "title": "Consider a colored shirt for dark brown suits.",
      "content": "Consider a colored shirt for dark brown suits. If your suit is on the darker end of the brown spectrum, you have a bit more flexibility regarding the color of your shirt. For instance, consider a light brown or a bold jewel tone, such as emerald, ruby, blue, or purple. [3] X Research source White is still the best option for more formal events, and ivory can look great with especially dark brown tones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Default to warm-toned ties.",
      "content": "Default to warm-toned ties. Reds, oranges, and softer yellows compliment many browns, especially lighter and moderate browns. A muted red or burnt orange tie on a light blue shirt beneath a mid brown suit is a classic, reliable look. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Try a black or patterned tie with a white shirt.",
      "content": "Try a black or patterned tie with a white shirt. For the most formal way to wear a brown suit, wear a black tie on a white shirt. Thin black ties will look especially good. If you want to go with a white shirt but don’t need to be particularly formal, you have more freedom to experiment with lively, patterned ties. [5] X Research source You can even get away with a jolt of bright color on a tie that is paired with a brown suit and white shirt. For instance, a blue or green tie can brighten up an otherwise neutral look."

    {
      "title": "Pick a patterned shirt if you’re eschewing a tie.",
      "content": "Pick a patterned shirt if you’re eschewing a tie. If you’re wearing a brown suit but don’t need a tie, you have lots of options regarding a shirt. Stripes and gingham patterns, especially with reds, oranges, or purples will work well as long as they’re complimented with a dash of confidence. [6] X Research source A plaid that incorporates greens and/or blues can work well too."

    {
      "title": "Pair a brown suit coat with other pants.",
      "content": "Pair a brown suit coat with other pants. One of the best features of a brown sport coat is its versatility. They don’t need to be worn with matching pants; many are intended for use in less formal outfits. They can even be worn with a pair of well-cut blue jeans. [7] X Research source Darker denim washes tend to look better with light brown sport coats, while lighter denim matches well with either tan or dark brown options. For the especially bold, consider pairing colorful slacks with a brown suit coat. Coral or salmon shades will go especially well."

      "title": "Forego a collared shirt.",
      "content": "Forego a collared shirt. You don’t always have to wear a button up shirt beneath sport coats. Even a well-fit white or black t-shirt can work well. Grey can work too, especially as a thicker long sleeve. [8] X Research source One good “dressed-down” look packs plenty of stylish punch: all black with a brown sport coat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play around with multiple layers.",
      "content": "Play around with multiple layers. Lightweight sweaters or knit shirts can look great beneath a brown sport coat. Wear them without a collared shirt beneath. Either crew necks or v-neck options are fine. A different shade of brown can look particularly good, such as a tan sweater beneath a dark brown sport coat. [9] X Research source Shades of green will work well in layers too, particularly those that have undertones similar to those of brown, such as olive or dark green."

    {
      "title": "Select shoes carefully.",
      "content": "Select shoes carefully. Brown suits should be paired with either brown or burgundy shoes. However, the particular shade of the shoes is important. There needs to be a distinct contrast between the color of your shoes and the color of your suit. [10] X Research source In general, look for a shade of brown or deep red that is darker than the color of your suit. Avoid pairing black shoes with a brown suit."

      "title": "Match your belt to your shoes.",
      "content": "Match your belt to your shoes. This is one of the most well-known rules in suit fashion. It’s hard to beat a pair of rich mahogany wing-tips with a belt made from matching leather. Slight variations are acceptable, but wearing shoes and a belt of significantly different colors risks looking youthful or sloppy. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid matching your tie to your pocket square.",
      "content": "Avoid matching your tie to your pocket square. If you’re planning to wear a pocket square with a brown suit, use it to compliment your tie, but don’t match it exactly. A well-chosen pocket square can make an outfit, especially if you’re able to complement colors from several other items. [12] X Research source For instance, if you’re wearing a deep red tie on a white shirt, try a yellow pocket square to make your suit pop and provide contrast to the color of your tie."

      "content": "Consider another colored suit for an interview. Job interviews are not an appropriate time to wear your brown suit. Even if you look great, brown sends a comforting and reliable vibe, but also risks making you seem simple, old-fashioned, or overly intellectual. Other colors, such as charcoal and navy, send the message that you are productive and forward thinking. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep brown out of the courtroom. Some professional environments still favor specific formal attire. Law is one of these realms. The courtroom calls for more traditionally assertive and powerful colors, including dark blue and black. Keep your brown suit for days at your practice."
