You can get hemorrhoids inside or outside the anus and, while unpleasant, they’re usually not serious. Pain and itching are the most common symptoms.

Hemorrhoids are often particularly painful during a bowel movement, when pressure in bearing down is placed upon the anal and rectal area. In addition to feeling pain, many report feeling the uncomfortable sensation of needing to have another bowel movement right away, even though the bowels have been vacated. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for blood. One of the most common signs of hemorrhoids is painless bleeding, usually when you go to the bathroom. You might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper or in the bowl. Your bottom may also itch, hurt, or have small bulges around the anus.

      "content": "Notice lumps. Small bulges around the anus that look like grapes may be an indication of hemorrhoids. These can be various sizes. Usually, they’re the color of surrounding. But if the lumps are black or dark red/purplish, you need to go to the doctor immediately as it is a sign of a thrombosed hemorrhoid – which needs to be treated by a doctor.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are medications that can reduce swelling, though, including over-the-counter meds called vasoconstrictors that will shrink hemorrhoids. You can also try non-prescription creams and wipes – or even a small ice pack – to ease pain and swelling. Soak in a bathtub filled with a few inches of warm water 2-3 times a day or use a special \"sitz bath\" pan that fits onto your toilet seat. Then, pat dry gently.

      "title": "Assess your bathroom habits.",
      "content": "Assess your bathroom habits. The biggest cause of hemorrhoids is straining during a bowel movement. It puts pressure on the veins in the rectum and anus, causing them to swell and become painful and irritated. If you have infrequent bowel movements or have difficult during bowel movements, you may be more likely to strain. Think about your bathroom habits and determine whether they put you at risk for getting hemorrhoids. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Straining can cause an internal hemorrhoid to pass through the anus, a condition known as a protruding or prolapsed hemorrhoid. This can be a medical emergency if the hemorrhoid doesn’t shrink or return to normal with the application of hemorrhoid ointment."

If your hemorrhoid symptoms don't seem to be affected by your home treatments, and if they don't go away after a week or so, you should see a doctor to determine whether you need medical treatment to take care of the problem.
