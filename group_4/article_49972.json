      "content": "Aries (March 21–April 19) Aries’ love language? Selective worship! (OK, so that might fall under “ words of affirmation .”) They love to be praised and put on a pedestal—but not in a disingenuous way. They want to feel like they’re royalty in your eyes…but they also appreciate their alone time. How does Aries act in love? A little bit entitled, but also very confident and sure of themselves. They’ll share everything with you: they’ll open up the vault (maybe too soon!), but they expect the same loyalty in return. How can you show Aries love? Praise them! Worship them, show them how grateful you are to have them in your life, and how much you love them."

      "content": "Taurus (April 20–May 20) Taurus’s love language is quality time , for sure. They want to spend family time with you, lounging by the TV, wearing matching PJs in your Christmas photo—they just want to spend every minute together. How does Taurus act in love? Tauruses like to express physical touch: they're very tactile and sensual (they’re ruled by Venus, a decadent and sensual planet). They really just like to have that one person who's their everything. They can be picky in love, but once you pass all their tests, they're all in and can even be a little possessive. How can you show Taurus love? Buy them nice things and cook them decadent meals. They really value someone who thoughtfully puts together shared quality experiences and who can be present with them: drop everything when you’re with them, make eye contact, and hold their hand."

      "content": "Gemini (May 21–June 20) Geminis want quality time , but in a totally different way from Taurus. They want to have playdates with you: they want to go to a concert, try a new restaurant, see Wicked in the theater, or join a bowling league. As air signs, they’re very restless. They’re symbolized by the twins, so they always want a companion, a playmate. How does Gemini act in love? They can be fickle in love. They love to text and be in constant communication, but getting a text from a Gemini doesn't mean that you're their soulmate, because they probably have three other windows open at the same time. How can you show Gemini love? Tease them, flirt with them, be funny, be witty, and give them variety. They like surprises. Don't be overly predictable or available. They like a little game playing. They're the ones who say stuff like, “I'm sending a dress over to your apartment. Be ready at 7.”"

      "content": "Cancer (June 21–July 22) A Cancer’s love language is acts of service in a nurturing, warm-and-fuzzy way. They like to send the card, show up with cupcakes for your birthday, take you out to dinner, and be there for you when you've had a bad day. They’re a total mama bear, as well as a friend who’s always got a shoulder for you to cry on. How does Cancer act in love? They can be clingy and, frankly, a little insecure! Getting into the relationship is the most stressful thing for them because it means letting their guard down, and they freak out. They hide their feelings. They’ll pretend they're not into you. They’ll wait for you to make the first move, but won't give a clear signal that it's safe. They confuse the heck out of their pursuers—but once they're in, they're in. The courtship process with a Cancer is like a multi-season streaming binge with so many dramatic arcs that it's crazy. It's exhausting…but worth it in the end. How can you show Cancer love? They need space, actually. Even though they're clingy and insecure, if you act that way with them, it's a turnoff. They need privacy and space for their different moods. Their house is also their hobby studio, and they have very specific zones that they go into to create. They need to be left alone and then they'll emerge and come spend time with you. So let them decorate the house. Let them keep it organized and well-stocked with all their favorites: they need to be in command of the house a lot of times."

      "title": "Leo (July 23–August 22)",
      "content": "Leo (July 23–August 22) Leo’s love language is giving and receiving gifts . Leos do not show up anywhere empty-handed, even if they have to pick the rose off the neighbor's bush. They're ruled by the sun, so everything that's on the inside needs to be displayed on the outside too. Basically, what those gifts represent is the real Leo: their hobbies, their passions, and their interests. Leo's also ruled by the heart and the spine, meaning they're constantly putting their hearts out there through their hobbies and interests. When you give them a gift that matches their interests, it really helps them feel seen. How does Leo act in love? They like to give attention, and they need to receive attention. They can be very physically affectionate, too. They're very spontaneous in relationships, but they also like to make big, grandiose plans to have something to look forward to. Their birthdays are a big deal, as are holiday celebrations. Entertaining together is fun for Leos. How can you show Leo love? Show that you see them by giving them gifts they’ll love. Rose petals on the bed, pink diamonds, a yacht—or, for the more modest Leo, whatever their favorite thing is."

      "content": "Virgo (August 23–September 22) Virgo’s love language is words of affirmation . They're very verbal. Virgo is ruled by Mercury, which is very buzzy, intellectual, and social. Every little thing you say matters to a Virgo. They have a tendency to be hard on themselves, so telling them “You're doing great” is really important to them. How does Virgo act in love? They need to hear words of affirmation from you, but they themselves like to be of service in relationships. Virgos get a bad rap for being boring, but they're not—they're just systematic, analytical, and wise. You can count on a Virgo to plan a great date: they will read all the Yelp reviews. They'll scout out the hidden gems. They're really good at securing tickets at half-price, or finding you a lawyer to help you renegotiate your lease. How can you show Virgo love? Speak reassuring words to them. They're always second-guessing and doubting themselves, so they need someone who can stay calm and tell them they've got this."

      "title": "Libra (September 23–October 22)",
      "content": "Libra (September 23–October 22) Libra’s love language is part gift-giving , part quality time , and part physical touch . Libras like to be spoiled and adored, and they also need lots of physical affection. They're ruled by Venus, so they really enjoy pretty things and material displays of someone's care. They don't like cheap people. How does Libra act in love? They're really good listeners, and they're known for their patience. They'll take the time to listen to and be there for their partner—but in return, they expect to be spoiled! They do not take kindly to someone who doesn't treat them like they're special. How can you show Libra love? Libras like to be babied. They may need a lot of hugs and sensual touching. They like to be gazed upon and referred to by cute pet names, like “sweetie” and “honey.” Keep it peaceful and pleasant. They hate conflict: no fighting, no raised voices. They’re also very appreciative of aesthetics: keep the house clean and well-decorated, and always have great music playing. Dress well, smell good, and come up with occasions to dress up, go out, and take pictures together."

      "title": "Scorpio (October 23–November 21)",
      "content": "Scorpio (October 23–November 21) Scorpio’s love language? Quality time . Scorpios need to know that you are present with them—a little bit like Taurus, but more intense. In love, their mantra is “No one else in the world understands us like we do each other.” How does Scorpio act in love? Scorpios are intense: they want to know everything about their partner and basically be one person, and they’re super observant. You might think that they're not watching you, but they're paying attention to every detail. And when you cross a line, that's a deal breaker! At the same time, Scorpios tend to be secretive and mysterious in relationships. It really takes a long time for them to show who they are. They reserve the right to keep a few things private, but it's always in service of keeping the relationship sexy: Scorpio is the most erotic sign of all, and a little mystery goes a long way in a Scorpio relationship. How can you show Scorpio love? Show up consistently and be trustworthy, and make it safe for them to just be themselves and cut loose. Because ultimately, Scorpios just want to lie around with their partner: you don’t have to shower or anything, just listen to music, smoke cigarettes, and lie in each other’s arms all day!"

      "title": "Sagittarius (November 22–December 21)",
      "content": "Sagittarius (November 22–December 21) Sagittarius’s love language is words of affirmation . Sags, like Aries, are always trying new things and taking risks. They're adventurous. They make a lot of mistakes because they shoot all the shots, and so they need someone who believes in them—but they don’t need a cheerleader. They need someone who will be honest with them, and who affirms what is best for them. How does Sagittarius act in love? Sagittarius tends to go into relationships with rose-colored glasses. They’re ruled by Jupiter, the planet of expansion, so they always see the potential in a relationship and sometimes lose sight of reality. Sagittarius is super independent, but they also like to share projects with their partner, whether it’s a business or a creative pastime, so they need a partner who can keep up with them and be willing to go along for the ride. How can you show Sagittarius love? Support them. Help them out with their business and their special projects, show up for their shows and parties they planned, and stay up late talking to them about their latest big idea. Just get involved in their projects and their ideas."

      "title": "Capricorn (December 22–January 19)",
      "content": "Capricorn (December 22–January 19) Capricorn’s love language? We say physical touch . As earth signs, Capricorns are hard and driven people, and they really starve themselves of physical touch. While they may be professional and hard-working at the office, once the markets close, they’re the horny sea-goats of the zodiac: their free time is their time to cut loose and experience a side of themselves that they repress all day long. How does Capricorn act in love? OK, so they can be a tad controlling in relationships! They tend to be workaholics and like everything scheduled down to the minute. If a Capricorn adds you to their shared Google calendar, watch out—it might be love! How can you show Capricorn love? Be family-oriented. Be interested in their work. Be a lady or gentleman in the streets and a tiger in the sheets. Be respectable out in public—a pillar of the community—and wild and crazy in the bedroom."

      "content": "Aquarius (January 20–February 18) Aquarius’s love languages are acts of service and gift-giving . Aquariuses are the humanitarian sign. It is really important for them to show up for their friends and for the world. They will pick you up at the airport. They'll give you a standing ovation after your band performs. They give the perfect gift, something that shows they know you well. Sure, they're not super effusive—but they show their love through action. How does Aquarius act in love? Real talk: a relationship with an Aquarius can be kind of messy at first! Aquarians tend to be really buddy-buddy with everyone, but when it comes to intimate relationships, they can be a little awkward. They might hide behind jokes or get kind of uncomfortable with too much affection or praise. Much like fellow air sign Gemini, Aquarians want to be best friends with their partner and not make it super mushy all the time—but this means sometimes it’s hard knowing when you and an Aquarius are just friends, or whether they want something more. How can you show Aquarius love? Have a good sense of humor. Read the books that they give you and appreciate the playlists they make for you. They love to experiment and explore, and they have a lot of whims."

      "title": "Pisces (February 19–March 20)",
      "content": "Pisces (February 19–March 20) Pisces’ love language is definitely physical touch . Pisces is ruled by Neptune, the planet of dreams and the subconscious. This means they're often very floaty, in their heads and not always in tune with their body, so they need a partner to bring them down to earth via physical affection. Plus, they’re the most empathetic sign: because they're always focusing on everyone else, they really need someone who will hold their hand and bring them back to themselves. How does Pisces act in love? It’s like a rom-com. They put it all out there: they have no boundaries. When they like you, they’ll let you know. They don’t understand separation and space very well, and they can be hypersensitive, meaning they can get their feelings hurt when you need some alone time. How can you show Pisces love? Spend a lot of quality time with them. Make them feel they're seen and appreciated, because they tend to have abandonment issues. You have to always let them know, “I'm thinking about you. I'm thinking about you,” and they'll do the same. Pisces also have really amazing taste in fashion, food, and music, and they love to express that! One of the best things you can do is let them share their passions with you."

      "content": "The 5 love languages refer to the ways people prefer to express and give love. According to Baptist pastor Gary Chapman’s 1992 book The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate , there are 5 general ways that romantic partners tend to show and receive love. Chapman calls these “love languages.” The 5 love languages, according to Chapman, are: Words of affirmation: expressing love through compliments, verbal appreciation, and encouragement Acts of service: expressing love by performing helpful tasks for your partner Giving gifts : expressing love by giving thoughtful, meaningful gifts that show how much you appreciate your partner and how well you know them Quality time: expressing love through shared experiences, undivided attention, and meaningful conversation Physical touch : expressing love through physical affection, including hugging, kissing, holding hands, and sexual activity Wondering what your love language is?

      "content": "Aries As a passionate fire sign, Aries are very confident and driven, and they need a partner who can either match their energy or balance them out. More importantly, they need someone who will shower them with praise and make them feel like royalty (without being clingy or impinging on their solo time!). Most compatible signs: Cancer: Aries can be real tender, and Cancer will want to baby them. Leo: As a fellow fire sign, Leo shares Aries’ playful energy. Sagittarius: Also a fire sign! Sag is adventurous and bold, which Aries likes. Least compatible signs: Scorpio: They have this sort of feisty energy, and while Scorpio and Aries may be attracted to one another, the relationship is combustible because Aries will miss all the subtle emotional cues Scorpio puts out and Scorpio will likely wind up coming off as passive-aggressive to Aries. How can they make it work? Aries needs to understand that Scorpio will take things personally and just be willing to apologize when they hurt Scorpio's feelings. And Scorpio needs to also remember that Aries is just kind of blunt and they're not trying to personally attack them all the time!"

      "content": "Taurus Taurus needs a partner who can appreciate the little things: making each other’s coffee in the morning, cooking dinner together at night, and asking each other, “How was your day?” It can be tedious for some people, but if you’re the type who likes to share every detail of your life and create an intimate bond, Taurus is your match for sure! Most compatible signs: Leo: They’re both decadent and larger-than-life. Capricorn: They’re both earth signs, so they kind of understand where one another is coming from. They’re both driven and very loyal. Virgo: Another earth sign. Virgo and Taurus like to plan everything out and can be rather analytical—they also like to be there for their partners, so they make a good match. Least compatible signs: Aquarius: This match can be a real mess. They’re both fixed signs, but Aquarius is just too free-flowing, whereas Taurus never likes to go off-script, so this pairing can go very wrong. How can they make it work? They need to make sure they have blocks of time scheduled for dating and seeing each other. The Taurus needs to respect the Aquarian's need for sovereignty, while the Aquarius has to make more effort to check in with Taurus."

      "content": "Gemini Geminis are serial daters: they love meeting new people, and they're never going to stop. They're very flirty, cheeky, and playful. But it doesn't mean they can't be loyal—it just means you really have to be their best friend if they're going to settle down with you. Most compatible signs: Cancer: It’s a weird match, but Cancers need someone social and flirty (like a Gemini) to draw them out, and then they can be really fun together. Meanwhile, Cancer helps Gemini settle down a little. Libra: As another air sign, Libra’s a great match, because they can both be flirty and romantic. Least compatible signs: Taurus: Taurus doesn’t like to experiment. They like their favorite things, and they’ll do them over and over. They want to get very deep into a few of the same things, whereas Gemini likes to superficially try a lot of different things. How can they make it work? Taurus needs to be willing to try not to turn everything into the biggest deal in the world, and Gemini needs to understand that there are a few things that are sacrosanct to Taurus, and they should take them seriously."

      "title": "Cancer",
      "content": "Cancer Cancer needs space—but they also need someone who will be their safety net, because they can be shy and insecure. You have to love their friends and family, too: their close inner circle is really important, whether it's chosen family or birth family. Most compatible signs: Scorpio: Scorpios need someone who will let them be themselves, like Cancer, and Cancers love to be there for their partners and provide for them. Capricorn: Dolly Parton's a Capricorn, and her husband was a Cancer, and he liked to stay home when she was out in the world doing her Dolly Parton thing. It's that nice combination of opposites where they respect each other's terrain really well and work together as a team. Least compatible signs: Sagittarius: Cancer is the homebody, and Sagittarius is the traveler. They both enjoy being at home and traveling, but they do it in such totally different ways: Cancer wants loyalty and a small group of friends, but Sagittarius wants to be friends with the world. How can they make it work? Cancer needs to be more open to strangers or just let Sagittarius go out on their own, and Sagittarius needs to understand that it's not the worst thing in the world to hang out with the same people over and over again."

      "content": "Leo Leo wants to be seen more than anything. They need a partner who will validate them, accept them, and make them feel like they’re perfect the way they are. They also need someone who will give them plenty of attention and affection and be willing to receive attention and affection in return. Most compatible signs: Taurus: They’re both very sensual signs who appreciate being together and lavishing attention on one another. Leo: Two Leos are a power couple. Leos love themselves, so why not love someone else who also loves themselves? Least compatible signs: Aquarius: This coupling happens a lot, but it’s often a bad idea. They’re opposites who attract, and it can last, but it tends to end badly. How can they make it work? Leo has to understand that sulking is not going to get them the attention they want from Aquarius, and Aquarius has to remember they cannot treat a person they just met at a party with more reverence than their partner! Aquarius sometimes treats strangers better than their close friends and partners, and that is just a no-go for Leo."

They need a partner who just sees them as beautiful and great and perfect, no matter what—and will tell them that on the regular! Most compatible signs: Scorpio: Virgo knows how to calm emotional Scorpio down while being sensible and wise. They’re always ready with advice when Scorpio gets thrown off. Scorpios can also help Virgos get out of their heads and tap into their creativity. Aquarius: They’re both service-oriented, and they bring out the best in each other. Least compatible signs: Aries: This is a hot mess. Aries can be rash, impatient, and focused on the big picture, but Virgo wants to analyze every detail. How can they make it work? Aries has to learn to cultivate a little more interest in Virgo's fascinations, while Virgo has to understand that Aries wants to hear the bottom line, not the entire story."

They appreciate the arts and aesthetics, so they likely need a partner who cares about that stuff, too. Most compatible signs: Cancer: They both appreciate the arts, music, and the finer things in life. Capricorn: Sort of the same thing: both of these signs are very cultivated and refined. Least compatible signs: Virgo: They both have a bookish energy, but there’s no spice. Virgos have a hard time with anything that is impractical, while Libras love to just indulge. How can they make it work? Mutual respect and understanding: Virgos will have to understand that they cannot get Libra hooked on a fitness app, but Libras need to not keep bringing chocolate cake home when Virgo is trying to do another one of their cleanses."

Scorpios will not waste time or settle: they need a relationship with “meant to be” vibes. Most compatible signs: Scorpio: Scorpios stick together. Nobody will ever understand a Scorpio like another Scorpio. Cancer: As a fellow water sign, Scorpio and Cancer tend to get along great. They’re both sensitive, emotional, and understanding, and they love love. Least compatible signs: Aries: Aries and Scorpio may have great chemistry, but ultimately, Aries can be very impatient and self-focused, and Scorpio will get frustrated by that and can take things very personally. How can they make it work? Aries needs to be more self-aware and take responsibility when they hurt Scorpio’s feelings, and Scorpio needs to practice letting Aries’ behavior roll off their back. Gemini: There’s attraction between these two, and while they both like mystery, Scorpios need more certainty, and Gemini may struggle to provide that. Meanwhile, Scorpio may demand more commitment, which can make Gemini feel hemmed in. How can they make it work? Gemini needs to be better at keeping their word and sticking to plans, and Scorpio needs to be a little more flexible."

They need someone who can help them be their best while also discouraging them from doing stupid things ( without popping their bubble). Most compatible signs: Aries: They’re both fire signs, both independent, both freedom-loving. They just really get each other! Virgo: Beyonce and Jay-Z are the classic Virgo-Sag power couple. These signs are both philosophical, analytical, and driven. They’re co-builders. Least compatible signs: Gemini: These signs are opposites, and while they may be attracted to one another, they don’t tend to have long-term potential. Sagittarius is always on the hunt for Truth, while Gemini is like, “Truth is subjective.” How can they make it work? Gemini needs to develop a more solid sense of values and not just get caught up in whatever everyone else thinks, whereas Sagittarius also needs to lighten up and have more of a sense of humor."

They may gravitate toward someone whom they can plug into the other parts of their lives that they don't have time to manage. Most compatible signs: Capricorn: They're the popular kids in school. They’re a power couple. Taurus: A Taurus can help balance Capricorn out by keeping the home fire burning for them. Least compatible signs: Aquarius: They often go for each other, but they often wind up falling apart: they’re both project-oriented, but Aquarius is more idealistic and Capricorn can be rather practical and corporate. How can they make it work? They have to make sure that they are both aligned with the same values and intentions before they start working together.

They don’t need a partner who’s just like them, but they need someone who won’t fence them in. Give them free rein to be as weird as they are. In fact, encourage it. Most compatible signs: Libra: They're both air signs. Libra's got a sweetness that isn't cloying, and this can get the Aquarius to lighten up and be a bit softer. And Aquarius can get Libra to think beyond just the aesthetics of things and inspire them to deepen their interest in the bigger questions of life. Virgo: Like Aquarius, Virgo is very service-oriented and loves helping people, but as an earth sign, Virgo can keep sometimes overly-intellectual Aquarius a little more grounded, while Aquarius can help draw out Virgo’s weirdness. Least compatible signs: Sagittarius: They make great friends, but there’s just too much independent spirit there, and their love winds up feeling competitive. How can they make it work? In order for this match to work, they’d need an intimacy coach who will tell them, “It’s ‘into me see,’” but they may not want to go there! They’re not warm and fuzzy people."

Pisces are enchanting, but they’re a little bit like a siren. Their song can send you crashing into the rocks if you're not careful. It's a lot of work to date a Pisces—but there are a lot of rewards too. Most compatible signs: Scorpio: This is kind of the ultimate match: they'll share the same taste in music, they like to dive into the poetic details of everything together, and there's a real chemistry between those two signs that you can’t beat. Scorpio and Pisces also knows how to make each other feel secure by giving enough attention. Cancer: Scorpio may be the best fit, but Pisces is a great match with both of the other water signs. They’re emotional and sensitive and understand each other. Least compatible signs: Aries: As the first and last signs of the zodiac, Pisces and Aries tend not to be a good match. Aries can be impatient and self-focused, and Pisces is compassionate and selfless. Pisces can get lost in the Aries world, and Aries can get annoyed by Pisces being too much of a fangirl or fanboy. How can they make it work? Aries would have to consciously cultivate support for the Pisces’ projects, whereas Pisces would have to consciously make sure that they step back and invest in their own thing and not get caught up in the Aries whirlwind."
