      "content": "Plan! If you know the date and time of your journey two weeks or so in advance, go to a local station or onto a rail website and book your ticket early. This could save you money or get you a reserved seat on a busy service. Pack all of your luggage so that you can easily have everything you'll need with you. Make sure that you can quickly pack the things that you might need to put in at the last available second. [1] X Research source Make sure to have a good breakfast, lunch or dinner before you start your journey. Not all trains have facilities to purchase food and drink."

Follow signs to get to the platform and listen to the loudspeaker system for possible platform alterations. Bear in mind you might have to go up and down stairs, look for a lift if stairs aren't an option for you."

      "content": "Get on the train. Put your luggage in the overhead racks or designated luggage area rather than on the seat next to you as you may stop someone else sitting down. Just think how annoyed you'd be if you needed a seat and someone else was using up a perfectly good one for their bag or feet. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Relax. [5] X Research source Now you have your seat you are in a good place to forget about everything and just be transported to your destination. It is a good idea to pay attention to the announcements so you have an idea of how many stops there are until you get off or if you are approaching your destination. Don't worry too much about whereabouts you are as it is usually announced when your stop is coming up. If there are no announcements ask the conductor for the time when the train is expected to arrive."

If you didn't hear the announcement ask someone nearby which stop you are approaching so you don't get off at the wrong place! Remember to press the buttons near the doors to open them. They won't open on their own."
