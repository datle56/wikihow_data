Read the jacket's care label to make sure you don't miss any instructions unique to your jacket. [3] X Research source If the jacket is non-machine washable, for example, you will need to clean it by hand."

      "title": "Use a detergent made for waterproof clothing.",
      "content": "Use a detergent made for waterproof clothing. Most detergents, soap powders, and conditioners can damage the waterproof coating on your jacket. Purchase a specialized mild detergent for washing your jacket. Check for leftover detergent in the machine slot to avoid getting abrasive residue on your jacket.

If your washer does not have a specific delicate cycle, choose a slow spin cycle. [5] X Research source Make sure the setting you choose uses warm water. Cold or hot water is too abrasive for most jackets."

      "content": "Reproof your rain jacket if its effectiveness wears off.

      "content": "Spray the jacket with a waterproofing spray. To choose the right waterproofing spray, research which water repellant sprays work well with your jacket's fabric. At a distance of about 4–6 inches (10–15 cm), coat the jacket with the waterproofing spray. Make sure you coat every inch of the jacket's outer shell. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Test your reproofing job by sprinkling water on the jacket.",
      "content": "Test your reproofing job by sprinkling water on the jacket. If the water droplets bead up, your jacket is once again water repellant. If your jacket absorbs the water, however, then you may not have sprayed it enough. The amount you sprinkle on the jacket should be small so you can closely measure its response. [12] X Research source While many sprays are immediate, some may take time to gain full effect. Read the spray instructions to check if you'll need to wait before testing it. Dry your jacket off, then spray it again or use a stronger reproofing spray if it absorbs the water."
