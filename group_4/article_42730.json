    {
      "title": "Breathe normally.",

      "content": "Practice easy letters. Say easy letters repeatedly until you can say them comfortably. Try to articulate with your tongue rather than opening your mouth. [8] X Expert Source Amy Chapman, MA Voice & Speech Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2019.

      "content": "Work on tough letters. There are 7 letters (B, F, M, P, V, W and Y) that are especially tricky to say with your mouth closed. This is because they require you to move your lips to make the sounds associated with them. To make the sounds of these letters, you’ll have to substitute them for easier letters or sounds. Substitute: D for B “Eth” for F N for M T for P “Thee” for V O for I W and Y [10] X Research source"

[11] X Research source Make a list of easy and difficult words and repeat them 10 to 20 times each – or until you feel comfortable saying them. Then, move on to new words."

      "content": "Emphasize “ing” when saying a word that starts with a problematic letter. Since “ing” is such a powerful sound, you can use it to obscure your substitution of a difficult letter. Simply emphasize the “ing” and possibly say it louder. Since “f” is difficult to say, with “fishing,” say “th-ish-ing.” Say the “ing” loud. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Speak entire sentences. Start to put individual words together to form sentences. Make sure to include a few somewhat difficult words. Without these, you won’t be able to master the art of talking with your mouth closed. After enough practice, you’ll find that your pronunciation will get better and better. Start with a simple sentence like “Hi, my name is John and I am from Nebraska.” Move on to tougher sentences like “I believe that running is one of the most effective ways to exercise.” [14] X Research source"

This way, you can not only entertain them but be challenged by unscripted conversations you’re likely to have with them. Try to hold a normal conversation with your friends. Talk about various subjects and let them ask you questions. Invite friends and family to watch you talk with your mouth closed.
