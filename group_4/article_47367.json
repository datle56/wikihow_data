      "title": "Wipe the outside of the pillow with a damp, soapy cloth.",
      "content": "Wipe the outside of the pillow with a damp, soapy cloth. Use warm water and mild laundry detergent or dishwashing soap to wet the cloth. Wipe the entire outside of the pillow with the soapy cloth, concentrating on areas that may be stained. A clean cloth, small towel, or even a sponge will work for cleaning your microbead pillow. Only dampen the outside fabric of the pillow, do not use so much water that you soak the fabric. Do not submerge the pillow in water or it could damage the microbeads inside."

      "title": "Use a clean cloth to rinse off the soap on the outside of the pillow.",
      "content": "Use a clean cloth to rinse off the soap on the outside of the pillow. Use a new cloth and clean warm water to wipe away any soap that may remain on the outside fabric of the pillow. You can also re-use the soapy cloth to rinse the pillow, just make sure it’s completely rinsed of soap before you use it. As with the soapy cloth, try not to get the outside of the pillow too wet. You don’t want the water to soak through the fabric to the microbeads."

      "title": "Allow the microbead pillow to air dry completely.",
      "content": "Allow the microbead pillow to air dry completely. Hang the microbead pillow or lay it on a towel to dry. Allow it to dry for at least 24 hours before using it again. Don’t use the pillow until it’s completely dry. If the pillow is drying on a towel, remember to turn it over every couple of hours so all sides dry out evenly. You can hang the pillow using clothespins from a line or you can lay it over something like a railing, towel bar, or even a shower curtain rod."

    {
      "title": "Place the microbead pillow inside a pillowcase and tie it closed.",
      "content": "Place the microbead pillow inside a pillowcase and tie it closed. Never wash your microbead pillow on its own in a washing machine as the agitator may damage the pillow or even rip the fabric. To prevent damage, put the microbead pillow inside a larger pillowcase or a laundry bag that can be tied or secured closed. If the microbead pillow’s outside fabric does get torn or ripped in the washing machine, a pillowcase will make sure the microbead stay contained. Make sure the colour of the pillowcase is similar to the colour of the microbead pillow, so if the colours do run, they won’t stain the pillowcase."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash the microbead pillow in a load with items of the same colour.",
      "content": "Wash the microbead pillow in a load with items of the same colour. Always wash your microbead pillow with other items. Washing it alone could ruin the pillow by stretching it too much or tearing the fabric. Washing your microbead pillow with towels is helpful as the wet towels will weigh down the pillow and make sure it doesn’t get damaged. Make sure the other items in the load are similar colours to that of the microbead pillow, just in case the colour of the fabric runs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the gentle cycle with warm or cold water and mild detergent.",
      "content": "Use the gentle cycle with warm or cold water and mild detergent. The gentle cycle will help ensure the washing machine won’t damage the microbead pillow. Use warm or cold water to prevent fabric colours from running. Use whatever mild laundry detergent you have on hand, like whatever laundry detergent you use for handwashing clothes. If you don’t have mild laundry detergent, you can find a bottle at any grocery or department store. Avoid using bleach or fabric softener when washing your pillow to prevent damage to the microbeads inside."

    {
      "title": "Dry the microbead pillow in a dryer at the lowest temperature.",
      "content": "Dry the microbead pillow in a dryer at the lowest temperature. Take the washed microbead pillow (and the other items) out of the washing machine and place them in the dryer. Set the dryer to its lowest temperature. If it has a sensor, also set it to stop before the contents are completely dried. You’re going to take the microbead pillow out of the dryer before it’s completely dry, but you can continue to run the dryer for the other items if needed. Keep the microbead pillow in the pillowcase while it’s in the dryer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hang the microbead pillow to finish drying.",
      "content": "Hang the microbead pillow to finish drying. Once the microbead pillow is about 90-95% dry in the dryer, take it out and remove it from the pillowcase. Hang the pillow up to finish drying. If you can’t hang it up, lay it flat on a dry towel to finish drying. You can put the pillowcase back in the dryer to finish drying if you want. If you lay the pillow on a dry towel to finish drying, turn it over after a couple of hours to make sure both sides dry completely."
