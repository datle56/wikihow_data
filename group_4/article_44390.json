      "content": "Make sure you understand the challenges and risks of traveling entirely alone as a teenager. Some countries will require a consent letter signed by your parents or guardians and some may refuse your entry all together. Most hotels will make you jump through extra hoops as a minor or may not let you stay there at all. Some tourist attractions won't let minors in without an adult accompanying you. You'll be all alone. If you're have a medical emergency, are arrested, or experience any other kind of pitfall, you may not be able to reach anyone back home."

      "content": "Learn the laws and regulations regarding teenage travel in the country you plan to visit. In some countries, traveling alone as a minor may not be allowed, and you can be denied entry. [1] X Research source In some countries, like Portugal, minors must have a letter signed by both of their parents, and must authenticate that letter at an embassy prior to travelling. In other countries, like Spain, minors can generally travel alone, but if they are arrested, end up in the hospital, or otherwise run into problems, they may be held by authorities until their situation can be resolved."

      "content": "Purchase travel insurance. Especially as a minor, having the safety net provided by travel insurance is a big help. Depending on the level of insurance you buy, your missed flights will be refunded; you will receive money to replace lost luggage; and your expenses in medical emergencies will be covered. Emergency transportation back to your home country may also be arranged and provided for you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for student discounts. One of the perks of traveling as a teenager is that you get access to student discounts automatically if you are under 18. Most tourist attractions, museums, and other sites of interest will offer discounts. Some hotels and airlines will also offer discounts. Also, most public transit systems offer discounted tickets or passes for teenagers."

      "title": "Find a hotel that allows minors to stay unaccompanied.",
      "content": "Find a hotel that allows minors to stay unaccompanied. Most hotels won't rent to anyone under the age of 18 (some won't even rent to people under 21), and usually this information isn't displayed on their website, so the only way to know is to call directly and ask. If the city you plan to visit has a youth hostel, try calling them. Many youth hostels will allow minors to stay, although most are restricted to those 16 and older."

      "title": "Book flights.",
      "content": "Book flights. Most, but not all, airlines will allow you to travel alone if you are 18. Traveling alone is different from traveling as an unaccompanied minor. Note that unaccompanied minor programs, usually for children under the age of 12, are tickets where you are guided from gate to gate by airline staff, and must be dropped off and picked up by an adult."

      "title": "Prepare to go!",
      "content": "Prepare to go! Traveling alone can be intimidating, but you almost always come back a different person. You'll be more self-confident, and have a different view of both your own culture and the cultures you interact with on your trip. You'll have new friends and new memories in a new place. Enjoy your trip!"

      "title": "Consider traveling as part of a tour.",
      "content": "Consider traveling as part of a tour. While not as free-spirited an option as traveling fully alone, tour groups specifically for teenagers are a good way to get out of your comfort zone, learn more about travel, and make new friends. Traveling as part of a group also means your hotels, food, transportation, and activities are already organized for you. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "See if your school offers any trips. Many schools offer tours as part of their foreign language classes. Ask a foreign language teacher if your school sponsors such a trip. If your school does offer one, it can be one of the easiest and best tour opportunities for you. You'll likely already have friends on the tour and the chaperones are usually teachers. If you do go with your school, the rest of the steps here are likely already handled. [4] X Research source"
