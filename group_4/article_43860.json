      "title": "Try the two-knuckle grip.",
      "content": "Try the two-knuckle grip. Arch your pointer and middle fingers so that the tips are facing down. Grab the ball so that the fingers you put down are right beneath the horseshoe seam on the baseball. Each baseball has four separate horseshoes, so any one will do. Dig your two fingernails into the middle of the seams behind the horseshoe. Use enough pressure so that the ball is firmly grasped but be careful not chip your fingernail or injury your finger tip. Stabilize the ball with your thumb and ring finger on opposite sides of the ball."

Grab the ball so that the fingers you put down are right beneath the horseshoe seam on the baseball. [1] X Research source Dig your three fingernails into the middle of the seams behind the horseshoe. Use enough pressure so that the ball is firmly grasped with injuring your fingertips. Stabilize the ball with your thumb and pinky finger on opposite sides of the ball."

      "title": "Try the four-knuckle grip.",
      "content": "Try the four-knuckle grip. Arch your pointer, middle, ring, and pinky fingers so that the tips are facing down. Grab the ball so that the fingers you put down are right beneath the horseshoe seam on the baseball. [2] X Research source Dig your four fingernails into the middle of the seams behind the horseshoe. Use enough pressure so that the ball is firmly grasped with injuring your fingertips. Keep your thumb off to the side of the ball, slightly underneath it. This is your only stability point so you may need to grip harder to control the ball."

      "title": "Throw from the fingertips.",
      "content": "Throw from the fingertips. Avoid digging your knuckles into the ball. Although the knuckleball was originally thrown with the knuckles pointing into the ball rather than the finger tips, this is not as effective. You're trying to reduce the amount of spin you put on the ball. Grabbing the ball with your knuckles may cause the ball to rotate more than necessary. This can create more spin, less movement, and the pitch will be easier to hit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep a fast arm motion.",
      "content": "Keep a fast arm motion. Go through your windup normally, with a normal fastball motion until you reach your release point. The knuckleball should look like a fastball until the pitcher reveals the ball right before his release. You don't want to tip your pitches to the batter. Don't alter your arm slot or anything else. This can reduce the chance your knuckleball will knuckle and end up as a soft lob."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your wrist up as you release the pitch.",
      "content": "Keep your wrist up as you release the pitch. This is essential to getting minimal amount of spin. Throwing a fastball, you usually move your wrist down as you release the ball, creating steady spin on the ball and causing it to travel straight, more or less. Throwing a knuckleball, you try to do the opposite, because you don't want spin. Extend your fingertips out as you release the ball. This will minimize spin. Try to let your knuckles be the topmost point of your hand as you release. Having your knuckles at the very top of your hand will ensure that less spin is created when you release the ball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Perfect your release.",
      "content": "Perfect your release. Let the ball slip through your hands by releasing your thumb from the grip. Follow through and end as if you are throwing any other pitch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know who to use it against.",
      "content": "Know who to use it against. Batters that prefer to hit fastballs over breaking pitches are more likely struggle with the knuckleball. Ask your teammates what they know about the batter or watch them playing other teams. Batters who are generally impatient and swing a lot are also good targets for the knuckleball.

      "title": "Known when to use it.",
      "content": "Known when to use it. Your knuckleball may become predictable if you use it too often, especially when you’re new to it and still perfecting your technique. Start out using it as a strikeout and change-of-pace pitch. Use your strikeout pitches when you have a two-strike count except when the count is full. If you’re using it as an occasional change-of-pace pitch, try to only use it once per inning or less."

    {
      "title": "Practice with catch.",
      "content": "Practice with catch. It's harder to throw a knuckleball out of the windup than it is when you're playing catch. After warming up, line up about 30 feet away from your throwing partner and practice mastering the grip and the motion before you combine it all in a pitch."

    {
      "title": "Practice by throwing straight up.",
      "content": "Practice by throwing straight up. Lie down and practice throwing the knuckler upwards instead of out. Practice getting the right grip and release. Throwing the ball vertically will help your muscle memory remember to keep your wrist up as you release. [4] X Research source"
