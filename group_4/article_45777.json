      "content": "Give copyright information and sources. If it's free work: Are you the copyright holder? Did you made this by yourself, from scratch, without copying or incorporating anybody else's creative work? If so, are you willing to release it under a free license? If so, provide how it's your own work, the date and publication (if you uploaded it somewhere else). Also, it's very important to place your work under a free license so that anyone can use it. If the owner of the file gave it to you: Can you provide evidence that they have agreed to release it under a free license, for free use by anybody and for any purpose? If so, provide the name of the owner/author, when did it get created, the source (Did you get it online, or the owner gave it to you by hand or in another way?), permission, which license did the owner chose, an evidence that the owner gave you the permission to use it. Note that these information are also requested if the file is from a free published source If this work is so old so it's copyright has expired: Is it an old photograph or old painting, drawing, etc.? Can you provide enough information about it's author and a prove that it is old enough for it's copyright to have expired? Is it legally now in the Public Domain? The information you need to are the name of the original author, the date of death, full bibliographic information, date of the creation, the place where you found this file (if you found it on the web, write the URL (link) where the file can be seen), why is the work is free of all copyrights, and an evidence. If the file is in the Public Domain for another reason(s): Can you demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain? Was it created by the US Federal Government? Is it too simple to attract any copyright? You will need to provide the name of the author, the source, date of the creation, and why is the work is free of all copyrights. If it's copyrighted, but you think that it is Fair Use: Enter the name of the article you wanted to be put in without the [[ ]] and the https://en.wikipedia.org./. Then you will need to provide the use rationale. If the file doesn't match any of the categories: Aren't you sure what its status is and who made it or who owns it? If so, don't upload it. Don't upload any file you found anywhere even if it will make the article better. Copyright rules are very important on Wikipedia."
