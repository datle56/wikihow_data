      "content": "Stack rings of different sizes on one finger to show off your collection. Stackable rings can be a great way to wear your favorite jewelry without making your hands look imbalanced. Stack similarly styled rings on one finger, leave space between each ring, or wear your stackable rings at different heights along your finger for a more elegant look. If the rings hinder your fingers’ ability to move, you may be wearing too many. Try spacing them out across all your fingers instead. If you have a ton of thin, minimalist rings you’ve been dying to wear, try spacing them out between your knuckles and your fingertips. Just make sure any rings you wear above your knuckle fit tightly enough that they won’t fall off."

      "content": "Mix and match metals or stick to one color throughout. There’s no strict rule for whether or not you should mix and match metals when it comes to rings. [1] X Research source Experiment with different metals and wear them however you feel the most confident. You can wear all gold on one hand and silver on the other, alternate between colors on each finger, or wear all of one color on both hands. While some people recommend sticking to one metal (like gold or silver) to avoid clashing, others say mixing metals can give you a more stylized aesthetic. [2] X Research source You can also wear silver or light-metaled rings on both hands with one gold ring or your wedding ring to make it really stand out."

      "title": "Wear rings that match your personal style.",
      "content": "Wear rings that match your personal style. Do you like a more minimalist style? Try wearing simple thin bands. Are you looking for a more edgy, rocker vibe? Maybe a skull ring is more up your alley. Choosing rings that you feel confident wearing and that reflect your taste and style might be all you need to pull off your look. You can also add in rings that have personal importance to you, like a wedding band, an engagement ring, a signet ring, a class ring, or a family heirloom. Whatever style you’re aiming for, try to avoid creating different styles on each hand. Instead, create one cohesive aesthetic throughout both hands."

      "content": "Look for metals and gemstones that compliment your skin’s natural tone. Matching your rings to your skin tone can help make the metal really pop. Everyone’s skin tone is different, so if you can’t find a material you like below, you’re totally free to experiment with other metals and gems to see what works best for you. Here are a few of our recommendations: [3] X Research source Skin with red or pink undertones: Try wearing silver, white gold, or platinum, and consider gemstones like citrine, garnet, or turquoise. Skin with blue undertones: Try wearing gold, white gold, or silver, and consider gemstones like diamonds, amethysts, or sapphires. Skin with yellow undertones: Try wearing gold, rose gold, or copper, and consider gemstones like emeralds, topaz, or rubies."

      "content": "Coordinate your rings with different occasions and outfits. When deciding what rings to wear, consider the formality of the event and what type of clothing you’re going to wear. Try to wear more elegant or sophisticated rings like gold, diamonds, or pearls if you’re attending formal events like weddings. Wear more colorful, fun rings for everyday looks and informal events. If you’re going to a very formal event, consider wearing only one or two rings to avoid looking too casual."

      "content": "Select appropriately sized rings for each finger. Each finger on your hand has a different ring size, so it’s important to wear the correct-sized rings on each finger to keep them from slipping off. To find your ring sizes : Using a piece of paper or string: Wrap a piece of paper or string around your finger, mark where it overlaps, and use a ruler to measure the length of the string from the end to the mark. Using a flexible measuring tape: Wrap the measuring tape around your finger and record the measurement where the tape overlaps. Using a ring sizing chart: Print out a ring sizing chart and place an existing ring over the circles on the chart until one fits perfectly along the inside of the band. Compare your ring measurements to a sizing chart to find your ring sizes."

      "content": "Wear rings that compliment each other for a cohesive look. The possibilities are endless—you could wear all silver on one hand and gold on the other, wear all matching rings with a couple of statement rings, or wear 1 to 2 rings on one hand and 5 on the other. Just make sure that the rings’ aesthetic has one overall theme to avoid an unbalanced look. For example, having grunge-themed rings on one hand and dainty gold stackable rings on the other might look a little inconsistent. No matter how many rings you decide to wear, just make sure they sit comfortably on your fingers and don’t obstruct your movement."

      "content": "Pick rings in similar styles for a unified, unique look. Try to wear rings that all have a similar aesthetic to keep any of your rings from looking out of place. If you’d like to wear a statement ring on one finger, try wearing smaller rings on the others to keep your hand from looking too cluttered. For example, you could wear a statement ring on one finger and smaller rings on the others. Statement rings might include wedding rings or any ring with a large precious stone. A pinky thumb ring can be a unique way to show off your personality while spacing out the rest of your rings. Experiment with different styles and switch rings between your same-sized fingers until you find the perfect style for you."

When wearing stacked rings, try not to wear any more than three on one finger—more than that might be uncomfortable or get in the way of daily activities. That doesn’t mean you can’t wear more than three rings on each hand! This is just a general guideline. Put on as many rings as you feel confident and comfortable wearing."

In some societies, thumb rings are a sign of wealth and influence, and can indicate that you have an assertive personality. [4] X Research source Because the thumb is separated from the rest of the four fingers, it can be a great finger to display chunkier rings or rings that symbolize something important to you, like class or signet rings.

A ring on the right pinky finger can symbolize professional status or graduation with a degree in a certain field, like engineering or ecology. [14] X Research source It used to be popular for men to wear both their signet ring and their wedding ring on their left pinky. This trend has pretty much fallen out of style, except for British royalty like Prince Charles. [15] X Research source Because your pinky is usually the smallest finger on your hand, it can be a good place to wear a ring for a more subtle fashion statement. [16] X Research source"
