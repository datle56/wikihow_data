      "content": "Mark each PVC pipe at the 54 in (140 cm) line. Use a measuring tape and silver marker; 54 in (140 cm) is tall enough to extend above a standard bed frame and accommodate 2-3 rows of ring ropes. Then rest each pipe on a tall, flat surface and hold it steady with a clamp or vise while you cut it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure the bed frame and add 7 in (18 cm) to its length. For example, to accommodate a standard twin-size bed, the boards should be 82 in (210 cm) in length, which is 7 in (18 cm) longer than a typical twin bed. In this case, measure 82 in (210 cm) on each board, make a pencil mark, then carefully cut the board width-wise with a table saw using the mark as your starting point. [2] X Research source Put on safety goggles and gloves before making your cuts, even if you have experience using sharp tools like hacksaws and table saws."

      "content": "Make 1 hole 6 in (15 cm) from the top of the pipe and one at 18 in (46 cm). Use a drill bit that matches the size of the eyelets you purchased. [3] X Research source You can also add a third hole if you want three rows of rope like they use in real WWE wrestling rings. It’s totally up to you how you want to customize this fun bed."

      "content": "The eyelets will anchor the ring ropes around the bed. It’s important that these stay tight. When your child begins using the wrestling bed, check the eyelets periodically to ensure they haven’t come unscrewed or been jostled loose. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The lines will guide you on where to attach the PVC pipes. Place a framing square on the outside edge of the board, measure 1 in (2.5 cm) inward, and draw a line parallel to the edge. Repeat this process at either end of the board, as well. The lines at either end should intersect at right angles 1 in (2.5 cm) near the corners. [5] X Research source A framing square will help ensure your build is as straight and aligned as possible."

Then hold them in place with clamps or weighted objects like bricks for at least a few hours (or even overnight) to ensure the glue bonds are strong. The caps will hold the pipes in place and prevent them from wiggling. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Only place glue about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) from the end of each pipe. PVC glue is extremely strong, so you don't need too much of it. You’ll also increase the bond by screwing the pipe into the cap in the next step."

Then, place tables, sawhorses, or another tall surface next to them to prevent them from tipping over while the glue dries. In the end, you’ll have two 1x10s with a PVC post placed on each end. The boards will serve as the base for the wrestling bed frame and the posts as the anchors for the ring ropes. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Prop the frame’s feet on the boards. If you did your measurements and pipe placement correctly, the PVC pipes should each be positioned close to each corner of the bed. [9] X Research source If you’re concerned that the 1x10s will damage your flooring, place anti-slip protectors on the bottom of each board. This will also help prevent them from sliding around and disrupting the visual effect of the wrestling bed."

      "title": "Measure the distance between the PVC posts to find the rope length.",
      "content": "Measure the distance between the PVC posts to find the rope length. Make sure to do this after positioning them around the bed frame. Cut 6 ropes long enough to stretch across the spaces without drooping. But don’t make them too short and tense, either! You want them to have some give for when children bump up or lean against them. [10] X Research source If you’re using synthetic rope, wrap the end you plan to cut in electrical tape and use a hot knife to saw through it. If you don’t have a hot knife, lay the part of the rope you plan to cut on a hot skillet or heat plate. Cutting the rope hot will prevent it from fraying. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "The bungee clips enable you to attach the ropes to the PVC posts. They also make it easier to take the ropes down as needed to change sheets or disassemble the bed for moving. [12] X Research source Keep in mind that these ropes aren’t designed to hold a lot of weight. They function more as decorative pieces than real ring ropes, so don’t allow your child to swing on or bounce off them. Leave one end of the bed free of ropes to allow your child easy access to the bed. Unless, of course, they want to duck underneath them like real wrestlers!"

      "title": "Wrap pipe insulation or foam around each rope and secure it with duct tape.",
      "content": "Wrap pipe insulation or foam around each rope and secure it with duct tape. You can wrap the ropes completely in the duct tape or sew simple vinyl covers. [13] X Research source Pipe insulation comes in tubes that resemble pool noodles. The easiest way to wrap them around the ropes is to cut an opening lengthwise on one side. Then, slide the insulation over the rope and add the duct tape or the cover you sewed. To sew a vinyl or fabric cover, cut out a piece of fabric to the length of the rope when it’s stretched between the PVC pipes on the bed frame. Make it wide enough so that when it’s sewn, it will fit snugly over the insulation or foam wrapping. Stitch it together lengthwise on a sewing machine – by the end, it should look like a very long, narrow sleeve – and then feed it onto the rope. Regardless of how you decide to cover the rope, remember to choose a fun color! Red, blue, or black are traditional WWE ring rope hues."

      "content": "Paint or print the WWE emblem on a white fitted sheet. Place it on the mattress, so it resembles the white floor of the official WWE wrestling rings and looks more authentic. Add a black bed skirt to the bed frame to make it look like a stage. Now your kid has all the most important elements of a miniature wrestling ring! Paint the boards black to help them blend in with the posts. This will heighten the illusion that the mattress is resting on a stage instead of a normal, boring bed frame! Hang posters of your child’s favorite WWE champions on the wall. Choose from the current roster of fighters, including Cody Rhodes, Mysterio, Liv Morgan, and Nix Jax. You can also opt for classic wrestler legends like Hulk Hogan and The Rock! [14] X Research source"
