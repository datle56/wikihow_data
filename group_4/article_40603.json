      "content": "Choose a name for your organization. Although each state has its own set of regulations, you can expect 3 general rules to apply: The name cannot be the same as the name of any other corporation on file with the state's corporations division. About half of all states require the name to end with a corporate designator, such as Corporation (Corp.), Incorporated (Inc.) or Limited (Ltd.). Your name cannot contain certain designations reserved for the state, such as United States, Reserve, Federal, National, Cooperative or Bank."

Ask to see if the name is available or if it is already taken. If the name is available, then you can usually pay a small fee that will reserve the name for you until you've filed your Articles of Incorporation. If the name is taken, then create another name."

The mission statement is a concise expression that covers in one or two sentences the name of the organization, what it does, for whom it performs services and where it dispenses service. It should also portray how your organization is distinct from others like it. Make your mission statement compelling. It will be used in all published materials, funding requests and public relations handouts. Use some of these mission statements as examples: \"The mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment.\" \"The National Mental Health Association is dedicated to promoting mental health, preventing mental disorders and achieving victory over mental illnesses through advocacy, education, research and service.\" \"The National Consumer Supporter Technical Assistance Center's purpose is to strengthen consumer organizations by providing technical assistance in the forms of research, informational materials, and financial aid.\" \"The mission of Texas Mental Health Consumers is to organize, encourage, and educate mental health consumers in Texas. TMHC supports and promotes the mental health recovery process through peer directed and operated services, advocacy, economic development, and participation in public mental health policy design.\""

      "content": "File Articles of Incorporation. Articles of Incorporation are official statements that you are creating an organization, and they are filed with a state's corporations office. Articles of Incorporation protect both board and staff from legal liabilities incurred by the organization, making the corporation the holder of debts and liabilities instead of placing responsibility with the individuals and officers who work for the organization. The specific requirements governing how to incorporate are determined by each state. You can obtain the information you need to proceed with this step from your state Attorney General’s office or your Secretary of State's office. These official documents may have different names in different states. For example, you may see names like \"corporate charter,\" \"trust instrument\" or \"articles of association.\" Before you spend any money, consider consulting with an attorney who is experienced in the area of nonprofit law. This step will help you to avoid many major mistakes that people make when they try to incorporate without legal representation."

Regardless of whether or not you have employees, nonprofits are required to obtain a federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), which is also referred to as the federal ID number. This number is used to identify the organization when tax documents are filed and is used not unlike an individual’s Social Security number. If you received your number prior to incorporation, you will need to apply for a new number under the corporate name. Ask for Form SS-4 when applying for your EIN."

Someone who's never worked with a 501c3 may not have the experience to handle the nuances of the process. Make sure that you feel comfortable with the person. The person should be reliable, should listen to your concerns and should respond to requests as soon as possible. Choose a firm that matches the size of your nonprofit. If you're a small 501c3, then choose a CPA who works alone or a small firm. For large nonprofits, choose a large firm with a good reputation. Take time to make your choice. Look for referrals and references and interview different candidates so that you make the best choice from a pool of available accountants. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Develop an accounting system in partnership with your CPA. Nonprofits are accountable to the public, their funders (contributors), and, in some instances, government granting bodies. You have to establish a system of controls (checks and balances) when establishing the organization’s accounting practices. Make sure that your system meets both your current and your anticipated future needs. The organization needs to open a bank account and decide whether to use the accrual or cash method of accounting. The difference between the two types of accounting is when revenues and expenses are recorded. In cash basis accounting, revenues are recorded when cash is actually received and expenses are recorded when they are actually paid (no matter when they were actually invoiced). In accrual basis accounting, income is reported in the fiscal period it is earned, regardless of when it is received, and expenses are deducted in the fiscal period they are incurred, whether they are paid or not."

Each state has regulations that determine the minimum size of the board, which is typically 3, 5 or 7, but the optimum number of people who sit on the board should be determined by the needs of the organization. Based on what your organization would like to accomplish, you should decide what special skills and qualities you will require of the individuals on your board. Identify qualified individuals who are supportive of your mission and are willing to give of their talents and time. Include the community at large, not just your specific community of focus (e.g. the mental health community). Consider the religious community, local service clubs, legal professionals and colleges and universities as sources for a prospective Board of Directors. Do not overload people who already serve on many committees so that you can seek a balance between old and new leadership."
