Wait a second to see how your date reacts to you leaning in before starting the kiss. [2] X Research source If your date leans in as well, then you can go for the kiss. The key is looking for a window of opportunity to arise. A lot of times, this happens when the other person is making deep eye contact with you and leaning in. However, if your date doesn’t lean in or turns away from you, it’s a good idea not to kiss at that moment. Don’t take it personally, your date might not be ready emotionally for a kiss."
