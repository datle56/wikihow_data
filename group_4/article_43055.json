Use a firm grip, similar to how you'd shake someone's hand. That gives them a chance to take the hint and leave you alone without drawing too much attention to the situation.

Loudly say, “Stop touching me!” so that other people around you will hear. Do not be embarrassed. It’s the creep who’s touching you that should be embarrassed! [2] X Research source You can also say something like, \"I don't feel comfortable being touched,\" or \"I didn't give you permission to touch me.\" [3] X Expert Source Collette Gee Relationship Coach & Certified Violence Prevention Specialist Expert Interview. 1 May 2020. If it is someone young and they say something like, “I was just joking, chill out,” don’t pay any attention to that. A joke is only a joke if both people are laughing. Just say, “It wasn’t funny and I won’t let you treat me like that.” Then walk away. [4] X Research source"

You have every right to feel that way and communicating that will show the offender that you mean business. Don’t be afraid to yell at the person or to say something like, “Stop it, that’s disgusting!” [5] X Research source If you know the person, you might be afraid to confront them because you don't want to make things awkward. But it's the person touching you without your permission who is making things awkward! Don't ever worry about upsetting someone who is disrespecting you. You have every right to be upset and you need to communicate this. You can say something like, \"Stop! You have no right to treat me that way!\" or \"Don't do that!\" or \"Stop it! I don't like that!\""

If the person keeps his hand on you, push him away and loudly say, “Get off me!” If you are loud, someone nearby will overhear what is happening and hopefully they will intervene. By pushing him away, you should create distance to allow yourself to get away. [6] X Research source If the person is a friend, it's time to get new friends! Friends have to respect one another and this person clearly does not! To end a disrespectful friendship, you can say something like, \"I don't like the way you treat me and I will not allow you to be a part of my life anymore.\" Then look for friends who are kind to you."

The person will be less likely to continue trying to touch you if you are surrounded by others. [7] X Research source If you are at school, go tell a teacher immediately. You could say, \"Ms. Anderson, I need to talk to you. Jerad was touching me inappropriately and he wouldn't stop.\" This isn't tattling; this is defending yourself against someone harming you. If you are near your house, run home and tell your parents or another adult right away. You could say, \"Mom, this creepy guy started touching me in the park.\""

You could tell the police, “I was riding on bus 44 at 2:00pm and this creepy guy kept groping me and wouldn’t stop.” [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Talk ahead of time. It can be uncomfortable to bring up a conversation about what forms of intimacy you are comfortable with, but it is much better to do this early rather than while you are kissing. If you know that you aren’t ready for certain forms of intimacy, find a time to bring it up so that there aren’t any surprises. Sometime while you’re hanging out, if there isn’t much to do, simply start a conversation by saying, “Hey, could we talk about something?” You could say something like, “I’ve been having a lot of fun with you, but before things move forward in our relationship, I wanted to talk about our physical relationship. There are certain things that I am ready for and certain things that I am uncomfortable with. Do you mind if we talk about it?” It’s ok if you feel a bit awkward bringing this up. It can be difficult to discuss these matters. You could even acknowledge that you feel a little awkward by saying something like, “I’m not really sure how to bring this up, but I wanted to talk to you about our physical relationship.” Or you could say something like, “There’s something I’ve been wanting to talk to you about. It’s a little awkward, but I was hoping we could discuss it anyway.” You could then start the conversation by saying, “There are certain forms of touch that I enjoy, but other kinds make me uncomfortable.” Decide ahead of time what is ok with you. Maybe you are ok with hand holding and cuddling, but aren’t ready for him to touch your breasts. Decide this before talking to him to make sure that you aren’t pushed out of your comfort zone by what he is ready for."

      "content": "Move his hand away. If your boyfriend is touching you in a way you don’t like, you can start by simply moving his hand away. Maybe he just wanted to try something or got a little carried away. By moving his hand, you are giving him a clear signal that you aren’t comfortable. You can simply move his hand from the area that you don’t like him touching and put it somewhere that you are comfortable with. For example, if he is touching your butt and you don’t like this, move his hand to your hip if you are more comfortable with that, or simply hold his hand in yours. He should get the hint and know to slow down. When moving his hand away you can make eye contact with him, shake your head, and say, “Not yet.” This will clearly communicate that you aren’t ready to be touched like that. You should not have to do this more than once. If he keeps trying, you need to tell him to stop. Instead of moving his hand away, you could move yourself away by scooting over. If you're sitting on the couch together and he's touching you in an uncomfortable way, just scoot further away from him. He should get the message that you didn't like being touched."

Anytime a boy touches you in a way that you are not comfortable with, tell him to stop right away. It can be as simple as saying something like, “Hey, not now” or “I’m not ready for that.” You could even just say, “Please don’t do that. You’re making me uncomfortable.” Your boyfriend needs to respect you and move at a pace that you are comfortable with. If he cares about you, he will stop right away and wait until you are both ready. [10] X Research source Make sure you stay firm when doing this, or else he might think that you were just flirting or being cute. Make it clear that you aren’t playing “hard to get,” but you’re genuinely uncomfortable. You can even tell him, “I don’t like that.”"

      "content": "Explain your reasons. You can explain to your boyfriend what you are feeling so that he understands. You could say, “I really like you, but I feel uncomfortable when you touch me because I’m not ready for that yet.” Maybe you would like him to touch you someday, but it’s moving too fast. You could say something like, “I need more time to be comfortable with that. Let’s slow down.” When he hears that you are genuinely uncomfortable, he should immediately stop pushing it and slow down. Explain to him where you’re at so that he knows why he is making you uncomfortable. You could say something like, “This is my first time being in a relationship, so I’m not comfortable being touched yet.” Don’t be afraid to express how you feel. Just because you are uncomfortable being touched, doesn’t mean you don’t care about him. It just means you aren’t ready for that, and that is perfectly acceptable. You can say something like, “I care about you a lot, but I’m not comfortable being touched like that yet.”"

If you don’t like one way that he touches you, but like other forms of touching, clarify that and let him know what you do enjoy. You could say something like, “I enjoy holding hands and I like it when you put your arm around my shoulder because I feel close to you.” It is important to communicate not only what you don’t like, but also what you do like. This will show him what he can do to make you comfortable while building your relationship."

Any touching in a relationship must be agreed to by both people. At this point, you need to get distance from him. Get up and walk away. If he asks what you are doing, you could say, “I told you to stop and you didn’t listen. I’m out of here!” and walk out the door. Don’t stick around to argue about it. You don’t owe him an explanation. He owes you a huge apology. [11] X Research source"

You could tell a parent, older sibling, teacher, coach, religious leader, or counselor. If this happened at school, the boy should be suspended. [12] X Research source If it happened outside of school, the boy’s parents need to be involved. If he went even further than touching, law enforcement agencies may need to be involved. Make sure to reach out for help. It is not your job to deal with this alone. The fault is solely on the boy who mistreated you; none of it is your fault. If you aren’t sure how to start the conversation, find a time alone with the adult and say, “Could we talk about something? I’ve been having problems in a relationship.” Then tell the adult what happened and ask for help. You could say, “My boyfriend started touching me in a way I was uncomfortable with, and when I asked him to stop, he wouldn’t listen.”"

If you want to say something, you could tell him, “This is over because you disrespected me and I won’t stand for that. Bye!” It's his own fault; he had several chances to stop, and you should never be with someone who doesn't listen to you. [13] X Research source If you stick with him and don't deal with it now, you will have problems in the relationship later and will continue to be mistreated.

Please stop.” [14] X Research source"
