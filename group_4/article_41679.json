It won't do much to give your hair extra volume, but it will protect your hair from heat damage, and prevent it from turning brittle and dry. Be sure to focus the heat protectant on the ends of your hair, which tend to get damaged the easiest. [1] X Expert Source Danielle Chiz Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 August 2021."

      "content": "Start with a small section of hair, close to your hair line. Take a small, 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) section of hair, and clamp your iron over it, as close as you can to your scalp without burning yourself."

      "title": "Pull the iron upwards and away.",
      "content": "Pull the iron upwards and away. Instead of pulling the iron straight down, pull it upwards towards the ceiling by a few inches/centimeters. When you get halfway across your hair, pull the iron away from your head. Pulling the iron upwards helps create volume, while pulling it away makes it easier on your arm. If your hair is too hot for you to touch, use a hairbrush to handle it. It might also be a good sign that your hair straightener is set to too high of a temperature; you might want to lower the temperature a little."

Once it is cool to the touch, carefully pull the brush out of your hair. At this point, you can move onto the next section. If your hair is very fine, consider giving it a quick spray with a lightweight hairspray before moving on. Save power by turning your hairdryer off while you wait for your hair to cool."

      "content": "Run a paddle brush through your hair, then pass a hair straightener through it, if necessary. If you are happy with this look, you are done and can go about your day. If your hair isn't straight enough for you, pass a hair straightener through the ends and the upper layers. Pull the hair straightener through your hair using an upwards motion rather than straight down. This will help create extra volume. Here are some more pointers on straightening your hair: For even more volume: roll your hair up in a round brush or thermal styling brush, about 1Â½ to 2 inches (3.81 to 5.08 centimeters) away from your scalp. Keep the brush in your hair until your hair cools before pulling it out. Pass your hair straightener through your hair, right under the brush, while unrolling it to make your hair even straighter."
