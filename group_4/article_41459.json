It is through bites and scratches from her fellow kittens that she learns what hurts and how to kill things. [1] X Research source Cat Behavior and Training. Ackermann. Publ: TFH Publications. If a kitten is deprived of this early experience, for example if she is hand-reared, or a lone kitten, then she is less likely to have a concept of what is painful and what isn’t."

      "content": "Be aware that a kitten will chase and bite your feet because she is dealing with her natural hunting instincts. It is a kitten’s natural instinct to chase anything that moves in training for hunting prey (even though she will most likely never have to hunt). As she reaches around twelve weeks of age instinct tells her to bite prey to kill it. Eventually, the scenario arises where she chases moving objects, such as human feet or hands, and then bites them. Unfortunately, the kitten’s behavior can be reinforced by the reaction of her victim. You are bitten and react with fear, it reinforces your young cat’s instinct to chase and bite her quarry."

      "content": "Tire your kitten out by playing games with a toy on a string to keep yourself safe from bites. Kittens are geared for bursts of wild energy and this is when they lose their inhibitions about biting. The trick is to channel this energy safely away from your hands and feet, by getting the kitten to play vigorous games of chase with a toy on a string. Tire her out with the toy while keeping your hands and feet at a safe distance. [2] X Research source A kitten can normally play in bursts for 5 to 10 minutes and then she will have to stop and lie down. Only pet her once she is calm again, and then reward this calm behavior with small food treats."

Pulling her out from under a bed will only intensify feelings of fear and reinforce that she is right to be frightened. [6] X Research source Cat Behavior and Training. Ackermann. Publ: TFH Publications. If your kitten is hiding because she got scared, place some food or a treat within her reach and leave the room. When she perceives the threat has gone, she will then have a reason to come out that will also reward her ‘bravery’ for coming out of her hiding place."

      "content": "Try to build a relationship between your kitten and children. As odd as this may sound, kittens and children can have a hard time getting along. This is because children have a hard time understanding that kittens need to be handled gently, and don’t always like to be picked up. If your kitten is frightened of children, help her get over these feelings. You can do this by: Teaching your kids to be gentle with the kitten. You can do this by modeling gentle and appropriate petting and playing behavior. Explain in simple terms how to touch the kitten, e.g., “Hand flat when you pet the cat!” or “Use nice, soft touches, like this.” Praise your kids when they pet and play with the kitten appropriately. Having your children give treats to the kitten. This will help the kitten learn to associate your kids with good things. Feeding the kitten in one half of the room, while the kids sit in the other half of the room and ignore her. Explain to your children that they should never disturb the kitten when she is eating because she might see them as a threat. By learning that the children are not a threat (to herself or to her food), she will gradually view them with less fear and begin to associate them with nice things (like eating food). Always supervising your kids around the kitten, and intervening if necessary."

When a kitten becomes aroused to the point of attack but cannot to do anything about it so she redirects her pent up emotion to the next closest thing. Often this is the person who disturbs her, and she lashes out and bites. For example, if your cat sees a bird out the window but can’t attack because there is a window pane in the way, she may redirect her anger to the next thing that moves or disturbs her, like your foot."
