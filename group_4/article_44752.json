For example, if the chemicals are giving off fumes or if the victim is in danger of getting splashed with more of the chemical, then remove the victim to another room or go outside. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Always take precautions to protect yourself when tending to someone who has received a chemical burn. For example, you may need to wear long sleeves, gloves, a mask, goggles, or other protective gear to prevent yourself from receiving a similar injury. If there are any dry chemicals left on the victim's skin, then brush these chemicals off before irrigating the area."

      "title": "Wash the burn thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash the burn thoroughly. If you receive a burn from a chemical, you should first dilute the chemical compound. This is the best thing you can do to treat a chemical burn right away. To do this, flush the burn and the surrounding areas of skin with copious amounts of water. The water should be cool. Let the water run over the burn for 15 minutes or more. [3] X Research source Don't use a high pressure stream of water to wash the skin. Too much water pressure can make the chemical burn worse by driving the chemical deeper into the skin. Just use light irrigation by holding the wound under a gentle stream of water and keep it there for a long time. Some chemical burns should not be treated with immediate irrigation. These include dry lime, elemental metals such as sodium, and phenol. This is because combining these chemicals with water causes a harmful exothermic (heat-producing) reaction and/or releases hazardous byproducts. For chemicals in the eyes, remove contact lenses and use an eyewash. These are found in locations where corrosive chemicals are common, including laboratories and industrial areas. To use one, place the face over the eyewash and turn the water on. The water will spray the face and enter the eyes."

If you know what the compound was that burned you, have that information ready. The operator can provide treatment advice that is specific to the chemical that burned you. If you don't know what chemical burned you, you should still call poison control. The operators can ask questions to determine with a reasonable certainty what the chemical might be. If your burn is serious and you are taken to a hospital before you can call the poison control center, you should make sure that you have someone at the hospital call so you can find out how to proceed. The doctor will know the basics of how to treat your burn, but the poison control center can give you a more specific idea. This information is invaluable as some compounds may need to be left open to air while others require an occlusive dressing.

It will no longer be red but will appear white, which shows that there has been damage to your blood vessels that is impairing circulation. It will not hurt because the nerves are also damaged so you cannot feel pain. There may or may not be blisters. Healing will occur but it will take longer than two weeks and will likely scar.
