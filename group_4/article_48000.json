      "title": "Even if you don’t act on it, you might desire to have sex with them.",
      "content": "Even if you don’t act on it, you might desire to have sex with them. One of the most obvious signs of sexual attraction is arousal. When you feel sexually attracted to someone, you might begin to think about what it’d be like to have sex with them and might be turned on when thinking about them or seeing them. Even if you haven’t known the person for very long, you can still certainly feel sexually attracted to and aroused by them. You might feel this way when you see a really “hot” celebrity or stranger. Even if you don’t know them personally, you might still feel some kind of sexual attraction toward them. For people who want to know if they may be asexual , it’s common for asexual individuals to feel little or no sexual attraction no matter whom they’re interacting with."

      "content": "You get butterflies in your stomach and get a bit sweaty. If you’ve ever had a crush on someone, you might be familiar with this feeling. Whenever the person you find attractive is near, you might find yourself stumbling over your words or breaking out in a nervous sweat. And if they’re attracted to you, you’ll probably notice them acting in the exact same way. [1] X Research source Your fight-or-flight response is responsible for your sudden jitters and nervous sweating. This is caused by your body releasing the hormone norepinephrine."

      "title": "Sexual attraction causes a rush of dopamine and excitement.",
      "content": "Sexual attraction causes a rush of dopamine and excitement. Dopamine allows you to feel pleasure and satisfaction, and your body releases high amounts of it when you experience attraction. So when you see someone you feel sexually attracted to, you might feel extra happy and excited, and it might feel like you suddenly got an extra boost of energy just from getting a glimpse of them. [2] X Research source You might even feel really excited just hearing their name being mentioned or seeing a picture of them."

      "title": "Various hormones make your pulse quicken when you feel attraction.",
      "content": "Various hormones make your pulse quicken when you feel attraction. Your adrenal gland releases hormones like adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine when you feel attraction, and these can make your heart beat faster and stronger. This is similar to the response your body gives during a fight-or-flight situation since many of the same hormones are involved. [3] X Research source However, it’s also possible for your body to trick you into thinking that you’re sexually attracted to someone. For example, if your heart is pumping after a long run and you happen to see someone good-looking, you might mistake your increased heart rate for sexual attraction. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "You might blush easily and feel hot around them.",
      "content": "You might blush easily and feel hot around them. Blushing is a physical sign of sexual interest that’s hard to hide. If someone you find sexually attractive happens to look your way, you might find yourself easily flushing and feeling a bit hot because it feels like they’ve caught you in the act of thinking about them. [5] X Research source Even though blushing certainly isn’t a bad thing, if you want to avoid blushing around someone you find attractive, make an effort to relax your body. If you’re really nervous and tense around them, you might blush a lot easier."

      "content": "Sexual attraction and arousal can make you behave less rationally. Scientists have found that sexual arousal actually turns off the region of your brain that regulates critical thinking and self-awareness. Thanks to biology, you might find yourself acting more silly around your crush or making a bit of a fool of yourself. But don’t worry, it’s totally natural and everyone’s been there at some point.

      "title": "You’ll go out of your way to brush up against them or hold their hand.",
      "content": "You’ll go out of your way to brush up against them or hold their hand. When you find someone sexually attractive, you might find yourself making up excuses to get close to them and share a friendly touch here and there. You might put your hand on their shoulder when they make you laugh or insist they hold your hand when you’re walking in a crowded place. Whatever it is, know that sexual attraction makes physical touch feel all the more electric. [7] X Research source To show someone that you’re attracted to them, don’t be afraid to flirt using physical touch . Sit close to them or even give them a hug if you’re both comfortable with that. However, avoid touching someone if you think it’ll make them uncomfortable, and refrain from this kind of flirting in professional settings like your place of work. For someone who identifies as asexual, you may still desire physical contact with this other person, but not in a sexual way. This is known as sensual attraction, and you may just want to hold their hand, hug them, or cuddle with them."

      "title": "Holding someone’s gaze conveys your interest in them.",
      "content": "Holding someone’s gaze conveys your interest in them. When you feel sexually attracted to someone, you often only have eyes for them. You might make more of an effort to maintain eye contact with them to show them that you’re interested in them and find them attractive. This might also be your way of encouraging them to pay attention to you and notice your interest. [8] X Research source When making eye contact with someone, make sure you maintain a pleasant facial expression to appear more warm and inviting."

      "content": "Sexual arousal can cause your pupils to get bigger. Even though you won’t necessarily be able to feel this sign of sexual attraction, it’s certainly something to look out for in others to see if they’re attracted to you. So next time you talk to someone you like, check to see if their pupils get larger to see if they’re interested in you as well. Of course, sexual arousal isn’t the only thing that can cause someone’s pupils to dilate. Other things like low lighting and feelings of excitement, anxiety, or anger can also be potential causes."

      "content": "The euphoria caused by dopamine makes you extra smiley. All of those giddy and excited feelings you get thanks to the dopamine being released into your body can make it so that you smile a lot more around someone you find attractive. Even if they tell a terrible joke, you might find yourself laughing hysterically anyways and smiling whenever you’re near them. [9] X Research source Smiling is also a great way to make yourself look approachable and friendly to the person you like. Make the other person laugh to get closer to them. Tell them a joke or a funny story, or just let yourself act silly around them to get them to relax and share in your laughter."

You might be fully aware of your feelings of sexual attraction toward another person and flirt as a means to get them to reciprocate your feelings. There are plenty of different ways you might flirt with them, whether it’s through coy jokes or subtle touches here and there. And if they start to flirt back, it’s probably a sign that they feel a similar way about you.

      "content": "You can’t help but check them out whenever they’re around. Scanning someone from head to toe because you find them good-looking is a potential sign that you feel sexually attracted to them. You might even have certain parts of them picked out that you find particularly attractive like their smile or physique. [11] X Research source For asexuals, you might still fixate on another person’s attractive features, but not in a sexual way. This is known as aesthetic attraction, and it’s simply the act of appreciating someone’s objective beauty or good looks."

      "content": "You find yourself thinking about them sexually and non-sexually. They might feature in a sexual dream or fantasy of yours, or you may simply find yourself wondering what they’re doing at random points throughout the day. You might also find it hard not to bring them up during a conversation, and the smallest things might remind you of them.

      "content": "You might make excuses just so you can hang out together. When you feel attracted to someone, the idea of being with them alone probably sounds very appealing. Whether your goal is to get up to some spicier activities or just hang out and get to know each other, your attraction to them might motivate you to find any way to get them all to yourself even if it’s just for a few minutes. [13] X Research source For asexuals, this desire to be alone may be due to feelings of romantic attraction. You may be seeking out time together because you’d like to be romantically involved with them and more exclusive."

While you probably give your close friends and family members a short, sweet hug, you might find yourself lingering just a bit longer when it comes to someone you feel sexually attracted to.

      "title": "You might unconsciously change your voice to sound more attractive.",
      "content": "You might unconsciously change your voice to sound more attractive. Research has found that when two people are interested in each other, the tone and pitch of their voices begin to become similar. You might also notice that the speed at which you talk changes to match up with the person whom you find attractive. This is all usually a completely unconscious change, so you might not even notice it happening. [15] X Research source If you want to know if the other person is interested in you, listen to their voice and see if it changes to mimic your own style of speech."

      "content": "You might unconsciously copy them to form a connection. When you find someone attractive, you might notice that you start to copy their actions, though it’s usually a completely subconscious reaction. When they cross their arms, you do the same. If they touch their hair, you’ll touch your hair as well. Mirroring, as unconscious of a behavior as it might be, also helps build trust between you and the other person. [16] X Research source Mirroring is a good way to flirt using your body language . It’s a subtle way of telling the other person that you have something in common and that you’re interested in them."

      "title": "People might tease you about having a crush.",
      "content": "People might tease you about having a crush. If there’s some sexual tension between you and another person, you might not be the only two who can feel it. If your friends are coming up to you and asking if you like the other person or find them attractive, it’s probably because they can already tell that you’re sexually attracted to them. [17] X Research source In some cases, the people around you might be able to detect your feelings before you do. So if they come up to you asking you about your feelings toward a certain person, take a second to reflect on if you actually do feel sexual attraction toward that person."
