      "content": "Take note of the dog’s general appearance. A dog’s physique will vary widely depending on its breed. However, no dog should appear too thin. [1] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source For example, if you can clearly see where a dog’s bones are below its skin, it may be emaciated. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Since neglected or mistreated dogs are sometimes not adequately fed or are even starved, emaciation can be a sign of prior abuse."

      "content": "Examine the quality of a dog’s fur. Some dogs have short, stiff hair, others have long, soft hair, while still others fall somewhere in between. Whatever breed a dog is, however, its fur should be clean and free from unexplained clumps or tangles. If your dog has overgrown or matted hair, it may indicate that it has been neglected in the past, not cared for or groomed, or perhaps made to live in substandard conditions.

      "content": "Pay attention to any fur loss. If your dog has patchy fur, or if its fur seems to be falling out in clumps, this may be a sign of prior abuse.

      "content": "Notice if the dog’s nails are overgrown. While it may seem like a relatively minor thing, overgrown nails can be a sign that a dog has been abused in the past. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source This condition can indicate that the dog’s previous owner neglected to care for the animal, or that the dog was kept in conditions in which it could not naturally wear down its nails."

      "title": "Watch for untreated skin conditions.",
      "content": "Watch for untreated skin conditions. You should observe a dog’s skin very closely. If you see certain unexplained skin conditions (that is, you don’t know how they came about), these may indicate that the dog was abused physically or did not receive adequate veterinary care in the past. These signs include: [7] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Scabs Wounds Bumpy skin Scaly skin Burns"

[9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source While there are other reasons a dog (even one that is well-cared for) can become a host to one or more of these parasites, a serious, unexplained infestation might indicate mistreatment, especially if there are other signs of possible abuse."

      "title": "Know what kind of behavior to expect.",
      "content": "Know what kind of behavior to expect. Be careful not to assume that all unusual behavior is a sign of abuse. For instance, dogs that are adjusting to new homes may express certain behaviors (anxiety, excessive chewing, whining, etc.) because they are excited or nervous. Likewise, a dog at a shelter that seems nervous, frightened, or aggressive might not necessarily have been abused.Instead, the dog might not be used to being around so many dogs, or to being confined. All dogs need a period of time to be socialized and to adjust to new settings. If you are thinking about adopting a dog, try to observe it in a quiet place first. This can give you a better idea of its normal behavior, and help you decide if it is likely to have been abused in the past."

      "content": "Observe how the dog moves. Sometimes, past abuse can leave no obvious signs on a dog’s skin or fur. However, if you notice lameness or difficulty moving, this can indicate that the dog was injured in the past due to physical abuse.

However, breeds that are used for dog fighting and security are more likely to have suffered abuse or neglect. This includes breeds such as pit bulls and Rottweilers.
