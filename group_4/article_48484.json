      "content": "Wheat pennies are valuable and generally worth between $10-$200. Wheat pennies generally rank very high among coin collectors when it comes to demand. In fact, some coin enthusiasts might say they’re the single most popular coin for collectors. [1] X Research source While especially common or damaged wheats aren’t worth much, many Lincoln wheat pennies are worth $10-20 or even $100-200! [2] X Research source Are wheat pennies rare? No, and that’s part of why they’re so popular to collect. They aren’t like 1797 Brasher Doubloons where the coins are so obscure you can’t even find them, but they also aren’t so common (like, say, a Kennedy half dollar ) to the point that they aren’t worth anything. They’re right in that sweet spot of valuable and easy to collect. Why is it called a “wheat” penny? On the back of the coin, Lincoln pennies say “ONE CENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.” Framing that lettering are two stalks of wheat. Ergo, the “wheat” penny!"

If you see “VDB,” your coin’s value just increased exponentially. These are the initials of the coin’s designer, Victor D. Brenner. He designed and sculpted the wheat penny, but chose to include his initials in the die. Americans were upset he took up such prominent space on the coin, and his initial design was altered shortly thereafter. [5] X Research source There are three basic variants of the VDB penny: 1909-P VDB 1909-S VDB 1909-P Proof VDB"

      "content": "Wheat pennies aren’t unlike other rare coins when it comes to the factors that impact their pricing. In general, you’re looking at the following elements: Rarity. The fewer copies there are of a given coin, the more likely it is that the coin fetches a premium. Provenance. Provenance refers to the historical record of an artifact. If you can track exactly where the coin has been in the past, it increases the overall value. Condition. The quality of the coin matters a lot. A mint or uncirculated copy will be worth more than a worn-out or weathered variant. Errors. Unique printing errors typically increase a coin’s value, and that’s absolutely the case with wheat pennies. Historical Importance. If the coin is tied to a distinct moment in history, or if there’s some fascinating historical reason for the coin’s existence (like 1943-44 steel wheats), it will generally earn more at auction."

Only 28 million pennies were made with these initials, so if you have one, you own a piece of rare history! [6] X Research source Value: Around $150,000. The non-proof version of these coins are worth around $12 on the low end, and $375 for more pristine mints. What’s the difference between proof and non-proof coins? Proofs are minted on a polished die, which creates a mirror-like finish you don’t see in non-proof coins. [7] X Research source"
