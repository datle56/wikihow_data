      "content": "Part and inspect your dog's fur. Examine more closely the problem area you have identified. Hot spots can be difficult to see with the naked eye because they tend to spread under the cover of the dog's fur. Usually by the time you notice them, hot spots are well established and growing rapidly.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show.

      "content": "Identify that you are dealing with a hot spot. Hot spots are red, moist, hot and irritated rashes. Other identifiers of hot spots include discharge and an unpleasant odor. [3] X Research source Hot spots are commonly found on a dog's head, hip or chest area, but they can be found pretty much anywhere. Dogs with long hair and thick coats are most commonly affected. Dogs who are not groomed regularly and have matted coats are also prone to developing hot spots, as are dogs who swim or are frequently in the rain. Dogs with hip dysplasia or anal sac disease are also more likely to suffer from hot spots because they tend to lick the skin on their hind end."

      "content": "Check areas surrounding the hot spot. If you do identify a hot spot, take some time to carefully check the rest of the dog’s skin. Part the fur in the area surrounding the hot spot and examine for any other moist or reddened areas. All spots need to be treated immediately and, if possible, you should try to ascertain the underlying cause of the hot spot (flea bite, scratch, allergy, etc.). [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Trim or clip the hair from the surface of the hot spot. Exposing the hot spot to air will dry out the moisture and help speed up the healing process. Be careful not to pull the hair, irritate the skin or cut your dog's skin. [5] X Research source Disinfect your scissors or clippers before clipping. In cases where there is a lot of discharge emerging from the hot spot, you will need to clean your clippers frequently while removing hair. Otherwise, the clippers will become plugged with debris. Remember to clean and disinfect the instrument after use. [6] X Research source Have your dog sit or lie down for this process. Get a second person if you need help keeping the dog still. To avoid accidentally cutting your dog's skin, don't cut too close to the skin itself and instead leave a quarter inch of stubble. [7] X Research source If the affected area is too large, shave it.

      "content": "Stop the itch with an antibiotic. The best way to relieve itching is with an antibiotic prescribed by your vet. Your vet may prescribe a cream antibiotic that is applied directly to the skin in order to quickly and directly relieve the itching. [18] X Research source Hydrocortisone spray can help reduce the irritation, but should not be used long term. Antihistamines such as Benadryl may also provide some relief. The appropriate dosage is 1 tablet per 50 pounds. Avoid putting creams intended for humans onto your dog's skin, as this can make matters worse. Creams keep moisture in the area, and the spot needs to dry completely before it can heal."

      "content": "Use an Elizabethan collar if your dog keeps licking or biting the lesions. The cone-shaped collar will restrain your dog's reach, making him unable to further irritate the wound. [19] X Research source An Elizabethan collar should not be used as the sole means of treatment for hot spots. Collars don't treat the hot spots but prevent your dog from making the lesions more severe. Untreated lesions will only grow and become more serious, in addition to being painful for your dog. You can wrap a sock around one of the dog's rear feet and tape it into place if the hot spot can be scratched by a rear foot."
