      "content": "Determine the correct threading order. Most sergers use four spools of thread: two for looping underneath the needles and two to use in the needles. The model you have will tell you the order in which you thread them. Look at the threading diagram on your machine. [1] X Research source A 3-thread machine has an upper looper, lower looper and a single needle thread."

      "content": "Thread the upper looper. Pull the upper looper thread up so that it is just below the needles. Remove the faceplate on the machine's front and pull the thread through the metal loops underneath the plate. Your serger will most likely have a color-coded guide to help you thread the upper looper."

      "content": "Inspect the looped thread. You should have an idea of how your stitch should look by looking in your serger’s user manual. The loops and interlocking stitches should be even, without areas that are too even or too loose. If the stitches are loose, adjust the tension dials next to each spool of thread on the overlock sewing machine to make the thread tighter. If the fabric is puckered or bunched up, loosen the tension on the serger."

Always do a practice stitch whenever you change your needle, thread, or any other part of the machine. That way, you can make sure that everything is in place and working properly."
