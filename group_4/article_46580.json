      "content": "Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using an internal condom. Before you commit to using an internal condom, you should be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of using it instead of another form of birth control. Here are the pros and cons of using an internal condom: [1] X Research source Advantages : The internal condom does not require a prescription and is therefore pretty easy to get. You can find it in most drugstores and some supermarkets. Internal condoms let people share the responsibility for preventing infection. Unlike the birth control pill, the internal condom doesn't have an effect on a person's natural hormones. (Though it may be used along with birth control pills for extra prevention, of course.) It can stay in place even if a partner loses their erection. It can enhance your sexual experience. The external ring can stimulate the clitoris during vaginal intercourse. It is made with polyurethane instead of latex and can therefore be used by people with a latex allergy. It can be inserted up to a few hours before intercourse -- and remember that you can use the bathroom while the condom is inserted. Disadvantages : The internal condom may irritate the vagina, vulva, penis, or anus (if it's being used anally). It may slip into the vagina during intercourse. It can be a bit tough to insert it, especially at first. Wearing the internal condom can create a louder noise during sex, though this can be controlled with more lubricant."

      "title": "Understand how an internal condom works.",
      "content": "Understand how an internal condom works. The condom works like a male condom but it's inserted into the vagina. It even looks somewhat like a large external condom, except it has a flexible inner ring that will be inserted into the vagina, and an outer ring that will hang about an inch from the vagina. Once the condom is inserted, the person can insert their penis into the condom. When they ejaculate into the condom, it should be removed. [2] X Research source The female condom can be effectively inserted into the vagina or the anus, and the method for insertion is very similar. Remember that if you are wearing a female condom, the male should not wear a condom. This will create friction that can cause one or both of the condoms to tear."

      "content": "Examine the package of a female condom. Before you use the female condom, check the expiration date on the package to make sure that you can still use it.

      "title": "Practice using the female condom.",
      "content": "Practice using the female condom. Though female condoms typically cost around $4 per condom and can only be used once, you should practice using the condom on your own instead of using it for the first time right before sex. Though inserting the condom is easy once you get the hang of it, you should try it on your own at least once or twice to make sure that you can get it right when the time comes."

[4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Using spermicides along with the female condom can further reduce your risk of pregnancy. Though the female condom will already be lubricated, extra lubricant can make it easier to insert and use the condom."

      "title": "Find a comfortable position.",
      "content": "Find a comfortable position. [5] X Research source To insert the female condom, you'll have to find a position that works for you. It's just like inserting a tampon -- you have to get comfortable and have access to your vagina before you can insert the condom. You can try squatting on the ground, laying down, or placing one foot on top of a chair."

[8] X Research source Once it reaches the cervix, it will naturally expand and you won't be able to feel it anymore.

      "title": "Have sex.",
      "content": "Have sex. It's normal for the female condom to move from side to side once you're having sex. As long as the inner ring is still inserted and your man's penis is in the condom, you're good to go. If his penis has slipped out or the condom has come loose, you can comfortably reinsert it as long as the man hasn't ejaculated yet. Once the man ejaculates, you can remove and throw out the female condom. [12] X Research source If you hear a loud noise because of the condom during sex, you can apply more lubricant."
