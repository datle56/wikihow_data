      "content": "Sometimes, we tell white lies to avoid making someone upset. If your boyfriend lies to you about something little, like whether or not he likes the sweater you bought him, he might just be trying to save your feelings. Lies like these aren’t malicious, but they aren’t totally necessary, either. If you want your boyfriend to be honest with you, tell him that you don’t mind if your feelings get hurt a little bit as long as he’s honest with you. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source If he’s trying not to hurt your feelings, he might give short answers or try to change the subject quickly. You might say something like, “Hey babe, do you actually like the sweater I got you? You can be honest—I want to make sure it’s something you really like so I know what to get you in the future.”"

      "content": "People often lie about things they don’t like about themselves. Maybe your boyfriend says he gave up cigarettes, but he secretly smokes them before bed. Or, maybe he’s trying to eat healthier, but he lies about the fast food he picks up on the way home. He’s probably lying because he doesn’t like what he’s doing, and he knows you wouldn’t like it, either. [3] X Research source You might be able to tell he’s hiding something if he acts defensive toward a seemingly innocent question. You can talk with your boyfriend about his bad habits in a non-accusatory way. For instance, you might say, “I noticed that you’ve been eating fast food again, even though you said you wouldn’t. Were you scared to tell me because you thought I might be disappointed?”"

      "content": "People often lie because they don’t want to deal with any consequences. If your boyfriend did something that he knows you’re going to be angry about, he might lie to you about it so you two don’t fight. He might be doing this because he doesn’t like confrontation or he just doesn't know how to handle negative emotions. You can talk to him about it by saying something like: [4] X Research source “I need you to be honest with me, even if you think I might be angry. Our relationship has to be built on trust, and right now, I don’t feel like I can trust you.”"

      "content": "In healthy relationships, partners are allowed to have privacy from each other. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it can become an issue if he continuously lies about things he doesn't want you to find out. [5] X Expert Source Maria Avgitidis Dating Coach Expert Interview. 20 December 2019.

      "title": "Your boyfriend might assume that he has to lie to you, too.",
      "content": "Your boyfriend might assume that he has to lie to you, too. When people have traumatic childhoods, they are sometimes punished for telling the truth or not taken seriously. If that’s the case, your boyfriend might have picked up a habit of lying from when he was younger, and he might just be doing it because he’s done it for a long time. [7] X Research source You can approach your boyfriend about this by saying something like, “I know you had to lie a lot when you were little, and that wasn’t fair to you. However, it’s not fair to me to keep lying all the time, either.” Trauma like this can be tough to work through without professional help. If this is your boyfriend’s issue, he may benefit from therapy."

      "content": "People sometimes lie to make their own lives sound better. If your boyfriend tells you a lie that makes his life seem awesome (how much money he makes, how well he’s doing at his job, how many friends he has), he might be saying it because he wishes it was true. This doesn’t excuse the lie, but at least you know it didn’t come from a malicious place. You can talk to him about a lie like this by saying, “Do you think you were dishonest about your job status because you wish you had a high-paying job? I can understand where you’re coming from, but I think it’s important that we tell each other the truth.”"

      "content": "People sometimes lie so they can control the narrative of their own life. If something doesn’t fit that narrative, they might bend the truth until it fits in. For instance, your boyfriend might get in a fight with his parents, but he doesn’t tell you about it because he wants to appear like he has a great relationship with them. This is another example of when lying isn’t malicious, but it can still be harmful. You could talk to him about this by saying, “I know it can feel embarrassing to tell me things like this, but I’m your partner. I tell you everything about my life, even the stuff that I don’t feel great about.”"

      "content": "Your boyfriend may lie about his debt or his income. If that’s the case, it’s probably because he feels embarrassed by his money issues and he doesn’t want you to know about them. He might also lie about money because he thinks you might reject him if you knew the truth. Money is an important thing to talk about with a partner, especially if you are serious or you plan on being serious. Sit your boyfriend down and talk about his money issues to get everything out into the open. [8] X Research source You might say something like, “I know money is a taboo subject for some people, but I think it’s important to talk about this. I’ve been honest about my finances; can you do the same?”"

      "content": "Unfortunately, people often lie about what they’re addicted to. No matter what he’s spending his time doing, he may lie to you to keep it from you so he can keep doing it. People also lie about their addictions out of shame, which could also be a factor. If you decide to confront your boyfriend about an addiction, keep in mind that he may need professional help to stop completely. You could say something like, “Honey, I love you, but I can’t watch you do this to yourself anymore. I think you have a problem, and you need serious help.” Addicts often promise to stop lying, but then go behind your back anyway. Be sure to pay attention to his actions, not his words."
