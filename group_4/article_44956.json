      "content": "Consider cost and space first. A triple monitor setup can cost a lot of money and take up a lot of space. Before you buy any additional monitors, identify any money and space limitations. Monitor cost usually goes up with monitor size, so determine how much space you'll have for your triple monitor setup before you decide what size monitors to get. You may also decide to get a bigger desk or add a second desk to expand your workspace. Look for monitors that fit your needs. If you do a lot of gaming, you might want to splurge on a gaming monitor for your main screen. However, if you mostly do general computing, you can get a cheaper monitor that will still work great for your purposes. Computer and tech specialist Luigi Oppido says to think about the top three things you'll be doing on your computer to figure out what monitors to buy. \"At that point then you're looking at size, you're looking at refresh rate, and you're also looking at inputs,\" Oppido says. Higher refresh rates come at a higher cost, but can help reduce eye strain if you use your computer for many hours at a time. Add your current monitors to your setup, if they're still in good condition. This will help cut down on costs from having to buy three new monitors. If you have a working monitor that you don't want to include in your new setup, consider selling, donating, or giving away your old monitor(s). If you don't want to repurpose the monitor, bring it to an electronics recycling facility instead of throwing it in the trash."

A graphics card that supports multiple displays Display cables (HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, DVI, Thunderbolt, etc.) Get display cables that match the ports on your monitors and your graphics card. Display cable adapters (optional, unless you have older monitors) If you have older monitors that have VGA or DVI ports, you'll almost certainly need some adapters—unless your GPU is also old. You also may want some adapters if, for example, all of your monitors only have HDMI ports but your GPU only has 2 HDMI ports and 1 DisplayPort port. Monitor arms or stands (optional)"

      "title": "All horizontal",
      "content": "All horizontal This is the most common triple monitor setup configuration. All of the monitors are in landscape orientation in a horizontal (or slightly curved) line, with the largest monitor usually in the middle. The monitors may be placed on stands or arms to improve visibility or create more desk space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Two horizontal, one vertical",
      "content": "Two horizontal, one vertical This is another common setup, especially for users who have a monitor dedicated to text-based websites or chat services like Discord, since the vertical monitor makes it easier to read more text at once. The vertical monitor is usually placed on either the left or right side, with the largest monitor in the middle. The monitors may be placed on stands or arms to improve visibility or create more desk space. Note: If you want to put one monitor in a portrait orientation, make sure the monitor's stand allows you to do that. Not all monitors can be rotated that far."

    {
      "title": "One horizontal, two vertical",
      "content": "One horizontal, two vertical The same concept as the configuration above, but two of the monitors are vertical and just one is horizontal. The horizontal monitor is usually in the middle as it's almost always the main monitor."

      "title": "Triangle",
      "content": "Triangle This setup is popular—especially with coders—but it requires owning a monitor arm. Two monitors are on the bottom in landscape orientation, and the third monitor is floated above them with a monitor arm. The bottom two monitors may also be on stands or arms to improve visibility or create more desk space."

      "title": "Square",
      "content": "Square This configuration also has two horizontal monitors and one vertical, but requires a monitor arm. This setup is a bit more aesthetic, but is still very functional. The two horizontal monitors are stacked one on top of the other on a monitor arm, and the vertical monitor is to either the left or right of the horizontal ones. If all the monitors are similar size, they will make a square-ish shape."

      "content": "Disconnected If you are using at least one laptop as a monitor for your triple monitor setup, you'll likely go with a disconnected configuration. This configuration is popular with office workers or professionals who travel or work on the go. There's no one way to set this configuration up. You can place your laptop on a laptop stand to make it easier to see when it's functioning as a computer monitor."

      "content": "Plug the appropriate display cable into each monitor. Make sure to use display cable adapters as needed to account for older monitors or a mismatch in port types. For example, if your monitor has a VGA port but your GPU only has HDMI and DisplayPort ports, you'll need either an HDMI cord and an HDMI to VGA adapter, or you'll need a VGA cord and a VGA to HDMI adapter."

      "title": "Plug each display cable into your GPU.",
      "content": "Plug each display cable into your GPU. Be sure to plug the cables into the ports on your graphics card, not your motherboard. If your motherboard has integrated graphics, you can plug one monitor into the HDMI port on the motherboard. It's best to plug your main monitor into the dedicated graphics card, however, for the best picture quality. Gamers may also notice dropped frames in their games if their side monitor is connected to the motherboard. If you're using a laptop as a monitor you will likely need a USB display adapter, unless your laptop has a display port. Many newer laptops have eschewed display ports (such as HDMI and VGA), but some models may still have them. If you don't have the space to plug each monitor into your computer, you can also try connecting them in a daisy chain . Daisy chaining only works if your GPU and all of your monitors have either DisplayPort or Thunderbolt ports."
