      "content": "Wash your hair when necessary. You may think you need to wash your hair daily, but most hair types only need a wash every other day or a few times a week. Depending on your hair type, wash it when it's dirty, not just out of habit. In general, people with fine, straight hair need to wash more often than people with thick, curly, or wavy hair. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have dry hair , wash it every third day. If your hair is more oily , try washing it every other day; if it looks really oily after just 1 day, wash it every day. If you have normal hair (not super dry and not super oily), wash it every other day or every 3 days. There’s no perfect formula for how much you should wash your hair. Monitor your hair and wash it when you feel it's dirty. Try using dry shampoo between washes to help soak up excess oil."

After you get out of the shower, it can be tempting to run a brush through your hair; however, a wide-tooth comb is the best way to remove any knots post-showering. A brush often snags and pulls your hair, causing it to break and become damaged, so use a comb and start at the bottom of your hair, working your way up.

      "content": "Trim your hair regularly to keep it healthy. Hair is prone to split ends , and if you go long periods of time without cutting your hair, it can look damaged and unhealthy. Try to give your hair a trim every 6 months or so, and if you’re really prone to split ends, trim your hair every 6 weeks. [5] X Research source If visiting a salon frequently is too much trouble or too expensive, trim your hair yourself. Invest in hair-cutting scissors and use a mirror to see the back of your head. It's easiest to trim your hair when it's wet or straight so you can get even ends. If your hair is curly, it’s best to trim it when it’s dry or only slightly wet. Curly hair looks much longer when it’s wet, so it may dry shorter than you expected."
