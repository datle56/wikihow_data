      "content": "Place the bathroom scale in an open area. This will make it easier for you to weigh your luggage. Keep the scale away from walls or furniture so that your luggage won’t be resting on anything. [1] X Research source A good place to do this is in the kitchen or any room with lots of open space."

      "title": "Weigh yourself and write down the measurement.",
      "content": "Weigh yourself and write down the measurement. After turning the scale on, step onto it and wait for the numbers to pop up. Write down the weight on a piece of paper so that you won’t forget it. Step off the scale once you’re finished. [2] X Research source If you know roughly how much you weigh, you can use this number to check to see if the scale is accurate or not. Writing down your weight is important because you’ll need to subtract it from the overall weight later on."

      "title": "Hold your luggage and step back onto the scale.",
      "content": "Hold your luggage and step back onto the scale. Now you’ll weigh yourself while also holding your luggage. Keep all of your weight on the center of the scale, and record this measurement as well. [3] X Research source Wait for the scale to zero out before stepping on it again."

      "title": "Subtract your own weight from the overall weight.",
      "content": "Subtract your own weight from the overall weight. This will leave you with the weight of just your luggage. Do the math in your head, on paper, or using a calculator. [4] X Research source For example, if you weighed 130 lb (59 kg) and the weight of you holding your luggage was 165 lb (75 kg), you would subtract 130 from 165, meaning your luggage weighs 35 lb (16 kg). Check the weight restrictions on your airline’s website to make sure your bag is within the proper range."

      "title": "Prop your luggage up on the scale if it’s too heavy to carry.",
      "content": "Prop your luggage up on the scale if it’s too heavy to carry. If you’re using a huge bag or your luggage weighs too much for you to hold in your arms, place a stool or something similar on the scale. Either zero out your scale so the weight of the stool doesn’t show up, or subtract the weight of the stool from the overall weight after you place your luggage on top. [5] X Research source Flip the stool over so that the flat part is sitting against the scale, placing your luggage in between the legs of the stool or other prop."

      "content": "Purchase a handheld luggage scale to easily weigh your luggage. This is a great idea if you travel often and are constantly weighing your luggage. Handheld luggage scales can be found in big box stores and online, and you can choose from a variety of different kinds, including digital ones. Handheld luggage scales are super small and portable, making it easy for you to bring them with you on your trip. Most airports sell handheld luggage scales as well."

      "title": "Set the scale to zero.",
      "content": "Set the scale to zero. If your scale is digital, press the On button and wait for the numbers to reset to zero. Other scales will need to be zeroed out by using your fingers to move the arrows to zero, pushing them like the arms of a clock. [6] X Research source If your scale isn’t digital, make sure both of the arrows are set to zero. Your scale should come with directions that you can refer to if necessary. Digital scales will likely need batteries installed before they work."

      "title": "Attach your luggage to the scale.",
      "content": "Attach your luggage to the scale. Your scale will be attach to either a hook or a strap. If you’re using a hook, place your luggage handle on the center of the hook so that it’s hanging securely. If you’re using a strap, attach the strap by threading it through the luggage handle and securing the hook. [7] X Research source Try to hang your luggage so that the weight is evenly distributed."

      "title": "Lift the luggage up slowly using two hands for 5-10 seconds.",
      "content": "Lift the luggage up slowly using two hands for 5-10 seconds. If you pull the scale up too quickly, it’s going to register more weight than is necessary. Lift the scale with the luggage attached nice and slowly, trying to keep the luggage as still as possible. [8] X Research source Using both hands will help even out the weight distribution, giving you an accurate measurement."

      "title": "Look at the scale to see how much your luggage weighs.",
      "content": "Look at the scale to see how much your luggage weighs. If you’re using a digital scale, the scale will lock in a measurement once it feels it has an accurate weight, meaning the numbers will stop changing. On other scales, the two hands will move to the number that reads the weight of your luggage. [9] X Research source You may need to wait longer for a digital scale to record an accurate weight, so be patient and keep the luggage as still as possible while you’re holding it. On the regular scales, one hand will return to zero when you put the luggage down, while the other hand will remain on the weight measurement so that you don’t forget it."
