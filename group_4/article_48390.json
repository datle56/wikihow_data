      "content": "Your partner may not understand exactly what you need when you’re upset. Sometimes, your partner might not know how to comfort you in a given moment. Maybe they think you need advice or “tough love” when you really just need a listening ear. Maybe your partner has low emotional intelligence or wasn’t taught how to identify and express emotions in their childhood, making it difficult for them to understand your needs. [1] X Research source Your partner may even come from a cultural background where emotional support and expression was viewed and treated in a very different way than what you are used to."

      "content": "You may have a different coping style than your partner. Everyone has different coping styles, but if you and your partner’s coping styles differ greatly, then it may be difficult to innately understand each other’s needs. For example, some people deal with emotions by distancing themselves from others, while others want to engage and talk out their feelings immediately. If your partner acts like they’re avoiding you, it may genuinely be their way of coping, so it doesn’t mean they don’t care or don’t want to comfort you.

      "content": "Your partner may feel overwhelmed by your emotional distress. Some people struggle when others become emotional. Your partner may be upset by seeing someone they love (you!) in emotional distress. They might feel helpless, anxious, or overwhelmed by how to help you and fix the situation. Sometimes, these feelings may cause your partner to withdraw instead of engaging with and comforting you. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Your partner may have had negative past experiences when comforting someone. If your partner had a past experience where they tried to comfort someone and it went poorly, they may be reluctant to comfort you now. For instance, maybe your partner’s ex would act very hostile or withdraw when they tried to comfort them. That experience may have made your partner fearful or anxious about saying the wrong thing and upsetting you even further. [4] X Research source Sometimes, these past experiences may come from how your partner observed their parents interacting as a child. If they never saw their parents emotionally supporting each other in a positive way, they’re unlikely to have the skills or confidence to comfort you themselves. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Your partner may respond with anger or irritation if they feel uncomfortable. If your partner gets mad at you when you’re upset or when you’ve expressed an issue with your relationship, this reaction may come from your partner’s attachment style, trauma history, or other factors. Rather than listening to how you feel and responding appropriately, your partner may be taking out their own emotions on you and becoming overly defensive. Try communicating with your partner with the help of a counselor or therapist—if nothing changes, it may be time to walk away from the relationship. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a quiet time to talk about your feelings.",
      "content": "Find a quiet time to talk about your feelings. Make sure there are no distractions so you can focus on each other. Pick a time when neither of you are stressed or busy—you’ll be more likely to be able to express yourself without it turning into an argument. Try opening the conversation with something like, \"Is now a good time to talk? I have a few things I've been thinking about lately.\" [7] X Research source It can be difficult to bring up tough subjects when they're not actively happening because you might feel like you don't want to stir the pot. Prepare for the conversation by taking some time by yourself to think about what you really want to say. That way, you'll be able to manage your emotions better during the conversation. Consider setting a time limit for the conversation so it doesn't become overwhelming. You could say something like, \"I just need about 15 minutes—then I have to walk the dog.\""

      "content": "Explain your feelings in a non-confrontational way. Use \"I\" phrases to explain that you need to feel more comforted. Talk about your own feelings rather than criticizing your partner. Your “message is going to be more well-received if you’re focusing on what you’re feeling rather than criticizing a partner,” says Miller. [8] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. You might say something like, \"Sometimes when I'm feeling stressed, I feel like you're not really sure what to do or say, so you shut down. That makes me feel really lonely, though.\""

      "content": "Point out examples of when they were supportive. Be specific about what they did and how it made you feel. Chances are, your partner has gotten it right at some point. After all, you're in a relationship with them for a reason. Soften the conversation by leading with examples of a time they were there for you the way you needed. That will give them an idea of what they can do for you next time. For example, you might say, \"Do you remember how upset I was when my dog got hit by a car? You put your arms around me while I cried, and the next day, you brought me my favorite chocolate. That made me feel really loved.\""

      "title": "Give an example of when you needed more comfort.",
      "content": "Give an example of when you needed more comfort. Keep your tone even as you explain this. Mention a specific time when you really wanted your partner to comfort you. Be specific about how you felt and how your partner's reaction affected you, but try to keep your voice friendly and soft so your partner doesn't feel attacked. [9] X Research source It can also help to hold hands or sit close to your partner so you feel connected during this part of the conversation. If your partner points out ways that they tried to be supportive during those moments, don't dismiss that! Even if it wasn't exactly what you needed at the time, try to appreciate the fact that they made an effort."

      "title": "Ask if there are times they don't know what to do.",
      "content": "Ask if there are times they don't know what to do. Give your partner a chance to talk, too. Ask if they have an idea of what might be stopping them from comforting you. They might feel helpless when you cry, for instance, or they might feel frustrated when you talk about a problem they can't solve. They might even feel like they've given you advice about a certain situation in the past that you didn't take, so now they're trying to figure out what to say. Your partner could also get defensive when you get upset because they're afraid you're blaming them for whatever you're feeling. Miller suggests reminding your partner that you’re in this together by saying something like, “‘Hey, it sounds like this is maybe a little overwhelming for you at times. What would help you to not feel like you have to run away when we have these arguments?’” [10] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Listen to what they have to say with an open mind—don't just wait for your next chance to talk. You might learn some really important things about how you can work together better in the future. It can help to repeat back what your partner just said in your own words. For instance, if they say, \"I'm always worried I'll make things worse,\" you might say, \"Ok, I'm hearing that you're not sure what to do because you're afraid I'll get more upset, right? I can understand that.\""

      "title": "Be specific about what you'd like in the future.",
      "content": "Be specific about what you'd like in the future. Don't leave them guessing about what you need. Tell your partner how you'd like to be comforted when you're feeling sad, angry, or disappointed. Being able to give this information might take some soul-searching on your part, but your partner isn't a mind reader—if you don't know what would help you, it's not fair to ask your partner to know, either. [11] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"I don't want you to feel like you have to fix the problem when I have a bad day at work. I just want to be able to talk to you about it.\" You might also say, \"If I'm feeling sad, I just want a hug or some time to cuddle on the couch.\" To end things on a positive note, it's a good idea to wrap up the conversation by reassuring your partner that you love them and really want to work together on this. If you aren’t sure exactly what your emotional needs are, consider if you have friends or family who you better meet your emotional needs. If so, figure out exactly what they do that works for you and communicate that to your partner."

      "title": "Ask for what you need when they don't do it on their own.",
      "content": "Ask for what you need when they don't do it on their own. Be honest about how you feel and what you need in the moment. Be willing to be vulnerable about how you're feeling—your partner can't comfort you if you're too closed off. If you express yourself plainly, your partner will have a better chance of making the connection between how you're feeling and how you've asked to be comforted. [12] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"My boss yelled at me today for a mistake one of my coworkers made. I'm feeling really frustrated and sad” or \"Can I just vent to you about my day? I don't want you to feel like you have to fix the problem; I just want someone to talk to.\" Keep in mind that this will require you to be in touch with your own emotions! If you find yourself feeling emotional or agitated, take some time to get down to the root of it. Your partner shouldn’t have to be a mind reader—some people have a hard time picking up on subtle clues about other people's emotions, and it can be tempting to hold out on asking for comfort because you want your partner to just \"get it.\" Try to let go of that idea—you'll be setting yourself (and your partner) up for success if you honestly express what you want from them."

      "content": "Show gratitude when they make an effort. Give your partner positive reinforcement for trying. People sometimes need a little time to change, so try not to be impatient if your partner doesn't get it 100% right on the first try. If you can tell they're trying, point out what they're doing right—not what they could or should be doing better. [13] X Research source The more you acknowledge your partner's efforts, the more encouraged they'll be to keep trying in the future."

      "title": "Be there for your partner, too.",
      "content": "Be there for your partner, too. Give your partner the emotional support they need. Relationships take effort on both sides. Your partner needs support just like you do, but it may not be the exact same way you need to be supported. Really listen to what they need from you and try to offer that emotional support when they're going through a hard time. For example, when you're sad, you might prefer to cry it out with someone who'll just listen. On the other hand, your partner might want some time to busy themselves in an activity while they clear their mind. Let them know that's okay, then offer to join them if they'd like, or let them know it's okay if they would rather be alone for a little while. If you’re not sure how your partner likes to be supported, ask them! Miller suggests “asking your spouse what they need, and then respecting that…Then, whatever they’re requesting, you just sort of follow through.” [14] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. Miller also stresses the importance of the comforting spouse “realizing that they didn’t cause [the problem], which also means that they can’t cure it.” [15] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. “You can support your spouse going through this,” Miller continues, “while also recognizing…that you may feel helpless and powerless, but there's only so much that you can do.” [16] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020."

      "content": "Build an outside support system. Reach out to family, friends, or even a therapist. There's a chance that being comforting will never be your partner's strong suit, even if they really try. It can take some of the pressure off if you have someone else you really trust—like your mom or your best friend—that you can turn to when times are tough. If you don't have anyone to talk to, consider taking up a new hobby so you can make new friends, or even talk to a therapist about whatever you're going through. [17] X Research source In the meantime, keep working with your partner on how they can be there for you, and appreciate all of the other good qualities they have. Couples therapy can also be really helpful for learning to communicate more effectively with your partner . Reader Poll: We asked 1601 wikiHow readers who they go to when they need to talk through a personal issue, and 61% said that they reach out to their best friend for support and understanding. [Take Poll] So, you might find that your other connections can help you feel more supported, too."

      "content": "Don't compare your relationship to other people's. Remember, what you see from the outside isn't always reality. It's easy to see other couples on social media or out in public and think that they must always be that happy. Chances are, they go through some of the same things in their relationship that you go through in yours. Their problems could even be worse than yours, so try not to hold yourself—or your partner—up to an imaginary standard. [18] X Research source Everyone has a unique set of strengths, and there probably are some people who are more naturally comforting than your partner is. However, they might not be as good at making you laugh, as encouraging of your career, or as amazing of a cook. Remember to embrace your partner for exactly who they are!"

      "content": "Give each other your full attention at least once a day. It's hard to be in touch with each other emotionally if you're not making a genuine connection. Ask your partner to commit to a certain time when you're both focused only on each other. [19] X Research source For example, you might make a \"no screens at dinner\" rule, making that a time when you can talk to each other about your day. If meals are the time you connect with your kids, try asking your partner if the two of you can set aside a few minutes for each other first thing in the morning or right before bed. It's okay if you don't have anything super important to talk about every day. Just having that time together will help you both feel closer, which will make it easier to be there for each other when things get hard."
