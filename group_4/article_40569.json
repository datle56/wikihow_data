[2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Start by walking for 15-20 minutes a day 3-4 times a week. From there, gradually increase the pace of your walking until jogging becomes the next logical step. Once you’re ready to start jogging, it’s still a good idea to start each run at a brisk walking pace. Walking first will help you warm up."

      "content": "Warm up for 5-10 minutes before you jog. To get your blood pumping and prevent injury to your muscles and tendons, it’s very important to warm up before you jog. Spend at least 5 minutes before each jogging session doing a light warmup routine that targets your legs and lower body. Some good warmup exercises include: [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Brisk walking Marching in place Doing knee lifts Side-stepping Climbing stairs"

      "content": "Alternate between jogging and walking when you start. When you begin running, even if you’re in shape from another sport, you’re using new muscles and will have to adjust accordingly. So, start off slow. For example, during your first few runs, you might alternate between jogging for 5 minutes and walking for 2 minutes for the entire run. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source As you get used to jogging, you’ll eventually be able to maintain a running pace for a longer period of time before you switch back to walking."

      "content": "Practice proper form while jogging. Though most people assume how far and how long you run has purely to do with endurance and determination, having the proper running form actually significantly impacts your performance. To make the most of your run and prevent injuries, remember to: [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Keep your head straight and your neck and jaw muscles relaxed Relax your shoulders and keep them back and down [6] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021.

      "content": "Breathe regularly as you jog. Keep an even rate of breathing while running and breathe with your belly—that is, take deep breaths into your stomach rather than shallow breaths into your chest. Try taking 1 breath for every 2 strides to help keep your breathing regular. [7] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You may be tempted to pant or take quick, shallow breaths as you run, but you’ll get more oxygen and maintain your energy better if you breathe slowly and deeply."

      "title": "Stay hydrated while you run.",
      "content": "Stay hydrated while you run. It’s easy to get dehydrated while you jog, which can deplete your energy and even endanger your health. Drink at least 16 fluid ounces (470 mL) 1-2 hours before you run and take 4-6 swigs of water every 15-20 minutes during your run. After you finish your jog, drink 14–16 fluid ounces (410–470 mL) of fluids, such as a recovery shake or smoothie. Water is usually the best thing you can drink while doing a short jog. If you don’t like the taste of water alone, add a splash of lemon or lime juice to give it a flavor boost. If you’re running for 60 minutes or more, or if you anticipate other difficult conditions (like uneven terrain or harsh weather), a sports drink can help you keep up your energy."

[10] X Research source To give your food time to digest and avoid discomfort, wait at least a couple of hours after a full meal before you jog, or between 30 minutes and 2 hours if you’ve had a smaller snack. [11] X Research source Good sources of protein include poultry breast, seafood, beans and peas, and low-fat dairy products. Healthy protein can help give you energy for your jog. It will also promote muscle growth and repair as you recover from your workout. If you’re jogging for weight loss, try increasing your overall intake of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Reduce your intake of sugary foods and drinks, processed foods, and greasy foods. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Run on an even, level surface when you’re starting out. Jogging on an uneven trail can be a great workout, but it’s going to be tough if you’re new to running. When you’re getting started, stick to flat surfaces like paved roads or running tracks. Tracks have the advantage of being softer than regular roads or sidewalks, so there’s less impact on your feet, knees, hips, and spine."

Try to pick an area that is familiar to you and gets a lot of foot traffic. This will reduce your risk of injury or attack while you jog. [13] X Research source Ideally, you should run with a buddy. That way, you’ll have someone with you in case something happens. [14] X Research source If you do run after dark or in low-visibility conditions, wear bright clothes so it’s easier for drivers, cyclists, and other runners to see you."

      "content": "Choose an indoor track or treadmill to avoid the elements. If the weather is severe or outside air conditions are unsafe, running indoors can be a great alternative to an outdoor jog. Head to your local gym or fitness center and hit the track or treadmills if you don’t want to jog outside. [15] X Research source Running outdoors can provide a better workout, since you’re working against wind resistance. However, you can compensate for that by setting your treadmill on a 1% incline. To reduce your risk of repetitive motion injury while running indoors, vary your speed from time to time (as well as your incline, if you’re running on a treadmill)."

      "content": "Choose a comfortable pair of running shoes. There are a huge variety of running shoes on the market, so you might feel daunted by the task of choosing the right pair. However, a recent study shows that the best running shoes for you are probably the ones that feel the most comfortable.

      "content": "Replace your running shoes every 350–500 miles (560–800 km). As running shoes start to wear out, they don’t absorb shock as well. Once you start jogging, keep track of how much distance you’ve covered, and get new running shoes after about 350–500 miles (560–800 km) to prevent pain and injury. If the heels of your shoes aren’t too worn down, you can still use them for walking. Even if your jogging shoes haven’t seen that much use, shoes that are older than 1 year might become less comfortable due to changes in the soles that occur over time."

It’s also important to wear clothes that will protect you from the elements. Go for light clothes, such as shorts and a t-shirt, if it’s warm out. If it’s cold, wear long sleeves and pants and layer on a windbreaker, scarf, hat, and gloves. [19] X Research source Stick to synthetic materials like rayon, nylon, or spandex, since they’re good at wicking away moisture.

Include intervals in your run. Intervals involve repeatedly alternating between running full out for several seconds followed by returning to a normal pace for several minutes. Alternatively, you can choose a landmark, sprint to it, then return to your normal pace for several minutes before choosing another landmark, sprinting to it, returning to normal pace, and so on.
