      "content": "Muddle the sliced strawberries in a glass, then add ice. Muddling is lightly smashing fruit or herbs to release their juices or oils. After you put the strawberries in your glass, firmly press into them with your muddler and twist a few times.

      "title": "Combine cran-strawberry juice and coconut milk.",
      "content": "Combine cran-strawberry juice and coconut milk. Use a separate container so you can mix 2 cups (475 mL) of cran-strawberry juice and 1 cup (240 mL) of sweetened vanilla coconut milk well with a spoon. Cran-strawberry juice isn’t as dark pink as the Strawberry Açaí concentrate Starbucks uses to make Pink Drinks, so your homemade version may be a paler pink. Use a hand blender or cocktail shaker for extra blending, but mixing with a spoon works well. Experiment with the proportion of juice to coconut milk if you prefer a Pink Drink that’s milkier or more tangy. Substitute cran-raspberry juice if you can’t find cran-strawberry."

      "content": "Pour the mixture into the glass with ice and muddled strawberries. Once you’ve mixed your caffeine-free Pink Drink, pour it over the ice and muddled strawberries. Then, add a few strawberry slices for a tasty and colorful garnish. A Pink Drink can be a little difficult to drink if your muddled strawberries get sucked up into the straw. Avoid this by using a wider straw or drinking your Pink Drink straight from the glass!"
