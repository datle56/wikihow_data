Anything under 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) is too short – there's not enough hair for the wax to grip. Anything over 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) is too long – the wax will grab too much hair and make the process painful. [1] X Research source If your hair is too short, let it grow out for a week or 2.

      "content": "Take a dose of ibuprofen 20 to 45 minutes before waxing (if desired). Waxing can be a little painful, especially if this is your first time. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen can reduce the pain of waxing , as well as minimize post-waxing pain. 400 mg is the standard dose for adults. [3] X Research source Wash the medication down with a full glass of water at least 20 minutes before waxing to give it time to take effect. You can take another 400 mg dose 4 hours later if you're still experiencing pain. [4] X Research source"

Panties will provide a guideline for where to apply the wax and protect your sensitive area from any accidental drips that land in the wrong place.

Hard wax goes on smoothly, and you can pull it right off with your hands once it hardens. If you're new to waxing, you may want to buy a hard wax kit. It will come with everything you need and include detailed instructions. [9] X Research source Avoid soft wax and soft wax kits. Soft wax works best on fine hair. [10] X Research source Avoid cold wax strips as well. This wax can be painful when used on the bikini area."

Each product will be different, so check yours for specific instructions for heating. You can use a microwave to melt the wax. If you plan on waxing in the future, consider investing in a wax warmer. A warmer keeps the wax at the right temperature as you work and you can bring it into the bathroom with you. [11] X Research source Warm the wax to be the consistency recommended by the product instructions. The right consistency is similar to warm syrup or honey – pourable, but still thick."

Go somewhere you can be completely alone and comfortable. Wait until everyone is gone so there is no chance of someone walking in on you. You want to be able to take your time and feel relaxed while you work. [13] X Research source You can wax on your bed or on your floor (with a towel laid down) so you are comfortable.

Use your non-dominant hand to gently pull the skin taut where you plan to start. [14] X Research source Sitting in front of a mirror can really help with this part. You'll be able to easily see all the sections you've completed and which ones you still need to work on."

Exfoliating right after waxing isn't usually recommended, since the skin is very sensitive and a bit irritated. Once tenderness subsides (within a day or 2), use a gentle exfoliating scrub on the area while you're in the shower. Rub gently in circular motions and rinse the area thoroughly."

Don't wax before your period. This is when you are the most sensitive to pain. [27] X Research source"
