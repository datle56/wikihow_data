      "content": "They want to show you affection. Cats learn to lick each other as a social grooming behavior from their mother; it’s an example of cat kisses . If they’re licking your hair, they may be trying to tell you they love you by showing you. It’s a way of strengthening your relationship and giving affection to you at the same time. When a cat imprints themselves on you, it means that they consider you their favorite person. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "They’re in the mood to play.",
      "content": "They’re in the mood to play. This behavior is especially prevalent in younger cats when they want to play or interact. They often lick other cats this way, which is why 2 cats licking each other can easily turn into 2 cats playing with each other. Cats also sometimes play with their toys by licking them, only to start biting them and tossing them around as they would potential prey if they were in the wild. [2] X Research source Cat care specialist Rita Reimers states that \"cats love to play; that's how they learn to hunt as kittens, and that instinct stays sharp even in your indoor cats. You can do some playtime with your cat with the laser pointer, but really, you can wear them out with things they can chase, like a fishing pole-type toy that can mimic the motion of birds flying in the air.\""

      "title": "They’re looking for attention.",
      "content": "They’re looking for attention. Your cat may simply want you to start petting them or giving them a hug or kiss. They may also be hungry and want to get your attention, so you’ll get out of the chair or bed and feed them. Cats figure that licking the hair on your head is a good way to get a reaction from you, so you’ll then focus on them. [3] X Research source Cat behaviorist Molly DeVoss suggests the following when your cat is acting out: \"Take a close look at the cat’s environment, diet, and activity and make sure their needs are being met before you try to modify the behavior; sometimes modifying the environment and increasing enrichment is what the cat really needs.\""

      "content": "They want to soothe themselves. When they’re kittens, cats often use licking as a way to find comfort. This is especially true if they’ve been weaned from being nursed by their mother cat too early. Another way cats try to comfort themselves is by constantly kneading their paws on everything from soft blankets to your lap. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "They have anxiety issues. Cats with anxiety can exhibit compulsive behaviors that include the need to lick or chew. They may lick themselves , toys, other cats, or your hair. Other signs of anxiety in cats include hiding, litter box issues, destroying things, pulling their hair out , and changes in their appetite. Take your cat to a veterinarian if you’re concerned that they’re experiencing anxiety so you can make a plan to treat the problem. It may be due to too many loud noises, unwelcome visitors in the home, or other pets stressing them out. [5] X Research source While licking your hair may be due to several reasons mentioned here, if your cat is actually chewing on or eating your hair, they need to see a vet. They are likely experiencing stress or a health-related issue like nutrient-deficiency. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "They’re drawn to the scent of your hair. When cats are interested in certain scents or odors, licking is a surefire way to find out what they are. This may only include sugars and salts that human skin gives off naturally but can also involve whatever hair care products you’re using. Cats love scents that include notes of basil, valerian, and rose or thyme, chamomile, and honeysuckle. If your products include scents they’re into, they’re likely attracted to them. [7] X Research source Don’t allow your cat to lick your hair after you’ve applied a topical product. Many hair care products contain ingredients that can be toxic to cats . [8] X Research source They may also be trying to cover up your hair’s scent. Cats are averse to certain scents that include citrus, eucalyptus, lavender, peppermint, cinnamon, and coffee. If your hair care products include these or other scents they dislike, they may actually try to remove the scent from your hair through licking. [9] X Research source"

It can also include excess grooming, like licking. It’s more likely that a hyperthyroid cat would overly groom or lick themselves than you, but if you’re concerned about their health, get them checked out at a vet to put your mind at ease.

      "content": "It’s only concerning if your cat licks your hair obsessively. When cats compulsively lick their own hair or yours, it can be a sign they’re experiencing stress and anxiety. Cats show stress in many ways, including sudden changes in appetite or weight, litter box usage, or how they behave. If you notice these changes, take your cat to the veterinarian for an immediate check-up. [11] X Research source It may also be a sign that they’re trying to soothe a reaction from allergies to things like dust, pollen, or specific fabrics. Keep an eye on them and take them to the vet if you become concerned. Licking your hair may also be an attempt to soothe some kind of pain they’re experiencing, especially if they are exhibiting other symptoms of pain. Cats hide pain well, so if you’re unsure, it’s best to get them checked out by a vet."

      "content": "It may signal other potential health threats like pica. Pica in cats occurs when they regularly eat non-food items. It’s an obsessive-compulsive disorder that can be an underlying sign of diabetes, feline leukemia, anemia, or hyperthyroidism. Other symptoms of hyperthyroidism include GI issues like vomiting or diarrhea, in addition to weight loss, restlessness, or an intolerance to heat. If you suspect your cat has pica or hyperthyroidism, it’s important that you take them to a vet for diagnosis and treatment. [12] X Research source Not all cats that eat or chew non-food items have pica. Pica occurs when a cat eats non-food items regularly (and obsessively so). When cats occasionally chew on or eat something they shouldn’t, it’s not a cause for concern; this is especially a common behavior for kittens. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Cats do it as a sign of affection, a call for attention, or a need to play. They also consider licking a social form of grooming because your head hair most resembles and feels like cat fur. Cats also like to place their scent on their human companion, so you know you’re part of their family. As long as it’s not a regular thing or the cat doesn’t do it compulsively, occasional chewing of your hair is ok. [14] X Research source Reimers reminds pet owners that \"hands are for petting and toys are for playing. If you're going to play rough, don't do it with your hand, because that just encourages biting. Make sure you give them other things to taste, bite, and kick.\"[v161835_b01]. 22 Jun 2021. A cat should never be allowed to eat your hair, as it can cause serious harm. Make sure to vacuum or sweep up any of your excess hair regularly."

      "content": "Get them cat grass to chew on. Sometimes, cats lick hair on themselves or you because they have mild digestive issues. Cat grass provides a source of fiber, as well as micro-nutrients that aid in digestion and the prevention of hairballs. It can also satisfy their need to chomp, chew, or nibble on something other than your hair. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep their mouths busy with teething toys . Young cats go through a teething period between 3 and 7 months old. [16] X Research source Teething toys help them strengthen their teeth as their adult teeth come in. For older cats, you can also try giving them dental treats, which also help with fresh breath and good oral health. Cat behaviorist Carrie Seay suggests distracting your cat from licking or chewing on things they shouldn’t be. “If you see your cat going over to start to chomp on something, you can call them over to you when you do see them getting ready to do that action. And so they're reinforced for coming back to you, as opposed to in the enjoyment of chewing on whatever they might want to chew on.”"

Other than helping with claw maintenance, scratching posts allow cats to exercise their energy and relieve stress; this may help to prevent them from licking your hair for the same reasons.

If your cat tends to lick your hair at night, this could also help curb that behavior if it’s based on nervous symptoms.

      "title": "Never punish cats for licking your hair (or for any behavior).",
      "content": "Never punish cats for licking your hair (or for any behavior). It’s a better idea to distract your cat and then redirect them toward other behaviors. Punishing a cat doesn’t work because they don’t associate their actions with your reactions. It only causes them to feel stress and fear, which won’t help solve the problem. Veterinarian Brian Bourquin (DVM) agrees that “You never want to punish. You want to be patient; cats do tend to have a short attention span. Make sure that you're giving them an item that is rewarding for them. For some cats, it's not a treat, but could be brushing, combing, or whatever works to make them do the behavior you want.”"

      "title": "A cat that licks your hair isn’t usually a cause for concern.",
      "content": "A cat that licks your hair isn’t usually a cause for concern. It only becomes a real issue if they’re aggressive or obsessive about the behavior, which may indicate a potential health risk. There’s a good chance they’re just doing it to say how much they love you or that they want to play. It’s best not to let your cat ingest your hair since it can damage their digestive system if eaten. Otherwise, enjoy their quirky behavior and make sure they have plenty of ways to entertain themselves—and you."
