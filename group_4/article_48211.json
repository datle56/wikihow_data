With Sling TV , users can watch a large variety of channels (including sports, news, and entertainment channels) on their televisions without a cable box or satellite dish. Customers have to subscribe to a Sling TV package of their choice, which gives them access to a selection of channels. Then, they can stream the content via their internet connection directly to TV, computer, or other devices. [1] X Research source Sling TV is particularly advantageous for consumers because of its channel bundles. These bundle packages are designed to let customers customize their services so that they only pay for the channels they want. Sling TV is also the first app-based TV service that lets you stream both live TV and on-demand content over the internet. There are also no equipment rental fees or contracts involved in a Sling TV membership. You can get as many channels and add-ons as you want, but you can also cancel at any time. Packages also include a cloud-based DVR service so you can record content to be watched later."
