      "content": "Unbox your tablet and charge your device/stylus as needed. If you have a brand new tablet, be sure to take everything out of the box and remove any protective tabs or film. If your tablet comes with a manual, read it. It will give specific instructions for your exact tablet. If your tablet and/or stylus need to be charged, plug them in and charge them before using them. If your stylus uses batteries, put new batteries in it before using it for the first time."

      "content": "Plug the tablet into your computer. If this is your first time using the tablet, your computer will immediately start installing drivers for it. While you can use the tablet when drivers are being installed, it's better to wait to avoid unintended behaviors. If your tablet is wireless or connects with a USB cable, you can use it on a desktop or laptop easily. If the tablet connects with an HDMI cable, you may need an HDMI to USB adapter if you're on a laptop without an HDMI port."

      "content": "Open a program that you want to use your tablet with. Technically speaking, you can do anything on your computer with your tablet—it essentially functions as a big mouse, and tapping something with the stylus is equivalent to clicking with a mouse. However, this isn't very efficient. Tablets are best used for specialized tasks (such as drawing or modeling). If you want to draw, try Adobe Photoshop, GIMP , Paint Tool SAI, Clip Studio Paint, or Krita. If you're looking to do 3D modeling, use Blender, ZBrush, Maya, or Sketchup. If you want to do video editing , use Adobe Premier Pro, Final Cut Pro, or CyberLink PowerDirector."

      "content": "Place the tip of the stylus on the tablet surface to move your mouse. If your tablet has a screen, the working area of the tablet is that screen. However, if your tablet is screen-less, you should see a guideline around the active area of the tablet. You can now use your tablet to draw, 3D model, or do just about anything you can think of."

      "title": "If your tablet doesn't have a screen, you'll need to look at the monitor.",
      "content": "If your tablet doesn't have a screen, you'll need to look at the monitor. You won't be able to see what you're drawing on your tablet, so you'll need to watch the screen to see what you're drawing. This will likely feel a little odd at first, but with practice, you'll get the handle of it."

      "title": "Look for software geared for tablets.",
      "content": "Look for software geared for tablets. Most tablets have software that allows you to draw and create with your tablet. Many of them don't even require a tablet to use. Some popular programs for tablets include Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Paint Tool SAI, Clip Studio Paint, Aseprite, Blender, and ZBrush."

      "title": "Practice using your stylus.",
      "content": "Practice using your stylus. The stylus is a pen-like attachment to the tablet that allows you to draw, somewhat like you might draw with a pen. However, using the stylus takes some practice to get used to it."

      "title": "Experiment with adjusting the pressure that you apply.",
      "content": "Experiment with adjusting the pressure that you apply. One of the advantages of a stylus and tablet is that you can change the pressure that you are using. This can create a vast array of effects. Different brushes will have different pressure sensitivity settings, and you can edit your brushes as you see fit to mesh with your drawing style. Pen pressure is especially important in drawing applications like Adobe Photoshop, Paint Tool SAI, and Clip Studio Paint."

      "content": "Purchase replacement nibs for your stylus. Over time, the plastic nib of your stylus will get worn down. This can cause it to not work as well, and it could even cause damage to the tablet screen. If you notice that your stylus nib is wearing down, replace it with a new nib (which are usually sold in multipacks)."

      "content": "If your tablet has a screen, you can use it as a secondary display. If you have enough room on your desk, you can even prop the tablet up so it's easier to use as a second monitor. While it likely isn't great for stuff like gaming, you can use it for internet browsing or watching a video."

      "title": "Some tablets can be used as a touch screen.",
      "content": "Some tablets can be used as a touch screen. If a tablet has touch capabilities, it will say so in the tablet's specifications online. If a tablet doesn't have touch capabilities, you can only use it with the provided stylus."

      "title": "Do some research on what tablet to get.",
      "content": "Do some research on what tablet to get. You can get inexpensive tablets for less than $50, or spend upwards of over $500 on one. The type of tablet you get depends on a number of personal factors about what you want and need. Some things that you want to take into consideration are: Software support: Does the tablet support the types of programs you want to use? For example, if you want to use Procreate (a popular art app), you'll need a tablet like an iPad since it's a mobile app. Cost: If you have a budget to adhere to, keep that in mind when looking for graphics tablets. Ease of use: Some tablets are easier to use than others. If you're a new tablet user, get one that doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles that make it more difficult to use. Learning curve: Tablets without a screen are more expensive, but they have a higher learning curve to use. End usage: Consider what you're going to use the tablet for—art, graphic design, 3D modeling, or maybe something else. Look at tablets that fit those needs when shopping. Size: The bigger the tablet, the heavier and more unwieldy it will be to use, plus it will require more space to set it up. However, it also means you have a bigger drawing space. Pressure sensitivity: If you're drawing, look for a tablet with a lot of pressure sensitivity. This will help you draw lines that look more fluid and visually pleasing. Connection interface: Most tablets are wired with a USB cable, but some are wireless. Consider your situation and desk setup to determine which tablet is best for you."
