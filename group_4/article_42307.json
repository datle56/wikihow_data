A good way to do this is to alternate between screwing the tool arm into the chain and removing it, checking to see if the chain has broken yet (you won't be able to tell while the chain is in the tool).

Once the brake pads are removed, unscrew the (smaller) screw on the pad/metal assembly itself, and slide the pad out of the metal piece it is attached to. Replace the pad by sliding a fresh one in. This is a worthwhile and inexpensive repair for your bike, since brake pads are cheap and are your best friend on the road."
