If you don’t already know how to swim the breaststroke , then that’s an essential first step to learning the eggbeater kick—which is the same as the breastroke kick but with alternating legs! Follow these simple steps to master the breaststroke kick: [1] X Research source Bring your knees up as if they’re moving toward your armpits. Place your heels near your butt, but keep your feet apart and parallel to each other. Turn out your legs by slightly spreading your knees apart— not by twisting your legs or feet. Flex your feet so that they’re not pointed. Kick both of your feet outward to the side, then move them around in a circle. Bring your feet together and point them. That’s one completed breaststroke kick!"

To really get the hang of the breaststroke kick, practice it on your back so that you can see exactly what your legs are doing. Float on your back as if you were about to swim backstroke , then do the breaststroke kick at least 10 times. Continue practicing until the kick begins to feel like muscle memory or second nature.

Now that you’ve mastered the breastroke kick, it’s pretty easy to do the eggbeater kick since this style of treading water is just the breaststroke kick with alternating legs. So, instead of moving both legs simultaneously like you were in the breastroke kick, move one leg at a time according to these steps: [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bring your right knee straight up with your heel near your butt. Move your right foot to the side and flex. Kick your right foot outward to the side of your body. Move your right foot out and around to meet your left foot, then point your foot. Repeat these steps with your left leg. That’s an eggbeater kick!"

If it helps, start with your arms below the surface of the water and use a sculling action to keep you afloat. [4] X Research source Otherwise, use a pool noodle or kick board to support your upper body as you practice the kick. [5] X Research source Eventually, you should be able to stop using your hands and move your body higher so that your hands, shoulders, and arms are above water. If you’re struggling to practice the kick in the water, try practicing while sitting on a bench or hanging onto the edge of the pool. Sculling is a technique where you stretch your arms to the side and keep them submerged in the water. Face your palms inward, keep your arms straight, and move your hands together and apart repeatedly in one fluid motion. This movement should help to keep you afloat. [6] X Research source"

While this treading technique will eventually become muscle memory and feel easy for you, the technique can be difficult to master at first. Watch for these common mistakes as you’re learning the eggbeater kick: [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pointing your feet: Your feet should be flexed, not pointed, up until the very moment that your feet are brought together at the end of the kick. Turning your foot while kicking: When you kick your legs out to the side, avoid twisting or rotating your foot or leg. Bringing your feet together at the start of the kick: At the beginning of the kick when your knees are near your armpits, your feet shouldn’t be together—keep about 1 foot (300 mm) of distance between them. Letting your knees drop: It’s important to pick your knees up high, as if to reach your armpits, throughout the kick. Letting your knees drop lower will make it more difficult to stay up in the water."

      "content": "The eggbeater kick is an alternating series of one-legged breaststroke kicks. In an eggbeater kick, the swimmer’s legs alternate quickly between breaststroke kicks. Since there are no breaks between kicks (as there would be when both legs are moving at the same time), the swimmer is able to stay stable in the water without any swaying or dipping. [8] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source When it comes to mechanics, the eggbeater kick works because the legs are being rotated circularly while the feet are flexed and angled. As a result, the water above the foot moves faster than the water under the foot, creating a pressurized force that propels the swimmer upward. [9] X Research source"

While any strong swimmer should be able to find a use for the eggbeater kick, it’s most often seen in a few different types of swimming activities . Water polo players, particularly the goalkeeper, use the eggbeater kick to stay afloat while leaving their arms free to control and pass the ball. [10] X Research source Synchronized swimmers also use the eggbeater kick to stabilize themselves in order to perform other tricks, like lifting their teammates out of the water. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Lifeguards are also trained in eggbeater swimming since it allows them to stabilize their upper body better than other techniques, leaving their hands free to rescue struggling or drowning swimmers. Anyone who finds themselves in deep waters should really know how to tread water egg beater style—this kick is the most efficient way to tread water, so it can be a convenient and even life-saving skill for any swimmer.

Eggbeater style isn’t the only way to tread water —in fact, there are quite a few options and techniques to help you stay afloat! While eggbeater kicking is considered the most energy-efficient way to tread water, it’s also one of the most difficult techniques to do correctly, so you can try one of these other kicks while you practice your eggbeater: [13] X Research source Pedal Kick: Flex your legs and move them in a circular motion, as if pedaling a bike. [14] X Research source Dog Paddle : Alternate your arms in a clawing motion while pointing your toes and kicking your feet. [15] X Research source Flutter Kick : Outstretch your arms, point your toes, and kick your feet rapidly in a consistent back-and-forth motion. [16] X Research source Frog Kick: Start with your legs together, then bend them at the knees before quickly extending them and whipping them to the side. Flex your feet while your legs are together but point your toes when you kick them out. Helicopter: Float on your black and move your hands in a backwards circular motion while kicking your feet up and down with pointed toes. Certified swim instructor Jacob Siegel also advises to “fill your lungs with air and use that to float as well,” regardless of the treading technique you’re using. “That will help you to tread water without using your arms.”"
