This time, stay close to the vertical line, but veer slightly left or right (whichever side has more cups remaining) once you get about halfway up the line. The trick is to aim the ball in the direction of the most cups for the best shot. Aim for the closest cups first instead of going for the more difficult ones in the back. This could give you an edge over your opponent who might be trying for the far cups. [2] X Research source Before making your shot, try to visualize the exact path the ball must travel to make it into a cup. Hold a straight-sided object, like a ruler or a postcard, against the screen to create a path between the ball and cup to figure out the perfect line."
