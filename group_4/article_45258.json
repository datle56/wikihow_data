[6] X Research source Keep in mind that bypassing VPN for search means your search sessions won't be private like the rest of your browsing. If you need to connect to a work or school intranet, you can bypass Opera's VPN for the intranet by turning on \"Enable intranet sites by bypassing VPN.\" To bypass other websites, click Manage additional VPN bypass rules and list any addresses for which you don't want to use the VPN."

[10] X Research source Opera disables VPN by default when you visit search engines like Google and Bing. This is because VPNs make your web traffic seem like it's coming from another location (often another country), which skews your results. If you want to stay on the VPN while searching, slide the \"Bypass VPN for search\" switch to the Off (gray) position. For example, if you're in Canada and connected to a VPN server in Sweden, you'd normally see Swedish results in Google. Bypassing the VPN for search would ensure you see results from Canada, not Sweden. Keep in mind that bypassing VPN for search means your search sessions won't be private like the rest of your browsing."
