Ask yourself a few questions to find out if this is the case: Are you putting little effort into the relationship, such as not contacting them and not making plans? Do you feel bored when you are with them? Do you hope that plans with them get cancelled?"

      "content": "Recognize if there have been bumps in your friendship recently. Sometimes, conflicts can lead to distance. For example, if you have had a fight with one or more of your friends, they may take some distance while things cool off. Taking some time apart is normal if you disagree about something. If time goes on and you haven’t made up or they say that things are fine but they’ve nearly stopped talking to you, this may indicate greater problems. Understanding the wider context can sometimes help you to see why your friends might be distancing themselves. If you have been apart because of an issue, reach out to them to start repairing your relationship. For example, apologize first after a fight."

Saying things like, “We’re best friends, right?” or, “You’re going to invite me to that party, aren’t you?” can be exhausting. While you want to feel accepted and included, don’t go actively seeking that inclusion. If you find yourself asking for validation from your friends, step back. If you’re worried about the friendship ending and want constant reassurance, it can turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy in no time. Make sure that you are not being needy . Spend time working on things that are special to you instead of asking for others to validate you."

If they’re being honest and not trying to be mean, try to see things from their perspective. For example, if they say that you chew loudly and don’t want to invite you to eat, try not to get too offended. Instead, make an effort to chew with your mouth closed. If they say things just to be mean and it seems like their statements are an attack on you, disregard what they say."
