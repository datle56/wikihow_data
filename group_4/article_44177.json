The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Hitting it will only make the puppy fear you and confuse it — never strike your dog. If you are in the middle of a training session and it doesn't fully understand, do not become impatient and scold it. After all, the puppy or dog is only learning. If you find that you are losing your patience, step away from the dog and try again later. Bernese Mountain Dogs are extremely affectionate and want to please — scolding or punishing may have an extremely detrimental effect on your Bernese. Focus on positive reinforcement instead of punishment."

[2] X Research source When you catch your dog or puppy chewing or destroying something it shouldn’t, remove either the dog or the object from the dog and distract it with something it can “destroy” or chew on, like a toy. Then praise it for chewing on the right thing — the toy. Keep a bag of treats in a Ziploc bag in your pocket or in a “fanny” type bag at your waist. This means you will always have a treat handy.

It's essential that you train your dog a command for when you want it to stop doing something. \"Stop\" or \"leave it\" are common commands — whichever you choose, make sure that you are consistent and that everyone in the household uses the same command. When you see your dog doing the unwanted behavior, first give the command, then immediately follow with action (taking away the item or moving your dog away from it). By giving the command first, then doing the corrective action, you will allow your dog to do what you want when it hears you say \"leave it\" and avoid an unpleasant consequence.

      "content": "Train your dog to stop biting and chewing. Puppies explore their environment by mouthing everything in sight. While these are natural behaviors for a puppy, you also don't want it to think it's okay to bite people or chew on your shoes. Your dog will not know what is appropriate for it to chew unless you teach it. Keep anything you don't want your puppy to destroy up and out of its reach (this includes trash, books, shoes, remote controls, glasses, dirty underwear, etc.). Have plenty of toys for it to play with and chew on, but make sure they are not indistinguishable from household items (your dog will not know the difference between an old sock you offer it to play with and a new sock it is not supposed to chew). Allow your puppy to mouth you, so long as it is gentle. When your puppy gives you a hard bite, give a high-pitched yelp, as though it's really hurt you, and let your hand go limp (don't jerk it away). Your dog should stop biting, at which point you should praise it for stopping. If it bites you hard again, repeat these steps. Do this no more than three times in a 15-minute time period. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Give your dog a chew toy when it wants to chew on fingers. If you find your puppy chewing on something it shouldn't be, take it away and give it a toy to chew instead. As you take the item away, say “leave it” and give it a toy to chew on. [6] X Research source Canine and Feline Behavior for Veterinary Technicians and Nurses. Edited by Julie Shaw and Debbie Martin. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2015 Do not punish your dog after the fact. If you find an item that your dog destroyed while you were away, don't wave it in it face while yelling at it. This won't teach it not to chew — it will not get the connection that you are angry about something it did two hours ago. Unless you catch it in the act, do not scold your dog.

Start out by observing your dog — when you see that it is in the process of sitting on its own, say \"sit\" clearly and in a firm voice. [8] X Research source As soon as its butt touches the ground, praise it, pet it, and give it a treat. Do this every time you spy your dog about to sit. [9] X Research source Another method is to stand in front of your dog with a treat in your hand. Hold the treat centimeters above your dog's nose, then move the treat backward, over its head, leading its nose. It should follow the treat with its nose and should sit down as it does this. Again, as soon as its butt hits the floor, give it the treat and praise it.

This may be cute when your Bernese is little, but they grow into huge dogs, and it may injure or scare people if it jumps when it is fully grown. Teach it not to jump when it is a puppy to avoid problems later on. If your dog has already mastered \"sit,\" this can make teaching it not to jump a lot easier. When it's in a situation in which it is likely to jump — meeting a new person, for instance, tell it instead to sit and reward it with your attention. [12] X Research source When you see your dog is going to jump up on you, turn your body away, deflecting it, avoiding eye contact, and saying nothing. It will get the message that, when it jumps on you, it gets no reward or attention. Once it stops jumping and calms down, praise it with lots of petting, attention, and scratching.

Lower the treat to the ground — it should follow with its nose, lowering its body; you can praise it as it moves toward the down position. When its belly touches the ground and it is lying down, reward it with the treat and more praise. Once it is familiar with the movement, add the verbal command. \"Down,\" \"lay,\" or \"drop\" are common commands. Say it just before you begin bringing the treat down.

      "title": "Teach your dog to stay.",
      "content": "Teach your dog to stay. This can be a difficult command to train, as your dog will naturally want to follow you around. Teach this command to your dog once it has learned to sit and lie down. Begin teaching your dog to stay when it is calm (try after a walk), in a familiar environment, and with few distractions. Keep these sessions short at first, as it will be a challenge for it to stay in the beginning. Stand in front of your dog and ask it to sit or lie down. If it remains in the position for a few seconds, quickly reward it with a treat. This signals that it is released from the position and may do something else. Repeat the process and wait a few seconds longer before rewarding your dog. If it breaks the stay before you have released it (by rewarding it with the treat), say \"ah-ah!\" And start over. Add the verbal command. When your dog is sitting or lying down, say \"stay\" and put one hand out like a stop sign. Wait a few seconds, then reward it with the treat. Gradually increase the length of the stay. Do this slowly, and don't make these training sessions too long or your dog may get frustrated. When your dog seems to be grasping stay, you'll need to complicate things a bit more. Because you want it to stay in position even when you are out of sight (if you ask it to sit and stay while you go in a store, for instance), begin taking a few steps back from your dog after commanding it to stay. If it breaks the stay, it does not get the treat. Some argue that this is not a necessary command — your dog should know that when you tell it to sit or stay, it should remain in that position until you release it."

      "content": "Teach the dog to come when called. The stay command is an important command for your dog's safety — it can stop it from dashing into a busy street or another dangerous situation. Never let your dog off the leash outside (in an unfenced area) until it knows the \"come\" and \"stay\" commands and does them consistently. [15] X Research source Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training, Procedures and Protocols. Volume 3. Steven R. Lindsay. Blackwell Publishing. 2005 To practice this command, leash your dog and have some treats handy. Holding the end of the leash, say \"come\" in a very welcoming voice, then quickly take a few steps backward. Continue to back up until your dog reaches you. Reward it by saying \"Yes!,\" and then give it a treat. You can also practice this off-leash. Crouch or kneel and call your dog over to you throughout the day, rewarding it greatly when it comes to you. Never punish your dog when it comes to you. This could mean giving it a bath or shouting at it for not coming when you called, or even just ending its fun by snapping its leash back on every single time it obeys. Coming to you when you call needs to be the most appealing option your dog knows — more appealing than chasing that rabbit or running across the street to say hi to the neighbor. [16] X Research source Your dog must understand that it must come every single time you call it. When you are training, don't put it in a situation in which you know it won't obey you and then try the come command. [17] X Research source"

Teaching your Bernese Mountain Dog proper leash etiquette is very important — a big dog like a Bernese could easily drag you down the street if it isn't trained. Start out by letting it get comfortable with its collar. Put it on when it's likely to be distracted, like when it's playing or eating food. [18] X Research source If it tries to scratch it off or remove the collar, do not allow it to do so. Do not remove the collar until it's forgotten about it.

Do not pull it back to you and do not proceed — allow it to come back to you. When the leash is loose again, praise it and begin walking again. [21] X Research source Never allow your puppy to pull you on the leash, as this teaches it that this is acceptable. By stopping the walk, it learns that pulling and straining will get it nowhere. If it wants to walk, it must do so without pulling. [22] X Research source If your puppy does the opposite and sits down, do not yank on the leash to get it to keep moving. Instead, call it over to you, offering treats and rewards when it comes. [23] X Research source"
