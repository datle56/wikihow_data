      "title": "Start early.",
      "content": "Start early. Olympic athletes often start training in their childhood, especially for popular and rigorous sports like gymnastics, where many start around 4 or 5 years of age. If you have not started serious training and are a teen or adult, keep in mind that for many sports, athletes must start training young to be able to compete while their body is in prime physical shape. [1] X Research source If you’re not sure if you’re too old to be able to make it to the Olympics given your current skill level, consult with a specialist who can evaluate your chances."

      "title": "Be prepared to make major life adjustments.",
      "content": "Be prepared to make major life adjustments. Before you commit to a full training schedule, you will have to embrace the fact that you’ll have to make major life changes to be able to compete on an elite level. You may have to get homeschooled if you’re not already so that your training is your primary focus. While you are in training, your education and other commitments will have to take a backseat. If you have already finished school, you still may have to make major sacrifices like relocating or quitting your job. Keep in mind that to make it to the Olympic level, you will have to hand over a lot of money for coaches, training facilities, travel expenses for competitions, and many other additional and sometimes unforeseen costs."

      "content": "Find a coach. A coach is an essential element of your training. Even if you’re highly skilled in your sport, you probably don’t know the ins and outs of qualifying for competitions, the most effective training styles, and what it takes to compete on in international standard. You may be able to find coaches through the Internet or through a network of athletes in your sport. Make sure that the coach you choose has experience putting athletes through the Olympics. A coach acts not only as a fitness trainer, but also as a guide and mentor through the grueling training process."

      "content": "Learn about the qualifying requirements for your sport. Research what you need to do to qualify for the Olympics in your individual sport.

      "title": "Warm up properly before you train.",
      "content": "Warm up properly before you train. Stretching and doing warm ups is an essential component of training. If you start to rigorously train without warming up, you run the risk of hurting yourself and not being able to compete at all. Make sure that your warm up includes not only stretching but also light jogging or jump roping, as well as dynamic warm ups like lunges and squats. [3] X Research source Ask your coach or a fitness trainer what the best warm ups are for your individual sport."

      "title": "Train in your sport six days a week.",
      "content": "Train in your sport six days a week. Come up with a training schedule with your coach that has you in training six days a week. Spend at least a couple hours a day training, and change up your routine so that you’re constantly challenging your body. Athletes training for the Olympics often take one day a week off to rest physically and mentally. If another schedule works for you, run it by your coach, but remember that you should rest at least one out of every ten days. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Do cardio training and strength training six days a week.",
      "content": "Do cardio training and strength training six days a week. According to your coach’s recommendations, also spend time every day you are training doing cardio like running in addition to strength training to supplement your other training. What you focus on the most in your training depends on your sport.

      "content": "Practice every aspect of your sport at least once a week.

Training with others will keep you motivated and feeling like you are part of a community that is working toward a common goal. You can also learn from other athletes by watching their techniques and approaches. [6] X Research source Fellow athletes are also a great source of support, since they understand the physical and mental challenges of training."

      "content": "Participate in qualifying competitions. Consult with your coach and enter national competitions that pit you against the nation’s best.

      "title": "Maintain healthy eating habits.",
      "content": "Maintain healthy eating habits. Your diet is the fuel that you need to perform. If you don’t eat healthily or if you don’t eat enough, you run the risk of burning yourself out or overworking your body which can be harmful to your health. The recommended calorie intake varies for each sport, so check in with your coach or a dietician for advice. Because you are training rigorously, it’s essential to get a second opinion from an expert to help you make nutritional choices. Even if you compete in a sport like long-distance running in which it helps to be lean, remember that your calorie intake should be much higher that the average person’s because of the amount you burn daily. Always wait at least half an hour between eating and starting your daily training."

      "title": "Hydrate continuously throughout the day.",
      "content": "Hydrate continuously throughout the day. Because athletes training for the Olympics sweat so much throughout their training, they have to drink many more glasses of water than the recommended eight glasses a day to ensure they won’t get dehydrated. If you are exercising intensely for several hours a day, aim to drink half your body weight in fluid ounces of water. [7] X Research source Drink a beverage with a three to one ratio of carbohydrates and protein after your workouts, like chocolate milk. Carbohydrates will restore what you lost during your workout and the protein will help rebuild your muscles.

      "content": "Have a strong support system. A good support system is an often-overlooked aspect of being a successful athlete.

      "title": "Keep your balance mentally.",
      "content": "Keep your balance mentally. Training for the Olympics is not only physically challenging: it also requires an incredible amount of mental strength. Keeping your focus while still taking care of yourself and maintaining your relationships with others isn't easy. That's why many people training for the Olympics try out a number of techniques to stay healthy mentally. Meditation is also a good way to relax your body and your mind, especially when practiced regularly. Learn how to meditate through a class or by reading resources online. Visualization, or imagining yourself achieving your goal, is a powerful technique that can help you before a major competition. Remember to always listen to your body and to your own needs."

      "content": "Use physical trainers and massage therapists to prevent injury. Training for the Olympics puts you more at risk of injury than the average athlete, both because of the stunts that you may perform and the sheer number of hours that you spend training. Meet with a physical trainer who can do an assessment of your fitness and your risk of injury. The physical trainer may assign you exercises that reduce your risk of injury for preventative care. Many athletes also find that having weekly massages as well as visiting the sauna helps to relax muscles, which in turn reduces the chance of injury. Always consult with a physical therapist or movement specialist before engaging in any kind of high-intensity training. They'll be able to assess your physical history and warn you of any risks to your body associated with working out intensely.
