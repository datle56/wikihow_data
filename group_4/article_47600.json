[1] X Expert Source Veronica Tharmalingam Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. Light colored jackets can be offset with dark colored shirt choices and vice versa. Wear a graphic tee for a trendier look. [2] X Research source When selecting a graphic tee or similar shirts, choose ones with designs on the front-middle of the shirt. This way others can see the design when your jacket’s unbuttoned. When wearing a tee, elaborate shoes might clash with your casual look. Try sneakers, simple boat shoes, or a casual, low-cut boot. Simple patterns, like horizontal stripes, can add pop to your ensemble. [3] X Research source More complex patterns, like paisley, may draw attention away from your jacket."

      "content": "Choose khaki pants for a versatile outfit. Khaki pants will provide a casual, laid-back look with nearly any shirt and jean jacket combo.

Pair traditional khakis with a jean jacket and a button down shirt for a look that might be described as “rugged gentleman.” Brown accessories, like belts and bracelets, and brown footwear, like derbies and oxfords, work well with traditional khaki pants. Oxblood colors add a rich, refined warmth to this look."

      "content": "Get preppy with a polo shirt. When headed out for a date or for a night out with the boys, a polo can add a touch of sophistication to your look. The contrast between the preppiness of the shirt and the ruggedness of the jacket can create a playful yet slightly edgy appearance. Much like normal tees, single-color polos and those with simple designs, like horizontal stripes, do well when paired with a jean jacket. Add to this look with an accessory, like a watch, necklace, or bracelet. Preserve your sophisticated look by wearing a simple belt with polos. Avoid casual footwear, like sneakers, with this style. Slightly formal shoes, like loafers or derby shoes, work best. [4] X Research source"

A plain white shirt will work with all colors of jacket. To create a smoother blend between outer and lower layers, choose colored shirts that complement your jacket’s color. A simple tie can make this outfit slightly more formal. Ties with complicated designs will likely be too busy or distracting. Simple patterned dress shirts, like those with plaid, checked, or striped designs, can add some pop to this look."

      "content": "Wait at least six months before washing new jackets. Washing your jacket too soon could do harm to its fibers.

      "title": "Refresh your jacket with shower steam.",
      "content": "Refresh your jacket with shower steam. Hang your jean jacket on a wooden hanger in the bathroom when you’re taking a shower. Keep vents off and windows closed to build up the steam. The steam will smooth wrinkles and could even eliminate faint stains and odors. To preserve your jacket the longest, try a shower steam treatment before anything else. Water may condense on metal or plastic hangers. If too much water accumulates, it can stain your jacket or create streaks where it has dripped. When hanging your jacket, do so in a way that keeps it from the surfaces of the room. Your jacket may absorb dirtiness or excessive moisture from walls, doors, and so on."

      "content": "Soak your jacket in a distilled white vinegar solution. Fill a bucket, bathtub, or similar container with enough cold water to completely submerge the jacket. Add a half cup (118 ml) of vinegar to the water. Stir the solution to distribute the vinegar, then soak your jacket in it for roughly half an hour. Treating your jacket with vinegar will help maintain its color. This is especially useful for dark colored jackets, which sometimes transfer dye to other clothing, furniture, and so on. Although vinegar has a potent smell, when your jacket dries this smell will disappear. Leftover solution can be disposed of down a drain."

      "content": "Air dry your jacket. Machine drying your jacket will dry it more quickly, but the heat from the dryer will cause its fibers to break down, weaken, and fray. Hang your jean jacket from a clothesline, a hanger, or on the back of a chair to let it air dry. [8] X Research source When hanging or draping your jacket to dry, pull on the fabric to straighten wrinkles. This will reduce the amount of wrinkling in the dried jacket."
