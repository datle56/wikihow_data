It’s also a good idea to have a miscellaneous category for any odds and ends that don’t fit into a specific grouping. [1] X Research source While you’re sorting your LEGO pieces, you may want to have interim containers to separate them into, so you stay organized. Plastic grocery bags are an ideal option."

      "content": "Sort your bricks and other pieces by hand to separate them by size. Eyeball the different pieces and put ones that are the same or similar sizes together. It’s up to you how specifically you want to group the sizes. [2] X Research source For example, you can put all the 1X1 pieces together, all the 2X1 pieces together, and so on if you want to get really precise and keep only pieces that are the exact same size together. Or, you can put all pieces that are 1x beams together, no matter the length, all 2x blocks together, and so on to group things together more generally."

[3] X Expert Source Robert Rybarski Organizational Specialist Expert Interview. 31 January 2020. Sorting by color alone can make it difficult to find specific bricks or accessories that you want, but dividing your collection even further can help organize it effectively. You might sort by color and type, so all your red bricks are in one spot and all your red beams are in another. You can also sort by color and size, so all of your blue 2x4 plates are in one container and your red 2x4 plates are in another. [4] X Research source Start by sorting the LEGO bricks according to type or size, and then further sort the pieces by color. Sorting your LEGO bits by color is best for collectors who like to build sculptures and mosaics."

      "content": "It’s easier to have pieces stored together when you want to build the original sets over and over again. If you’ve kept the LEGO bricks in their original packaging, you’ll easily be able to sort the pieces. If you haven’t kept the boxes from your sets, it helps to locate the instruction booklets from your sets because they include a listing of all the pieces from the sets, so you can identify the LEGO pieces that should be gathered together. [5] X Research source When you don’t have the original packaging on hand, you may want to sort the LEGO bricks into small containers before placing them into a larger storage system. That’s because storing them each in their own bin, basket, or other storage option may take up too much room if you have many specialized sets. Zip-top bags or other small plastic storage bags are inexpensive and work well. It’s a good idea to place the instruction booklet from each set in the bags along with the pieces. Not only will it prevent you from losing the booklet, it can help you identify which set is which when you have several bags in a single bin, basket, or container. Creative builders may be frustrated if they store their collection by set because it’s more difficult to locate specific pieces when you’re building your own creation."

      "content": "Keep track of the pieces you’re using for a week or so to identify your favorites. This can help even if you instinctively know which LEGO pieces are your favorites. It also helps to create specific categories, so you know how to sort the pieces. For example, you might decide on “Most Frequently Used,” “Used Regularly,” and “Used Rarely” categories. [6] X Research source Sorting by favorites or frequency of use is a good method if you’re organizing a child’s LEGO collection because it can help you identify pieces that you may be able to get rid of when your child needs room for other toys, books, or belongings. Place the LEGO pieces into containers based on accessibility. You’ll want to put your favorite or most used pieces and sets in the bins or containers that are easiest to access. That might mean placing them on the top shelf of your storage unit -- or the lowest, if you’re sorting for children."

      "content": "Purchase enough plastic bins to hold your LEGO collection. Place your sorted LEGO bricks in the containers. When you’re sorting your pieces in your bins, you don’t want to overload them or it will be difficult to find pieces when you’re working on a project. Having the LEGO pieces in a single layer in each bin is ideal because it makes it easier to see all of the pieces. [7] X Research source Clear bins or boxes work especially well because you can easily see what’s inside. However, if you’re color sorting your LEGO bricks, you may want to color code your bins. For example, choose red bins for your red pieces and blue bins for your blue pieces. It helps to buy bins in a variety of sizes, so you can customize your storage based on the size of the pieces. Small pieces, such as Technic pins, clips and hinges, can get lost in large bins, so smaller boxes are a better choice. If you are storing small LEGO pieces in a larger bin, you may want to place them inside a Ziploc or other plastic bag to make them easier to locate when you’re building. Bins do not need to be boring but can also be seen as being part of an interior so that it does not become a focal point [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Purchase a storage cabinet or drawer system that fits your LEGO collection. Depending on the size of your collection, you can opt for simple plastic drawer sets that only have a few drawers or more elaborate cabinets with many drawers. For example, drawer systems that are usually used to hold crafting or hardware supplies are great. [9] X Research source As with plastic bins, storage cabinets that feature clear drawers are the best option because you can easily see what LEGO pieces are inside. Look for drawer systems that provide different sizes of drawers, so you can easily organize your collection based on the size of the pieces."

      "content": "It may make sense to store multiple types of LEGO bricks and pieces in a single drawer. To prevent them from becoming mixed up, it helps to have a drawer organizer with different compartments, so you can separate the pieces based on your chosen sorting system. [10] X Research source Drawer organizers are available at office and home supply stores. They come in a variety of sizes and some are even customizable, so you can create the ideal storage for your LEGO bits."

      "content": "This way, you’ll know exactly where to find all your pieces. Even if your bins are clear or if your storage cabinet has drawers made of clear plastic, it’s a good idea to label them with the contents, so you don’t have to go searching for a certain piece in the middle of a build. For the most organized collection, be as specific as possible when creating the labels. [11] X Research source A label maker is obviously ideal for creating labels for your drawers, but you can also easily create custom labels on your computer as well and tape them to the bins or drawers. A creative way to label things is to cut the small pictures from the original boxes your LEGO sets came in and use them to identify what is in each bin or drawer and keep a precise inventory of what you have. Laminating the pictures will help increase the durability."

      "content": "One of the benefits of using this type of storage is that they’re versatile. You can stack the bins full of LEGO bits on a bookcase or shelving unit, stash them in a closet, or even tuck them under a bed to keep them out of sight. In a child’s bedroom or playroom, you may want to simply stack them on the floor, so it’s easy for your child to access them. Storage drawers can also go in a closet or be placed against a wall in the room you build your LEGO creations in. [12] X Research source For example, if you’re sorting a LEGO collection for your child, consider organizing the pieces in drawers and lining a wall of your kid’s playroom with them. Or, use skinny bins that fit under your child’s bed."

      "content": "These types of containers are usually divided into several compartments. This makes it extremely easy to sort your LEGO pieces and keep them separated. You can store the boxes on shelves or tables, but they’re also portable, which makes them ideal for taking your LEGO collection on the go. [13] X Research source A tool, tackle, or craft box works best for a small collection. If you have many pieces to hold, you may need multiple boxes. Avoid boxes with removable dividers because they are usually flimsy, and your LEGO pieces may end getting mixed together when you move the box around."

The organizer’s pockets make it easy to keep your sorted bricks and pieces separated, and the clear plastic allows you to see what’s inside. [14] X Research source This works best for smaller LEGO collections, since these types of hanging shoe organizers have a limited amount of space."
