      "content": "Determine if you have a first or second degree burn. A first-degree burn is a minor burn, but a second-degree burn will have further damage to the skin's layers. Second-degree burns will also have blistering, pain, redness, and bleeding. These may require different treatment or professional care, so it's important to understand what level of burn you have. To tell if you have a first-degree burn, look for the following: [1] X Research source Ziyad Alharbi, Andrezj Pialkowski,Rolf Dembiaski et al Treatment of Burns in the First 24 Hours: A Simple And Practical Guide by Answering Ten Simple Questions In A Step By Step Form, Review 2012 World Journal of Emergency Surgery 7:13 doi 10 1186/1749 7922-7-13 Redness to just the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) Damage to the skin, but no blistering Pain similar to that of a sunburn Stinging, but no broken skin If you develop large blisters, the burn covers a large area of your body, or if you notice infection (like oozing from the wound, severe pain, redness, and swelling), get medical attention before trying to treat the wound at home.

      "title": "Cool the skin.",
      "content": "Cool the skin. Place the burned skin under cool running water for 20 minutes. This should help to lower the temperature of your skin. If you don't want to stand next to running water for that long, fill a bowl with cool water and soak the burn in the bowl. You may want to add some ice cubes to the bowl, since the water could warm up quickly. But, make sure the water just remains cool, not cold. Avoid using ice cold water to run over or submerge your skin. It can damage the delicate and already injured tissue if you cool it down too quickly. If you use a bowl, make sure it's big enough to completely submerge your burn in the water."

      "title": "Ice the burn if you still feel pain.",
      "content": "Ice the burn if you still feel pain. If you're still feeling pain after cooling the burned area with water, apply ice. Be sure to wrap a washcloth or paper towels around the ice pack to create a barrier. Press the wrapped ice, ice pack, or even a bag of frozen vegetables, against the burn. Leave it on for around 10 minutes, but move the ice to different spots every few minutes if it gets too cold.

You may instead wet a clean cloth with cold water and use it as a cool compress if you don't have any ice.

      "content": "Apply an antibiotic and wrap the burn if blisters develop. By this point, you should be feeling relief from the pain. You should only need to dress the burn if it's developing a blister (making it a second-degree burn). Dress the burn by simply patting the burned area dry. Generously cover the burn with a topical antibiotic, like Neosporin, and cover it with clean gauze. Tape the pad in place or wrap the gauze around the burn for extra flexibility. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Most first-degree burns won't require antibiotics and bandaging. Instead, apply a natural moisturizer, like aloe vera, throughout the day. [6] X Research source Take care to change the dressing every day, until the skin looks normal."

      "content": "Apply aloe vera gel. [10] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. Spread aloe vera gel directly on the burned area. You should notice a cooling sensation on your skin. Studies have shown that aloe vera may also help heal the burn faster, since it's an effective moisturizer. If you purchase a skin product containing aloe vera, look for one that contains mainly aloe vera with as few additives as possible. Aloe vera gels which contain alcohol, for example, can actually irritate and dry the skin. Avoid spreading aloe vera gel on broken skin or open blisters. This could cause infection."

Hold the can 6 to 9 inches away and spray the burned area. You should notice numbness within 1 to 2 minutes. Don't use topical anesthetic spray for more than 7 days. If the pain is still noticeable or irritating, see your medical provider. [11] X Research source"
