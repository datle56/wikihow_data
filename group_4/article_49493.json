      "content": "Know when to write a formal letter . Write a formal letter when addressing someone you only know in a professional capacity. This includes letters written to government departments or businesses, instead of a known individual. These letters should be typed, then printed. You can use any text editing software to do this, such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, or Text Edit. If the letter is urgent or the recipient prefers email, you can send an email instead. When addressing your current boss or coworker, you can be slightly less formal. Email is usually fine, and you don't need an address at the top of the page."

You may use the last name, or the full name (first and last), but never the first name alone. Include an abbreviated professional title if applicable. If you know the job title but not the person's name, you may write \"Dear Health Inspector:\" or a similar phrase. It's usually possible to find the name with an online search, so try that first. If you don't have a specific contact, write \"Dear Sir or Madam:\" or \"To Whom It May Concern:\". These sound a little stiff and old fashioned, so try to avoid it when possible.

Do not use contractions (write are not instead of aren't ), and phrase questions formally ( Would you be interested in...? instead of Do you want to...? ). Proofread the letter for spelling and grammar when finished, or ask a friend to help you. [5] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source If you are writing on official business, keep it short and direct. If you are writing a distant relative or an acquaintance for social reasons, you can be a little more conversational. It's still best to keep it to under a page."

      "content": "Use a complimentary close. A complimentary close ends your letter on a good note and establishes a connection with the recipient. Make two hard returns after the last paragraph of the letter, then write the complimentary close. For formal letters, stick to \"Sincerely yours,\" \"Kindest regards,\" or \"Best wishes.\" Sign underneath the close, as follows: For typed formal letters, leave about four spaces between the complimentary close and your typed full name. Print the letter, then sign your name in blue or black ink in that blank space. In a formal email, type your full name after the complimentary close. You may use a courtesy title for yourself when you put your name at the end of a formal letter. For instance, a married woman could sign as \"Mrs. Amanda Smith.\""

Consider these guidelines: If you're writing to a distant or elderly relative, or a social acquaintance, write a semi-formal letter. If that person has sent you emails before, you may email them as well. If not, a handwritten letter is a safer bet. If you're writing a friend or close family member, an email or handwritten letter are both fine."

Use the first name if that's how you talk to each other, or the courtesy title (Mr or Ms) if not. If you're writing an informal letter , you can use \"Dear\" or \"Hello,\" as well as more informal greetings such as \"Hi\" or \"Hey.\" Follow it with the first name."

Thank you!\" Whatever the subject is, sharing information should be the focus of the letter.

A letter written in anger or to solicit pity is probably not a letter you should send.

This was originally a formal style, but you can have fun with it when writing a light-hearted letter to a friend. For example, the last paragraph of your letter could read \"I remain, as ever, your devoted servant,\" and then your name. If you want to add something after the letter's written, use P.S, which means Postscript (\"after the writing\")."
