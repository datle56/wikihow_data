      "content": "Hold your foot under cool running water for 10-15 minutes. Cool the area off immediately after you receive the burn. Use running water to flush away any particles and bacteria in the wound. For a burn on your foot, going into the shower or bathtub and holding your foot under the faucet is easiest. If you’re outdoors, a garden hose could work as well.

Any contamination could cause a serious infection. Do not use ice or ice water. Very cold water can cause further skin damage. Use cool to comfortably cold water. Do not wash out the burn with soap or scrub it in any way. Only run it under cool water. Do not blow on the wound to cool it off. This spreads germs into the burn.

      "content": "Use a cold compress or water in a bowl if running water isn’t available. While running water is best, use other methods of cooling the area off if you have to. Dip your foot into a bowl of cool water if you have it. If the skin over the burn is still intact, you can also use a cold compress wrapped in a towel. If the burn is severe enough that skin is burned away, don’t apply a could compress. The towel could get stuck to the wound and cause further damage. Remember to make sure any water you use is clean."

      "content": "Remove any clothing around the burn area while holding it under water. If you have a sock or shoes on, do your best to remove them. Work them off gently to avoid causing more pain. If the clothing is directly over the burn, leave it in place. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Do not pull off any clothing or objects that are stuck to the skin. This will cause more damage. Continue running the wound under water and see if the object dislodges by itself. Otherwise, leave it and let the doctor remove it."

      "title": "Determine the degree of the burn.",
      "content": "Determine the degree of the burn. The severity of the burn determines how to proceed. After cooling the area and removing any clothing, get a good look at the burn. Assess its degree to determine how severe the burn is. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source First-degree burns are minor. They only affect the outer layer of skin and cause redness, swelling, and minor pain. Second-degree burns affect deeper skin layers. They cause deep redness, more intense pain, and blistering. Third-degree burns completely burn away the outer layer of skin. The skin may be black or white. You may also feel numbness due to nerve damage. Never try to treat a second or third degree burn by yourself. These are serious injuries that require medical attention immediately."

      "content": "Call your doctor if the burn is severe or covers a large area of your foot. Minor first-degree burns that cover a small area can be treated at home without a doctor's intervention. Burns over large areas, like the entire bottom of your foot, require a doctor's attention. Additionally, second and third-degree burns on your foot always need medical attention, no matter how small. Call your doctor as soon as possible and explain the burn you received. Then follow their directions on how to proceed next. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Your doctor may want to inspect the burn firsthand. Make an appointment as soon as possible. If the burn is severe enough, your doctor may tell you to go to the hospital. Listen to these directions and receive medical attention as soon as possible.

Apply a very thin layer of moisturizer to the burn before wrapping it with gauze. [7] X Research source Use only gentle, fragrance-free moisturizers to avoid irritating your skin. If the skin is broken, check with your doctor before applying any lotion. The doctor may not recommend using lotion on more serious burns.

      "content": "Cover the burn with a bandage to prevent it from rubbing on your clothes. Even minor burns on your foot can be very painful because your socks and shoes rub against the injury. Use a sterile, non-stick bandage to cover the burn and prevent rubbing. Use a strip of medical tape to secure the bandage.

[10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Take all medication as instructed. Don’t double-up on doses or take them for longer than the instructions say. Make sure you don’t have any drug allergies before taking pain relievers. Allergies to NSAIDs are common."

      "content": "Avoid popping or breaking blisters. Blisters may form on more serious burns. Leave them alone. Blisters form to help your skin heal, and breaking them can cause an infection. Don’t scratch or pick at the burn, and wear loose-fitting shoes so the blisters don’t burst. [11] X Research source If the burn itches, take an antihistamine medication to prevent yourself from scratching. If the blisters grow very large and uncomfortable, talk to your doctor about it. They may want to drain the blisters. But never do this yourself."

      "title": "Wear loose-fitting shoes or sandals.",
      "content": "Wear loose-fitting shoes or sandals. Tight shoes will rub against the burn and cause pain. Try wearing your loosest pair or getting a pair a size bigger to make walking easier. Alternatively, wear open sandals that don’t rub against the spot your burn is in. [12] X Research source Consult your doctor about getting a pair of orthopedic shoes while you recover. These are designed for comfort and support, and may make your recovery process much easier. If your skin is broken and you do wear sandals, be sure to wrap your burn well. Dirt and bacteria could enter the wound when you go outside."

      "content": "Cover the burn with sterile, non-stick gauze. Keep the burn covered to prevent bacteria and dirt from causing an infection. Covering the wound also prevents your socks or shoes from rubbing on the burn, which helps with the pain. Get sterile, non-stick gauze from a pharmacy and wrap your foot loosely. If you have to, use some surgical tape to secure the gauze. [13] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Do not wrap the surgical tape around your foot. This cuts off the circulation and slows healing. Only put a strip along your skin so the gauze stays in place. Don’t use cotton or a similar product with fibers. These fibers will get stuck on your skin. Change your bandage at least once a day. Also change the bandage any time it gets wet."

      "content": "Keep your foot elevated for 24-48 hours to reduce swelling. More serious burns may cause significant swelling within the first 48 hours after the injury. If you’re experiencing swelling, elevate your foot to draw blood away from the area. For the best results, raise your foot above your heart level. [15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For a good elevation position, lay back on a couch. Then place your burned foot on the armrest. Place 1 or 2 pillows under your foot in bed to keep it elevated."

Walking with a cane can increase your mobility and decrease your pain levels. [18] X Research source Doctors sometimes rent canes to patients while they recover. Speak with your doctor to see if they provide this service or can point you towards someone who does. Some insurance plans cover canes and crutches if you need them. Check with older relatives or neighbors to see if they have an extra cane lying around."
