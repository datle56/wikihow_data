      "title": "Ask yourself why you cheated.",
      "content": "Ask yourself why you cheated. There are many reasons for cheating in a relationship. Sometimes the cheater feels as if the current relationship is ending anyway. Other times the cheating is a way to seek out thrills or experience something exciting that isn’t happening in their relationship. Still, there are more reasons - most of which are complicated. If you intend to discuss cheating with your partner, be prepared to answer the question “Why?”"

      "content": "Decide if you want to continue your relationship with your partner. If you do not want to continue your current relationship, it might be best to just end it and not put your partner through the pain of knowing you cheated. If you plan to continue your current relationship, you’ll need to weigh the pros and cons of being honest with your partner against the amount of pain that honesty will bring. You should realize, though, that these kinds of things usually surface eventually, and it might be best to be honest up front. Even if you end the relationship, you need to tell your partner about the cheating if their health may be compromised by any sexually transmitted diseases as a result of your cheating. They have the right to seek medical care."

Whether your partner is confronting you or you have just decided that you need to be honest, the first step in this conversation is to confess. You need to take full responsibility of your actions. Even if you feel that the relationship wasn’t going well, you made the decision to cheat. Own up to that honestly. [2] X Research source The focus should be on you. Instead of saying “You didn’t make me feel good in our relationship, so I cheated,” you should phrase it more like “I was feeling insecure in our relationship and I made a mistake. I cheated.”"

Why you cheated is irrelevant in this part of the conversation. Even if you feel that your actions were justified (or even if you aren’t sorry for the actual cheating), you have done something that hurt your partner. You should apologize for the pain that they are feeling as a result of your actions. [4] X Research source Your partner should be the focus of your apology. You should apologize directly to them. For example, “I am really sorry that what I’ve done is hurting you so badly.”"

      "content": "Answer any reasonable questions. Your partner will have many questions about your cheating. Most of the time they will want to know who the other person is, how long it has been going on, where you met the other person etc. Some partners will take this interrogation too far, though. You should explain that it is not helpful to answer questions about the actual “act.” These details are irrelevant to repairing your relationship and will only be painful to discuss for both of you. [5] X Research source If you partner asks something such as “How long has the cheating been going on,” you should respond with a direct answer like “It has been three months now.” If your partner asks questions like “What was it like being with the other person,” you should respond by respectfully redirecting the conversation “I know that you’re hurt, but talking about that will only cause more pain. We should focus on how to go on with our relationship.”"

You have to allow your partner to decide for themselves how they will react to your cheating. You can only be honest, you cannot decide how your honesty is received. Keep in mind that your partner does NOT have the right to react violently or to abuse you because of your cheating."

You know why you cheated, but now you need to really decide if you intend to do whatever it takes to stop the cheating, or if you will continue it or relapse into it later. If you want to stop cheating, you have to actively keep your promises. If you want to continue your promiscuity, you need to be honest with your partner about this. [14] X Research source Though it is not as common as monogamous relationships, you and your partner could consider things such as open relationships if you wish to stay together.

Most people agree that intercourse with another person is cheating, but the definition gets blurry from there. Is your partner okay with you talking to an ex online? Are you okay with them meeting a friend for dinner? These boundaries should be discussed early and often so that both partners know where they are. [16] X Research source"

Freely offering to give your partner access to these things will make it easier for him or her to trust you again. If you refuse to allow your partner to access these things, then he or she may suspect that you are still cheating with the same person or cheating with someone new. [19] X Research source If giving your partner total access to these accounts bothers you, then you might consider setting some ground rules, such as asking that your partner only check your accounts once per day or that your partner only check the accounts in your presence."
