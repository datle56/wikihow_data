      "content": "You must have First Move privileges to send the first message. In general, only women can send the first message on Bumble. But it's a little more complicated than that, depending on what you're doing on Bumble: Dating mode: Only women and non-binary people can start a conversation with someone of a different gender. If two men (or two people of the same gender) match, either can start the conversation. [1] X Research source BFF mode: BFF mode only displays people of the same gender, so either can write to the other first. Bizz mode: The gender rules are the same as in Dating Mode, but instead of only having 24 hours to write to a match, you'll have 7 days to start the conversation."

You have 24 hours from the time you match with someone to start a conversation with them (unless you're in Bizz mode—then you'll have 7 days). At that point, the other person has 24 hours to respond. Once they've responded, you'll have an official match, and the time limit will no longer apply. [2] X Research source"

If you see a green circle around the person's profile photo, that person is a \"Beeline\" match, which means they've swiped right on you, but you haven't swiped right on them.

      "title": "Start with an open-ended question.",
      "content": "Start with an open-ended question. It's hard to come up with things to talk about if you don't know anything about a person. That's why questions are great conversation starters. What was it about their profile that made you want to swipe right? Do you have anything in common? If so, think of a question you could ask them about that topic. When you ask a question, you're likely to get an answer. If you both like hiking and/or the outdoors, ask about their favorite local hikes. Did they mention any bands or TV shows you both like? Ask what they thought about the latest album or episode, or what they'd recommend you listen to or watch. Are they a student? If they haven't mentioned what they study in their bio, ask them! You could also ask what they think of their program and what types of classes are involved. If you're at a loss, you already have one thing in common with the person—you're both on Bumble! Ask them what's the worst line they've heard, whether they've met any weirdos, or what they're looking for. Try to avoid yes-or-no or one-word answer questions, as they can be conversation stoppers."

      "title": "Comment on a photo.",
      "content": "Comment on a photo. Even after you ask a question, you could run out of things to talk about. One thing that could keep the conversation going is to bring up things in their photos. Pets: One thing is for sure—everyone loves talking about their pets. Have they shared photos of their dog or cat? Tell them how cute their pet is, or how much you love that type of animal. Ask how old their dog is, or how many pets they have. Books: Do you see a book you've both read in one of their photos? Tell them you've read it and ask what they thought. If they've shared a photo of a place you've been or recognize, ask what they thought about it, or tell a funny story about a time you've been there."

      "title": "Appeal to the person's sense of humor.",
      "content": "Appeal to the person's sense of humor. If the person's profile shows that they have an oddball or sarcastic sense of humor, a funny GIF or cheesy pickup line could make them laugh (in a good way). Self-deprecating humor can be a great ice breaker, but don’t be too self-deprecating—you don't want them to doubt your self-confidence. Avoid joking about controversial or political subjects until you've built a rapport."

      "content": "Show genuine interest. People on Bumble could be chatting with many matches at once. If you want this person to keep talking to you, make sure they know you are interested in getting to know them in particular. Don't be afraid to compliment. Everyone loves a compliment, but too many (or too personal) compliments can make people uncomfortable. If you think a person is attractive, tell them! [3] X Expert Source Shana Tibi Certified Professional Matchmaker Expert Interview. 19 October 2021. If you're enjoying the conversation, tell them you'd love to meet in person, or at least have a phone or FaceTime conversation to see if there's a spark. Don't just talk about yourself. Continue asking questions and you'll keep getting answers!"
