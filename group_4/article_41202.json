      "title": "Avoid caffeine or other stimulants for 6 hours before bedtime.",
      "content": "Avoid caffeine or other stimulants for 6 hours before bedtime. Coffee, soda, and other stimulants can leave you feeling restless and fidgety before bed, which contributes to kicking. Stop drinking any caffeinated beverages at least 6 hours before you go to bed. This ensures that all the caffeine leaves your body and reduces your restlessness. Sugary foods like ice cream, cookies, and candy are stimulants as well. If you snack before bedtime, stick to foods without processed sugar. Nicotine is also a stimulant, so smoking before bed can have a similar effect."

      "content": "Keep your immune system strong with a healthy diet. There is some correlation between a suppressed immune system and restless sleeping. Try improving your diet with immune-boosting foods. Build a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables to get the nutrients you need, and avoid sugary or processed foods. Vitamins A, C, and E, plus zinc and iron, are especially important for immunity. They’re all in leafy green vegetables, squash, poultry, fish and shellfish, and fresh fruits. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Foods high in sodium and saturated fats can suppress your immunity. Avoid processed foods and limit your red meat intake to 2 servings per week. If you don’t get enough nutrients from your daily diet, take multivitamin supplements to keep your immunity up."

      "content": "Take iron supplements if your blood is low in iron. Iron deficiencies are a cause of restless legs syndrome. This condition causes a burning sensation in the legs, resulting in a strong urge to kick or fidget throughout the day and at night. [4] X Research source The daily recommended dose of iron is 8 mg for men and 18 mg for women. [5] X Research source Keep your daily intake within these ranges through your normal diet or with over the counter iron supplements. Before starting on iron supplements, speak with your doctor to determine if you do have an iron deficiency. This only takes a simple blood test. Take the supplements exactly as directed. It’s possible to overdose on them, which causes other adverse effects. Foods that are high in iron are fortified cereals and dairy products, shellfish, beef, and beans. Constipation is a common side effect of iron supplements. Try to increase your fiber intake or use a stool softener to help."

      "content": "Reduce your stress to have a more peaceful sleep. Stress can cause all kinds of sleep disturbances, including kicking and thrashing. Stress may be especially to blame if your nighttime kicking started suddenly. Consider if you’ve just experienced something stressful, like problems at work or in your relationships. If you’re feeling stressed out, take some steps to relax and have a calmer sleep. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Aerobic exercise is a great way to reduce stress. If you’re not very active, try going for a walk or jog a few times per week. Exercise releases hormones that improve your mood and help you avoid anxiety. Any activities you enjoy are good stress-reducers as well. Listening to music, knitting, reading, or playing video games can help you escape a stressful mindset. If you feel overwhelmed by stress, consider speaking to a therapist for help alleviating your anxiety."

      "content": "Maintain a healthy body weight. Being overweight can cause several sleep disorders like sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. If you’re overweight, speak with your doctor to find out what a healthy body weight for you is. Then, exercise and adjust your diet to lose excess body fat and maintain a healthy weight. [7] X Research source Consider your diet if you want to lose weight. If you drink a lot of soda and sugary drinks, cutting these out would be a big reduction in your daily calories. Try to cook more meals at home. Restaurant food and prepared meals are usually very high in salt and fat, even if the food seems healthy. Commit to exercising for 30 minutes each day. Even a light walk is better than not exercising at all. Make sure to stretch or massage your legs after you work out to help relieve mild symptoms."

      "content": "Visit a doctor if you’ve ever had a head injury. If you’ve ever had a serious head injury, then nighttime kicking could be a result of undiagnosed damage. Even if you sought medical attention for the injury in the past, doctors may have initially missed something. Think back and try to remember if you’ve ever had a bad head injury. Visit the doctor for further testing to see if it left any damage. Any head injury that results in unconsciousness is serious and requires medical attention. Also see a doctor if you receive an injury that causes a bad headache, confusion, dizziness, or nausea. Testing for a head injury usually involves a CT scan or an electrical test of the brain’s activity. None of these tests are painful or invasive.
