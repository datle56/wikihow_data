      "content": "Place the 2 lines side by side, overlapping by about 6 in (15 cm). Put the 2 lines running parallel to each other, with the line to the reel and the line to the leader running in opposite directions. Overlap them by approximately 6 in (15 cm) so you will be able to create a loop with both of the lines where they overlap. [1] X Research source The surgeon’s knot can be used to tie together both lines of equal and unequal sizes."

      "content": "Form a loop with both of the lines. Grab both of the lines at the right-hand side. Curl them into a loop, crossing back over the top of the lines where they run parallel. [2] X Research source Overlap the loop with the 2 parallel lines enough to tie a double overhand knot. A double overhand knot is just a regular overhand knot , the most basic knot you probably already know how to tie, but with an additional pass through the loop."

      "title": "Pull both ends of the lines through the loop.",
      "content": "Pull both ends of the lines through the loop. Slide the ends of the loop under the parallel lines and pull them up through the loop to start tying a double overhand knot. This part is just like tying a standard overhand knot. [3] X Research source If you don’t have enough slack to tie an overhand knot, then start over and make a bigger loop."

      "content": "Wrap the ends around the lines and pull them through the loop again. Cross the ends of the loop back over and under the 2 lines. Pull the ends up through the loop to make a double overhand knot, leaving the loop loose. [4] X Research source The double overhand knot will look like a little braid at this point. You can make a third pass through the loop if you want to make what’s called a triple surgeon’s knot."

Pinch the 2 ends on the left-hand side between the fingers on your left hand and the 2 ends on the right-hand side between the fingers on your right hand. Pull on all the lines simultaneously to cinch the knot closed. [5] X Research source The knot will now look like a tight little “X” shape."

Cut them down as close to the knot as you can to finish tying the lines together. [6] X Research source The surgeon’s knot is very strong for how simple it is to tie. This makes it a great first knot to learn for tying 2 lines together!"

Overlap the ends by at least 6 in (15 cm) to give yourself enough line to tie the knot with. The double uni knot is a simple and fast way to tie any 2 lines together. It’s a strong and reliable knot that works for all types of fishing line."

Take the end of the loop you just made and wrap it around both lines where they overlap, pulling the end through the center of the loop. Leave the loop loose while you wrap the lines.

Grab 1 in each hand and pull them in opposite directions to bring your 2 uni knots together into 1 double uni knot. [7] X Research source The double uni knot has a strength rating of about 90% and will hold your lines together in almost all fishing scenarios."
