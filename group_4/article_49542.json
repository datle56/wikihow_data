      "content": "Follow a meter. The meter of the limerick is the number of beats, or stressed syllables, in each line. A limerick will follow a meter that goes 3, 3, 2, 2, 3. You can also use \"da\" for unstressed syllables and “DUM” for stressed syllables. Say “da” and “DUM” aloud to yourself as you compose each line to make sure you are stressing the right words. The meter will look like: [3] X Research source Line 1: Three stressed syllables (da DUM da da DUM da da DUM) Line 2: Three stressed syllables (da DUM da da DUM da da DUM) Line 3: Two stressed syllables (da DUM da da DUM) Line 4: Two stressed syllables (da DUM da da DUM) Line 5: Three stressed syllables (da DUM da da DUM da da DUM)"

Think of an event or moment that made you laugh or giggle, recently or in the past. [4] X Expert Source Alicia Cook Professional Writer Expert Interview. 11 December 2020. For example, maybe you remember a funny event at a childhood birthday party that you can write about. Or perhaps you decide to write about an entertaining moment with your dog at the park earlier in the day."

Try brainstorming with a first line like, “There once was a girl named Sam” or “Once there was a fellow named Mark.” Then, think of absurd or silly things that can then happen to the subject of the poem.

You can start with a structure like “There once was” or “There was.” Make sure you follow the eight to nine syllable pattern for the first line. [9] X Research source For example, in a limerick by Edward Lear, the first line is: “There was an Old Person of Dover.” Another example is a limerick by Selina Wallis that begins with, “There once was a girl named Selina.”"

      "title": "Use one syllable words that rhyme.",
      "content": "Use one syllable words that rhyme. Choose words that relate to your subject or main character. Pick words that are one syllable long to make it easier for you to follow the syllable count for each line as well. [10] X Research source For example, you may start with a first line like, “There once was a shy boy named Mark.” You may then think of words that rhyme with “Mark” like “shark,” “lark,” or “park.” You can then build a story around these rhyming words."

      "content": "Describe the main character doing something funny or strange. Use strong verbs that convey a sense of immediacy and action. Pick an action that might make your reader laugh or giggle. For example, in the limerick by Edward Lear, the second line shows the old person from Dover doing something silly: “Who rushed through a field of blue Clover;” Another example is a limerick by an anonymous poet that opens with the lines: “A bather whose clothing was strewn/By winds that left her quite nude.”"

      "title": "Give the main character an obstacle or issue to overcome.",
      "content": "Give the main character an obstacle or issue to overcome. In the third and fourth line, the main character should be presented with a predicament that they must address. The obstacle could be another person or an animal. Maybe the main character falls or injures themselves. Pick an obstacle that might appear strange or a little ridiculous to the reader. For example, in the Lear limerick, the old person from Dover is confronted with an obstacle: “But some very large bees/Stung his nose and his knees.” In a limerick by Selina Wallis, the aspiring ballerina deals with an issue: “She went on her toes/And fell on her nose.”"

Maybe the main character has a sudden realization and makes a decision. Or perhaps the main character ends up doing something funny or ridiculous to get out of their predicament. [11] X Research source For example, the limerick by Edward Lear ends with the line: “So very soon he went back to Dover.” The poem is resolved when the old person realizes they needs to treat their bee stings and go back to their home. In the limerick by Selina Wallis, the ballerina realizes her injury means she cannot be dance anymore, and the last line is: “Then she became a cleaner.”"
