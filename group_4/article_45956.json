      "content": "Select virgin or refined coconut oil. Any coconut oil will work, whether it's labeled for hair or cooking. There are many types, however, so use this guide to find a quality oil: [2] X Research source A *\"virgin,\" \"extra-virgin,\" or \"unrefined\" label means the coconut oil has no added chemicals. A high quality virgin coconut oil should be pure white when solid, and clear when liquid. A \"refined\" or unlabeled product has probably gone through an industrial process. There are high- and low-quality examples, but they are difficult to evaluate without researching the brand. These tend to have a more mild scent."

      "title": "Check the label for extraction information.",
      "content": "Check the label for extraction information. Either type of oil can be extracted from the coconut in one of several ways. This is a little technical, and you can skip it without much harm done. For those interested in finding the perfect brand, here's a breakdown: \"Centrifuged\" oils tend to have a more mild scent, and little risk of damage. \"Expeller-pressed\" or \"cold-pressed\" oils range from mild to strong scented. Low-quality examples may have heat damage, which cause unpleasant burnt scents. \"Direct Micro Expelled\" (DME) oil tends to be high-quality, and created directly by coconut farmers. This may be difficult to find."

      "title": "Melt the oil (optional).",
      "content": "Melt the oil (optional). Virgin coconut oil melts at 76ºF (24ºC), so in temperate weather it may already melt as you apply it to your hair. If you prefer handling liquid oil, spoon about 2–3 tablespoons (30–45mL) coconut oil into a bowl. Place the bowl in a larger container and pour hot tap water into the larger container, until it reaches halfway up the bowl. The oil should turn liquid within a few minutes. Do not microwave the oil. While this probably won't make it less effective, it can make the oil dangerously hot. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Prevent water damage. As a pre-wash conditioner, coconut oil reduces hygral fatigue, or swollen, damaged hair caused by water exposure. It may also reduce damage caused by brushing and heat-treating wet hair. Massage a small amount of coconut oil onto the roots of your hair, and drag it down throughout all your hair. Make sure you use an old towel and no clothes as coconut oil stains clothes and towels. Leave the oil in for 10–20 minutes first to treat damaged hair as well. Keep it under a shower cap or plastic bag to prevent dripping and keep it warm. Wash and condition your hair as usual. Although your hair will be more resistant to damage, it won't be invulnerable. When convenient, avoid brushing and heat-drying wet hair to reduce damage."

      "content": "Prevent tearing. As a leave-in conditioner, coconut oil reduces damage caused by brushing or handling wet hair, and adds shine. Start with a pea-sized amount, and saturate the ends. Work your way up, adding a light layer to the middle and nothing at all to the roots. [5] X Research source Add a little more if necessary, but not so much that your hair feels greasy. Leave this in as long as you like. This technique will restore some strength to chemically treated hair, heat-damaged hair, and dry Afro-textured hair. If you have frizzy hair, this will tame your curls in the short term. However, since coconut oil penetrates the hair, your hair will frizz again over time. Mineral oil is more effective for this purpose, although it will not restore strength. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Restore strength and shine. A heavy application of coconut oil can restore strength and shine to dry, damaged hair. About once a week or whenever convenient, set aside some time for a big treatment. To start out, rub in the oil with your fingers, or dip a pastry brush into liquid oil. Massage it over all of your hair, focusing on dry or damaged areas. If you have thick or long hair, section it first and apply the oil in sections."

If you have severely damaged hair, leave the oil in for six hours to increase this to about 25%. [7] X Research source"
