      "content": "As a practical earth sign, Capricorn’s least compatible matches are with the zodiac’s spirited fire and air signs. Air signs Gemini, Aquarius, and Libra may seem flighty and inconsistent to steady Capricorn. Fire signs Sagittarius, Aries, and Leo are adventurous and high-energy compared to this methodical earth sign. The best zodiac matches are fellow earth signs Taurus and Virgo, plus water signs Pisces, Scorpio, and Cancer. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Libra",
      "content": "Libra Capricorn and Libra make a tense match. Libra is playful, flirty, and indecisive compared to a serious and practical Capricorn, who will likely find Libra’s spontaneity and lack of structure in life irritating. Capricorn is also blunt, which may cause friction with a soft-spoken, fair-minded Libra. And where Libra is chatty and outgoing, Capricorn prefers a limited social circle. This couple’s biggest challenge: Different interests and lifestyles. How to make it work: Libra can work to bring balance into Capricorn’s life (and guide them away from being a workaholic), while Capricorn can entice Libra by providing them with the stable, loving relationship they crave."

      "title": "Aries",
      "content": "Aries Both are cardinal signs (meaning they’re initiators and go-getters of the zodiac), but Aries loves to live in the moment, whereas Capricorn is thoughtful and cautious. Aries is also reckless and approaches life with a “me first” attitude, which might put off Capricorn. Meanwhile, Aries might get bored with a studious, hardworking Capricorn. This couple’s biggest challenge: Extremely contrasting personalities. How to make it work: Both signs are ambitious. Aries can use their boldness to help Capricorn reach for the stars, while Capricorn can give Aries some much-needed structure in their life."

    {
      "title": "Gemini",
      "content": "Gemini Gemini shares Capricorn’s rational nature, but that’s where the similarities end. Gemini is always on the move; they’re spontaneous and prefer to go with the flow, contrary to a stubborn, orderly Capricorn. Their energies and approaches to life will conflict, and Capricorn will be put off by Gemini’s lack of structured and planned life goals. This couple’s biggest challenge: Their conflicting values. How to make it work: Gemini and Capricorn can learn to respect one another’s differences and work together to achieve their goals, with Gemini providing the ideas and Capricorn hatching a plan for success."

    {
      "title": "Aquarius",
      "content": "Aquarius These signs are opposites in many ways, but Aquarius and Capricorn can be fast friends. Both signs have lofty ambitions in life, though they approach life differently; Aquarius is the intelligent, forward-thinking rebel of the zodiac, while Capricorn is more traditional in their way of thinking. Aquarius is also more relaxed and creative than a rigid Capricorn, which can cause tension. This couple’s biggest challenge: Their clashing characteristics and ideals. How to make it work: Both signs are clever and will naturally give one another the space they need. If they learn to value their differences and appreciate one another’s ideas, they’ll enjoy a mentally stimulating relationship."

    {
      "title": "Sagittarius",
      "content": "Sagittarius While Sagittarius and Capricorn both bring a ton of passion to a relationship, Capricorn might eventually decide that flirty, high-energy, inconsistent Sagittarius isn’t mature enough for them. Sagittarius will get impatient with Capricorn’s dedication to their work—fire sign Sagittarius wants to get out of the house, have fun, and enjoy new experiences as often as possible. This couple’s biggest challenge: Opposing personalities and energies. How to make it work: These signs can complete each other if they accept their differences! Sagittarius can help Capricorn loosen up, while Capricorn can offer Sagittarius structure and help them achieve their goals."

    {
      "title": "Leo",
      "content": "Leo Leo and Capricorn have the potential to be an incredible power couple, but their ambition and boldness can also be their undoing. Leo is typically outgoing and adventurous compared to a conservative Capricorn. Plus, Capricorn might think Leo is frivolous with money while Leo will think Capricorn is stingy, and their joint inflexibility can lead to arguments over whose way is “right.” This couple’s biggest challenge: Their stubbornness. How to make it work: Both signs are ambitious and competitive. So long as they keep their careers separate and become one another’s biggest supporters, they can build a beautiful relationship."

      "title": "Taurus",
      "content": "Taurus Two grounded earth signs make for one harmonious, unbreakable pair. Capricorn will appreciate Taurus’s dependability , and Taurus’s hardworking nature and affinity for making money will mesh well with Capricorn’s ambition and drive to succeed in life. Taurus also has an eye for luxury, so they can show Capricorn how to enjoy the finer things in life without being too extravagant. This couple’s biggest strength: Their values and work ethics. How to make it work: Both signs can be homebodies, but Capricorn craves the opportunity to expand their social (and professional) connections. This couple should try to get out of the house every now and again!"

      "title": "Virgo",
      "content": "Virgo Virgo’s practicality and intelligence are like a breath of fresh air for down-to-earth Capricorn. Virgo shows affection by helping the people they care about, making them a perfect partner to assist Capricorn in achieving their dreams—and Capricorn will be the same, always ready to help Virgo. Both signs are looking for the same thing in a relationship: committed, long-term stability. This couple’s biggest strength: Their similar personalities and outlook on life. How to make it work: Capricorn and Virgo both love routine so much they might get stuck! This couple should make a point to go on adventures and have fun every so often."

      "title": "Scorpio",
      "content": "Scorpio Secretive, mysterious Scorpio will instantly intrigue Capricorn —and as it turns out, they’ll find a lot to love about one another! Both signs are passionate (even if Capricorn hides it and seems somewhat aloof at first), so Scorpio’s emotional depth won’t be intimidating. Both will love the other’s ambition, determination, and boldness. This couple’s biggest strength: Passion and communication. How to make it work: Both signs are stubborn and may have difficulty resolving conflicts unless they learn how to compromise and understand one another’s perspectives."

    {
      "title": "Capricorn",
      "content": "Capricorn Two Capricorns will naturally have a lot in common. They share a love of protocol, so they’ll understand why it’s so important to show up on time for dates (or have an excellent reason for being late). They’ll feel more comfortable opening up to one another, and they both prefer to take things slow, so they’ll build a solid relationship built on friendship and respect. This couple’s biggest strength: Matching communication styles and ideals. How to make it work: Two driven perfectionists might forget to make time for the relationship! A Capricorn-Capricorn pair can use their organizational skills to add date nights and quality time into their busy schedules."

      "title": "Pisces",
      "content": "Pisces Dreamy water sign Pisces might seem too different from down-to-earth Capricorn, but they can build a fulfilling, harmonious relationship together. [2] X Research source Intuitive Pisces will know precisely how to make Capricorn feel special and appreciated, while Pisces will cherish the stability and care that Capricorn can give them. Capricorn can confide in Pisces, who will help them unpack their deepest emotions. This couple’s biggest strength: Complementary relationship goals. How to make it work: Capricorn is bolder and more assertive than Pisces, so Capricorn should encourage Pisces to make decisions more often—and Pisces should learn to stand up for themselves."

    {
      "title": "Cancer",
      "content": "Cancer Another emotionally-driven water sign, Cancer’s nurturing approach to relationships will attract Capricorn, who will appreciate having a caring partner to look after them. Meanwhile, Cancer is the most family-oriented of the signs and wants a stable, grounded relationship that Capricorn can provide them. [3] X Research source This couple’s biggest strength: Matching values. How to make it work: Cancer is more expressive than Capricorn and may demand more attention than Capricorn is prepared to give. Both signs should communicate their needs clearly and find a balance between their lifestyles."
