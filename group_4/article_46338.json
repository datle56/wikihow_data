      "content": "Check the items you want to enable snapping for. The options are as follows: Bounding box: This allows objects to snap to the bounding box that surrounds a selected object. Edges: This allows objects to snap to the edge of another object. Corners: This allows objects to snap to the corners of an object's shape. Edge midpoint: This allows objects to snap to the center point of a line or edge. Centers: This allows objects to snap to the center of another object. Nodes: This allows objects to snap to the nodes or vector points in an object's shape. Path intersections: This allows objects to snap to the point where two lines intersect. Cusp Nodes: This allows objects to snap to nodes or vector points where one curved line connects to another curved line curving in a different direction. Smooth nodes: This allows objects to snap to nodes or vector points that are part of a smooth line curve. Line midpoints: This allows objects to snap to a node or vector point that is in the middle of a straight line. Perpendicular lines: This allows objects to snap to a point where two perpendicular lines meet. Tangential Lines: This allows an object to snap to a point where one line touches another line. Other Points: This enables snapping for a variety of other points, which are listed below. Object midpoint: This allows objects to snap to the center point of another object. Object rotation centers: This allows objects to snap to the rotation point of another object. Text baselines and anchors: This allows objects to snap to the bottom left corner of text characters. Masks: This allows objects to snap to an object mask. Clips: This allows objects to snap to a point where a mask cuts off another object. Alignment: This allows objects to snap to an alignment with other objects. Nodes in same path: This allows nodes or vector points in the same line to snap to a straight level vertical or horizontal alignment. Same distances: This allows multiple objects to snap to an alignment that is the same distance from other objects. Grids: This allows objects to snap to the lines and corners of a grid. You must have the grid turned on to use this option. Guide lines: This allows objects to snap to any guidelines you have set on the page. Page borders: This allows objects to snap to the edges and corners of a page. Page margins: This allows objects to snap to any margins you have set for your page."
