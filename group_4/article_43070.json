    {
      "title": "Make a list of the things that you like about her.",
      "content": "Make a list of the things that you like about her. Don’t worry about organization. Jot down all the reasons you have for writing this letter. Even if it sounds weird, you can cross it out later. Focus on her actions and the way she makes you feel instead of only physical features. [1] X Research source For example, you might list her bright smile followed by the way she greets you in the morning. Write down your honest feelings. For example, her smile might light up a dark morning, which makes you look forward to school. That’s a heartfelt compliment you can include in your letter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start with why you’re writing the letter.",
      "content": "Start with why you’re writing the letter. Now it’s time to put your thoughts into the letter itself. Let her know that this is a romantic letter. That way, there’s no surprises and she reads the letter when she’s prepared for it. Mention that you have significant feelings to share and had to tell her. [2] X Research source For example, say, “You are an amazing person and deserve to know it.” Another possible introduction is “I didn’t know how to tell you how I felt, so I wanted to write this letter.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk about what she adds to your life.",
      "content": "Talk about what she adds to your life. Making her feel special involves more than flattering compliments. Maybe she’s a good friend who helped you through a difficult time. Being near her might help you be a better person. Telling her these things shows that you value her presence and that it means a lot to you. For example, you can say “You make me remember who I am” or “You make me unafraid to be me.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring up personal memories you have.",
      "content": "Bring up personal memories you have. Even if you haven’t spent a lot of time with her, come up with at least one memory. Most likely you’ll remember the day you first spotted her or the moment that made you like her. Use the memory to describe how she made you feel. [3] X Research source For instance, you can say, “I saw you across the classroom, and you were so stunning that I knew I had to talk to you. But you were so stunning I was speechless.” Reader Poll: We asked 1174 wikiHow readers, and 57% of them agreed that the memory they cherish the most about the person they like is the moment they first met them or felt sparks fly . [Take Poll]"
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss what you like about her.",
      "content": "Discuss what you like about her. Refer to the list you made earlier and avoid repeating anything you already mentioned. Find the details that feel meaningful to you and work them into short but powerful sentences. Compliment her, but don’t go overboard by writing a page of praises. [4] X Research source Some examples you can include are “You are kind to everyone and I love your big heart” or “I love how you laugh even when times are tough.” You can include some similes such as, “Your eyes are like a deep blue ocean.” Don’t overdo it and instead write your feelings in your own words."
    },
    {
      "title": "End the letter by thanking her.",
      "content": "End the letter by thanking her. Thank her for taking the time to read the letter. Tell her to continue to be an amazing person. Then you can tell her that you’d like to go on a date or be in a relationship. Say, “I’d like to take you on a date” or “I hope I can get to know you better, if that’s okay with you.\" She might not feel the same way you do. That’s normal, and she should always feel like that’s okay. Don’t pressure her or go overboard in planning a future together."

    {
      "title": "Read your first draft aloud.",
      "content": "Read your first draft aloud. Find a quiet place and read the letter to yourself. It might feel a little awkward at first, but keep going. Find any spots that sound awkward or don’t flow well. Read the letter at least one more time after that. This is a special letter, so make it as good as you can. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Note any mistakes you need to fix.",
      "content": "Note any mistakes you need to fix. Have a pen on hand and mark the errors as you read along. Draw lines when you need to reorganize sentences to make them sound better. Circle any words you need to change or correct. Cross out anything that sounds weird and remove or edit it. Don't be afraid to make notes too, like \"expand this section\" or \"add another example\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Check your spelling.",
      "content": "Check your spelling. Her name is a key part of the letter, and getting that wrong spoils everything you say. In addition, look up any long or difficult words you’re unsure about. Make sure you spell similar-sounding words such as “there” and “their” correctly. Also, edit out any Internet abbreviations or shorthand such as “u” or “ur.” [6] X Research source Spellings like “u” or “ur” are acceptable in text messages but look tacky on paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rewrite the letter neatly.",
      "content": "Rewrite the letter neatly. Take a deep breath, grab a clean sheet of paper, and write the letter again. Work slowly so your words are easy to read and understand. Include all the corrections you decided upon earlier. Get that final copy to look as good as she does. Use blue or black ink for the final letter. These colors are the easiest ones to read. You may also type your letter on a computer. Make sure to use any spell checker and grammar correction features in the word processing program you use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read the letter one last time.",
      "content": "Read the letter one last time. Read it aloud to yourself again. You may still notice some spots where you can improve the writing. Mark those spots and rewrite the letter again. It’s meant to be heartfelt and impressive, so the time spent rewriting is worth it when you create a letter you’re proud to hand to the girl you like. If you found any errors, then you will have to rewrite the letter a final time again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write your number on the letter to show she can call you.",
      "content": "Write your number on the letter to show she can call you. There’s no guarantee you’ll get a response, but she can call you or send you a text message if she has something to say. She might feel too nervous to respond face-to-face. As phone contacts, the two of you can talk in private. If you don't have a phone number that she can call, consider leaving your email or social media name."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include an envelope so she can write a response.",
      "content": "Include an envelope so she can write a response. She might feel more comfortable writing her response. Place the envelope inside your letter and give her time to respond. She may hand the envelope to you or mail it. It can take a few days, but no one else will see her response. [7] X Research source This envelope should be smaller than the one you are sending the actual letter in. If you can't find a smaller envelope, you can fold it up instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slip the letter into her desk or locker to stay anonymous.",
      "content": "Slip the letter into her desk or locker to stay anonymous. Look for a spot where she’ll quickly notice the letter, but no one else will. You know she’ll come back to these spots, and most likely no one else will see the letter before she does. Push the letter into the vent on her locker or leave it visible on her desk. If you leave it on her desk, hide the letter from others by sticking one end inside a book or between some papers. Alternatively, you can mail the letter to her."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the letter to her directly to make sure she gets it.",
      "content": "Give the letter to her directly to make sure she gets it. Hand delivery is tough, but you’re courageous. Talk to her when she’s alone and say, “I have something important to say to you.” This way, no one else has a chance to see the letter and she can read it when she’s ready."
