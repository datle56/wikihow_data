Each line is labeled in degrees, followed by “N” for “North” or “S” for “South.” Lines to the North of the equator 0° will be labeled with an “N,” while lines to the South of the equator will have an “S.” The number of degrees increases as you move farther North or South of the equator. [1] X Research source For example, New York City is located close to latitude line 40°N. This means that New York City is 40 degrees North of the equator. Sydney, Australia, is located near the latitude line 34°S. This means that Sydney is 34 degrees South of the 0° equator. Latitude lines range from 0°-180° North or South. Since 0° (the equator) sits exactly between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, 0°N and 0°S mean the same thing. 180°N is the geographic North Pole, while 180°S is the geographic South Pole. Since these are different locations, 180°N and 180°S are not the same."

The lines run North to South, beginning with the 0° longitude line located near London, U.K. Each line is labeled in degrees, followed by an “E” for “East” or a “W” for “West.” Lines to the East of 0° will be labeled with an “E,” while lines to the west of 0°will have a “W.” The number of degrees increases as you move farther East or West of 0°. [2] X Research source For example, New York City is located close to the longitude line 74°W. This means that New York City is 74 degrees west of the 0° longitude mark. Sydney, Australia, is located near the longitude line 150°E. This means that Sydney is 150 degrees east of the 0° longitude mark. The 0° longitude mark is called the prime meridian. Since it’s located exactly in between the Eastern and Western hemispheres, 0°E and 0°W mean the same thing. The opposite line, 180°, runs North to South in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As with 0°, 180°E and 180°W mean the same thing since the 180° line is located exactly between the Western and Eastern hemispheres."

For example, the latitude and longitude of New York City are roughly 40°N, 74°W. For Sydney, the coordinates are roughly 34°S, 150°E. [3] X Research source Your latitude and longitude won’t be exact when using a map or globe. For example, your map or globe may only show degrees in increments of 5° (that is, 40°, 45°, etc.). Use Google Maps to obtain more precise coordinates . For this exercise, you can use the latitude or longitude line nearest to the location you’re measuring. So for New York City, your coordinates might be 40°N, 75°W."

[4] X Research source On Google maps, your latitude and longitude will be displayed as positive or negative numbers, but no compass direction (that is, no N, S, E, or W). A positive latitude is East, while a negative latitude is West. A positive longitude is North, while a negative longitude is South. For example, New York City’s coordinates on Google Maps are roughly 40.753, -73.983. This means 40.753°N, 73.983°W."

For New York City, the latitude is 40 degrees, 45 minutes, and 11 seconds North. The longitude is 73 degrees, 58 minutes, and 59 seconds West.
