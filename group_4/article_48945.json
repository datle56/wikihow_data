      "title": "Stay in groups.",
      "content": "Stay in groups. The easiest way to stay safe as a crewmate is to work in groups. This will make it harder for an imposter to kill you. It will also allow other players to vouch for your whereabouts if a body is discovered. The more imposters there are in a game, the larger the group you will need to be safe. Imposters can multi-kill if they work together. If there are 2 imposters in a game, you will need to be in a group of 5 or more to be safe. If there are 3 imposters, you need to be in groups of 7 to be safe. (It may still be difficult to stay in such groups because players have different tasks and may not be always together. Keep in mind that groups can still lead to stack kills - and isn't an ultimate solution for everything.) When you connect to a game, the red number next to how many players the game allows tells you how many imposters the will be in the game. Be aware of sabotage events that are meant to break up groups. Some critical sabotage events (such as O2 depletion and reactor meltdowns) require the crewmates to make repairs within a certain number of seconds or else the crewmates lose. Be sure to stay in groups when taking care of all repairs. Other sabotages may trap crewmates in a room."

      "content": "Report dead bodies immediately. If you happen to come across a dead body, be sure to tap the report button right away. If another player sees you running away from a dead body, they will likely suspect you are the imposter and you will get voted out."

      "title": "Know what imposters can and can't do.",
      "content": "Know what imposters can and can't do. There are certain things only imposters can do and certain things imposters cannot do. Knowing what imposters can and can't do will help you win the game. Killing: Only imposters can kill other players. If you witness a murder, you know immediately that the murderer is the imposter. Killing animation will instantly move the killer to the very location of the body (if the imposter hadn't already been next to it) and the top half of the dead player's body will be chopped off, with a bone sticking out. A few seconds later, the body will 'drop', and you can see the collapsed half of the body lying on the ground. Report body immediately and tell everyone what you saw. Using vents: Only imposters and engineers can use vents to get around the map. If you see an imposter enter or leave a vent, you immediately have good evidence that they are the imposter. Call an emergency meeting and report what you saw if there is other evidence. Crewmates cannot see imposters when they are inside a vent, but imposters can. Note that engineers, a variant of a crewmate, can use vents too, but it has a cooldown. If you see a person use a vent, it is not sure proof but it is viable suspicion. With other evidence, it helps a lot. Tasks: Imposters cannot complete tasks, though they may stand in front of task stations to fool other players into thinking they are completing tasks."

      "content": "Complete tasks. When all tasks are completed, the crewmates win the game. You have a list of tasks you can complete listed in the upper-right corner. Complete all tasks to win the game, but be careful how you do the tasks. Visual tasks can confirm to other players that you are not an imposter. (if visual tasks are on) Other tasks may leave you vulnerable to the imposters."

    {
      "title": "Keep an eye on other players completing tasks.",
      "content": "Keep an eye on other players completing tasks. There are several ways to tell who is and who is not an imposter by watching other players complete tasks. The following are some examples: [1] X Research source Check the taskbar to make sure tasks are being completed if task updates are turned on. If you see a player complete a task without the green taskbar at the top moving, they probably didn't complete the task. While this may mean the player just hasn't ended the task either because they simply didn't like it or by mistake, this may be an indicator that they are an imposter. Be aware that some tasks have multiple steps in different locations. These tasks will not update until the task is completed in all locations. Some tasks take longer than others to complete. If you see a crewmate quickly complete a task you know is a long task, they could be an imposter. Many tasks are visual tasks . These are tasks that display some sort of visual animation when completed (such as emptying the chute). When you see a player complete a visual task, you know they are not the imposter. Visual tasks include emptying garbage (2 step), submitting a scan, clearing asteroids, and priming shields. This may not always work out in your defense, though, because there is a setting in which visual tasks can be turned off. [2] X Research source Common tasks are tasks assigned to all players. These include things like inserting a key (Polus) or swiping a card. If you have a common task, all players have the same task. If you do not have a common task, no players have it. If you see a crewmate completing a common task that you do not have, they are most likely an imposter."

      "content": "Use emergency meetings to plan a strategy. You don't just have to use emergency meetings to make accusations and discuss who the imposter is. You can also use them to make suggestions and plan a strategy. Let other players know you are going to complete a visual task or something else that clears your name. Also, make sure you talk during meetings or have a good reason for calling a meeting, otherwise other players may become suspicious."

      "content": "Do visual tasks in front of other players. Visual tasks confirm for other players that you are not the imposter. Doing visual tasks without other players around to see it is kind of a waste. Make sure to do visual tasks only when other players are around. Stay with verified crewmates. If you see a crewmate do a visual task, such as emptying garbage, submitting a scan, clearing asteroids, and priming shields, try and stick with them, because you know they are safe to be by them. If you can, try and verify yourself, too, otherwise the player you are staying by may become suspicious of you. Be aware that when you complete a visual task, it may make you a target for the imposter since other players know you are safe. Be extra careful to stay in large groups when doing these tasks."

Some sabotages (such as reactor meltdown and oxygen depletion) are critical sabotages that will cause crewmates to lose the game if they are not fixed in time. Be sure to fix sabotages when you can, but be aware that some sabotages can be used to set traps. Work in groups when possible. Complete your tasks as quickly as possible. Crewmates can also win among us when the green task bar fills up. If an imposter calls a sabotage, make sure you know which one it is. Oxygen Depletion or Reactor Meltdown (and sometimes lights) are critical to fix ASAP. If not fixed in time, the imposters will win. If it is a door sabotage, don't worry about fixing this unless you need to go into that room for a task. Comms sabotage isn't critical, but you won't be able to look at cams, see your list of tasks, and some other things until it is fixed."

While this may not be 100% incriminating, the following are examples of suspicious behavior that you should look out for: Players wandering around not completing tasks. Players standing too close to vents. Players not being able to explain what tasks they were doing. Players who are quick to make accusations without evidence. Standing too close to doors."

Keep the following in mind when faking tasks: Some tasks take longer than others to complete. Be aware of how long it takes to complete each task. If you move away from a long task after a couple of seconds, people will start to suspect you are an imposter. Stay away from visual tasks. These tasks have a visual animation that confirms the task is completed. If players see you doing one of these tasks with no animation, they will immediately know you are an imposter. Avoid common tasks. These are tasks that everyone either has or doesn't have. If someone sees you pretending to do a common task that nobody has, they can figure out that you are the imposter. Pay attention to the taskbar at the top of the screen if it is turned on. Move away from a task when you see the taskbar change. If you move away from a task station without the taskbar changing, players will suspect you are the imposter because you didn't complete a task."

      "content": "Know how to use sabotages. Sabotages can be used to lure players away from dead bodies, set traps, or trap players in a location. All sabotages except door sabotages will prevent players from pressing the \"Emergency Meeting\" button. To do a sabotage, tap Sabotage in the lower-right corner to bring up the map. Then tap the icon on the room you want to sabotage. The following are some of the sabotages you can do as an imposter: [4] X Research source Oxygen Depletion: This is critical sabotage that will flush the oxygen out of the ship/map if the countdown reaches 0. If the crewmates fail to fix this sabotage in time, the imposters win the game. To fix this sabotage, crewmates need to input a PIN at 2 separate locations. Reactor Meltdown: This is another critical sabotage. If the crewmates fail to fix the reactor before the countdown reaches 0, the imposters win the game. To fix this sabotage, 2 crewmates need to hold their hands on fingerprint scanners in the reactor at the same time. Reset Seismic Stabilizers: On the Polus map, \"Reactor Meltdown\" is replaced with \"Reset Seismic Stabilizers.\" It has the same function as \"Reactor Meltdown\" except the fingerprint scanners are further apart making it harder to fix. Comms Sabotage: This sabotage prevents crewmates from viewing their task list or progress in the taskbar. Tasks can still be completed, but there won't be any indication of what the task progress is. On Skeld and Polus, crewmates can fix this by adjusting the dial so that it matches two wavelengths on a monitor. On Mira HQ, comms are fixed by two players entering the same PIN at two different locations. Lights Sabotage: This drastically reduces the light radius around living crewmates. This makes it harder for them to see other players around them and makes it easier for imposters to get off some easy kills and getaways. The lower light level does not affect imposters and ghosts. To fix this sabotage, crewmates must flip breakers in the electrical room or the office in Mira HQ. Door Sabotage: This shuts a door for 10 seconds to keep players in or out. This sabotage does not affect the emergency meeting button. Door sabotages will disable other non-door sabotages. However, multiple doors can be sabotaged at one time. Crash Course: This sabotage is only available on the Airship map, and sets up a course for the plane to crash into the map in 90 seconds. To fix this sabotage, crewmates need to enter a code on both sides of the Gap Room."

      "title": "Be convincing during emergency meetings.",
      "content": "Be convincing during emergency meetings. You'll need to accuse other players during emergency meetings, but don't be too forceful with it. If you just randomly accuse another player without any reason to do so, you will look suspicious. Be honest about your whereabouts. Join in when players start accusing other players. Take the initiative and try to steer the conversation in the direction you want it to go. Try covering for other players. This will help you build up some credibility. If a player sees you standing near a body, say something like \"It wasn't orange. Me and orange discovered the body together.\" You can also say something like \"I saw red complete a task.\" This will make you seem trustworthy and the person you are covering for will be less likely to vote you out."

When a group of players are standing in the same place, you can stand in the group and kill. The crowd makes it hard to see who did it. You can take advantage of this early on in the game if you can't find players by themselves. [5] X Research source This will only kill one player. It will not kill the entire group."

Once you only need one kill to win the game, take the kill as soon as you can. Don't worry about witnesses. Once you win the game, they will be irrelevant. [6] X Research source You can also use a critical sabotage to lure all remaining players away from the emergency meeting table. This keeps players from calling emergency meetings just to kill time."
