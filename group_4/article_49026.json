      "title": "Open the box.",
      "content": "Open the box. You may need to open an additional compartment labeled \"Customer Access\" as well. Inside, you will notice modular plugs and two screws. The plugs look just like the phone jack that you plug your phone into inside of your house. There will be a line plugged into each modular plug for each phone company line that runs to your house. The pair of screw posts will contain one red screw and one green screw. These posts are where your new wiring will connect to the phone company wiring."

Strip an inch off of the end of each of the colored wires. Separate the green wire and the red wire. Unscrew the red connector screw and the green connector screw (or both of the screws in the \"Line 1\" area).
