The first row of rollers will go down the center of your head staring at the front of your scalp and ending at the nape of your neck. Use a comb to section off a vertical segment of hair at the front of your scalp. This first section should be centered on your head. Do not make it longer than the curler itself or thicker than the curler. A section that is too long or too thick will not remain tightly curled. Unclip your first roller. Place the roller behind the section of hair. Slide the roller up the strand from the roots to the tips so that the hair is standing straight up. Tuck the ends under the roller and proceed to twist it down towards your scalp. Continue to section off your hair and set rollers down the center of your head until your reach the nape of your neck."
