      "content": "Examine the wound to determine how deep it is. Sometimes, a scrape and a laceration can appear similar. Before you treat a scrape, you need to make sure you have one. This is important because lacerations, or cuts, may require sutures (stitches) or glue for treatment if they are long or gaping open. A scrape is a shallow skin abrasion that is over a portion of the skin. [1] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital.

      "content": "Wash your hands with soap and water. Before you take care of your wound, make sure you have clean hands. As long as your wound is not bleeding excessively, take the time to wash your hands with antibacterial soap. If the deep scrape is on your hands, try not to get the soap on the wound because it will hurt. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you don’t have access to soap and water, wipe any obvious dirt off your hands and then rub them with hand sanitizer until they feel dry (usually 20-30 seconds)."

      "title": "Rinse the scrape with warm water.",
      "content": "Rinse the scrape with warm water. After you determine that the wound is a scrape, rinse it with water. Run water over the wound to remove any debris that may have gotten into it when you were injured. The water should be lukewarm. Continuously run or pour water over the scrape for a few minutes at a time. In between, check to make sure there is not more debris in the wound. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you are not in a place where there is a clean and available water source, remove the obvious debris by brushing it away with a clean cloth. If you notice excessive bleeding, rinse for as little time as possible to remove the debris. Then, move on to the next step. Most healthcare professionals no longer recommend pouring antiseptics, such as alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine over a wound. These chemicals may irritate the damaged tissue and slow down healing.

      "title": "Apply pressure to stop any bleeding.",
      "content": "Apply pressure to stop any bleeding. Once any large debris or matter is removed, you need to stop the bleeding. To do this, take a clean cloth, towel, or gauze and cover the wound. Apply firm pressure to the wound. If you only have a used shirt or dirty cloth, don't worry too much. Your wound is already dirty because it hasn't been disinfected. Just focus on stopping the bleeding. [6] X Research source Once you begin applying pressure, refrain from checking on the wound for at least 15 minutes. If you stop applying pressure too soon, the blood clot will not form and bleeding will begin again. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Seek medical attention if the wound is severe.",
      "content": "Seek medical attention if the wound is severe. If your compression cloth becomes soaked with blood or if you notice squirting blood flow, seek medical attention immediately. This means that your wound is severe and needs more advanced help from a doctor. This may happen with large scrapes, such as road rashes or scrapes of an excessive length. [8] X Research source Some medical conditions, such as bleeding or clotting disorders, diabetes, kidney disease, or circulation problems, can put you at greater risk of complications from cuts or scrapes. [9] X Research source If you have one of these health concerns, call your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic if you get a deep scrape or a more serious cut."

      "title": "Remove any stuck in debris.",
      "content": "Remove any stuck in debris. Sometimes, pieces of debris may be lodged in the skin that did not come out with rinsing, especially with scrapes. Once the bleeding has stopped, look at the wound for extra debris in the skin. If you see any debris, use tweezers to gently remove it. If the debris will not come out, see your doctor to have it removed. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not dig the tweezers into the wound. You don't want to injure yourself further. If you don’t find any debris, you can move on to the next step."

    {
      "title": "Apply antibiotic cream to the scrape.",
      "content": "Apply antibiotic cream to the scrape. Even if you think you have removed all of the dirt and debris, there is still a chance that your wound could become infected. Because of this, applying some antibiotic cream to the wound is always a good idea. This ointment will also keep your scrape moist so it won’t crack and get worse when you move around. A thin layer of antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly covering the area of the wound should be enough. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Neosporin, Polysporin and Bacitracin are 3 of the most common products used. Look for a multi-action antibacterial ointment, such as Neosporin Pain/Itch/Scar ointment, that can reduce pain and itching as well as preventing infection and promoting faster healing. You can purchase these kinds of ointments over-the-counter."

      "title": "Bandage the wound.",
      "content": "Bandage the wound. Take gauze or large bandage and cover your wound. Take medical tape and cover each of the edges. This will help keep out debris, germs, and other particulates. If your scrape isn't too large, you may be able to use a large band-aid instead of gauze. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source These supplies can be found in most drug stores and pharmacies. If the wound is over a flexible joint, rolled gauze may be more easily managed. You can secure a dressing with this kind of gauze more easily and it will be less likely to fall off."

    {
      "title": "Change the dressing at least once a day.",
      "content": "Change the dressing at least once a day. Take the bandage off so you can clean the wound and apply fresh dressings. This is also a good opportunity to look at the wound and check to see if any infection is occurring. Do not leave a dressing on for more than 24 hours. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Change the bandages any time they get wet or dirty, as dirty bandages can lead to your scrape becoming infected."

      "content": "Watch for signs of infection, such as redness or pus. Despite your efforts to keep the scrape clean, you may still get an infection. This will depend on the size of the scrape as well as other factors, such as your age, overall health, and any conditions such as diabetes and obesity. These can affect your healing time as well. Look out for redness around the wound or on the edges, especially if expands from one day to the next. The wound may also start draining or oozing pus. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other signs of an infection include increasing pain, swelling, or warmth around the wound. You may also develop a fever or feel generally unwell. [15] X Research source"

      "content": "Go to a doctor if you suspect an infection. If you think your wound might be infected or if the bleeding will not stop after applying pressure, seek medical attention. If you have had the wound for a while and have noticed that it has gotten infected, you should also go see a doctor. Letting an infection linger can lead to blood poisoning and other life-threatening situations. [16] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Call your doctor immediately or go to urgent care if your skin is warm around the wound or the scrape is leaking yellow or greenish discharge.

[17] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This is especially important if you haven’t had a tetanus shot recently (within the past 5-10 years). You should get the shot as soon as possible after the injury to ensure that you do not develop tetanus.

      "title": "Take antibiotics if your doctor prescribes them.",
      "content": "Take antibiotics if your doctor prescribes them. If your scrape is deep or badly infected, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to take to combat or prevent further infection. The type of antibiotic they prescribe may depend on how serious your infection is or what kind of bacteria are causing the infection. Follow your doctor’s instructions when it comes to taking the medication. You may also be prescribed painkillers depending on how painful your wound is. Tell your doctor about any other medications or supplements you may be taking, since this could affect which antibiotics you can use safely. Let your doctor know if you have any medication allergies or health conditions that could affect which antibiotics you can take."
