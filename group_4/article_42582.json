      "title": "Lie flat on your back and push your butt and tailbone into the floor.",
      "content": "Lie flat on your back and push your butt and tailbone into the floor. Bend your knees and point your toes to elongate your legs, and keep one knee slightly above the other to create more graceful curves. Then, press down with your shoulder blades, push your chest up into the air, and arch your lower back so it lifts off of the floor or bed. [1] X Research source Best camera angle: Take this photo from the side to show off that back arch. For a more dramatic arch: Roll your shoulders up so only your hips and the top of your head are touching the floor. Pro tip: If you have trouble lifting your back enough to create an arch, bring your elbows in close to your body and use them to prop yourself up. Let your head fall backward to create a graceful arch. [2] X Research source Change it up: You have a lot of options for your hands with this pose—experiment by lifting your arms over your head, playing with your clothing, and running your hands over your body to see what gives you the best shot."

      "title": "Lie on your stomach on a flat surface like a firm mattress or the floor.",
      "content": "Lie on your stomach on a flat surface like a firm mattress or the floor. Bend your knees so your feet are in the air, and point your toes to elongate your legs. Stretch your arms out in front of you, then push your butt into the air, creating a space beneath your hips. Keep your chest and knees on the ground. [3] X Research source Best camera angle: To show off the curve of your back, take this photo from the side. Pro tip: Use a firmer surface for this picture to show off your curves more—if you’re on a soft mattress, your body will sink in, and the arch won’t be as dramatic."

      "title": "Stand facing a chair with the camera to your side.",
      "content": "Stand facing a chair with the camera to your side. Prop one knee on the chair, then stretch one leg out behind you. Place your arms on the back of the chair and arch your back for a sexy standing shot. Or, run the hand closest to the camera along your face and body—this will open up more of your torso to the camera. [4] X Research source Posing tip: Keep your torso tall and your back leg straight and long. Where to look: Throw your head back to deepen the arch in your back, or look over the shoulder closest to the camera to give off sultry and shy vibes."

    {
      "title": "Kneel on the floor with your knees apart, then arch your back gracefully.",
      "content": "Kneel on the floor with your knees apart, then arch your back gracefully. If you need extra support or you want to arch further, place one hand on the floor behind you. You can also lift your arms above your head to elongate your back. [5] X Research source Outfit tip: If you’re wearing a loose top, lift the hem so it shows off your lower back and bottom. Or ditch the top entirely for a sultry but not-too-revealing shot. Best camera angle: This picture looks best taken from the back or the side. Where to look: Take this picture looking ahead, glancing back over your shoulder, or looking upward."

      "title": "Press your shoulders and hips against the wall as you arch your back.",
      "content": "Press your shoulders and hips against the wall as you arch your back. Play around with your arms in this pose—cross your arms above your head with your forearms touching the wall, run your hands down your thighs, or put one arm up and one arm down. [6] X Research source Best camera angle: Either place the camera against the wall if you want a profile shot, or put it beside you and slightly forward for an angled shot. Posing tip: Create a flattering silhouette by crossing one foot in front of the other."

    {
      "title": "Stand facing the wall with your chest arched up.",
      "content": "Stand facing the wall with your chest arched up. Press your hands to the wall, either at chest-height or above your head. Then, arch your back and push your hips back, and either drop your head back or turn your head to the side to look at the camera. [7] X Research source Best camera angle: Take this photo from the side to accentuate the curve of your back. Posing tip: Bend one knee slightly to create killer curves through your hips."

      "title": "Tidy up the room before you take the picture.",
      "content": "Tidy up the room before you take the picture. Little details can make a big difference, so make sure the area around you is clear of clutter before you get started. You don’t have to clean the whole room—but do make sure anything in the shot is orderly. [8] X Research source It’s also a good idea to clean your camera lens before you take a picture so you get a clearer shot. If you’ll be using a mirror in your picture, wipe it down, too.

      "title": "Wear something that makes you feel confident.",
      "content": "Wear something that makes you feel confident. You don’t have to wear lingerie for an arch pic (although you definitely can if you want to), but do opt for something that makes you feel great. It could be a great pair of jeans and a shirt you love, an oversized T-shirt or sweater and a pair of undies, or a cute pair of bottoms and no shirt. [10] X Research source If you don’t have time to style your hair, tousle the roots with your fingers to instantly get a sexy bedhead look."

      "title": "Get yourself into a sexy mindset.",
      "content": "Get yourself into a sexy mindset. If you feel relaxed and sultry, it will show in your picture. Dance around, play some music, light some candles—whatever it takes to make yourself feel more comfortable before you start taking pics. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Take your photo in soft, flattering lighting.",
      "content": "Take your photo in soft, flattering lighting. Natural light is best, especially if you can take the shot in the golden hour (right at sunrise or just before sunset). If you don’t have good natural lighting, a ring light is a great way to add a gentle glow to your pictures. [12] X Research source Try posing in front of a window for a sexy backlit photo, or use a ring light and pose in front of a darker wall. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use a lower angle to show off your curves.",
      "content": "Use a lower angle to show off your curves. Most of these poses will look best if you take the picture from a lower angle than you might be used to. Prop your phone up against a book or on a shelf, or use a tripod if you have one—whatever it takes to show off those curves. [14] X Research source Take a few shots from different angles to see what you like best! No matter what angle you’re shooting from, use the grid on your camera to line yourself up in the center of the shot. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "Take a video and grab screenshots of your favorite moments.",
      "content": "Take a video and grab screenshots of your favorite moments. The easiest way to make sure you get the shot is to put your phone on video and record yourself posing. That way, you’ll easily be able to see the subtle little changes in your posture that are the most flattering to your curves, and you can grab screenshots to get the perfect arch pic. [16] X Research source If you prefer, you can also take a ton of pictures at once and sort through them afterward."

      "title": "Keep your shoulders back and your chin up, no matter the pose.",
      "content": "Keep your shoulders back and your chin up, no matter the pose. Even if you’re looking down in your photo, lift your chin just a little, and roll your shoulders back so your chest pushes forward. This subtle trick makes any photo more flattering—it adds definition to your jawline and makes your neck look longer. [17] X Research source"
