      "content": "Extra layers help you stay insulated and toasty in chilly temperatures. Choose a long-sleeve shirt to be your base layer, along with a warm vest. Keep bundling up with loose layers until you feel comfortable. If possible, choose garments that are extra warm and insulating, like fleece, wool, or cotton. [1] X Research source Don’t forget about your feet, too! Slide into a warm pair of socks and slippers to keep your feet from getting too cold. Want to make your hands and feet extra toasty? Slip some hand warmers and foot warmers into your gloves or mittens and shoes for an extra burst of warmth. Loose layers are better since you’re less likely to sweat a lot in them. Getting your skin damp and sweaty may potentially boost your chances of getting hypothermia.

      "content": "Hot food and beverages warm you from the inside out. Boil some water to make some decaffeinated tea or hot chocolate, or start heating up a delicious pot of soup on the stove. Sipping on hot drinks and soups is a great way to stay both warm and satiated when you’re struggling to stay warm at home. [3] X Research source Be sure to enjoy alcoholic drinks in moderation. While these beverages can make you feel warmer, they don’t help you hold onto body heat. [4] X Research source"

Whip up a batch of your favorite baked good and enjoy the extra heat that fills your home while the food bakes. Once you’ve turned off your oven, open the door slightly to let that extra heat escape.

Invite them over to the couch or bed for a nice snuggle sesh as you both warm up together. Grab some cozy blankets to really amp up the toasty vibes and ward the chill away.

[8] X Research source Focus especially on any south- and east-facing windows in your home if you live in the northern hemisphere, as these will be exposed to the most sunlight. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Sealing off unused rooms helps keep the rest of your home warmer. All the heat that’s currently in your home is precious, so closing off the doors to any surrounding, unused rooms, helps to collect and use that heat more efficiently. For entryways that don’t have doors, drape bedding or a thick curtain over the entrance to prevent heat from escaping. [12] X Research source Want to confine your home’s heat to an even smaller space? Build temporary walls with leftover sheets of plywood or cardboard and set them close to wherever you’re spending the most time."

      "content": "Block off the cool surface of the floor with a layer of carpet. Floors made with materials like vinyl or hardwood don’t hold onto heat very well. To counteract this, roll out an area rug over the exposed floor so you don’t have to walk on such a chilly surface. [13] X Research source A thick blanket can also work in a pinch."

      "title": "Counterclockwise fans force down the warm air that’s drifted up.",
      "content": "Counterclockwise fans force down the warm air that’s drifted up. Traditionally, ceiling fans spin in a clockwise direction to help funnel cool air down and warm air up. By setting your ceiling fan to spin in a counterclockwise direction, the opposite will occur; you get to enjoy the warm air, while the cooler air gets lifted up. [14] X Research source Search around your fan’s motor housing for a switch—activating it will reverse the direction of the fan blades. [15] X Research source Check your ceiling fan’s operational wall panel if it has one, as the reversal function might be there."

      "content": "Warm air always rises, which makes your second floor warmer. Scientifically speaking, warmer air expands and loses density, which causes it to float above the denser, less warm air. [20] X Research source Use this law of nature to your advantage by holing up in an upper room of your home—chances are, it’ll be a lot toastier than the downstairs."

Taking a walk around your home, moving along to a workout video, doing some yoga poses … anything that gets your blood moving is fair game! Try to get up and move once an hour rather than staying stationary. [21] X Research source Whenever you sit down, prop your feet up on an elevated surface, like a table or ottoman—this can help your feet feel a little less cold."

In the event of a power outage (or just a brutally cold winter day), portable space heaters can be an invaluable source of warmth. Ideally, look for a model that turns off automatically and lacks a glowing heating element. [25] X Research source Electric blankets and hot water bottles are also useful investments that can help keep your bed nice and toasty.
