Roasting the brisket with some water will give you more chances to check for doneness, although some of the natural juices will escape with the dry heat. [3] X Research source Always cook with the fat side up. Fill the lower pan with water. It should cover approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) of the bottom of the brisket. Adding water will improve the moisture of the meat. [4] X Research source For a little more dynamic flavor, use ½ of a beer and ½ water. Cover the roasting pan. If you do not have a cover, you can use foil to keep the moisture inside."
