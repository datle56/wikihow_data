Whatever floats your boat.” Them: “I think I’m going to skip pilates today and have a self-care session instead.” You: “Whatever floats your boat! You deserve some down time.” Tone tip: Save this phrase for casual conversations about somewhat trivial matters with friends, family, and familiar acquaintances, though. Saying “whatever floats your boat” in a very serious, formal, or professional setting may come off a bit dismissive or overly casual."
