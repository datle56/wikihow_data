      "content": "Stop the bleeding. The first thing you want to do with a graze is work on stopping the bleeding. If the graze is minor, bleeding should stop on its own. If the bleeding does not stop within a few minutes, apply pressure to the wound using a sterile bandage or a clean cloth. It can also help to elevate the wound slightly while applying pressure.

      "content": "Clean the graze. Once you've stopped the bleeding, clean the graze. This can help prevent infection. To clean the graze, run it under tap water. Do not use antiseptic, as this can irritate the skin. When the wound is cleaned out, gently pat it dry with a clean towel.

      "title": "Apply an antibiotic.",
      "content": "Apply an antibiotic. To prevent infection, it's a good idea to apply an over-the-counter antibacterial cream or ointment. Neosporin or Polysporin would work well. Apply a layer to the wound, following the instructions on the package. [4] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source In addition to preventing infection, your antibiotic cream can also speed the healing of your wound by keeping it moist and free of bacteria. If you are allergic to any ingredient in a product, don't use it. Discontinue use and consult your doctor if you develop a rash, hives, itching, skin irritation, burning, cracking, peeling, or worsening of your injury."

      "title": "Bandage the graze.",
      "content": "Bandage the graze. You can either use an adhesive bandage with a non-stick pad or a non-stick gauze to cover the graze. Don't use a gauze that lacks a non-stick surface because it can stick to the wound and pull off skin when you remove it, preventing your wound from healing. Make sure the covering is big enough to protect the full graze, and the skin surrounding the graze.

      "title": "Keep your wound moist.",
      "content": "Keep your wound moist. Use healing ointments such as antibacterial creams to keep your wound moist as it heals. Keeping a wound moist will help it heal faster and will prevent the skin from pulling apart as you move, which delays healing.

Make sure to change the graze's dressing at least once a day. [8] X Research source Early on, you may have to change the dressing more. If the bandage gets wet from pus or blood, change it."
