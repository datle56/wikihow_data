      "title": "Take an apple cider vinegar bath.",
      "content": "Take an apple cider vinegar bath. Apple cider vinegar has long been used as a treatment for bacterial vaginosis. Help soothe symptoms of BV by adding half a cup (about 118 ml) of apple cider vinegar to a hot bath and allowing your lower body to soak for at least 10 minutes. [3] X Research source Vinegar can be drying and harsh on the skin, so it is advisable to try this treatment just once a day. You can also drink small amounts of apple cider vinegar to help maintain the proper pH for your vagina. If you feel any stinging or burning around your labia from the vinegar, drain the bath immediately and rinse your lower body with clean, warm water. Do not insert vinegar directly into your vagina."

      "content": "Insert yogurt directly into your vagina. Some research suggests that the probiotics in yogurt, when used topically, can help restore the natural balance of the vagina. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use clean fingers to apply a plain, unflavored yogurt topically to your labia to help treat symptoms like itching. To treat symptoms inside your vagina, soak a tampon in plain, unflavored yogurt for five to ten minutes, then insert it into your vagina for up to an hour. [5] X Research source If possible, use a hand-held shower head to rinse off the yogurt. Otherwise, wash your vagina with warm water using whatever method you normally use to wash it. Repeat topical application or the tampon treatment as necessary when you feel symptoms including pain or itching. Yogurt may cause itching or burning around your vagina. If this occurs, stop the treatment. Rinse off the yogurt. Do not leave yogurt-soaked tampons in overnight."

      "title": "Use garlic directly on your vagina.",
      "content": "Use garlic directly on your vagina. While medical research is still ongoing, garlic is thought to be a strong, natural antibacterial. You may be able to treat BV by using garlic directly in your vagina. That said, this remedy is largely untested. You may do it at your own risk. To do this: [6] X Research source Peel a clove of garlic and make a small cut anywhere on the clove with a knife. Wrap the clove in a single layer of sterile gauze. Tie the gauze closed with a piece of undyed string or unflavored dental floss, leaving enough length to comfortably remove the garlic afterward. Insert the garlic into the vagina, just past the cervix, and leave it there for 30 minutes to an hour."

      "title": "Eat a serving of yogurt every day.",
      "content": "Eat a serving of yogurt every day. Consuming yogurt has just as many benefits as applying it topically. Eating a serving of unflavored regular or Greek yogurt every day may help balance your out your vagina’s ecosystem and help build your body’s population of good bacteria. [7] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Fat content of the yogurt does not matter. Just avoid using flavored yogurt, as the added sugar can be bad for vaginal health. This may be done in addition to or instead of using yogurt topically. Eating yogurt is not a quick fix. Yogurt works best when taken along with prescribed antibiotics from your doctor. Many women report yogurt taking several days and even over a week to work. Keep eating yogurt after you get better. Yogurt can help prevent you from getting BV again."

      "content": "Take a daily garlic supplement. Much like yogurt, garlic may help when it is ingested, too. Since studies are ongoing, there is currently no set recommended amount of garlic to ingest to help treat BV. However, adding fresh garlic to your regular meals and taking a once-daily garlic supplement are both thought to help with BV. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Add fenugreek to your yogurt or steep it as a tea. Fenugreek has a long history of being used to treat feminine issues. Add a tablespoon (14.18 g) of fenugreek seeds to your daily yogurt serving to help boost your home treatment. [9] X Research source Alternatively, you can steep the same amount of seeds in a mug of hot water for five to ten minutes. Strain the seeds, and drink the water as a healing tea. If you do not care for the taste of fenugreek, you can instead take a daily fenugreek supplement. These are available at most pharmacies and health food stores."

      "title": "Determine if your symptoms are related to bacterial vaginosis.",
      "content": "Determine if your symptoms are related to bacterial vaginosis. BV has symptoms similar to other vaginal complications, particularly those of yeast infections. BV and yeast infections both cause pain and itching in the vagina and around the labia, as well as vaginal discharge. There are some differences in symptoms, though, that can help you recognize BV: [10] X Research source The discharge caused by BV is typically thin, watery, and white or grey. Discharge caused by a yeast infection is a thick, chunky, white or light yellow. The pH of the vagina becomes more alkaline with BV. Yeast infections do not impact vaginal pH. BV may cause the skin of the vulva to become pink or red, sometimes with white marks. Both BV and yeast infections may cause pain during urination or intercourse."

      "content": "Know when to see a doctor. While some BV infections can be treated at home, others may require medical intervention. If symptoms do not clear up within a week, seek a medical diagnosis to make sure you have BV and not another complication. The only way to diagnose BV is through a vaginal smear performed by your doctor. [12] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If symptoms do not stop or get worse, you may need a prescription for antibiotics to treat your BV. The doctor may also prescribe you a pessary to be inserted into your vagina and a cream to help with the itching. See a doctor immediately if you are pregnant and notice a discharge or pain that may be associated with BV. If you experience pain strong enough to prevent you from your daily functions, seek immediate medical help."
