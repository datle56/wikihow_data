      "title": "Go with a pair that falls just above your ankle.",
      "content": "Go with a pair that falls just above your ankle. The big stand-out feature of cigarette pants is the bottom hem area. Make sure that you get a pair of pants that are the correct length. The bottom of each pant leg should hit right at the top of your ankle–no longer, no shorter. If your cigarette pants are too long but otherwise fit correctly, try having them hemmed."

    {
      "title": "Opt for pants that are form-fitting.",
      "content": "Opt for pants that are form-fitting. Cigarette pants are meant to be relatively tight. Get a pair that cling comfortably close to your body, as opposed to a loose or baggy pair. Keep in mind that the pants should be fitted everywhere besides the bottom of the pant leg. While many types of pants taper in at this point, cigarette pants do not. [1] X Research source The pants should stop fitting snugly at the knee. Above the knee, the fabric should lay smooth and flat against your skin. The material should cling to your leg shape, but they shouldn't be so tight that you can't easily sit or squat."

      "title": "Try cigarette pants that have bold details if you're tall.",
      "content": "Try cigarette pants that have bold details if you're tall. If you consider yourself taller than average, pants that have some interesting detail may be very flattering. Go for a pair of cigarette pants that have a subtle cuff at the bottom hem, a colorful embroidered patch near 1 of the front pockets, or embellished back pockets. [2] X Research source The fit of cigarette pants complements a tall frame well and allows you to get away with bolder style elements."

      "title": "Go for a pair that has vertical elements if you're petite.",
      "content": "Go for a pair that has vertical elements if you're petite. Vertical elements can help to elongate your legs. If you're petite, try to find a cigarette pant that has front pleats or pinstripes. It's also especially important for you to get a pair that's form-fitting. Otherwise, the pants will swallow your legs up and look bulky. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Get a structured or stretchy pant if you're curvy.",
      "content": "Get a structured or stretchy pant if you're curvy. Find a cigarette pant that's made at least partially of a structured fabric, like tropical wool, or a stretchy material, such as spandex. These materials should allow the pants to hug and complement your curves well, in addition to enhancing the comfort of the pants. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Opt for cigarette pants in neutral colors and classic styles.",
      "content": "Opt for cigarette pants in neutral colors and classic styles. The office is not the best place to debut cigarette pants in bright colors, busy patterns, or unusual styles. Stick with neutral colors like black, navy, and khaki. Go with trouser-style cigarette pants for workwear, since this style looks formal and sophisticated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear a long-sleeve button-up shirt with your pants.",
      "content": "Wear a long-sleeve button-up shirt with your pants. A long-sleeve collared button-up adds some instant class that's simple and suitable in the workplace. Consider wearing a solid black or tan cigarette pant with a solid light blue or white button-up for a classic, clean look. [5] X Research source Pair a crisp red button-down with black cigarette pants for a pop of color. Go monochrome with a black button-down and black cigarette pants for a sophisticated vibe."

      "title": "Sport a blazer to dress up your outfit.",
      "content": "Sport a blazer to dress up your outfit. To blend into a slightly more formal work environment, throw on a nice blazer. Opt for a blazer that goes with your pant color, such as black if you're wearing black pants, or a light brown if your pants are tan. [6] X Research source Wear a patterned dress shirt with navy cigarette pants and a navy blazer to bring some fun variety to your work style."

    {
      "title": "Match some neutral close-toed pumps to your pants.",
      "content": "Match some neutral close-toed pumps to your pants. Heels are appropriate in the workplace, and they also look great with cigarette pants. Opt for black or nude close-toed pumps to take your work outfit up a notch. A smaller heel, such as a 2 in (5.1 cm) heel, is the most appropriate option for work. [7] X Research source Pair some black pumps with a red or orange cigarette pant, a solid white dress shirt, and a black blazer for a bolder work look."

      "title": "Wear neutral ballet flats as a simple alternative.",
      "content": "Wear neutral ballet flats as a simple alternative. If flats are more your style, opt for a simple, solid-colored ballet flat to wear with your cigarette pants. Black or nude-colored flats will go with just about anything. Either wear a plain, embellishment-free pair, or go for a pair that has a polished, subtle detail, such as a small bow near the toe area. [8] X Research source Pair black flats with matching cigarette pants and a cream-colored silk top for a chic look. Add a fitted black blazer to pull the look together."

      "title": "Go light on the jewelry.",
      "content": "Go light on the jewelry. Wearing 1-2 smaller pieces of jewelry can dress up an outfit, but too much jewelry or jewelry that's big and flashy can make the outfit more casual. Wear simple rings and earrings, and go for just 1 statement piece, such as a classic pendant necklace or a chic watch. Contrast the intensity of your clothing with your jewelry to look sophisticated and stylish. Wear dangling earrings as your statement piece with a simple, solid-colored shirt and blazer. As an alternative, wear a vibrant multi-colored top with a white gold or yellow gold designer watch."

      "content": "Put on a slightly oversized white shirt or a graphic tee. One of the best ways to dress down a cigarette pant is to go loose and comfy on top. Pick a billowy cotton or rayon solid scoop neck or v-neck tee, or simply wear your favorite graphic T-shirt. These options give off a more casual vibe while still going well with your cigarette pants. [9] X Research source If you have black cigarette pants, wear them with a colorful graphic tee that has black lettering to pull the outfit together. If your cigarette pants are purple, blue, or another bold color, opt for a plain white shirt and some canvas shoes that are neutral-colored.

Since you're going out, this is the time to break out those strappy, open-toed, 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) heels. Since the pants are just a little shorter than most other styles, your favorite fancy heels can be the focal point of your outfit. [14] X Research source"

Pick a bag that's an exciting color, such as teal or silver, and match it to your accessories. [16] X Research source For instance, if you're wearing a chunky necklace that's coral and gold, carry a solid coral handbag. As an alternative, carry a neutral-colored black or brown purse that has an interesting structural element, such as tassels."

      "content": "Choose eye-catching jewelry to make a statement. Sparkling statement pieces are perfect for nights out! If you're attending something classy, like a dinner party, opt for elegant jewels like a diamond drop necklace or tennis bracelet. If you're heading out somewhere fun, like a dance club, go for something flashier -- a rhinestone choker or cocktail ring that will glitter under the lights. Stick to 1 piece of statement jewelry per outfit to make the most impact. If you pile on multiple pieces, the results can look over the top."
