      "content": "MCs and rappers are different but can sometimes overlap. While an MC can still refer to the general host of an event, the term became connected to rap and hip-hop culture in the 1970s. Originally, rap MCs were just hosts whose job was energizing the crowd. Over time, they leaned more into performance as vocalists who rhyme oversampling, scratching, and mixing tracks provided by a DJ. [3] X Research source Rappers who perform live for audiences are also technically emceeing. You can refer to a rapper as an MC or emcee—but rappers can do more than just emcee. MCs are often associated with traditional hip-hop culture, while rappers are more mainstream performers. MCs don’t only exist in rap and hip-hop; garage, drum and bass, ragga, happy hardcore, and old-school rave music commonly have MCs too."
