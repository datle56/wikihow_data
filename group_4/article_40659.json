Enjoy your time with the friends you came with, keep dancing, or sit at the bar and nurse your drink—whatever you have going on. Just keep glancing her way every so often. When she notices you looking, meet her eyes for a few seconds, smile, and then look away. [1] X Research source As you're trying to catch her eye, notice whether she's paying extra attention to any one person she's with.
