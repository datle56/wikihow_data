      "content": "Be sincere and include a return envelope to get a response. Briefly introduce yourself and explain how Zach has impacted you. Whether he inspired you to start playing guitar or write your own songs, specify what he means to you. Finish off with a polite request to return your letter, send you an autograph, or answer one of your burning questions. [3] X Research source When writing fan mail , use conversational language to showcase your personality. To make your letter stand out (and increase the likelihood of it being read), put it in a brightly-colored envelope or decorate the outside with stamps and stickers. If you’re requesting an autograph from Zach, send your photo in a properly stamped and self-addressed envelope. It typically takes 3+ months for a response, so try your best to be patient.
