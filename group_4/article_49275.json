      "title": "Understand the brand.",
      "content": "Understand the brand. Before you actually write anything down, it’s best to research the brand you are writing the slogan for. Get information from the website, ask the employees of the company for history on the brand, how long the company has been around, what has been tried before, etc. You want to develop an intimate knowledge on the company and brand. Figure out who the target demographic is, what’s the voice and tone of the company, and what the company is selling. [1] X Research source Your slogan is meant to differentiate you from the competition while conveying a brand’s overall mission. Research what makes your company or brand different. Narrow down what the key benefit of the product or brand is. Once you have a single idea of what this is, you can start to throw around ideas for how to say it in a fun and memorable way."

    {
      "title": "Research other slogans.",
      "content": "Research other slogans. Look at popular slogans, the slogans of competitor companies, and think about what slogans you just remember that were popular or catchy. You don’t want to copy someone else’s slogan, but understanding what has and has not worked in the past will benefit you. [2] X Research source Think about some of the most iconic slogans. Slogans like “Just do it” “Think different” “I’m lovin’ it”. These slogans have a few aspects in common that make them successful. Each slogan here is short and memorable. These slogans also impart a positive feeling about the brand, while differentiating it from competitive brands. Nike’s “Just do it” slogan resonates and inspires you to get out and take action. It transcends the athletic world as well, giving you the positive feeling that you tackle any obstacle in any situation. Apple’s “Think different” not only pays homage to all of the visionaries in our history who have challenged the status quo to bring the world forward, but it speaks directly to competitor (at the time) IBM’s “Think IBM” slogan. This slogan shows us that being unique is good, and that Apple is more than just a computer company. McDonald’s “I’m lovin’ it” generates a positive feeling towards food that’s not good for you. There are no false claims about health, just a promise that you’ll love the taste. When writing your slogan, keep in mind length, key benefits, and how your slogan will make people feel good about this brand, which is different from the others. Look at word count, the overall message, the rhythm, and even if there’s humor."

      "title": "Think about your brand’s placement in the market.",
      "content": "Think about your brand’s placement in the market. This means taking an honest and objective look at the brand’s recognition and influence. The slogan you write should reflect your brand’s influence. For example, if you’re writing a slogan for a new company that isn’t widely known, it should be an informative teaser of what this company can offer. If the company is reputable, then you need to ask yourself why there is a change. Is the company going in a new direction? Is the new slogan part of a re-brand? Take a company like Porsche, the slogan for Porsche is: “There is no substitute”. This works because Porsche has years of quality craftsmanship to back up that claim and level of luxury. Also think about what the overall product is. If the product is something fun, then a serious or authoritative slogan might not be best."

      "title": "Write down everything that comes to your head.",
      "content": "Write down everything that comes to your head. If you’re working with a team, start throwing out ideas to each other. Oftentimes something that you think of or say may sound silly at first, but it can be the seed of a larger idea. Try not to edit yourself here. Now that you have information on the company’s goals and mission statement, you want to throw a wide net and come up with as many ideas as possible. While the end product of your slogan should be short, it’s ok to have a longer sentence or rhyme at the beginning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick your five best slogans.",
      "content": "Pick your five best slogans. Narrow down what you have come up with so that you have five options to work with. These slogans won’t be the final product, but they’re a good starting point. What you probably will, and should have now, are five long, possibly awkwardly phrased messages, but that’s ok. You’re narrowing down the ideas into something that you can build on. Don’t worry too much about being stuck with the slogans you’ve picked. As you continue to write and rewrite you may come up with a whole new idea. That’s fine, right now you’re just trying to find something that fits with what the company or brand is selling."

    {
      "title": "Describe the brand in one sentence.",
      "content": "Describe the brand in one sentence. What is the brand’s value proposition? A value proposition is a brief description that clearly states the benefit you provide, for whom you provide it, and you do it well and in a unique way. [3] X Research source You’re not writing your slogan just yet. But by narrowing down your value proposition and being able to describe it in a quick, clear fashion, you can start to find an angle for your slogan. Try to be able to describe your brand with as few words as possible. This isn’t always easy, but it will force you to think about what’s relevant and important, and what might be unnecessary information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the story.",
      "content": "Find the story. By now, you should know the history of the brand, be able to present its value proposition in a quick and engaging way, and you should have several rough taglines written down. Compile all of this information and see what common threads tell the story. Don’t just look to brands and companies for inspiration when finding the story, look at actual stories. Movies and books are great for looking at taglines because they have to get you excited about an entire story in a very limited amount of time. Finding the story of your brand using all of the information you have, will give you a narrative which you can use to help create a teaser that will engage people and help them remember your brand.

      "title": "Keep your slogan pithy.",
      "content": "Keep your slogan pithy. [5] X Research source Your slogan needs to say a lot with a little. Think about who the consumers are, and get inside their heads. When a consumer is considering your product, your slogan will consciously or subconsciously be remembered. Look at Taco Bell’s “Think outside the bun”. When you want a quick bite you run through your options in your head. Taco Bell has an effective angle because it reminds you that there are other options besides a burger. You want to highlight a key benefit, which in this case, is that you have an alternate option. You want your slogan to position your brand to motivate people. [6] X Research source Look at Nike, which has had the same, simple slogan since 1988: “Just Do It”. It’s simple and motivating, playing into an athlete’s basic drive to simply perform well and break through barriers."

      "title": "Make it memorable.",
      "content": "Make it memorable. Rhyme, rhythm, and brevity are your friend when writing slogans. [7] X Research source When a slogan has a rhythm or a ring to it, it’s much easier to remember. Look at Bounty’s “The quilted quicker picker upper.” The alliteration and natural rhythm of this slogan achieves several goals. It tells you why this product is of a certain quality, what it does, and the fun, light tone is easy to remember and repeat. It’s not always easy to get creative, and to be creative effectively, so if you’re having trouble, see if you can make a rhyme or a tune to your slogan. Try to directly address your customers in the slogan with active verbs so the slogan feels like a call to action.

      "title": "Keep it short.",
      "content": "Keep it short. This has been said a lot, but it’s important. Once you’ve written a few slogans, take a break and let it all digest. Then come back to them and see if you can edit them down further. Think about email subject lines, these are like slogans for an email. Studies show that subject lines with around 50 characters or that are six to nine words have a higher open rate. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source Keeping your slogans short can also create a bit of mystery that entices people to research on their own. And if you can get your brand’s message out quickly, you’ll get people’s attention. Take Apple’s slogan: “Think different.” Two words that immediately inspire you and conjure up all of the possibilities that you can experience with an Apple product."

      "title": "Make your slogan honest.",
      "content": "Make your slogan honest. During the entire process, you want to stay honest, but once you’ve written your slogan or slogans, take an objective look and ask yourself if this is an honest and accurate representation of the brand. Avoid hyperbole like “No. 1” or “The best”. These phrases are probably not true, and this kind of language is also not creative. Your slogan gets people’s attention and helps consumers to remember your brand, don’t promise something that can’t be backed up."
