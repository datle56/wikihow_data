      "content": "Take a shower. Wash thoroughly before you attempt to take a detox salt bath. You want to wash away any additives like perfume, soap residue, or conditioner that could throw off the composition of your bath. Make sure the tub gets a good rinse too after you’ve finished using any toiletries. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill your tub with water.",
      "content": "Fill your tub with water. The water should be at or just above body temperature. Himalayan salt baths are not meant to be taken in very hot water. If you have a thermometer, aim for about 97 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Add the salt while the tub is filling with water.",
      "content": "Add the salt while the tub is filling with water. As the water is running, add enough Himalayan salt to create a 1% solution. This means adding about 2.5 pounds (a little over 1 kilogram) to a standard-sized tub, which holds 27-32 gallons (102-121 liters) of water. [3] X Research source Himalayan salts can be purchased online, at health stores, or at some organic grocery stores."

      "title": "Allow the salts to dissolve.",
      "content": "Allow the salts to dissolve. A fine grain salt should dissolve quickly, but if your salts are chunkier this may take more time. If you’re concerned that your salts will take too long to dissolve, place them in a large bowl the night before and cover them with warm water. The next day, pour the entire contents of the bowl into the tub as it’s filling."

    {
      "title": "Add essential oils if you want them.",
      "content": "Add essential oils if you want them. Essential oils can increase your level of relaxation or rejuvenation in the bath. If you choose to use one, such as eucalyptus oil or lavender oil, add about 3 drops as the tub is filling with water. Do not add more than this, since it could irritate your skin."

    {
      "title": "Ask your doctor if a Himalayan salt bath is safe for you.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor if a Himalayan salt bath is safe for you. Salt baths can place a lot of pressure on your circulatory system, so if you have poor heart circulation, heart disease, diabetes, or are pregnant, always check with your doctor first to be sure that you can safely take a salt bath.

      "title": "Keep a glass of water nearby.",
      "content": "Keep a glass of water nearby. You can quickly become dehydrated while taking a salt bath. Make sure you have a glass or water bottle near the edge of the tub to sip from while you soak."

      "title": "Soak for about 20-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak for about 20-30 minutes. Soaking in a salt bath can be intense for your circulatory system and your muscles, so spend no more than 30 minutes in the tub. Even after that short amount of time in the salt water, you will likely feel weak when you get out of the bath."

    {
      "title": "Stand up carefully.",
      "content": "Stand up carefully. When you’re done, drain the tub and rise slowly. Hold onto something sturdy, like the edge of the sink, as you attempt to climb out. If you begin to feel dizzy, sit down immediately and sip some more water until you feel ready to stand again."

      "title": "Rest while you air dry.",
      "content": "Rest while you air dry. The salt water is safe to leave on your skin, so no need to rinse yourself off or even wipe your whole body down with a towel. Use this drying time to rest for at least 30 minutes, since you will need some time to recover from the detox. [5] X Research source It’s best to take this bath right before bed so that you won’t be doing any more physical activity for the day."

      "title": "Limit salt baths to 1-3 times per week.",
      "content": "Limit salt baths to 1-3 times per week. Since Himalayan salt baths can be so intense, you should not be taking them every day. Start out by taking one a week, and then build up to two or three if you really like them. [6] X Research source"
