      "content": "Unspool some wrapping paper on a flat surface. Take some decorative gift wrapping paper and place it on a flat surface such as a desk or table so you have plenty of room to wrap your bottle. Unspool the paper with the top side facing down so it’s open and loose. [1] X Research source Choose wrapping paper that matches the theme. For instance, if you’re giving the liquor bottle as a holiday gift, choose paper with snowflakes or something that matches the occasion."

      "title": "Lay the bottle down lengthwise about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the edge.",
      "content": "Lay the bottle down lengthwise about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the edge. Place the bottle on top of the wrapping paper. Align the edge of the bottle so it’s near the outer edge of the paper, but leave some room so you’re able to wrap the paper around the bottle easily. [2] X Research source Whether your liquor bottle is round, rectangular, or square, you need extra room to wrap the paper around it properly. Don’t worry if your wrapping paper is much longer than your bottle. You can always trim it down later."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the paper around the bottle and cut just past it where it connects.",
      "content": "Wrap the paper around the bottle and cut just past it where it connects. Bring the edge of the paper up over the bottle and hold it against the surface. Roll the bottle in the paper until the outer edge touches the paper on the other side of the bottle. Use a pair of scissors to cut just past where the edge connects to leave a little bit of extra room. [3] X Research source Keep the paper wrapped tightly around the bottle as you roll it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold over the cut edge and attach a strip of double-sided tape.",
      "content": "Fold over the cut edge and attach a strip of double-sided tape. Take the extra length of paper and fold it over itself to leave a nice, smooth edge. Take a small strip of double-sided tape, stick it on top of the fold and remove the paper strip so the adhesive is exposed. [4] X Research source If you don’t have double-sided tape, you can use clear tape. Take a strip of the tape, wrap it around itself and connect it to make a sort of makeshift double-sided tape."

    {
      "title": "Roll the bottle in the paper until the edge meets the tape.",
      "content": "Roll the bottle in the paper until the edge meets the tape. Hold the gift wrap tightly against the surface and begin rolling the bottle. Continue rolling the bottle until the paper connects with the tape on the fold. Smooth out the paper and press on the taped area to help seal it. [5] X Research source You should have a long tube of paper tightly wrapped around your bottle at this point."

    {
      "title": "Slide the bottle down and tuck in the bottom edges of the paper.",
      "content": "Slide the bottle down and tuck in the bottom edges of the paper. Push the bottle down toward the bottom edge of the paper tube, leaving a small gap. Tuck in the paper in the gap at the bottom edge so the bottom of your bottle is covered. Tape the tucked in paper so it stays in place and won’t come undone. [6] X Research source The tucked in paper will help cover the bottom of the bottle and keep it from coming out of the gift wrap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the top of the paper and tape it closed.",
      "content": "Fold the top of the paper and tape it closed. Stand up the bottle on its base so the extra length of wrapping paper stretches over the top of the bottle. Smooth out the paper, fold over the upper edge, and tape it shut to finish wrapping the bottle. [7] X Research source The top of the wrapping paper extends past the top of the bottle and doesn’t wrap around the neck. If the paper is much longer than your bottle, use your scissors to trim it down, then fold it over and tape it shut."

      "title": "Tie some ribbon around the wrapping to add a decorative touch.",
      "content": "Tie some ribbon around the wrapping to add a decorative touch. Take 1 metre (1.1 yd) of ribbon and place the bottom of your bottle in the center of it. Bring the ribbon over the top of the wrapping and make a loose knot. Then, wrap the ribbon around the sides of the gift wrap and tie a bow for a nice decorative accent. [8] X Research source Ribbon can be a great way to enhance your wrapping and add to the theme of the occasion. For example, if you’re giving a bottle as a congratulatory gift for a baby boy, you could use blue ribbon, or if the liquor is a gift for a springtime party, you could use pastel green ribbon."

      "content": "Place the bottle in a gift bag for an easy solution. Pick up a gift bag that’s close to the size of your liquor bottle. Place the bottle into the bag and add some gift tissue paper as a decorative touch that also helps conceal the bottle inside. [9] X Research source If you’re in a hurry or don’t have time to wrap your bottle, a gift bag is a quick fix."

      "title": "Put the bottle in a box and gift-wrap the box to conceal it.",
      "content": "Put the bottle in a box and gift-wrap the box to conceal it. Place your bottle of liquor in an empty box so it isn’t obvious what your gift is. Wrap the box with wrapping paper and you’re ready to give your gift. [10] X Research source If you don’t want the bottle to move around in the box, you can stuff some packing material like newspaper or gift tissue paper."

      "title": "Gather cellophane and tissue around the bottle for a shiny wrapping.",
      "content": "Gather cellophane and tissue around the bottle for a shiny wrapping. Attach some double-sided tape on the edges of gift wrap tissue paper and place a layer of gift cellophane on top to connect them. Stand your bottle in the center of the paper and gather up the cellophane, holding it at the neck of the bottle. Tie a ribbon around the neck of the bottle to hold the cellophane tissue wrapping in place. [11] X Research source You could also use cellophane that’s dark enough to prevent seeing through it instead of connecting tissue paper to it. Look for gift wrapping tissue and cellophane at your local craft supply store or department store. You can also order them online."

      "title": "Roll the bottle in a tea towel to give 2 gifts in 1.",
      "content": "Roll the bottle in a tea towel to give 2 gifts in 1. Use a clean, nice-looking tea towel and fold it in half on a flat surface. Place your bottle of liquor between the 2 layers of the tea towel and roll the bottle until it’s tightly wrapped in the tea towel. Tie a ribbon around the neck of the bottle to secure it and you’re set to give 2 gifts at the same time! [12] X Research source Look for nice tea towels at your local home decor store. You can also order them online."

      "content": "Twist wrapping paper around the bottle and tape it for a last-minute option. If you aren’t great at wrapping gifts or you’re pressed for time, take some gift wrap and wrap it tightly around the bottle. Use clear tape to keep it attached. Twist the paper around the neck of the bottle and add more tape to hold it in place. [13] X Research source The bottle will be wrapped, but it’ll be pretty obvious what the gift is."
