      "content": "Make a list of the things you want a few days before. Start out by writing down everything you think you might want a couple of days before you write your letter to Santa. Return to your list every so often and reconsider what you wrote. Cross off items you are not keen on, keeping only the ones you really love. [1] X Research source Santa gets tons of letters from children (and children-at-heart) around the globe, so sometimes he is not able to get a child everything on their list. This is why it is important that you only include your top items."
