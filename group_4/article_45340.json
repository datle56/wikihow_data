      "title": "Low Fade",
      "content": "Low Fade The low fade is a classic choice. It starts just above the ears, dropping down on the back of the head toward the hairline at the nape of your neck. Because the fade starts lower, the effect is less noticeable than higher fades, making this a good choice if you want a more subtle or conservative cut. [1] X Research source Maintenance tip: Low fades don’t take a lot of maintenance—the new growth is low on your head near your natural hairline, so it doesn’t look as obvious. That means you can usually wait longer between trips to the barber. Best hairstyles to pair it with: Low fades work well with haircuts like the side part or slicked-back styles, but it may not be the best look for textured styles where you want a lot of contrast."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mid Fade",
      "content": "Mid Fade Mid fades usually start around the temples. The effect is more striking than a low fade because of the added contrast, making it a good choice if you want something modern and fashionable, but still more casual than a high fade. [2] X Research source Maintenance tip: Because more skin is exposed in a mid fade, new growth will be more obvious. You’ll need to visit your barber or stylist for touch-ups every few weeks with this cut. Best hairstyles to pair it with: Mid fades are versatile, working well with structured cuts like a quiff or pompadour, but also adding structure to more casual styles like a messy fringe or blowout."
    },
    {
      "title": "High Fade",
      "content": "High Fade A high fade is a modern, bold look that starts high on the head near the parietal ridge (the part of your head that curves down from the top to the sides). A high fade leaves of skin exposed, so most of the focus will be on the top of your head—making this a good option if you want to accentuate an edgy or textured style. [3] X Research source Maintenance tip: Like a mid fade, plan on seeing your barber or stylist every 2–3 weeks with this cut. Best hairstyles to pair it with: The sharp edge of a high fade looks great combined with styles like the French crop, crew cut, and afro. High fades can be seen as a little edgy, so they may not be suitable for all professional environments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drop Fade",
      "content": "Drop Fade Drop fades curve down behind the ear toward the back of the head. This creates a more natural fade than one that runs in a straight line all the way around your head. They’re especially good for low and mid fades, but you can get a high drop fade as well. [4] X Research source Some stylists will automatically cut low and mid fades in a drop because it’s more natural-looking, but it’s a good idea to double-check before they start cutting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Taper Fade",
      "content": "Taper Fade The term “taper fade” is often used to refer to a fade that changes length gradually. It still ends in a fade, but the transition is subtle. But this isn’t a standard definition—some people use “taper fade” interchangeably with “taper,” which isn’t a fade. If you want this cut, it’s best to be really specific with your barber or stylist about the exact look you’re going for. [5] X Research source For instance, if you want a low taper fade , you might ask for a low fade that gradually gets longer, without a noticeable line where the length changes. What’s the difference between a taper and a fade ? With a taper cut, you’ll typically have some length all the way down to the bottom of the cut. With a fade, the hair will be very short or shaved all the way down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Skin Fade/Bald Fade",
      "content": "Skin Fade/Bald Fade The terms “skin fade” and “ bald fade ” are interchangeable. They both mean a fade that goes all the way down to bare skin using a zero on the clippers. The sides and top can be any length. [6] X Research source Skin fades can be high, medium, or low, and can be combined with any variety of cuts on top."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shadow Fade",
      "content": "Shadow Fade With a shadow fade, you leave a little length at the shortest part of the fade—not as much as you would with a taper, but just enough to create a “shadow” of hair. Shadow fades can be low, mid, or high, and they can work with a variety of cuts on top. [7] X Research source Shadow fades can be a good option if you have sensitive skin and experience skin irritation with the regular touch-ups needed to maintain a skin fade."

      "title": "Temple Fade/Brooklyn Fade",
      "content": "Temple Fade/Brooklyn Fade Temple fades—or Brooklyn fades—were popularized in NYC in the ‘90s. Temple fades start at about mid-height around the temple, but they often drop back to a lower fade in the back. [8] X Research source Temple fades are often paired with a blowout, meaning the hair on top is left longer with a sharp transition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Burst Fade",
      "content": "Burst Fade The burst fade is an edgy trend where the hair is faded in a distinct curve behind the ears. Unlike a drop fade, though, the burst fade doesn’t go all the way around your head—the fade goes in two C-shapes behind your eras, and there’s a strip of longer hair in the back that goes all the way down to the nape of your neck. [9] X Research source For a more subtle look, try a low burst fade —but if you really want to go edgy, a mid or high burst fade is your best bet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Messy Fade",
      "content": "Messy Fade With a messy fade , the hair on top has added texture so you can wear it in a carefree, messy style. Messy fringe fades , brush-up fades, wavy fades, and curly fades are some of the most popular messy fade styles. Try a mid fade with messy texture on top for a look that’s casual but trending."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blowout Fade",
      "content": "Blowout Fade A blowout fade is a taper fade where the hair is left a little longer on the top, back, and sides. It features lots of volume and is often styled with the hair going upward. Blowouts are often paired with a low, mid, or burst fade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Side Part Fade",
      "content": "Side Part Fade The side part fade, also known as a comb over fade, features longer hair that’s worn parted on the side. For a more dramatic look, have your barber shave a hard part along your natural hairline."
    },
    {
      "title": "Crew Cut Fade",
      "content": "Crew Cut Fade Crew cuts are a classic, clean-cut style that’s been popular since the 1920s. The top is short, transitioning to even shorter hair on the sides and back. If you want a subtle, low-maintenance style, go with a low fade or taper fade crew cut. If you want a bolder look that elongates your face, opt for a high fade crew cut."
    },
    {
      "title": "Undercut Fade",
      "content": "Undercut Fade While most undercuts have longer hair on top that abruptly transitions to shorter hair on the back and sides, you can opt for an undercut fade to get a more subtle effect. Low fade undercuts are popular right now, but you can go with a mid or high fade for a bolder look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pompadour Fade",
      "content": "Pompadour Fade Modern pompadours are cut similar to an undercut, with longer hair on top and shorter sides and back. Pompadours are worn up and back for a sleek, polished look. Mid fades and drop fades are popular options for a pompadour cut."

    {
      "title": "French Crop",
      "content": "French Crop A French Crop is a fade that’s worn longer and brushed forward on top, with tapered sides. It’s a low-maintenance, versatile style that works in both casual and professional settings. Try a drop fade with a French crop for a clean and casual look."

    {
      "title": "Afro Fade",
      "content": "Afro Fade An afro fade adds a little structure to this natural hairstyle. A low afro fade usually looks the most natural, while a mid fade is good for bringing in the volume lower on your face. A high fade is a great option for a clean look that still shows off your natural texture."
    },
    {
      "title": "Burst Fade Mullet",
      "content": "Burst Fade Mullet For a modern take on the classic mullet, try a burst fade mullet . The fade starts above your temples and curves back toward the back of your neck. The top of your hair is cut shorter, but back is left longer to give those carefree mullet vibes. Leave the hair in the back just a little longer than the top for a more subtle mullet, or grow it out long for the full mullet experience."
    },
    {
      "title": "Taper Fade Mullet",
      "content": "Taper Fade Mullet The taper fade mullet is a more subtle variation on the mullet. The fade is mostly focused above your temples—it’s sometimes called a temple fade mullet—with the top and sides cut short and the back left a little longer. Taper fade mullets are usually kept fairly short in the back, but you can grow it out long if you want!"

      "title": "Boosie Fade",
      "content": "Boosie Fade The Boosie Fade is a high-and-tight fade that was popularized by rapper Boosie and immortalized in meme form. It’s a great choice if you want a sleek, clean-cut look with some length on top. Ask for a high fade that transitions into a rounded square at the top."

      "title": "Tell your stylist where the fade should start and how long it should be.",
      "content": "Tell your stylist where the fade should start and how long it should be. When you’re asking for a fade , it’s important to be specific about what you’re asking for. Knowing the terms for each fade style is a good starting point, but be prepared to add more detail, like exactly what you want the fade to look like and the length you want on the top and sides. When you’re talking about the length you want, it can be helpful to know what the different clipper lengths are. Carnevale-Russo says, “The higher the clipper number, the more hair that’s going to be left. A one or a zero is going to be a fade haircut. If you say you want a 3, you’re going to have longer hair.”"

    {
      "title": "Add details to make the cut your own.",
      "content": "Add details to make the cut your own. Talk to your stylist about what the top looks like, including the length you want and how you want to style it. Let them know how connected or disconnected you want the fade to be—meaning how sharp or subtle the transition is—and any areas where you want more or less volume. Carnevale-Russo advises, “Go on Google or Pinterest and find pictures of what you want, then bring them with you to your stylist or barber. They’ll be a lot more explanatory than trying to verbalize what you’re looking for.” Carnevale-Russo also suggests being open to your stylists’s opinion—”they may have suggestions on what will be the best fit for you.”"

      "title": "Choose a style that will suit the shape of your face.",
      "content": "Choose a style that will suit the shape of your face. To find your face shape , measure the length of your face plus the width of your cheeks. If the numbers are about the same, you may have a round or face, depending on the sharpness of your features. If your face is longer than it is wide, you may have a rectangular or oval face. Round: Try a mid or high fade to add definition to the contours of your face. [10] X Research source Oval: Any fade works with an oval face shape. Square: Try a mid fade—the tapering effect will help soften your features. Rectangular: If you have a rectangular face, consider a low fade—it can help balance out your features."

      "content": "Pick a style that works with your hair type. When you’re looking at inspiration pictures for your next haircut, try to find models who appear to have a similar hair texture to yours. That way, you’ll have a more realistic idea of how that cut will fall on your hair. Thick hair: Consider a high or mid fade to take down some of the volume on the sides. Thin: Go with a shorter cut like a crew cut fade, or add volume on top with a pompadour or spiky look. Curly or coily: Make the most of your natural waves, curls, or coils with a messy, blowout, or afro fade."

      "content": "Think about which cuts match your personal style. Changing up your hairstyle can sometimes make you feel like a whole new person, but if you pick a style that’s too different, you might not feel like it suits you. It’s also a good idea to think about whether certain cuts are appropriate for your job—if you work in an industry where you’re expected to have a neat, clean-cut appearance, higher fades might be frowned on. If you want a neat, professional look: Go with a subtle low fade paired with a neat cut on top, like a side part. [11] X Research source If your style is bold, creative, and edgy: Consider a high, mid, or specialty fade."

      "content": "Be prepared to get regular trims with a fade. You’ll need to see your barber or stylist every 2–3 weeks to keep high and mid fades looking fresh. You can probably get away with pushing low fades a little more—maybe every 4–6 weeks, depending on the style you choose—but any fade will start to look messy and unkempt without regular upkeep.

      "content": "Do touch-ups at home with clippers. “After your barber or stylist cuts the line in, you can use clippers at home every couple of days to maintain it. That way, you don’t lose that line,\" says Carnevale-Russo. According to professional hair stylist Marius Morf, it’s worth investing in good hair clippers : “A steady hand and a great pair of clippers are the keys to the perfect cut.”"

      "content": "Use styling products to get the look you want on top. You don’t need to do much to the back and sides of a fade, but a good product can add texture and hold to the top. Try a product like: Sea salt spray : Perfect for creating messy, beach-like texture Pomade : Helps your hair hold its shape Texturizing powder : Adds subtle texture for a messy look Matte clay : Adds texture and hold with a natural-looking finish."

      "content": "What’s the difference between a skin fade and a shadow fade? With a skin fade (or bold fade), the hair is cut all the way down to the skin. With a shadow fade, a little length is left, so it almost looks like a shadow on the skin."
