      "content": "One of the best ways to have rizz on Tinder is to show off your humor. Everyone loves being with someone who can make them laugh, so make sure your match vibes with your sense of humor. [1] X Research source Here are some funny openers to inspire you: Are you my laptop? Because you’re really hot, and I’m concerned. Could you get me a glass of water? Because I’m suddenly really thirsty. I’ve been blinded by your beauty. My insurance company is going to need your name and number. Your eyes are like Ikea. I’m totally lost in them. Do you ever lie down at night, look up at the stars, and think about all the messed up things in the world? Like, why is there a “d” in “fridge” but not in “refrigerator”? I hope you know CPR because you’re taking my breath away. I need a real estate agent. Do you know any? Because I’m trying to make a move here. Hey, I’m writing an article on the finer things in life and wanted to know if I could interview you. I heard you like bad girls/guys… Well, I’m bad at everything! Are you a good cuddler? Because if so, I might let you join my gang. Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I delete this match and try again? Will you be my Tinderella? You’re so gorgeous I forgot my best pick-up line. I’m not really this tall. I’m just sitting on my wallet. I don’t normally chase people, but I’d put my Crocs in sports mode for you. I should complain to Spotify for not making you this week’s hottest single. 123456789. The only number I don’t see here is yours. Are your shoelaces tied? I don’t want you falling for anyone else. I’ve got all these forks and knives. All I need is a little spoon. My mom told me not to talk to strangers online, but I’ll make an exception for you. You’re garbage! I guess I’ll have to take you out."

      "content": "Show off your silly side with a cheesy opener. Sometimes, cliche openers are cliche for a reason—they work! Use one ironically to show your sarcastic side, or use one unironically if you’re unashamedly cheesy. After all, you’ll probably want to attract someone with a similar personality. [2] X Research source Here are some popular options: Are you my untied shoelace? Because I’m falling for you. I think I’ve seen you in a book somewhere. It was really fine print. I’m researching important dates in history. Do you want to be mine? Do you like bagels? Because you’re bae-goals. If you were a fruit, you’d be a fine apple. What do you call a queue of people lifting mozzarella cheese? A cheesy pick-up line! If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber. Are you German? Because I’d like to be Ger-man. How much does a polar bear weigh? Enough to break the ice! I bet your birthday is October 10th because you’re a 10 out of 10. Just wanted to let you know: you have some cute on your face. Have you been speeding? Because you’ve got fine written all over you. You wanna know what’s beautiful? Read the first word again. Is there a rainbow outside? Because I think I just found gold. You look so familiar! Did we have chemistry together? Just call me Shrek because I’m head ogre heels for you. Have you been to the doctor recently? I think you’re lacking some vitamin me. I’m lost. Can you give me directions to your heart? Well, here I am. What are your other two wishes? Is there an airport nearby, or is that just my heart taking off?"

      "content": "Impress your match with a pun on their favorite topic. If your match mentions a specific interest like a movie, TV show, or video game, show them that you’re also a fan by sending them a cute pun! You can also do this if they mention their job, college degree, or interest like math or science. Here are some awesome nerdy pick-up lines: Wow, you breathe oxygen, too? We already have so much in common. Call me a proton because I’m positive you’re the one. Are you an appendix? Because I think I should take you out. If this goes well, you and Saturn will have something in common. You’ll both have giant rings! Even if gravity didn’t exist, I’d still fall for you. You’re sweeter than 3.14. I hear you like numbers. Want to add yours to my phone? Can you solve this equation: you + me + dinner Friday night = ? Are you a computer keyboard? Because you’re just my type. Are you hitting the F5 key right now? Because our conversation is refreshing. You and Google have something in common: you have everything I’m searching for. Is your phaser set to stunning? So you’re a Stranger Things fan. Well, I have a feeling you’re about to turn my world upside down. Want to be my player 2? I’m just a Link looking for my Zelda. Forget the Golden Snitch. You’re the best catch out there. It looks like I’m down to one heart. Mind if I have yours? Sorry, I thought you were Pikachu. You know, since you’re shockingly beautiful. Is your nickname D20? Because you’ve been rolling through my mind all day. You like comic books? I promise to keep our love in mint condition. Are you a Star Wars fan? Because Yoda one for me. Are you a D&D rogue? Because I’m pretty sure you just stole my heart. Are you HTTP? Because without you, I’m just :// Wanna be Minecraft without the craft? Hey, my name’s Microsoft. Can I crash at your place tonight?"

Yes, pickup lines can be cheesy, but if you use the right one at the right time, they can also show that you’re quick on your feet. [3] X Research source If you want to get your match’s phone number, try one of these lines: Look, I won’t flirt with you. I’ll just be extra friendly to someone who is extra attractive. Do you have an Instagram account? Because my mother always told me to follow my dreams. I would ask you to come to the movies with me, but they have a rule against bringing your own snacks. So, when our friends ask how we met, what are we going to tell them? Do I know you? You look a lot like my next boyfriend/girlfriend/partner. Let’s just set an anniversary date right now. You’re pretty, and I’m cute. Together, we could be pretty cute! I just became an organ donor so I could give you my heart. All the good pick-up lines are taken, but you aren’t. How can I plan our wedding without having your number? What’s your favorite drink? I’m asking so I know what to buy you on our first date. They say dating is a numbers game, so can I get yours? When I text you good morning tomorrow, what number should I send it to? They say nothing lasts forever. Want to be my nothing? Guess what I’m wearing? The smile you gave me. I have a phone number. You have a phone number. Think of the possibilities. I bet my number sounds better than yours. Wanna hear it? Aside from stealing hearts, what do you do? Is your license suspended from driving all these guys/girls crazy? It’s time to pay up because you’ve been living in my mind rent-free. I usually go for 8s, but I guess I can settle for a 10."

      "content": "Show your match you’re attracted to them by being flirty. There’s nothing wrong with showing someone you’re interested. It’s what you’re here for, after all! Don’t beat around the bush, and see if they flirt back. Just remember to keep it respectful! [4] X Research source Here are some flirty pick-up line options: I know your name is *their name* but what would you think about me calling you tonight? When I send your pic to my group chat, which one would you like me to use? I’d say bless you, but it looks like you already have been. If you could be anywhere in the world, doing anything you wanted, where would we be? Your lips look lonely. Would they like to meet mine? If you let me borrow a kiss, I promise I’ll give it right back. If I told you that you have a great body, would you hold it against me? You’re like a fine wine. The more of you I drink in, the better I feel. You know what you would look really good in? My arms. I think there’s something wrong with my phone. Could you try calling it to see if it works? Your hand looks heavy. Can I hold it for you? I thought this was Tinder, but it must be a museum because you’re a work of art. What does it feel like to be the most gorgeous person in the room? One night, I looked up at the stars and thought, “Wow, how beautiful,” but now that I’m looking at you, nothing else can compare. If I had a nickel for every time I saw someone as beautiful as you, I’d have 5 cents. I’m not religious, but when I saw you, I knew you were the answer to my prayers. Do you have the time? I want to remember the exact minute I got a crush on you. Kiss me if I’m wrong, but dinosaurs still exist, right? I believe that honesty is the best policy, so if I’m being completely honest, you’re the sexiest person I’ve ever seen. I’m going to have to ask you to leave Tinder. You make everyone else look bad."

      "content": "Create an engaging profile. If you want to put your rizz to the test, make sure you get matches by completing your profile. Have a variety of photos (not just bathroom selfies!) that show your personality and hobbies, and make sure your bio genuinely reflects who you are and what you’re looking for. [5] X Research source If you don’t have many high-quality photos of yourself, ask a friend to take some the next time you’re at a fancy event like a wedding or when you’re out doing an activity you’re passionate about. You can also learn how to take flattering photos of yourself if no one is available. Be direct about what you’re looking for. Whether it’s a long-term relationship or a hookup, let your potential matches know early on so you can both find someone who wants the same thing. Use good grammar in your bio to show your matches you’re taking this seriously. Showing that you put time and effort into it is a green flag."

Just don’t come across too braggy or act like you’re better than them. [6] X Research source To show your confidence , try messaging them first instead of waiting for them to start the conversation. Then, if they seem interested, don’t be afraid to ask for their phone number or set up a first date."
