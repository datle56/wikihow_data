      "content": "Smell amazing. Smell is incredibly powerful when it comes to attraction. Not so much in terms of smelling good (though it can help a little), but smelling bad is a HUGE turn-off. Set a good foundation by showering regularly and using deodorant. If you really want to smell amazing, add in a little body spray or perfume. [5] X Research source Choose a smell that you want him to associate with your personality (citrusy for playful, floral for feminine, musky for sensual, etc). Try not to go crazy with lots of different scents: work towards one \"signature\" smell that he can associate with you."

A lot of the time, guys are reluctant to date because they worry that they'll lose their freedom or their identity because this is something that our society tends to teach.

You know the girl who constantly gossips, starts arguments and fights with other people, and generally complains and looks for flaws in everything? Don't be that. Stay away from drama and definitely try to minimize the drama that he's exposed to.
