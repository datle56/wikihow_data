      "title": "Consider oil pulling.",
      "content": "Consider oil pulling. Oil pulling is an Ayurvedic remedy in which you swish oil in your mouth to remove harmful germs and bacteria from your mouth. Use organic, cold-pressed oil like vegetable, sesame, olive, or coconut oil. Take a spoonful of oil and swish it in your mouth for one minute to gain the benefits. If you can, try to swish the oil for 15-20 minutes. To make sure the oil absorbs and detoxifies as much bacteria as possible, aim to do this with an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse your mouth with lukewarm water. [1] X Research source These contain lipids that absorb toxins and pull them out of saliva. They also stop cavity-causing bacteria from sticking to the walls of your teeth. This is a natural moisturizer that also helps prevent dehydration in the throat and mouth, which can ease the symptoms of a cough."

      "title": "Take elderberry extract.",
      "content": "Take elderberry extract. Elderberry is commonly used to treat coughs, sore throats and respiratory illnesses because of its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. It also stimulates the immune system. You can buy Elderberry extract as a syrup, lozenge or dietary capsule supplement at most nutrition or drug stores. Or, you can steep 3–5 grams (0.11–0.18 oz) of dried elderflower in a cup of boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes. Then, drink it as a herbal tea, up to 3 times per day. Consider the following precautions: It's better to take elderberry every 2 to 3 days, since prolonged use isn't recommended. Elderberry is a blood thinner and may not be recommended for people with low blood pressure. Do not use unripe or uncooked elderberries since they may be poisonous. Speak to your doctor before taking elderberry, since it may have some side effects for pregnant people, people with autoimmune disease, and people taking diabetic medication, laxatives, chemotherapy drugs, or immunosuppressants."

      "content": "Use peppermint. You can buy peppermint in the form of lozenges, extracts used in dietary supplements, herbal teas, essential oils and a fresh herb. Don't forget that you can use the fresh leaves as a garnish or flavouring in everyday meals. You can also make and drink your own teak up to 3 times a day by steeping one tea bag (approx. 3-4 grams or 1 ½ teaspoon) of dried peppermint leaves in a cup of hot water (80–85°C). Peppermint contains menthol, which can help soothe sore throats and dry coughs. It's also a decongestant that can thin mucus and help break up phlegm. Don't use peppermint or menthol with infants. Also, don't take peppermint oil orally. Instead, it's usually used in aromatherapy or as a rub."

Try applying topical eucalyptus ointments to your nose and chest to relieve congestion and loosen phlegm. It's generally safe for adults to apply eucalyptus to the skin. Or, you make eucalyptus tea to drink up to 3 times a day by steeping 2–4 grams (0.14 oz) of dried eucalyptus leaves in a cup of hot water for 10–15 minutes. Eucalyptus' active ingredient is a compound called cineole, which works as an expectorant to fight respiratory infections and alleviate coughs. Eucalyptus also has antioxidant properties that protect against free radicals, molecules that can damage and infect cells. You can also gargle eucalyptus water after meals to reduce bad breath and soothe your throat. Do this up to 3 or 4 times a day by steeping 2–4 grams (0.14 oz) of dried leaves in one cup warm water (40°C) for 5-10 minutes."

You might give them a try, but understand that some may be more effective for you than others. These include traditional remedies that are commonly known for their helpful healing properties: Marshmallow (Althea officinalis) Slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) Mullein (Verbascum densiflorum) Sundew (Drosera spp.) Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)"

You can also supplement with glucose-free sports drinks that have electrolytes. If you drink caffeinated beverages, you should also drink 1 liter (0.26 US gal) of water for every cup (1 fluid oz.) of caffeine. Water helps ease congestion caused by colds, preventing postnasal drip that can irritate the throat, and keeps your throat from drying which can cause coughs. Not getting enough water can also lead to dehydration which can cause headaches, irritability, dizziness, irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath."

You can get probiotics from yogurt, certain types of milk, soy products and as dietary supplements. Talk with your doctor before taking probiotics if you have a weakened immune system or are currently taking immunosuppressant drugs.

Studies show that sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, increase the production of stress hormones, put you at higher risk for chronic disease and lower life expectancy. If you suffer from sleep apnea or insomnia, talk to your doctor for possible treatments. If you have a cold or nasal congestion, try to lie on the side that is least congested to breathe comfortably and allow the mucus to drain. To get plenty of rest, you can also: Avoid caffeine, alcohol and sugary foods 4-6 hours before heading to bed. These can act as stimulants to keep you awake. Create a regular sleep schedule by going to bed early and waking up early to set your body's internal clock. This will make sure you get better quality and consistent sleep. If you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed, go to another room and do something relaxing until you are tired enough to sleep. Melatonin (1 to 3 mg) and/or 1 to 2 Valerian capsules may also be helpful to fall asleep. If you suffer from obstructive sleep apnea—frequently interrupted breathing during sleep— ask your doctor for treatment options. Your doctor may recommend surgery or CPAP.

[9] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source The pillow should support the natural curve of your neck and be comfortable. Place a firm pillow between your knees and pull your knees up slightly toward your chest if you sleep on your side. This will prevent your upper leg from pulling your spine out of alignment and reduce stress on your hips and lower back. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, since this can block breathing, promote acid reflux and cause stress. Avoid working or exercise 3–4 hours before going to bed. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can make the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol may increase your alertness. In this context, it is interesting to note that melatonin counters the effects of cortisol. Try listening to relaxing music or doing some light reading a few hours before sleeping. Regular, moderate exercise, especially in the afternoon, can help deepen sleep."
