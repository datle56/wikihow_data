If the equation you’re looking at doesn’t equal zero, don’t worry. We'll show you how to convert it. Here's a quadratic equation in standard form: a x 2 {\\displaystyle ax^{2}} + b x + c = 0 {\\displaystyle +bx+c=0} [1] X Research source Here are 2 examples to demonstrate: x 2 − 3 x + 1 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-3x+1=0} This equation is ready to solve because it equals 0 {\\displaystyle 0} . − 3 x 2 + 6 x = − 5 {\\displaystyle -3x^{2}+6x=-5} This equation is not ready to solve just yet.

      "content": "Standard form means the equation equals “0” and is ready to solve. It might sound complicated, but converting to standard form is pretty easy. You just need to move some things around a bit! It’s easier to show you, so check out these examples: [2] X Research source If an equation looks like this: − 3 x 2 + 6 x = − 5 {\\displaystyle -3x^{2}+6x=-5} Move the − 5 {\\displaystyle -5} to the left side of the equal sign and put 0 {\\displaystyle 0} on the right side of the equal sign. Remember: numerals change from + {\\displaystyle +} to − {\\displaystyle -} (or vice versa) when you move them to the other side of the equal sign. Our converted equation: − 3 x 2 + 6 x + 5 = 0 {\\displaystyle -3x^{2}+6x+5=0} If an equation looks like this: x 2 = 3 x − 1 {\\displaystyle x^{2}=3x-1} Move all the terms to left side of the equal sign. Our converted equation: x 2 − 3 x + 1 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-3x+1=0} If an equation looks like this: 2 ( w 2 − 2 w ) = 5 {\\displaystyle 2(w^{2}-2w)=5} Undo the brackets to expand and move 5 to the left of the equal sign. Our converted equation: 2 w 2 − 4 w − 5 = 0 {\\displaystyle 2w^{2}-4w-5=0}"

      "title": "The radical is the number inside √ which is 96.",
      "content": "The radical is the number inside √ which is 96. To simplify, find the prime factorization of the number inside the radical. \"Prime factorization\" means dividing the number by 2 (the first prime number). Then, continue dividing by 2 until you get a decimal or remainder. At that point, divide by 3, 5, 7, etc. until all you have left are prime numbers. Here's the prime factorization of 96: 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 96. Group the pairs: (2 x 2) (2 x 2). There are four 2s, so 4 goes outside the radical sign. Multiply what's left: (2 x 3) = 6. This goes inside the radical sign. So √ 96 {\\displaystyle 96} simplified = 4√ 6 {\\displaystyle 6} Putting it all together: x = − 6 {\\displaystyle x=-6} ± 4√ 6 {\\displaystyle 6} / − 6 {\\displaystyle /-6}"
