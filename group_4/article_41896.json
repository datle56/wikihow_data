      "content": "Leave some of your conditioner in. Even though it’s meant to be rinsed out, leaving some of your conditioner in can give your curly locks a moisture boost. Just after you apply the conditioner, give your hair a very brief rinse. Then, leave the rest in to get smoother, shinier hair. [5] X Research source Don’t skip the quick rinse, or else the conditioner may weigh down your curls too much."

      "content": "Detangle your hair with a wide-toothed comb. Using a brush to detangle your curls will only create unsightly frizz. Instead, use a wide-toothed comb after washing and conditioning your hair. Start combing your ends and slowly work your way up to the root area instead of combing root to tip. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Let your hair air-day half way.",
      "content": "Let your hair air-day half way. If your hair is thick and coarse, it’ll take longer to air-dry. If your hair is fine and thin, it’ll dry quickly. Let your hair dry naturally for however long you need to in order to get your hair about 40% of the way dry. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Scrunch",
      "content": "Scrunch your hair with a small towel or microfiber cloth. Hold your towel or cloth flat in your palm just below the ends of a small section of your hair. Bring the towel or cloth upward while simultaneously squeezing your hair. Once your hand is close to your head, hold the squeezed position for a couple of seconds. Then move onto a new section of hair. Repeat this process for your entire head. This will remove the excess water from your hair and also give you natural, bouncy curls."

      "title": "Plop your hair",
      "content": "Plop your hair with a cotton t-shirt. Lay out a cotton t-shirt with the bottom of the shirt facing you. Flip your hair over onto the center of the towel and then place the shirt’s bottom on the nape of your neck. Use the shirt sleeves to tie a knot towards the back of your head in order to secure the shirt to your head. Untie the knot and remove the shirt after about 10-20 minutes. [8] X Research source Plopping works well for hair that is medium to long in length. It adds volume and curl because the hair is squished against the head; It also removes moisture from the hair."

      "content": "Volumize your curls with a sea salt spray. In general, you want to keep your hair products lighter, to avoid weighing down your hair and decreasing volume. Hold a sea salt spray bottle about 6 inches (15 cm) away from your hair and give your locks a quick spritz. Move the bottle around your head as your spray about 5-8 times so that all of your hair gets an even application. Salt sprays create a very dry, natural finish on your roots (almost as if they've been teased). You can still tease your hair a little bit with a comb if you want, but you don't have to do it so vigorously because of the salt spray. Sea salt spray will hold the strands of your hair together well without giving your hair the “crunchy” texture that other products often do. [11] X Research source You can also get some extra volume by applying a volumizing foam to your hair. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Moisturize and/or de-frizz with leave-in conditioners. Apply a leave-in conditioner to your wet hair in order to give your hair the moisture it needs, and also lessen frizz. When hair frizzes, it is moving outwards in search of moisture, but it will lie flat when well moisturized. You can also apply an oil serum to your hair to help de-frizz it. [13] X Research source It’s also beneficial to apply some leave-in conditioner to your hair 1-2 days after you’ve washed it to help revitalize your curls."

Take a flatter/straighter strand of hair that’s about the same size as one of your curls and wrap it around the wand. Hold this position for a couple of seconds. Let go of the strand and slowly pull the wand away from your hair. Using a curling wand on some strands in your top layer will add definition and shape to your curls. Repeat this process for about 10-12 strands evenly spaced around your head. [14] X Research source"

Repeat this process with the rest of the clips on various points of your head. This will create the illusion of volume at the root area.
