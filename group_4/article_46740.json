      "content": "Be in good health and avoid saunas if you have any high-risk medical conditions. Saunas are considered safe for most users, but some people need to take extra precautions. Others might have to avoid saunas altogether. If you are taking medications, or have any medical conditions, ask your doctor for advice. Some illnesses, such as a cold, might benefit from a short visit. Others might get worse. You should reconsider using a sauna if: You have unstable angina pectoris, poor blood pressure , abnormal heart beats, advanced heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or severe aortic stenosis. You have other high-risk medical conditions, such as: kidney disease, liver failure, or other cardiac conditions. [1] X Research source You are a child, pregnant, or trying to conceive. Many places won't allow children under a certain age to use the sauna. Saunas may also affect the developing fetus, or reduce sperm count. You are feeling sick, faint easily, have cramps, suffering from heat exhaustion or heat stroke. You are taking medications that prevent you from sweating or cause you to overheat very quickly."

      "title": "Drink two to four glasses of water before going into a sauna.",
      "content": "Drink two to four glasses of water before going into a sauna. Saunas cause the body to sweat, and thus lose water. Because of this, is vital that you stay hydrated. If you don't drink enough water before getting in, you can get dehydrated. This can lead to heat strokes, or worse. Water is the best, but isotonic drinks are also suitable. Avoid drinking alcohol before (and during) using a sauna. Alcohol dehydrates the body, which can become a big problem in a sauna. If you did drink alcohol and have a hangover , wait until it is over.

      "content": "Bring a clean, cotton towel to sit on. This will help keep you clean, as well as protect the benches from body oils. If you are going into a coed sauna, consider bringing a cotton sarong or wrap to cover yourself with. Whatever you bring into the sauna must be dry and clean. Ideally, you should clean your sauna attire using water, and if needed, a little bit of white vinegar. A mild detergent intended for baby clothes is also a good substitute."

      "content": "Do not wear anything dirty or tight-fitting to a sauna, including things that you wore throughout the day. Clothes pick up lots of dust and dirt throughout the day. The sauna's heat will loosen this dirt, and release it into the air and onto your skin. You also should not wear tight-fitting clothes, as your skin also needs to breathe. Listed below are things that are not appropriate to bring into a sauna: Clothes you wore throughout the day are bad for saunas. Shoes are bad choices for the same reason as your day clothes. Shower sandals are okay to wear to the sauna, but should be taken off once you get inside, especially before you get up on the benches. Sweat suits and workout clothes are bad choices, especially if you just wore them to a workout. Sauna suits made out of PVC are dangerous. They keep the skin from breathing, and can actually melt in the sauna. The high temperatures will cause them to give off toxic fumes, chemicals, and residue. Old, loose-fitting swimsuits are okay, so long as they are colorfast, and contain no slimming panels or metal parts. Anything that has metal on it. Saunas get hot, and metal heats up easily. If that metal is against your skin, you could end up with bad burns."

If you have any jewelry, take it off, and put it in a safe place. Do not take it into the sauna with you. [3] X Research source You also don't want to wear any creams or lotions. If they don't run with your sweat and make an oily mess, they will clog up your pores and keep your skin from breathing and sweating."

This is because your body will be using a lot of energy to digest and process that food. If you just finished working out, wait until your heart rate slows down and you regain some energy. Your body will need this energy in the sauna."

Use baking soda on stubborn stains, especially oil-based ones."
