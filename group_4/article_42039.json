When they are looking for a place to sit, suggest one with minimal distractions (e.g. facing away from a noisy kitchen) Move conversations to quiet places Designate an area where the autistic person can retreat during stress, and fill it with calming things"

When changes are made to those routines, the whole day can be completely thrown off, leading to confusion, fear, anger, or a meltdown. Here are some tips to keep things stable: Help them create a schedule. Time slots can be used to designate what activities will happen during each part of the day. Maintain a visual calendar. Place it in a prominent and accessible location, such as a wall in the family room. Illustrations (clip art or drawings) can make the calendar look more friendly and appealing"

      "content": "Give your loved one plenty of warning so that they can adjust to any schedule changes. To prepare your loved one for this change, you should try to plan the event with them so they know it is coming For example, a dentist's appointment may change your loved one's schedule. Put this event on your loved oneâ€™s calendar and discuss it with them ahead of time. While they might not be happy about their schedule being changed, they will at least be prepared. Try to place activities at specific time slots. For example, if they have math meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:00, plan something else at 3:00 (e.g. a family hike) so that they will always have some sort of activity at the time."

      "title": "Schedule downtime after stressful or taxing events.",
      "content": "Schedule downtime after stressful or taxing events. After a busy day at school, a social event, an appointment, or an outing, an autistic person is likely to feel tired. Time spent doing quiet activities (reading, playing, special interests) will help them recharge and stay balanced. Remember that your idea of relaxation may not match their idea of relaxation. During a schedule change, try to schedule something positive after the stressful change. For example, after a doctor appointment, let your son have free time until supper."

      "title": "Determine which stimuli cause discomfort.",
      "content": "Determine which stimuli cause discomfort. Autistic people often struggle with Sensory Processing Disorder, a neurological disorder in which sensory input that feels normal to other people may feel distracting, intensely uncomfortable, or even painful to the individual. Understand that these sensitivities cannot be ignored or willed away, and cause real distress. Communicate with your loved one about the stimuli. Notice what causes discomfort, or ask. They may potentially be able to express discomfort, or give you clues. Pinpoint what the issues are, and try to find ways around them. For example, if your teenage sister cannot handle the sharp taste of toothpaste, try helping her pick out a milder flavor (e.g. children's bubble gum) toothpaste at the store."

Due to this confusion about body language, an autistic person will more than likely not produce body language that matches the way she is feeling. This is also the case with tone. Because of this, it is important to remind yourself not to read into or be offended by any rude tone or body language that is directed at you. [10] X Research source For example, your loved oneâ€™s tone may seem short and rude, yet they may be in a fantastic mood. Watching their stims may offer cues. For example, if a boy only flaps his hands when he is happy, then this is probably a reliable sign that nothing is actually wrong. Even if they are upset, it may not be your fault. For example, a barking dog may have been putting them on edge all day."

During the therapy, your loved one will hopefully develop strategies for emotional regulation, conversational skills, problem solving, and friendship skills.

Avoid compliance therapies, which can hinder their ability to say no. When your loved one says \"no,\" listen. What's wrong? If something is unavoidable, can you remove the part that makes it distasteful, or strike a bargain that they are happy with? Only ignore a \"no\" in important cases of health or safety. Teens and adults may gain skills through self-advocacy groups such as ASAN or the Autism Women's Network.
