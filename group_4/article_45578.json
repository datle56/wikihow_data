      "content": "Come up with a compliment that is personal, specific, and unexpected. The key to giving a unique compliment is to highlight a small quirk or trait that may go unnoticed by other people. Detailed compliments that go beyond physical appearance are much more unique and impactful, especially if you incorporate creative or witty comparisons. If the other person always has the answers, for example, you could tell them they’re basically a human search engine. Here are some other tips to create a unique and genuine compliment : Start your compliment with an “I” statement: Using “I” statements, such as “I admire…” or “I appreciate…” gives your words more weight and makes your compliment seem more sincere. Celebrate their skills, talents, and best traits: Think about their words and actions to craft a meaningful compliment that goes beyond looks. If you need help, search positive adjectives online, and weave them into your compliment. Acknowledge the impact they’ve made in your life: People love knowing they’ve made a difference in the world, so bring up all the ways the other person has affected you. It could be as simple as making you smile on a bad day, or as deep as making you believe in love again. Give a compliment that matches their personality: If your friend is a jokester, for example, you might want to give them a witty and playful compliment so they don’t feel awkward. If you’re complimenting your long-term partner, however, you might want to use deep and heartfelt words."
