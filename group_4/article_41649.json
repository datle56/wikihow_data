      "title": "Fill a glass jar with weed.",
      "content": "Fill a glass jar with weed. Glass jars are the best because they’re airtight, they don’t leave flavors behind, and they trap weed odors inside. Try to fill the jar with as much weed as possible to reduce the amount of air inside. [1] X Research source Use different jars if you’re planning on storing multiple strains. That way, each strain maintains their flavors. If you can, opt for UV-resistant glass containers that help block light to help protect your weed even more."

    {
      "title": "Add freshness packets to the jar.",
      "content": "Add freshness packets to the jar. Freshness packets absorb moisture to help maintain humidity levels and keep mold from growing on your weed. Drop a packet or two into the top of the jar, especially if you have a strain that contains more moisture. [2] X Research source Product Recommendation: Many weed smokers use Boveda humidity packs because they maintain a specific humidity level made for cannabis. Choose packs between 54–63% humidity for the best preservation."

    {
      "title": "Seal the jar with an airtight lid.",
      "content": "Seal the jar with an airtight lid. When cannabis is exposed to oxygen, the THC starts to break down more quickly. Choose a lid that fits tightly and has rubber around the inside rim to prevent airflow. [3] X Research source Using an airtight lid also helps trap strong weed odors so they don’t permeate throughout your home. Only open the jar again when you plan to smoke to limit how much your weed is exposed to air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your jar of weed in a dark and cool spot.",
      "content": "Keep your jar of weed in a dark and cool spot. Find a closet, drawer, or cabinet away from direct sunlight. Try to keep the temperature between 60–70 °F (16–21 °C) and the humidity levels between 59-63% because drastic temperature or moisture level changes can reduce your weed’s potency. [4] X Research source Make sure there aren’t any other strong-smelling substances, like spices or cleaning chemicals, near your weed because there’s a chance your weed could absorb some of the smell. If you have children or pets in your home, make sure to store your weed in a place where they cannot easily access it. Choose a high cabinet or a locked container for safe storage.

      "title": "Weed can stay good for a few years, but it won’t be as potent.",
      "content": "Weed can stay good for a few years, but it won’t be as potent. Even when you store weed in the perfect conditions, weed can lose about 16% of its THC content after only 1 year. As it sits around longer, the potency keeps going down. Enjoy your weed within a few months of storing it if you want to want to feel the full effects. You may store weed for longer and it’s still safe to smoke, but the effects won’t be as strong as fresher flower. If the weed is sticky or has a higher moisture level, then there is a chance that it could form mold in humid conditions. Signs of moldy weed include a musty odor or a white coating that feels powdery or fuzzy. If you notice these signs, then throw the weed away."

      "title": "Stainless steel containers",
      "content": "Stainless steel containers Stainless steel containers don’t leave behind any residual flavors and they block the light so your weed stays potent. Opt for containers that have rubber-lined lids so they’re airtight once you seal them. [6] X Research source Titanium containers are also a great choice for storing weed. While other metals can leave behind a metallic taste on your weed, stainless steel and titanium will help preserve the strain's original flavor."

      "title": "Vacuum-sealed bags",
      "content": "Vacuum-sealed bags Putting your weed in a bag and using a vacuum sealer helps pull out all the oxygen from the package. Because there’s less air exposure, you weed will stay safe and potent for longer periods of time. [7] X Research source Vacuum-sealing works best on dry weed buds. If you seal buds that are wet, damp, or sticky, then they could grow bacteria."

      "title": "Humidor",
      "content": "Humidor A humidor is primarily used to store cigars at the perfect humidity, but it can also work for storing weed if you don’t have other options. Either store your weed loose inside of the humidor, or roll blunts so they’re ready to smoke when you pull them out. [8] X Research source Still keep your humidor in a dark and cool area so it maintains the proper humidity inside."

      "title": "Aluminum foil",
      "content": "Aluminum foil If you only need to store your weed for a short time, like if you just need to transport it somewhere, wrap your buds in aluminum foil. Just keep in mind that you’ll still notice the smell and your weed could lose potency because the foil isn’t airtight. [9] X Research source Aluminum may also give your weed a slightly metallic flavor if you store it long-term."

    {
      "title": "Sandwich bags",
      "content": "Sandwich bags Sandwich bags are an okay substitute if you’re really in a pinch, but they’re not ideal for long-term weed storage. The plastic creates static that can destroy the trichomes, or the little hairs on weed that contain the THC, so your weed won’t be as potent when you smoke it. You may also notice a weed smell because the odor can permeate through the bag. [10] X Research source If you plan on using sandwich bags, wrap your weed buds in paper towels or parchment paper to protect them."

      "title": "Should I store weed ground or whole?",
      "content": "Should I store weed ground or whole? Store whole weed buds to keep them freshest. When you grind weed, it has more surface area that’s exposed to the air. Exposure to oxygen can reduce your flower’s potency, so it won’t be as strong when you smoke it later on. Tightly pack the buds in your storage container instead. [11] X Research source If you already ground your weed or bought it pre-ground, still keep it in an airtight container in a cool, dark place so it doesn’t lose any more potency."

      "title": "Can I store weed in the fridge or freezer?",
      "content": "Can I store weed in the fridge or freezer? No, you shouldn’t freeze or refrigerate weed long-term. It’s true that colder temperatures can slow down how fast THC in weed breaks down, so it works well for a couple of days. However, the humidity in your fridge changes pretty frequently and could cause mold to grow on your weed. In your freezer, the cold temperatures can actually make your weed fragile and cause the trichomes containing THC to break off. [12] X Research source Ice can also form if your weed isn’t fully dried out before freezing it, which could make it less potent and flavorful."

      "title": "Prerolls",
      "content": "Prerolls Because prerolls have ground weed in them, store them in an airtight glass container just like your buds. Keep them in a cool, dark place for the meantime and only pull them out when you plan on smoking them. [13] X Research source If your joint came in a plastic airtight tube, it’s perfectly safe to leave it there."

      "title": "Tinctures",
      "content": "Tinctures Keep tinctures in amber bottles to protect them from harmful UV lights. Make sure to screw on an airtight lid and keep the tincture in a cool, dark place away from heat sources. [16] X Research source Tinctures don’t have strong odors, so you don’t have to worry about them making a cabinet or closet stinky."

      "content": "Topicals Keep the topicals sealed in the container they came in because they’re already made to protect against light and temperatures. Place the topicals in a dark cabinet or closet away from heat sources until you’re ready to use them. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Vape cartridges",
      "content": "Vape cartridges Make sure to keep vape cartridges and pens vertical so the concentrate sits at the bottom and is ready to hit right away. Place vape pens in a dark cabinet or closet when you’re not using them so they aren’t exposed to light or lose potency."
