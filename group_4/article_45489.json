      "content": "Watch your cat's body language. Cat's meows can be confusing as they may meow for many different reasons. While a cat may meow to get your attention, it may also meow as a warning. You can pay attention to your cat's body language to help read the meowing. [1] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Pay attention to how your cat reacts to you when it is meowing. Does it arch its back and rub up against you? Does it reach its head up to meet your hand when you reach down to pet it? If so, your cat may be meowing because it wants your affection. Conversely, meowing may be a sign of aggression or fear. If your cat cowers when meowing, and ducks away from your touch, it may be meowing because it's distressed."

      "title": "Consider whether your cat wants something.",
      "content": "Consider whether your cat wants something. Your cat may meow while engaging in other behaviors. These behaviors may indicate the cat wants something. It may be trying to get you to do something. [2] X Research source For example, if your cat is meowing while running to the kitchen, it wants to be fed. If your cat is meowing by the door to your bedroom, it wants to go in the bedroom. Cats often signal what they need in other ways while they meow. If you pay attention to what your cat is doing while it meows, you may be able to figure out why it is meowing."

      "title": "Think about when the meowing is occurring.",
      "content": "Think about when the meowing is occurring. Cats may meow at specific points in the day. This can help you pinpoint the reason for the meowing. Meowing that occurs near dinner time, for example, probably means your cat wants food. Meowing that occurs when you first get home is probably a greeting. [3] X Research source You should also pay attention to where your cat is when it meows. Cats dislike being alone for long periods. If your cat meows when it's alone in a room, it may be meowing out of loneliness. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Weigh in recent changes.",
      "content": "Weigh in recent changes. Meowing is often the expression of a benign emotion or need. However, meowing can be in response to stress. Think about any recent changes to your home. Consider whether these could be the cause of your cat's meowing. [5] X Research source Cats may get stressed in response to a recent move, a new pet, a new baby, or any other big changes. If your household has undergone major changes recently, your cat may be meowing out of stress. If you can adjust the cause of the stress, this may cut back on the meowing. For example, if your cat dislikes its new bed, switching back to an old bed can help. However, some changes, like a recent move, cannot be undone. In this case, give your cat extra love and attention as it adjusts to the changes."

      "title": "Consider if your cat is spayed or neutered.",
      "content": "Consider if your cat is spayed or neutered. If your cat has not been fixed, meowing is often hormonal. Female cats will yowl in heat in attempt to find mates. Male cats will yowl if they smell a female in heat nearby. As such noise can be frustrating to live with, consider spaying or neutering your cat to cut back on unwanted meowing.

      "title": "Think about your cat's age.",
      "content": "Think about your cat's age. If your cat is getting older, it may meow more. A cat may meow if it becomes confused due to deteriorating senses. It may be a good idea to have an elderly cat evaluated by a vet to make sure it does not have any major health problems causing excessive meowing.

      "title": "Evaluate the length of the meow.",
      "content": "Evaluate the length of the meow. The duration of the meow may indicate what the cat is trying to express. Shorter meows tend to indicate your cat wants something, such as food or attention. Longer, drawn out meows, especially if they're throatier in nature, tend to indicate your cat is annoyed or stressed by something. [8] X Research source A long and very drawn out moaning noise is almost always an indication of distress. If you hear your cat yowling, you should check in on it to make sure it's okay. The frequency of meowing can also indicate what your cat is communicating. Many meows fired off in quick succession usually indicate your cat is trying to get your attention."

    {
      "title": "Listen to the tone of the meow.",
      "content": "Listen to the tone of the meow. You can tell a lot about a cat's meow by tuning into tone. You may hear purring or rumbling noises alongside a meow. This usually indicate a happy meow. Squeaky meows, or meows that sound like chirps, usually indicate your cat is happy to see you. [9] X Research source In rare occasions, purring can actually indicate distress. Focus on your cat's body language when it purrs. If your cat seems tense, and is keeping its ears back, it may be purring out of distress."

      "title": "Pay attention to chattering noises.",
      "content": "Pay attention to chattering noises. If a cat clicks its teeth when meowing, making a kind of chattering sound, this is usually an indication of predatory excitement. A cat may chatter when looking at a bird outside or stalking a small bug in your home. A chatter can also indicate distress. If your cat is chattering out the window, for example, it may be frustrated it cannot get at a bird or other prey. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Listen for signs of distress.",
      "content": "Listen for signs of distress. Cats often meow if they're injured or in pain. Long, shrill yowling meows may indicate something wrong. Very loud meows can also be an indication of stress or pain. Excessive yowling, with no identifiable cause, should be evaluated by a vet. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Check if your cat needs something.",
      "content": "Check if your cat needs something. Meowing should never be entirely ignored. You do not want to encourage excessive meowing, but you should always check to make sure your cat does not need anything if you hear it meowing. A cat may, for example, be trapped in a room or be unable to reach its litter boxes. You should make sure your cat is not in need when you hear it meowing. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not punish a cat for meowing.",
      "content": "Do not punish a cat for meowing. Never scold, hit, or punish a cat in any way for meowing. If you want your cat to not meow for breakfast in the morning, ignore the behavior instead of punishing it. [13] X Research source Cats do not respond well to punishment. A cat is unlikely to realize why it is being punished and will only become stressed. If you punish your cat for meowing, it can create a stressful environment that can lead to other behavioral problems."

      "content": "Talk to a vet about sudden or excessive meowing. Your cat may start meowing excessively suddenly. In this case, take it to a vet immediately. Unexplained meowing can often be a sign your cat is injured or sick. You should never ignore unusual meowing in a cat that's normally quiet. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Accept certain cats simply meow more than others. If you're dealing with a new cat, you may be confused by excessive meowing. If the meowing does not sound distressed or frightened, it is probably okay. Certain cats are simply more vocal than others. Your new cat may simply feel the need to communicate through meowing more frequently.
