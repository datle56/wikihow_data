      "title": "A true friend will have your back no matter what.",
      "content": "A true friend will have your back no matter what. Friends are typically loyal to one another, meaning they shouldn’t betray you and you shouldn’t betray them. It’s hard for two people to be friends and not ever let one another down, but betrayals shouldn’t be standard in the relationship. [1] X Research source If this person talks about you behind your back, spreads rumors about you, or disappoints you repeatedly in other ways, they probably aren’t your friend. [2] X Research source A good friend should value you as a person, not view your friendship as a series of transactions, explains psychologist Christy Irvine.

      "title": "A real friend sticks by your side, even when life gets rough.",
      "content": "A real friend sticks by your side, even when life gets rough. When you go through a breakup, lose a loved one, or have a setback, you can count on your friends to be there. If someone is truly your friend, they won’t be around for only the good times—they’ll be by your side to face it all. [5] X Research source Think about a time when you were having a really hard time. Was this person there for you? Did they offer you support when you needed it most? A fake friend typically only sticks around when things are going well. They might even think or say that your problems are a burden to them."

      "title": "A true friend doesn’t get jealous when you share your achievements.",
      "content": "A true friend doesn’t get jealous when you share your achievements. Friendship shouldn’t be full of jealousy or competition. A friend should want to celebrate you no matter what! Rather than tearing you down, they’ll lift you up, even if it means sacrificing something themselves.

      "content": "A true friend is someone you can count on. If you know you can call on this person and they’ll come running, they’re likely a friend. Good friends prioritize their pals, even if it means going out of their way.

Go to source For example, even if a friend is away on vacation, they’ll still make time to text or check in on you if they know you’re sick. This goes both ways. If you call someone your “friend” but never seem to have time for them, you may need to reassess how important the friendship is to you."

      "title": "A real friend is someone you’re comfortable sharing the truth with.",
      "content": "A real friend is someone you’re comfortable sharing the truth with. If a true friend asks, “How’s it going?” you’re not pressured to respond with “Fine” when you’re not. You feel comfortable around them—you can tell them anything, no matter how troubling. They’re someone you can go to for advice or simply a listening ear. [11] X Research source Therapist Ebony Eubanks says that a true friend “accepts that person for who they are, and not who they want them to be.” [12] X Expert Source Ebony Eubanks, MSW, ACSW, CAMS-II Therapist Expert Interview. 16 Jun 2022.

      "content": "When it comes to communication, a friend won’t make it one-sided. You can both equally talk to each other in a true friendship. You can share details about your life knowing they’ll listen wholeheartedly, and vice versa. [15] X Research source Good listening skills in a friend are important because you need to feel heard and understood by the people you care about. Pay attention in your next conversation. Does your friend take the time to hear your message before responding?"
