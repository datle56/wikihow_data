      "content": "It’s important to keep your phone juiced up so you can call for help. Depending on the make and model of your car, a USB cord or cigarette lighter-style charger might do the trick. If you don’t want to rely on your car’s fuel line, pack a portable charger instead. [2] X Research source Portable chargers are very affordable, with some costing less than $20. The price point really depends on the amount of juice you’d like your battery pack to store, though."

      "content": "A functioning flashlight is essential if you’re stranded off-road at night.

      "content": "Water will be essential if you get stranded. Stick a small package or case of plastic water bottles in the back of your vehicle so the bottles won’t crack or break if the temperature drops.

Make sure your jack and tire iron are stored nearby too, so you can change the tire if you need to. [4] X Research source A tire gauge is also handy so you can check your tire pressure. Stop by your local auto shop or car repair place if you need to replace or update your spare tire tools."

      "content": "Top off your car quickly if you’re stranded on the side of the road without fuel. Pick up a gas can from your local gas station and fill it up. Seal the container so no gas can leak out, and keep it in the back of your car in case you run out of fuel. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that gasoline lasts about 6 months when stored in a securely-sealed gas can, so be sure to dispose of the gas if you haven’t used it by then. [8] X Research source You can also pack an empty gas can and siphon if you’d rather not keep a full can of gas in your car."

      "title": "Road flares can be valuable if your car breaks down at night.",
      "content": "Road flares can be valuable if your car breaks down at night. If you get stranded on the side of the road, light the flares and set them about 10 to 20 yd (9.1 to 18.3 m) behind the boot of your car. This way, passing a helpful driver or roadside assistance vehicle won’t park too close to your vehicle. [13] X Research source Reflective triangles can also help your vehicle stand out to passing drivers."

      "content": "Extra layers are invaluable when you’re stuck in freezing cold weather. Slip on a hat, coat, scarf, and mittens if you’re stranded in a car for a long period of time, especially if the temperature starts to drop. You can even double up on layers, too–it’s better to be too warm rather than too cold! [14] X Research source A thick blanket is another great way to stay nice and toasty without draining your car’s fuel in the process. [15] X Research source Consider packing multiple quilts and blankets if you live in an especially cold area."

      "content": "You may need to clear ice, snow, or slush away from your vehicle if you live in a cold area. Ice scrapers typically have a scraping tool on 1 end and a snow brush on the other. Remove any tough patches of ice with the scraper part of your tool, and clear away mounds of snow with the brush. If you get stuck in a snowbank or other snowy terrain, use a foldable metal shovel to clear your way out. [16] X Research source It’s actually against the law in some places to drive with snow and slush on your car, so it’s really important to have this tool on hand. You can get an ice scraper and brush at a big-box retail or home improvement store for less than $20. You can get a foldable shovel online for around $25."

      "content": "Sand or cat litter can provide traction during winter weather. If you find yourself stuck on a really snowy or icy road, scatter a handful of sand or non-clay, non-clumping cat litter in front of your tires. The gritty texture of the litter or sand can help your vehicle get some traction on the ground, and may help you get back on the road more quickly. [17] X Research source Clay cat litter doesn’t have the right texture to provide tire traction."

[18] X Research source Hand-cranked radios are a great alternative, and don’t require any electricity or batteries to operate."
