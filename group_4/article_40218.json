Even if they're written written in Latin letters (as opposed to Arabic letters), you can't always guess the correct pronunciation. That's particularly true if the letters have accent marks. [11] X Research source For instance, \"ḥ\" is pronounced as a hard \"h\" sound, while \"ḫ\" (also kh or x) is pronounced like the German \"ch,\" such as \"Bach.\" \"T\" is a typical \"t\" sound, but \"ṯ\" is a \"th\" sound. Similarly, \"S\" makes a typical sound, but \"š\" makes an \"sh\" sound, while \"ṣ\" makes the \"s\" sound in \"sold.\" \"J\" makes a sound like the \"g\" in \"game,\" while \"ġ\" or \"gh\" makes an \"r\" sound, such as \"Paris.\" These are the main examples of the differences; most of the other Latin letters are pronounced as you would in English."

[12] X Research source Egyptian Arabic is a regional dialect (or actually, several dialects), and there isn't a standardized spelling for it. That's why it usually uses MSA. However, you will see many different spellings when it is written down."
