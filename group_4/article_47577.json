      "title": "Tuck the brim under the beret.",
      "content": "Tuck the brim under the beret. Every beret has a brim that fits snug on your head and holds the beret in place. Tuck the brim up and under the excess fabric of the beret. Then puff out the fabric of the beret so it hides the edge of the beret. Tilt the beret to 1 side, with the front of the beret pulled down to your eyebrow. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Create volume with your beret.",
      "content": "Create volume with your beret. Keep the brim tight against your head, and tilt the beret slightly to one side. Then pull gently on the top of the beret so the fabric pulls away from your head. This should create space between the top of your head and the top of your beret, rather than it sitting flat against your head. [2] X Research source You can also smooth down the part of the beret that sits over your ear for a variation of this look."

    {
      "title": "Pin the beret to the back of your head.",
      "content": "Pin the beret to the back of your head. Place the beret at the crown of your head and secure it with bobby pins around the brim. How many bobby pins you need will depend on how thick your hair is, but placing 1 every 1 in (2.5 cm) is a good place to start. Pull the fabric at the front of the beret very gently so that the beret shows just above the top of your hair. [3] X Research source Create more height in your beret by rolling up a silk scarf and stuffing it in the front of the beret. Then pin the beret on."

      "title": "Tilt the beret to one side.",
      "content": "Tilt the beret to one side. The trim of the beret should make about a 45-degree angle across your forehead. If you part your hair on the side of your head, tilt your beret in the opposite direction for contrast. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Straighten your hair if it will show under your beret.",
      "content": "Straighten your hair if it will show under your beret. The classic beret look calls for straight hair hanging under your beret.

      "title": "Use your curls to balance your beret.",
      "content": "Use your curls to balance your beret. Having curly hair doesn't mean you can't wear a beret. Simply use your fingers to fluff out the curls on the side of your head opposite to the beret’s tilt. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid high hairstyles.",
      "content": "Avoid high hairstyles. High ponytails, buns, or braids can warp the shape of your beret. If you're planning on wearing one, avoid those hairstyles. Instead, opt for low ponytails and braids, or just wear your hair loose!"

      "content": "Pick a lined beret to wear in cold weather. Lined berets will have a thin layer of material inside of the hat. They'll keep your head warmer than an unlined beret, which makes them a perfect choice for cold weather."
