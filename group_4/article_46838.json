      "content": "Navigate to the main American Express website. Type www.americanexpress.com into the navigation bar to bring up the company's homepage. It's important to start at the company's main site rather than typing \"American Express gift card balance\" into your search engine because there are many authentic-looking scam sites on the web phishing for account numbers. Many of these scam sites look like they're affiliated with American Express, but if you check the navigation bar, the website address will start with a prefix like \"www279\" or some other variation. This should be an immediate red flag. You can also go directly to www.balance.amexgiftcard.com, which is the correct page run by American Express. Keep in mind that if you make any mistakes when typing in the address, you could be taken to a scam site."

Many vendors have policies that purchases can only be returned to the card originally used for the purchase, so this could cause problems for you if you have to make a return.

[10] X Research source Only use regular debit or credit cards for deposits and reservations. This includes hotel reservations, car rentals, or another kind of transaction in which you must provide a lump sum of money up front to be refunded later."

[11] X Research source Online merchants typically aren't set up to do split payment transactions, which is why the card will be declined.
