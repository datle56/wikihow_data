      "title": "Remember which players have asked for which cards.",
      "content": "Remember which players have asked for which cards. One of the most important means of winning Go Fish is remembering cards players have been asking for in each turn. When a player asks for a card, it means they have that card in their deck. If you need the card in question, ask the player who has it in your next turn. [1] X Research source For example, say you have two 3's. If you gain two more, you'll get a point in the game. You notice your friend Jane asked Tim if he had any 3's in her last turn. This means Jane has a 3 in her deck. Remember this. When your turn comes around, ask Jane if she has any 3's."

      "title": "Keep track of which cards certain players have gained.",
      "content": "Keep track of which cards certain players have gained. In addition to keeping track of which cards players have asked for, know what cards they have gained. If a player has at least 2 cards of the same kind in their deck, snagging these cards could help you a lot when it comes to scoring a point. [2] X Research source For example, say Jane asked Tim for a 4 in the last round. Tim had a 4 in his deck, so he gave the card to Jane. You know Jane has at least two 4's now. If you have 4's in your deck, ask Jane if she has any 4's in the next round. If you get all her 4's, you're well on your way to a point. In fact, if you have at least two 4's in a deck, you'll get a point as soon as you ask Jane for her cards."

      "title": "Do not pass your turns.",
      "content": "Do not pass your turns. Never pass a turn in Go Fish. Even if you don't think any players are likely to have the cards you need, remember you can draw a card from the deck in the center. There's a slim chance you'll get the card you need if you draw, so never pass your turn. Keep in mind if you get the card you were asking for, you get to continue your turn. It's worth the risk to ask a player cold for a card."

      "title": "Try using a mnemonic device to help you keep track of everyone's cards.",
      "content": "Try using a mnemonic device to help you keep track of everyone's cards. As memory is vital to Go Fish, make use of mnemonic devices to win. This is a verbal or visual technique that allows you to better remember facts. You can use acronyms to help you remember. For example, say you know Jane has two 3's in her deck. Make up a sentence in your head like, \"Just Hoping for Two Threes.\" The J, H, and two strong T's can help you remember the sentence, \"Jane has two threes.\" You can also use a linking system. Think of an image in your head that helps you link a person with a type of card. For example, say you know Phillip's favorite animal is a horse and his favorite color is green. You learn he has at least one 2 in his deck. Imagine two green horses standing side-by-side."

      "title": "Organize your deck.",
      "content": "Organize your deck. A good way to help yourself win at Go Fish is to work at staying organized. In Go Fish, each player starts with five cards. When you get your first five cards, see if you have any cards with the same number. Shift your cards so the same numbered cards are together. This will remind you of which cards you need to ask for as the game continues. [3] X Research source If you run out of cards during the game, you'll draw five more cards from the pile. Make sure to organize these cards as well, grouping together any cards of the same number."

    {
      "title": "Start by asking for the cards you need the most.",
      "content": "Start by asking for the cards you need the most. Prioritize which cards you ask for. If you have a deck of two 6's, a 3, and a 4, ask for 6's on your first turn. You'll want to work on getting 4 of a kind with 6's first, as you're already halfway there."

    {
      "title": "Adopt a \"poker face.\"",
      "content": "Adopt a \"poker face.\" You do not want to give away too much when playing Go Fish, as this can alert other players as to which cards you have. For example, if you have two 6's and gain one, you may smile as you're close to getting a point. Try to maintain a poker face, which is a neutral expression people use to play cards. This will keep other players from guessing your likely deck. To start, try to eliminate any nervous ticks. Avoid things like nervous laughter, twitching your leg, or fidgeting. It may help to strengthen your grip on your cards, as this will channel nervous energy elsewhere. Make eye contact with other players. Eye contact shows power by letting someone know you're not intimidated. When a player asks for a card, look them straight in the eye while they're asking you. If you feel tempted to react to something, find a way to distract yourself. You could, for example, bite the inside of your cheek or get up to get a drink from the kitchen. Practice your poker face in front of a mirror. It may take awhile to master."

      "content": "Remember to lay down your cards when you get four of a kind. Remember, you win a point by getting four cards of the same kind. Keep track of your cards throughout the game. As soon as you get four of a kind, lay your cards down on the table so you'll have a point to count at the end of the game."

      "content": "Play until everyone runs out of cards. You will keep playing Go Fish until all the players have run out of cards. You should have run through the deck in the center, and everyone has scored all possible points. Once this has happened, you can add up your scores. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Count up your points by seeing who has the most complete \"books.\"",
      "content": "Count up your points by seeing who has the most complete \"books.\" \"Books\" refer to grouping of four cards of the same kind. In Go Fish, suit does not matter. Only the number or symbol on the card is important. For example, a grouping of four 5's, even though they're of different suits, is a book. Count up how many books you have at the end of the game. The player with the most books wins the game. Suits do not matter because there are only four suits, and only one card of each value per suit. Groups of four cards of the same value will be of different suits."

      "title": "Try harder next time if you lose.",
      "content": "Try harder next time if you lose. You may not win the game, even when employing proper strategy. A lot of Go Fish comes down to simple chance. If you don't get a good hand, you may lose despite your best efforts. Try not to get upset if you lose a round of Go Fish. It's just a game, and the point is to have fun. Do not get so caught up in the competition you don't enjoy yourself. You can always use the same strategies in the next game and see if it works out better."
