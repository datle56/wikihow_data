    {
      "title": "Choose a format.",
      "content": "Choose a format. Typing is recommended for most letters of permission, such as a letter of consent to travel or a letter of medical authorization. Write the letter by hand only in informal situations, or for short notes that only need to be shown once."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start with a subject line.",
      "content": "Start with a subject line. A clear, short title lets the reader know the letter topic immediately. For example, write \"Medical Treatment Authorization\" or \"Letter of Consent for Traveling Minor.\" Type this in bold font. In American English, the subject goes at the top of the letter. In British English, the subject goes after the salutation."

      "title": "Address the letter.",
      "content": "Address the letter. If the letter will be kept with the child and shown whenever necessary, open with \"To Whom It May Concern:\" or skip the salutation entirely. If you are sending the letter to a specific person, address them by their professional title and full name."

In an emergency, (adult) should attempt to contact me. (He/she) may seek and consent to emergency transport, as well as treatment deemed advisable by and supervised by a licensed medical professional.\" Example for consent to travel letter: \"I authorize (adult's name) to take (child's name) to the Grand View Hotel in Oakville, South Dakota from January 12th through January 18th, and supervise (him/her) on excursions in the surrounding area.\""

[5] X Research source Otherwise, ask a neighbor, coworker, or other adult with no relation or close connection to anyone involved. Print and sign your name with the witness watching, then have the witness print and sign her name. Clearly label the two signature lines \"parent\" (or other role) and \"witness.\" For a simple letter authorizing field trip attendance or absence from school, you do not need a witness. Just close the letter with \"Sincerely\" or \"Regards,\" followed by your printed name and signature."

If you are the author or artist and sole copyright holder, this is your decision. Many authors and artists waive the fee for an educational or nonprofit institution they support, or for minor uses. To do this, state \"I waive my fee for this request.\" If you'd like to support a small for-profit group, you could waive the fee but request a certain payment if the venture is successful. (For instance, if they sell a certain number of copies.) [8] X Research source You can typically charge US$25–100 for allowing the reproduction of a short quote (a few lines). The price of larger text excerpts, images, songs, or video varies depending on how many people will see your work. US$100–200 is a very rough estimate for a book or newspaper, but your agent or other people in your field can give you more precise information."
