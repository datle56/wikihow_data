      "content": "Part a section of your hair using a comb. Start at your temple, or wherever along your hairline you would like, and slide the comb straight back along your scalp, toward the crown of your head. A rattail comb works well for this because of its pointed tip. If you do not have a comb, you can use your index finger; however, the part will likely not be straight."

Here are a couple of tips for doing this: If you parted the section of hair on the left side of your head, pinch the hair with your left hand. This frees up your right hand to reach across to slide in the bobby pin. Likewise, if you parted the section of hair on the right side of your head, pinch the hair with your right hand. This way, your arms are not getting crossed and tangled in front of your head."

      "content": "Slide the bobby into your hair so that the flat arm covers the hair. Insert it at such an angle that the hair will be held in place: Slide the bobby pin straight up, toward the top of your head, or at a slight angle toward the back of your head. Do not insert it completely horizontal or downward, because your hair will fall out of the pin. This is a quick and simple method for pinning back your hair. However, it is likely that it will not hold for a long period of time, and you will probably have to reinsert it. You may need to use multiple bobby pins to keep your hair secure for an extended period of time."

Use your fingers or a comb to help you part and lift the segment of hair so that it separates from the rest of your hair.

      "content": "Use your index finger to twist the parted segment of hair a few times. You can make the twist tight or loose; it is up to you based on how you want the twist to look. You will need to twist the part at least five times to get a tight twist, but you will only need to twist it a couple of times to get a looser twist."

      "content": "Lay the twist against the side of your head. Gently place it at the height where you want it to sit, making sure again to avoid any bumps. It is best to lay the twist at such an angle (or height) so that the hair that stems from your hairline doesn't bump, or pouf, up when you lay it. If this happens, you will want to gently slide the twist down until the hair lays flat. Hold the twist in place with the hand that is on the same side of your body as the twist. If your twist is on the left side of your head, then hold the twist in place with your left hand. Likewise, if the twist is on the right side of your head, then hold the twist in place with your right hand."
