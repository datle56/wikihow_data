Even if you’re not in direct contact with her, seeing her posts on social media can also be a potential trigger that will cause you to think about her.

Your relationship may have ended, but it’s completely possible that you’re still hoping that she might change so that you two can continue being together. Unfortunately, toxic people have a tendency to lie to others to get what they want. Even though she might have told you that she’s going to change, it’s possible that she was just saying that to keep you by her side. What you’re feeling now may simply just be some of that hope leftover from her promises. [2] X Research source"

Even if your ex had toxic personality traits, you likely still spent a lot of time together and were a significant part of each other’s lives. Thinking about her might be your subconscious way of dealing with these new feelings of loneliness and any fears you might have about being on your own. [3] X Research source"

You might have specific activities you do together, places you like to go together, and friends you both hang out with. After breaking up, that routine suddenly goes away, and you might feel at a loss about what to do. A reason you might be missing your ex is that you may be missing this routine while you adjust to a new normal.

      "content": "She was the center of your world. Toxic people can be very selfish, so it’s possible that your ex didn’t shy away from making everything about her in your relationship. You might have found yourself going along with what she wanted most times and even becoming dependent on her when making certain decisions. Because she was such a big part of your life, it makes sense that you might miss her after splitting up. Even if you didn’t have the healthiest of relationships, it’s okay to admit that she was an important part of your life. [6] X Research source It’s also possible that you’re feeling unsure about how to define yourself without her. Her selfishness might’ve caused you to simply adapt to her way of living, and now you’re not quite sure what your personal interests are. You may miss that sense of purpose she gave you."

Unfortunately, a toxic person isn’t above saying belittling or humiliating things to others in order to assert dominance and make themselves feel good. During your relationship, it’s possible that your ex might have said things to make you feel like she was the only person who’d ever love you or want to be with you, and those doubts may be what’s causing you to miss her. [7] X Research source These feelings of self-doubt might also prevent you from going out and meeting new people. A good way to move on from your ex is to branch out and talk to new people, but the negativity she left behind might be stopping you at the moment."
