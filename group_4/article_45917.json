      "content": "Borax is a mineral powder that’s used as a natural cleaner. Borax , also known as sodium tetraborate, is found in nature as a mineral that turns into a powder when it dries out. Since it dissolves easily in water and acts as a detergent, there are many ways to use borax around your home as a cleaner. [1] X Research source When you add borax to your laundry, it works by raising the pH to soften your water and make detergent more effective. It also helps deodorize your clothes and remove stains in the fabric. [2] X Research source Borax is used for cleaning carpets, making laundry detergents, cleaning mold, and mildew. Borax can also be used to clean fine china, remove odors from your mattress, and scrub your shower tiles, and removes rust. While borax is similar to baking soda, borax has a slightly higher pH that helps your detergent work better. Borax powder is safe to use, but it could cause irritation if it gets in your eyes or lungs when it’s undiluted. Avoid applying borax to your skin, and keep it away from children and pets.
