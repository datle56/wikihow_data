Hold the leader line and the tag end of the tippet together by pinching them between your thumb and forefinger on your non-dominant hand where they meet. [1] X Research source Tag end refers to the end of the line that you are using to tie the knot."

Use your dominant hand to create an overhand knot with the tag end of the leader, and pass the leader and tippet tag ends through the loop once. Do not tighten the knot all the way. It should be an open loop. At this point the loop will look like a loose pretzel."

      "content": "Pass the leader and the tippet through the loop another time. Hold the loop in your non-dominant hand. Twist the leader and tippet tag ends around the loop and pass them through again. Do not fully tighten the knot yet.

Pull the leader line and tippet tag end with your left hand, and the tippet line and leader tag end with your right hand simultaneously until the knot is fully closed. Lip balm also makes a good moistener for the line if you don’t want to use saliva. Pull each side slowly to tighten the knot evenly. [3] X Research source"

Try to get them as short and close to the knot as possible so that there are no loose ends. Once you learn this knot it is very strong and fast to tie! [4] X Research source"

Keep your dominant hand free to tie the lines together. [5] X Research source Tag end means the end of the line where you are tying the knot. The blood knot can be used to tie any two lines of the same diameter together."

Then pull the tag end back and through the middle where the two lines meet. [6] X Research source You can wrap one line around the other up to 7 times for a stronger variation of this knot."

[10] X Research source The blood knot is not quite as strong as the double surgeon’s knot, but it creates a straighter connection between the two lines, which can help when casting your line."
