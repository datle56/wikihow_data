      "title": "This competitive sport involves snorkeling in a peat bog, not the ocean.",
      "content": "This competitive sport involves snorkeling in a peat bog, not the ocean. For the competition, players use snorkels and flippers and must use their flippers to get them down a 60-yard (55 m) long trench filled with water (and back). They can’t use regular swimming techniques, just the flippers. Talk about an unconventional race! [1] X Research source Originated in: Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales (United Kingdom) The current men’s world record for speed was set by Neil Rutter in 2018, with a time of 1 minute, 18.81 sections. The woman’s world record was set by Kirsty Johnson in 2014, with a time of 1 minute, 22.56 seconds."

      "title": "Bo-taoshi is like a chaotic Japanese version of Capture the Flag.",
      "content": "Bo-taoshi is like a chaotic Japanese version of Capture the Flag . Its Japanese translation means “bring the pole down.” Although the rules differ by school and institution, typically, it consists of two teams of 150 players (75 attackers and 75 defenders). The defenders guard a vertical wooden pole, with one defender even standing on top of the pole. Attackers attempt to bring the pole at least 35 degrees down from its vertical position—and the first team to do it wins! [2] X Research source Originated in: Japan Attackers can try bringing down the bo-taoshi pole in many different ways; some even let teammates springboard off their backs to get closer to the pole! Players can use wrestling, kicking, and punching to defend and attack, so injuries are extremely common!"

      "content": "Bossaball is a mashup of volleyball, soccer, gymnastics, and capoeira. It’s played on an inflatable court with small trampolines on either side of the net. The goal is for each team to get the ball over the net with five touches or less, and the court is divided into scoring zones—with teams getting the most points when they score in the other team’s trampoline! [3] X Research source Originated in: Brazil (conceptualized by Belgian Filip Eyckmans) Bossaball can actually played in different styles: volleyball-style (using hands alone to control the ball) or football-style (where players can use other body parts to control the ball as well). Scoring when using the football style of bossaball also awards more points, encouraging players to try more acrobatic moves and kicks. Music is also an essential part of bossaball, used to set each game's fun, upbeat atmosphere."

      "content": "The goal of Canal Vaulting is right in its name. Participants must try to jump as far as they can from one side of a muddy canal to the other, ideally without getting any water or mud on themselves. This is done by jumping onto a pole set up in the canal; the pole has a flat bottom, and it can swing when players put their weight on it, allowing them to use the pole to swing toward the far side of the canal. [4] X Research source Originated in: The Netherlands Players must typically get a running start before jumping onto the pole and climbing it as high as possible (while using their momentum to swing forward) before jumping down."

      "content": "Canne de combat—or “combat canes”—is a French sport similar to fencing. But participants use wooden canes instead of fencing swords! It’s a martial art originally developed as a type of self-defense using everyday tools (like canes), with the goal being to strike, block, or disarm an opponent. Even though it uses canes, watching a canne de combat match can be like watching an old-fashioned duel! [5] X Research source Originated in: France, in the 19th century"

      "title": "Castells is the practice of “building” incredible human towers.",
      "content": "Castells is the practice of “building” incredible human towers. It’s more of an art form than a sport, wherein groups of Castellers compete to see who can create the most complex tower. This requires coordination, strength—and, of course, trust. Castellers must form a base and build the tower with participants standing on one another’s shoulders. The person on top, the “anxaneta,” signals with a hand to show the tower is finished. Originated in: Catalonia, late 18th century Castells are unique to Catalonian culture and associated with pride in the Catalonian community."

      "content": "This silly sport is practiced at the Cooper’s Hill cheese rolling race. The hill is close to Gloucester, England—and the sport is a 200-year-old tradition wherein participants race down a steep hill and chase a round of Double Gloucester cheese. The rules are simple: whoever gets down the hill first wins the cheese! This impressive cheese can weigh up to 9 pounds—and roll at around 70 miles per hour. [6] X Research source Originated in: Gloucester, England Because of how steep the hill is, participants don’t always stay on their feet! Many tumble, leap, and roll down the hill instead. Rugby players even wait at the bottom of the hill to stop their momentum."

      "content": "The name says it all: Chess Boxing is a mashup of chess and boxing. Games consist of 5 rounds of boxing and 6 rounds of chess , with players alternating between them round by round (meaning there’s a round of chess, then boxing, and so on) and each round lasting for 3 minutes. [7] X Research source Originated in: Europe (it was invented by French comic book artist Enki Bilal and adapted by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh; the first chess boxing event took place in Berlin, Germany)."

      "content": "Cycle-ball is basically soccer (or “football”) played on bicycles. Players move the ball—and, of course, try to score in the opposing team’s goal—using their bikes rather than their feet. There are a couple of other major differences, including team size; cycle-ball (or “radball”) is played with teams of 2 players, and the bikes they use are altered to have fixed gears (and no brakes). [8] X Research source Originated in: America (created by German-American cyclist Nicholas Edward Kaufmann; the sport later took root in Europe, especially Germany)"

      "content": "The “sport” of death diving is mainly done for entertainment. It’s definitely extreme, though! Competitors dive into water from boards about 10 m (32 ft) high—and their goal is to hold a pose for as long as they can before hitting the water in a tucked position. This means competitors try all kinds of creative poses, flips, and diving tricks in their quest to win a contest. Originated in: Norway (the sport is called “Dødsing” in Norway) While there’s no definitive “rarest sport in the world,” sports like this one—as well as niche sports like Castells, cheese-rolling, and underwater hockey—are definitely among the rarest sports out there!"

      "content": "The unusual sport of ear-pulling is based on pain endurance. Competitors sit across from one another, legs connected, with a string looped around both their ears. Each competitor then pulls the string and keeps at it until one bows out because of the pain. Because of the nature of the sport, ear damage and bleeding are both common. [9] X Research source Originated: Among the Inuit people (based on survival and hunting skills to toughen up hunters’ ears)"

      "content": "Extreme ironing is an unconventional “danger sport.” Don’t believe ironing clothes could be an extreme sport? Think again! Participants must take ironing boards to remote places and iron clothing there, then snap a picture for proof. People have gone all sorts of crazy places in the name of extreme ironing, from mountainsides to underwater and even while parachuting, kayaking, or standing atop a large bronze statue.

      "content": "As the name suggests, this sport involves kayaking in giant pumpkins. Sure, you could kayak normally…but why do that when you can kayak inside a giant, hollowed-out pumpkin? That’s how they do it on Lake Pisiquid, Nova Scotia, during the annual Windsor Pumpkin Regatta. Participants race one another along a half-mile course, typically decorating their pumpkins with paint or flags beforehand. Sounds pretty fun, right?

The mud-put belly flop is one of the most popular events—and, as the name suggests, it’s staged in an enormous mud pit. Competitors belly flop into the mud, and judges decide which one made the biggest splash. It’s that silly—and simple! Originated in: Georgia, USA"

It’s played in teams of 7 with a ball that players must shoot through a hoop (like basketball ), but there’s no dribbling. Furthermore, players can wrestle one another for the ball, and takedowns are perfectly legal—which means a game of regball can get pretty brutal.

Strange as it may sound, it can be a fun sport for people who prefer not to run around all the time! Today, there’s even a World Toe Wrestling Championship—and the winner receives, of course, a gold trophy shaped like a toe. [16] X Research source Originated in: Staffordshire, England"

      "content": "The wizarding sport in Harry Potter has been adapted for muggles. Quidditch isn’t all that unheard of—but the premise of a sport played on flying broomsticks being adapted for the “muggle” world is still an unusual one! Obviously, players can’t fly to play Quidditch ; instead, they keep brooms between their legs while playing the game to simulate what happens in the books. [17] X Research source Originated in: The Harry Potter books (although the real-world sport was created at Middlebury College, Vermont, USA) In the books, players try to gain points by throwing a ball called the Quaffle into the other team’s hoops, while other balls (Bludgers) knock players off-course, and seekers look for the Snitch. In place of a magical flying Snitch, every game has a Snitch-runner (an impartial player dressed in yellow with a tennis ball inside a sock hanging from their shorts) Seekers enter the game later and try to catch the Snitch-runner, while the other players (Chasers and Beaters) play from the start."

      "content": "Underwater hockey involves a weighted puck at the bottom of a pool. How can someone play hockey underwater, you ask? Well, some people absolutely do it! The game is played in a pool; players use smaller one-handed sticks (instead of traditional hockey sticks) to push the weighted puck around. They also swim with fins and wear masks to see underwater. [18] X Research source Originated in: Portsmouth, England (also called “Octopush”) Interestingly, players hold their breath (and pop up for air when needed) instead of using oxygen tanks. That means teammates must stay in sync with one another (so they can adapt when someone goes up for air)."

      "content": "There are a lot of different games adapted for unicycles. Go figure! Unicycle polo is much like the traditional polo, using the same long-handled mallets and wooden balls—except players ride unicycles instead of horses. And, on unicycles, players try to score in the opposition’s goals. Other unicycle game adaptations include: Unicycle hockey. It’s just like hokey, except every player is riding on a unicycle (and a tennis ball replaces a puck since the game isn’t played on ice). Unicycle basketball. Just like basketball, players must dribble the ball and try to shoot it into the opposing team’s net on a regulation basketball court. The only difference is that they’re all riding unicycles!"

      "content": "It’s called “Wife Carrying,” but participants don’t need to be husband and wife. This competition involves one participant (the “husband”) carrying another (the “wife”) on their back, all while navigating a course with two dry obstacles and one water-based obstacle. The team to finish the course fastest wins the competition, though there are also other prizes (like “best costume” for the couple). [19] X Research source Originated in: Finland You don’t even need to be a male and female team to compete, as there are no official rules about gender—the “wife carrying” name is mainly based on history and tradition."

If you’ve ever seen someone rolling around in a giant plastic ball (like a human-sized hamster ball), they’re actually zorbing! While it’s usually done on gentle hills, the orbs can also be used on water or any flat surface. Harnessed orbs can fit 1 to 2 people, while non-harnessed zorbing orbs can fit up to 3 people.
