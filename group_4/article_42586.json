      "content": "Try an at-home body wrap. In order to do this wrap you’ll need lotion, clear plastic wrap and an elastic reusable bandage (like the kind you’d use on a sprained wrist). Once you’ve obtained the necessary items, perform the following instructions right before you go to bed: [1] X Research source Apply the lotion to your stomach and waist area in a thick layer. Don’t massage the lotion too much into your skin. Wrap the clear plastic wrap around your waist, on top of where you put the lotion. You may need to wrap the plastic two to three times around your waist. The plastic wrap should not be loose, but should be tight enough that it doesn’t fall off. Wrap the elastic bandage around your waist on top of the plastic wrap. Secure the bandage to your body by tucking the end into the portion already wrapped around. Sleep with the wrap on all night and remove it in the morning. You’ll likely notice a small difference in your waist size, but note it’s only temporary."

Corsets come in many different types, depending on what you’re trying to accomplish. ‘Real’ corsets designed to trim your waistline have steel boning and multiple layers of non-stretchy fabrics. You can buy a ready-made corset at a lingerie store, or you can have one custom made for you. Corsets can help your waist look 2 – 4” smaller just by wearing them. Corsets, because they’re tight, can also help you eat less as you’ll feel full faster. Alternatively, you can also try wearing shapewear, which can help make you look thinner as well, but uses a different material than corsets. Plus, you can buy shapewear that’s also underwear, camisoles, etc. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear clothing that makes you look thinner. The key to dressing so you look thinner is to avoid items like capris, pleated pants, long baggy shorts or shapeless skirts that only go down to your calf. Ensure the clothes you wear fit you properly, and choose items like the following: [3] X Research source Dark-colored jeans or pants that go down to your ankle or 1-2” below your ankle; long shirts, blazers, or non-baggy sweaters; knee-length pencil skirts; or fitted A-line skirts. Maxi skirts. These are another great option to make you look thinner because they give you a longer vertical line and make your legs look longer. Solid colors work best. Avoid skirts with pleats, big pockets, layers and thick elastic waistbands. Pair a maxi skirt with a fitted top and heels. Jeans that have a higher-rise or waist. Lower-rise jeans, while stylish, unfortunately can create the muffin top look around your waist, which does not look at all flattering. As with many other clothing pieces, higher-rise jeans make your legs look longer, which in turn makes you look thinner. Tuck your shirt into your jeans as well. Skinny belts to cinch shirts, dresses and even coats. This helps to define your natural waistline and shows off your curves. Try wearing heels. To help make your legs look slimmer and elongate your whole body, wear heels that are at least 2.5” or taller. It also helps to wear heels with a somewhat pointed toe, as opposed to a square toe. [4] X Research source Just don't wear them all the time — wearing high heels repeatedly for prolonged periods can cause serious harm to your body and your posture."

There are several colors and patterns you can choose for your clothing that will help make you look thinner, especially in the waist area. [5] X Research source Black is a classic color that can go with just about everything. But in addition to being a good color choice for coordination purposes, it’s also a great color choice for making yourself look thinner. Black (and dark blue, green and red) can create an illusion of a long vertical line which thins the body. Vertical stripes create a similar illusion that the color black does, and can be helpful when you’re trying to make your middle look smaller. If you wear vertical stripes on pants or skirts, it helps make your legs look longer and thinner, which thins out your middle and upper body too."
