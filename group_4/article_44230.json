[2] X Expert Source Jessica Powell Certified Professional Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 5 October 2021. A clicker is a small noisemaker that you can buy in a pet supply store. Use a clicker to mark your dog’s good behavior and help her to learn what you want her to do. For example, if your dog responds to your “Sit” command by sitting, then click the clicker right as her bottom hits the floor. This will help her to associate sitting with doing something good."

Keep a bag of your mini pin’s favorite treats on hand and reward her with one for following your commands. [4] X Expert Source Jessica Powell Certified Professional Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 5 October 2021. Never hold treats in your hand while you are training. This will distract your dog and she will not be able to give you her full attention. Try to vary how often you give your mini pin a treat. Giving a treat after every command can leave your mini pin expecting to be rewarded. Give frequent treats at first and then start to space them out more, such as every other command or every third or fourth command."

One important part of potty training is taking your mini pin outside to go potty often. You may need to take your mini pin out once every two hours until she is house trained. Make sure that you take her to the same spot every time. Choose a patch of grass in the yard where you want your mini pin to go potty and lead her to the same spot every time.

If you will be at work or somewhere else for a long stretch of time, then it is important to find someone who can take your mini pin outside to go potty. Try asking a friend or neighbor to stop by once or twice to let out your mini pin or walk her around the block. If you cannot find someone to let your mini pin during the day, then consider hiring a dog walker or taking your mini pin to doggy daycare while you are away. Your dog cannot hold her urine or feces all day and it is cruel to expect your dog to do so. If you leave for a long stretch of time and your dog cannot go out, then she will likely have an accident."
