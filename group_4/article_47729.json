      "title": "Luvdisc is a finless, heart-shaped fish.",
      "content": "Luvdisc is a finless, heart-shaped fish. How does it swim around? Why is it so flat? These are questions we may not want the answer to…but they’re questions nevertheless. In Pokémon, Luvdisc is a symbol of love that supposedly blesses couples who see it, which is a sweet idea, but the Pokémon itself (and its name) are still pretty strange, all things considered.

      "title": "Cubone’s sad backstory explains its weird look.",
      "content": "Cubone’s sad backstory explains its weird look. In Pokémon lore, Team Rocket (Jessie, James, and Meowth) killed Cubone’s mother. The skull that Cubone wears is its mother’s…which is strange, even if it’s also pretty tragic. Without the skull helmet, this dinosaur-like Pokémon probably wouldn’t seem all that weird! Type: Ground Pokedex #: 0104 Generation: 1"

    {
      "title": "Barbaracle are comprised of multiple Binacle Pokémon.",
      "content": "Barbaracle are comprised of multiple Binacle Pokémon. That means Binacle doesn’t just evolve—it merges with other Binacles to become Barbaracle, a single body with (apparently) multiple creatures within. That’s odd enough, and when you factor in Barbaracle’s head (which looks like a clawed fist with a face in it), this Pokémon’s weirdness is unquestionable. Type: Rock/Water Pokedex #: 0689 Generation: 6"

      "title": "Calyrex is a Legendary Pokémon with a very big head.",
      "content": "Calyrex is a Legendary Pokémon with a very big head. This goat-inspired Pokémon actually looks quite regal for the most part…except for the giant, green, bulbous mass atop its head. It made its Pokémon debut as part of the Sword & Shield DLC, proving that every generation of Pokémon, from the old to the new, has its eccentricities. Type: Psychic/Grass Pokedex #: 0898 Generation: 8"

      "title": "Exeggcute looks like an assortment of cracked eggs.",
      "content": "Exeggcute looks like an assortment of cracked eggs. It’s been around since the early days of Pokémon and qualifies as “weird” because every egg in the bunch has its own face (and expression). How a bunch of eggs manages to fight in Pokémon battles is a mystery, and Exeggcute’s transformation into Exeggutor (a multi-headed palm tree creature) only makes it weirder.

      "title": "Magikarp is a floppy, near-useless fish-like Pokémon.",
      "content": "Magikarp is a floppy, near-useless fish-like Pokémon. At least its evolved form, Gyarados, is a more epic-looking water dragon Pokémon. Magikarp looks like a bug-eyed goldfish (which is a little disturbing), and to top things off, its only move is “Splash,” which doesn’t do much of anything in battle (as you can imagine). [3] X Research source Type: Water Pokedex #: 0129 Generation: 1"

      "content": "Kricketune is a mustachioed insectoid Pokémon. As the name would suggest, Kricketune appears to resemble a cricket—which isn’t necessarily strange by itself. However, Kricketune’s moves in battle make it weird; it moves its long bug arms like an orchestral conductor! It doesn’t help that Kricketune also sports a long, black mustache on its face. Type: Bug Pokedex #: 0402 Generation: 4"

      "content": "Chandelure is a ghostly Pokémon resembling a chandelier. Yes, there’s a strange assortment of Pokémon resembling objects you’d find around a house—including Chandelure (as well as Litwick and Lampent, its two previous forms). In addition to its unusual look, Chandelure is described in the Pokedex as being able to steal life energy and feed on spirits. Creepy!

      "content": "The Arctovish combines a fish and a plesiosaur. It’s also a “Fossil” Pokémon—it’s revived by merging fossilized fish and dinos in Pokémon games. Clearly, the Arctovish’s association with dinosaurs and fossils has given it an appropriately bizarre appearance, with its gigantic, tiny-eyed head being the star of the show. Type: Water/Ice Pokedex #: 0883 Generation: 8"

      "title": "Vanillish (and its other evolutions) are ice cream Pokémon.",
      "content": "Vanillish (and its other evolutions) are ice cream Pokémon. It really does resemble a giant vanilla ice cream cone that’s been in the freezer a little too long—and its counterparts, Vanillite and Vanilluxe, aren’t much different. An ice cream-themed Pokémon probably isn’t very intimidating during battles, and the idea of sentient ice cream altogether is just plain weird .

      "content": "Orthworm’s gaping mouth and wide eyes are certainly memorable. The concept of an earthworm-inspired Pokémon isn’t so strange; there are plenty of insect types. However, Orthworm’s design is more than strange—it’s a little haunting! Orthworm’s mouth is always open (too) wide, and its unblinking eyes are way too small in comparison. Type: Steel Pokedex #: 0968 Generation: 9"

      "content": "Klefki is really just a keyring (with keys included). If any Pokémon proves the people designing them were low on ideas at some point, this one does. Yes, there’s lore for Klefki stating that they sneak into homes and feed off the metal in keys—but, at the end of the day, this weird little Pokémon still just looks like a living, breathing keyring (which would be a strange choice for a Pokémon battle, right?)

      "title": "Sigilyph’s totem-like appearance sets it apart from other Pokémon.",
      "content": "Sigilyph’s totem-like appearance sets it apart from other Pokémon. Its name is most likely a combination of “sigil” and “glyph,” both words for ornamental symbols or pictographs, and the reason for that is clear—Sigilyph looks like a multicolored, levitating totem pole. It has a black head, cyan eyes, a zigzagging pattern on its body, and striped wings; that’s a pretty busy look as far as Pokémon go! Type: Psychic/Flying Pokedex #: 0561 Generation: 5"

      "title": "Honedge resembles a broad sword.",
      "content": "Honedge resembles a broad sword. That’s pretty much all there is to Honedge’s strange design: a silly-looking sentient sword with a big blue plume coming out of the handle. And while yes, Pokémon is partially a battle game, having a sword-shaped Pokémon is just a little on the nose. Ah, well…at least it’s not a trash bag (and yes, there’s a trash bag Pokémon). [7] X Research source Type: Steel/Ghost Pokedex #: 0679 Generation: 6"

      "title": "Falinks is a peculiar centipede Pokémon.",
      "content": "Falinks is a peculiar centipede Pokémon. Or, at least, it looks like a centipede. It’s actually a whole group of bipedal Pokémon (five troopers and a leader) in orderly formation. Falinks has a cool “medieval knight” vibe, but it’s also a very weird concept if you think about it too hard…especially the idea of knights forming a centipede-like unit to launch attacks. Wild! Type: Fighting Pokedex #: 0870 Generation: 8"

      "title": "Crabominable is one of the strangest-looking ice Pokémon out there.",
      "content": "Crabominable is one of the strangest-looking ice Pokémon out there. It’s one thing to create a Pokémon mashup of two different animals—but what about a mashup between a crab and an abominable snowman/yeti creature? That’s what Crabominable looks like (and what its name suggests). The result is a fluffy white crab with a weird, open-mouthed expression like it’s constantly shocked! Type: Ice/Fighting Generation: 7 Pokedex #: 0740"

      "title": "Probopass’s giant nose and bushy mustache are hard to miss.",
      "content": "Probopass’s giant nose and bushy mustache are hard to miss. Probopass is a rocky, statue-like Pokémon—but its gigantic nose stands out because it’s bright red against the Probopass’s blue-grey body! When you add the black mustache (how do rocks grow mustaches?) and red hat-like structure on the Probopass’s head, this Ruby & Sapphire Pokémon is absolutely a strange one.

      "title": "Mimikyu has a sad reason for its strange look.",
      "content": "Mimikyu has a sad reason for its strange look. On the surface, Mimikyu looks like a lopsided, homemade Pikachu puppet—but it’s not a sinister creature! Mimikyu looks like that because it’s trying to mimic Pikachu’s appearance…so it can make friends. Knowing that makes you want to give little Mimikyu all the friends it wants (even if it still looks quite weird). [9] X Research source Type: Ghost/Fairy Pokedex #: 0778 Generation: 7"

      "content": "Bruxish is an eerie fish-like Pokémon. The narrowed eyes, the sinister smile full of sharp teeth, the perfectly made-up lips and eyelashes—Bruxish has all these delightful traits on top of a psychedelic hot pink, purple, yellow, and turquoise body. The final result is Pokémon resembling a scheming, sentient piranha that is absolutely going to bite you soon…which is pretty unsettling. Type: Water/Psychic Pokedex #: 0779 Generation: 7"

      "title": "Trubbish is shaped like a tied-up garbage bag.",
      "content": "Trubbish is shaped like a tied-up garbage bag. It’s even in the name “Trubbish,” which is just a combination of “trash” and “rubbish,” making Trubbish a true garbage-type Pokémon (even if its official designation is poison). Trubbish’s arms even look like pieces of garbage that have broken through its dirty-green trash bag outer shell—and its evolution, Garbodor, looks like a pile of waste spilling out of a ripped bag. Yuck! Type: Poison Pokedex #: 0568 Generation: 5"

      "title": "Porygon-Z resembles a geometric duck.",
      "content": "Porygon-Z resembles a geometric duck. Its base form, Porygon, is very cubic and hard-edged. In comparison, Porygon-Z is smoothed down with a more spherical body—making it look a bit like an abstract painting of a bird (rather than an actual bird). Its eyes contribute to its strangeness, too: they’re wide and look more like black-and-white targets than eyes! [10] X Research source Type: Normal Pokedex #: 0474 Generation: 4"

      "title": "Blacephalon is a truly strange cross between a clown and a disco ball.",
      "content": "Blacephalon is a truly strange cross between a clown and a disco ball. It was introduced as an Ultra Beast (Pokémon from a different dimension) in Sun & Moon— and it certainly looks like it’s from another world! Blacephalon’s “outfit” looks reminiscent of a circus clown costume, but instead of a humanoid head, it has a spherical head with blue and pink sparks dotting the surface. [11] X Research source Type: Fire/Ghost Pokedex #: 0806 Generation: 7"

      "title": "Klink is basically just a pair of interlocked gears.",
      "content": "Klink is basically just a pair of interlocked gears. That in itself is strange—each gear has an “eye,” so are they both sentient? How do they stay together? Each gear also has a round, turquoise nose and a small, perpetually open mouth, making this Pokémon look a little clueless all the time.

      "title": "Dusknoir takes the form of a ghostly cyclops.",
      "content": "Dusknoir takes the form of a ghostly cyclops. As the final evolution of Duskull, Dusknoir doesn’t really fit in visually with other Pokémon. Additionally, it has a single red eye and hands that are detached from the rest of its body, which only contributes to the “weirdness” of the Pokémon. Type: Ghost Pokedex #: 0477 Generation: 4"

      "content": "The Legendary Enamorus has a genie-like form. Introduced in Legends Arceus, the odd-looking Enamorus seems to be inspired by genies—but it looks like a pink, horned humanoid with a snake (covered in heart patterns) wrapped around it. It also floats around on a white cloud and transforms into a sort of turtle Therian form with a white mustache. Type: Fairy/Flying Pokedex #: 0905 Generation: 8"

      "content": "Mr. Mime is a Pokémon with features that are way too human-like. Many Pokémon have adorably animalistic traits—but not Mr. Mime. This guy looks way more human than most Pokémon, to the point that fans have even speculated he’s not really a Pokémon but a human cursed into a Pokémon-like form. Whether or not that’s true, the pink cheeks and pointy jester shoes make for one bizarre creature. Type: Psychic/Fairy Pokedex #: 0122 Generation: 1"

      "title": "Jynx has a startling combination of humanoid traits.",
      "content": "Jynx has a startling combination of humanoid traits. Like Mr. Mime, Jynx is more human than most Pokémon, which adds to its “weird” factor. Jynx has long, blond hair, a purple humanoid body, bright pink lips, and a red gown with a gold-accented chestplate. Considering most Pokémon don’t need clothes (and don’t have long, flowing hair), Jynx’s look is downright unnerving…and unique, that’s for sure! Type: Ice/Psychic Pokedex #: 0124 Generation: 1"

      "content": "Unown is a one-eyed, shapeshifting Pokémon. Each of Unown’s forms is supposed to look like a letter in the Latin alphabet, which is a creative concept—but the idea of pitting a Latin symbol against other Pokémon in battles is a little laughable. Unown’s single, wide eye is also a bit creepy, making it an all-around strange Pokémon to look at. [13] X Research source Type: Psychic Pokedex #: 0201 Generation: 2"

      "content": "True to its name, Yamask comes with its own mask. This Pokémon resembles a dark shadow with red eyes carrying a golden, human-like mask with its appendages, which is already odd. Then, there’s the lore behind this Pokémon—which says the mask is a recreation of the Yamask’s face from when it was human. Oh, and Yamask can possess humans. That’s like something out of a horror story! [14] X Research source Type: Ghost Pokedex #: 0562 Generation: 5"

While technically a Normal-type Pokémon, there’s nothing normal-looking about Likitung. It looks like a bipedal pink dinosaur with a tongue longer than the rest of its body, and its evolution, Lickilicky, also has the same wildly long tongue.
