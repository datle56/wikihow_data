Separate the leaves of the lettuce with your hands. [1] X Research source Be careful when using a knife so you don’t hurt yourself. Make sure your fingers are away from the blade when you cut."

If you got the lettuce from a farmer's market, it will probably be more dirty than from the store.

      "content": "Inspect whole heads. If you are washing whole heads of lettuce, make sure to thoroughly inspect them. Gently open the heads and check between the leaves for dirt. Gently bend the leaves back and away from the core to allow water to get between the leaves. Make sure to check the area where the leaves are attached to the stem. [5] X Research source You can leave the lettuce heads together for grilling. [6] X Research source If the lettuce was in your fridge for a while and there’s colored liquid in the bottom of the bag it came in, your lettuce has gone bad, unfortunately."

Make sure not to go near the dirt at the bottom of the bowl. Gently shake the excess water off of the leaves and lay them on a paper towel. [7] X Research source"

Pour out any water from the bowl and put the colander back inside the bowl. Put the lid on top of the bowl and turn the handle to spin the lettuce to dry out the leaves.

Start rolling the towel (starting at the end near you). Lightly press against the green while you roll. If you push too hard, you might bruise the leaves. Unroll the towel and the lettuce should be dry. [10] X Research source"
