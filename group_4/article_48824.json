      "content": "Replace the battery. If you hear a single chirp from your smoke detector every 30-60 seconds, the batteries are likely low, and you should change them . This also applies to hard-wired fire alarms, as they have backup batteries to keep them working in case of a power outage. Firefighter and paramedic David Decker recommends testing your fire alarm's battery once per month and replacing the battery twice a year. A good way to remember to change your fire alarm's battery is to do so when it's time to set the clocks back or forward. \"In the state of Ohio,\" Decker says, \"the motto is Change your clocks, change your batteries.\""

      "content": "Move the fire detector somewhere else. Some locations are bad for alarms and smoke detectors, causing nuisance alarms (alarms triggered by environmental factors, not CO or smoke). Decker recommends not installing fire detectors near doors, windows, or air ducts, as the fresh air can prevent smoke from triggering the alarm. Bad locations include dusty, dirty, greasy areas like garages and areas with combustion particles, like kitchens. You also want to avoid putting your CO alarm or smoke detector in high-humidity areas like your bathroom. Install the unit at least 5 feet away from any cooking appliance and 10 feet away from anything that creates humidity.

If your unit is chirping constantly or in a pattern you don't recognize, it may have reached the end of its life due to age, exposure to water, paint, stickers, fire, or grease, or has been hit with force. Most fire alarms last 7-10 years after the manufacture date, which you can find on the back of your unit. If youâ€™ve had the unit for more than 10 years, it is time to replace it.
