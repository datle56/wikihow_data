      "content": "Grab a partner, then find a group. Square dance is performed in pairs, so ask someone to dance and get in position—traditionally, the man starts on the left, and the lady on the right. Then each pair groups up with 3 other pairs, and the 4 pairs all stand in a square facing each other. That’s where the name comes from! The “first couple” stands with their back to the source of the music, and the other couples are then numbered 2-4 counterclockwise from the first. These numbers come into play in some dance moves. “Head couples” are the first and third couples (facing each other), and “side couples” are the second and fourth couples. Note that square dancing delineates partners by the “man” and “lady,” and these terms are used to describe and call the moves, but you can dance with anyone you like! Free dancers holding up their right hand are willing to dance the man’s position; a left hand indicates a dancer able to dance the lady’s position. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Nod or bow to your partner, and also to your corner partner. Your “corner partner” is the nearest person in the couple immediately next to you. They’ll be your temporary partner for some particular calls, so it’s nice to say a quick “howdy” to them and introduce yourself. While you’re at it, introduce yourself to the whole square. In square dancing terms, y’all are a “family” now!"

      "title": "Listen to the caller and follow their lead.",
      "content": "Listen to the caller and follow their lead. Every square dance has a “caller,” or an announcer who shouts out the next move that all the dancers will follow. Keep your ears open for the next call, and follow the flow of the dance. [2] X Research source Many calls are fairly self-explanatory, like “circle left” (everyone forms a circle and moves to the left), but some calls need a little studying, like “allemande left” (we’ll get to that one soon)."

      "title": "Circle Left and Right",
      "content": "Circle Left and Right Everyone in the circle joins hands and moves in a circle, either to the left or the right, depending on the caller’s directions. If the caller just says “circle,” assume you’re headed left. [3] X Research source Careful not to step on any toes! Face slightly in the direction you’re moving; you’re not walking sideways, but forward at a comfortable angle."

    {
      "title": "Forward and Back",
      "content": "Forward and Back Each dancer walks 3 short steps forward, then taps their free foot on the floor in front of them. Then, everyone takes 3 steps back to their starting position, starting with the foot they just tapped, and finishes by tapping their new free foot on the floor beside the other. [4] X Research source Altogether, this move takes 8 beats to perform; 4 beats forward, 4 beats backward. Start this step with your right foot by default, but feel free to use your left foot if it’s more comfortable."

Grab your partner and hold them in a ballroom pose, holding your left hands together The man places his right hand on the lady’s waist, and the lady places her right hand on the man’s shoulder.

The dancer on the right steps to the left, while the dancer on the left steps backward and to the right to let the other dancer pass before stepping forward into position. [6] X Research source The half sashay is often followed by a “rollaway,” in which the dancers once again swap places, this time joining hands while the dancer on the left twirls the dancer on the right."

Take that dancer’s left hand and step past their left shoulder. Repeat this movement, alternating hands with each dancer, until you come face-to-face with your original partner. [8] X Research source You and your partner will walk separate ways and step past each dancer in the square until you both meet again on the far side of the square from where you started. You’ll pass by both men and ladies as you perform this move."

      "content": "Promenade Each couple turns sideways to their right and walks together in a circle counterclockwise, so that the group forms a rotating cross with the men at the center. Unless the caller stops the dancers early, each group walks until they reach their original positions. [9] X Research source In a “single-file” promenade, the group walks counterclockwise in a single-file line, without coupling up. A “weave the ring” is a promenade without hand-holding—everyone passes on alternate sides without touching."

      "content": "Use a light grip when holding hands. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of the music, but mind your grip when taking hold of your partner. A too-firm grip is uncomfortable and can make it difficult to perform certain moves. Hold other dancer’s hands gently so that you can meet and part easily during the dance, without any fuss. [15] X Research source Always default your hand-holding to your right palm facing upwards and your left palm facing downwards. The other dancer will do the same, and your grips will match perfectly every time."

Listen intently to the caller, keep your square tight, and guide other dancers with your actions, not your words, to avoid confusion. If someone makes a mistake, complete the call to the best of your ability and wait for the next one. [16] X Research source"

Traditional square dancing attire often consists of formal, regional blouses, skirts, trousers, and shirts, but these aren’t typically required to join in on the fun. You do typically need long sleeves, however. A long-sleeved shirt makes moves like interlocking elbows much more comfortable for yourself and other dancers. [17] X Research source"
