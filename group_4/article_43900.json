      "content": "Make a basic spiral. The spiral pattern is a classic tie dye look. The basic spiral collects all your fabric together into a single coil. Using this method of tying, you'll create a design with your design that corkscrews out from the middle point of your spiral."

      "title": "Spread your material out on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Spread your material out on a flat surface. But before you do, make sure the surface is clean! If you are working on a commonly used surface, like a table you eat meals at, leftover food or oil can get on your fabric and ruin your consistency of the pattern made by your dye. Crumbs wound in your fabric could create light spots in your dye or flecks of white. Take a damp cloth and wipe off your surface before laying your fabric on it. You may want to protect the surface on which you are working by laying down a dye resistant mat or disposable cover to work on. Some common options include cardboard, plastic, and tarps."

      "content": "Pinch the center of the fabric with your thumb and two fingers. You only want to gather a very small amount of fabric between your fingers at this point. The fabric you grasp in your fingers will form the center point of your fabric. Gathering too much fabric can lead to a large, blob-like center of your spiral. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the fabric while holding it down with your fingers.",
      "content": "Twist the fabric while holding it down with your fingers. Keep your spiral as tight and flat as possible. To help create a regular spiral, you should flatten your fabric against your surface with each full twist of your hand. As you continue to twist, the fabric should begin to form a spiral shape. You may want to use a tool to help you coil your fabric to give you the tightest spiral possible. A tighter spiral will result in more coils in the pattern, making it more elaborate. Some tools you might use to wind your spiral include a blunt fork or the eraser end of a sturdy pencil. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Close your spiral with your free hand.",
      "content": "Close your spiral with your free hand. Bring the loose end of your spiral and hold it to the main coiled part with the free hand you aren't using to twist the fabric. Pull the outside end of your coil tightly so that your spiral is wound as tightly as possible. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Band your spiral together.",
      "content": "Band your spiral together. Continuing to hold your spiral together with one hand, use your other hand to slide several large rubber bands around the fabric. You'll want to position them so that they cross at the center of the bundle, stretching from one end of the coil to the opposite side. Start with four rubber bands and increase the number as you find necessary. Larger pieces of fabric, fabric wound especially tight, or thicker fabric might need more rubber bands to maintain the spiral."

      "content": "Know the effect of knotting tie dye. An advantage of knotting your tie dye is that you can tie as many knots as you want. This is especially useful for long strips of fabric. Dyeing knotted fabric creates a design where fine lines of white, like the irregular shape of cracked glass, run throughout your dye colors in random directions."

You could also tie many knots to create a series of burst-like points throughout your fabric. Be careful while twisting and knotting your fabric. You'll want it to be tight, but knotting it too tightly can cause the fabric to rip or warp."

You could also use twine or string to fasten your ball together, but in both cases, fasten your ball loosely. Fastening your ball too tightly can make it difficult for the dye to work its way into the core of the bunched fabric. This can create gaps in your dyed design. Use the minimum number of fasteners secured as loose as possible while still retaining the ball's shape. If you plan on using twine or string, it may be easiest to have a friend help you hold the bunched fabric while you tie, or vice versa. If no friends are available, lay of the string on the surface, set your ball atop the middle of the string while still holding the ball together with one hand, cross the ends of the string at the top of your ball, and use your free hand to tie a simple knot ."

You might want an arc of rosettes beneath the top of your fabric, above its bottom hem, up and down its sides, or any number of other variations. When you've decided where you want your rosettes to be, use a piece of chalk to draw a dots along the fabric where the center of each rosette will be. You can even create more elaborate shapes with your rosettes. For example, you could make a circle of rosettes around the middle of your shirt or gather them into the shape of star.

      "content": "Fasten your tube at regular intervals. Use rubber bands or string to tie the cloth tube off at even intervals. If the spacing between your fasteners is uneven, the distance between your stripes will also be uneven. Your stripes will form along the orientation of your rubber bands. To ensure even striping, you might want to measure the space between your fasteners with a ruler and adjust as necessary. You could also measure out and mark your spacing beforehand."

Chemical dyes, even commercial ones that can be purchased at a craft store, will usually be most effective if you first soak your fabric in a solution made from soda ash and warm water. Take a large plastic bucket and: Combine 8 oz (250 ml) of soda ash fixer with 1 gallon (4 L) of warm water. Stir until it is evenly mixed.

After the fabric has finished soaking/cooling, remove it from the fixative and wring it out so that it feels damp. If using vinegar or salt, rinse the material before squeezing out the excess moisture. A pair of tongs can be used to remove the fabric from the simmering solution so you can rinse the fabric immediately with cool water. This will save you time spent waiting for it to cool.
