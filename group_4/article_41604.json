      "title": "Examine your pears for ripeness.",
      "content": "Examine your pears for ripeness. Unlike most other fruit, pears are picked off the tree when they are mature, not ripe. They begin to slowly ripen from the inside out after they’ve been picked. You can check the ripeness of your pears yourself by applying gentle pressure at the top near the stem. [1] X Research source The color of your pears alone is not a good indicator for how ripe or not ripe they are. If the flesh is hard when you press down, your pears are not ripe. If you plan to eat them a few days from now, purchasing unripe pears is perfectly fine. If the flesh slightly gives when you press down, your pears are ripe and can be eaten right away. Softness or bruising anywhere else on a pear could indicate it is overripe and will impact the taste and texture."

      "title": "Store unripe pears at room temperature.",
      "content": "Store unripe pears at room temperature. Room temperature storage will allow your pears to continue the ripening process. They should be stored whole and not cut. Room temperature is 70 °F (21 °C). [2] X Research source You’ll need to check your pears daily using the pressing technique to see if they are ripe and ready to eat. Most pears ripen between 3 and 4 days after purchase. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Refrigerate ripe pears to keep them fresh.",
      "content": "Refrigerate ripe pears to keep them fresh. Ripe pears will not last very long on the kitchen counter or pantry. Placing them whole in the fridge can extend their shelf life up between 5 and 12 days. [4] X Research source The temperature of your refrigerator should be set at or below 40 °F (4 °C). [5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If you’ve cut up your pears, wrap them tightly in a bag or container before refrigerating to limit air exposure."

      "title": "Don’t eat bad, rotten or spoiled pears.",
      "content": "Don’t eat bad, rotten or spoiled pears. Browning, bruising and blemishing are all signs that your pears are no longer desirable or safe to eat. [6] X Research source It’s possible for a bad pear to look healthy on the outside, so you’ll have to cut it open to confirm whether or not you should eat it. If a pear is not rotten but just slightly overripe, it can still be used in a variety of recipes, including smoothies, jams and dressings."

      "title": "Speed up the ripening process of your unripe pears by placing them in a brown bag.",
      "content": "Speed up the ripening process of your unripe pears by placing them in a brown bag. If you want to enjoy your pears sooner rather than later, it’s possible to speed up the ripening process. Fruits like pears produce a natural hormone known as ethylene during the ripening process. Placing your pears in a brown paper bag traps the hormone, allowing them to ripen at a faster rate. [7] X Research source Placing your pears in a fruit bowl with other ethylene-producing fruits, like bananas, apples and avocados, will also speed up the ripening process."

      "title": "Cut the pears before freezing for easier storage.",
      "content": "Cut the pears before freezing for easier storage. Freezing pears will allow you to enjoy their sweet taste throughout the year, even when not in season. How you cut the pears is completely up to you––cut them in halves, quarters, or slices. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source Before cutting pears, peel and core them for best results. If you’re not comfortable completing these steps with just a knife, a variety of fruit peeling and cutting tools is available to help make this step easier."

      "content": "Soak the pears in a simple solution to prevent browning. In 1 quart of water, add either ½ tablespoon salt, ¾ teaspoon ascorbic acid, or 3 tablespoons lemon juice. After creating the mixture, add the pears, then allow them to soak for 3 to 5 minutes.

      "content": "Place the pre-treated pears on a baking sheet or tray and into the freezer. Spread them in a single layer so they all lay flat, then transfer them to the freezer on the baking sheet or tray. Allow the pears to freeze for 3 to 5 hours. Leaving them too long without being properly packaged could cause freezer burn, which could impact the taste and texture of your pears. [11] X Research source Freezing the pears before placing them in their long-term storage bag or container will allow the pieces to freeze individually instead of sticking together."

      "title": "Pack and seal the pears in freezer-friendly bags or containers.",
      "content": "Pack and seal the pears in freezer-friendly bags or containers. You can use plastic resealable bags, plastic containers with a lid, or even mason jars. Fill the bag or container with the pears, leaving enough room so they are not packed too tightly. Once you’ve packaged the pears, seal the bag or container. [12] X Research source If you’re using a bag to store the pears, push out as much air as possible to limit browning and freezer burn. Label the bag or container with the date and name of the fruit so you’ll be able to quickly identify what it is and how long its been in your freezer."
