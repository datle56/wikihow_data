Either keep the toothbrush cradled in its charger or change the batteries when you notice it's losing its power, which can help ensure that you can use the toothbrush most effectively. If you run out of power, then you can either continue brushing manually or get a regular toothbrush if you have one. Store your toothbrush close enough to the sink so it is easy to reach, but far enough away that you won't accidentally knock it into the sink and get electrocuted if the toothbrush is plugged in. Consider keeping extra batteries on hand so that you can always brush your teeth."

These bristles can wear with regular use and you should inspect the brush regularly to maintain its integrity, which can help ensure that you get the best brush possible. Make sure the bristles don't have any sharp or jagged edges or endpoints. Make sure that the bristles are not falling out. Also, check the colored bristles. If they start fading, it means that you should change the tip with a new one. Replace your electronic toothbrush head every three to four months, or more often if you notice any of the above-mentioned issues"

      "content": "Brush from outer to inner tooth surfaces. Maintaining the 45-degree angle, brush the outer surfaces of two to three teeth using a back and forth rolling motion. Once you've completed this procedure for a quadrant, move to the inner surfaces of your teeth and repeat the same procedure. The rolling motion is achieved by contacting the brush to the gum line and then moving downward with the toothbrush towards the chewing surface. Also, brush your gums with gentle pressure and avoid holding the brush for too long next to the gum line because the rotation can cause gum recession over time. To brush behind your front teeth, tilt the brush vertically and make up and down strokes using only the front half of your brush."

Wrap it around your middle fingers. You can then grasp the floss between your thumbs and forefingers which can help you clean more effectively.

A small study has shown, however, that flossing before brushing may increase the efficacy of fluoride."
