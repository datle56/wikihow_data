      "content": "Pair a skinny tie with a blazer for a clever, casual look. If you already wear a blazer at work, add a skinny tie into the mix to elevate your everyday look. A black or navy blazer is a good investment because you can pair it with any color tie. [1] X Research source Choose a colorful tie with a solid-colored button-up for playful, post-work vibes. Go for a casual-chic look with jeans, a collared blouse, and a blazer. If you want to go for a grunge or rockstar look, pair a skinny silk tie (either worn traditionally or tied into a messy bow) with a relaxed tee or scuffed-up top."

      "content": "Wear a loose tie with a button-up for an ultra-casual look. To keep the look consistent with the loose, casual tie, make sure your collar isn't too stiff. Keep it loose and a little disheveled by unbuttoning the top 2 to 3 buttons. [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Image Consultant Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. Avoid trying to match your tie to a patterned button-up shirt. If your top has lots of loud colors, choose a black (or other solid color) tie.

      "content": "Leave the very top button on your shirt undone. Buttoning the very top button on your shirt might stiffen up your look (plus it can be uncomfortable), so feel free to leave it unbuttoned to give yourself a little breathing room around your neck. You can even unbutton the top 2 or 3 buttons for a sexy or more casual look. [5] X Research source But if you want to look very prim and proper or ultra-modern, feel free to button all the way up!"

      "content": "Go for a preppy look by wearing a tie under a sweater. Let the top of the tie peek out from the neck of your sweater for a clever take on the college-prep style. Be careful not to look too scholastic—make sure the tie is a darker color than your sweater and the collared shirt underneath. [6] X Research source Make sure the sweater isn’t so tight that there’s a lump where the tie lays underneath."

      "content": "Add a tie to a simple summer or day dress for a playful look. If you like to wear casual dresses, try draping a tie around your neck or making a loose bow tie to hang around your neck. This is a great way to make a simple neckline look more fashion-forward. [7] X Research source If you have an A-line dress or shirtdress with a collar, wear a skinny tie (tied into a standard neck tie knot) for an androgynous look."

      "content": "Choose a plain belt that complements your tie. Don’t forget to wear a belt when you’re wearing a tie! The belt will balance out your look, especially if you’re wearing jeans or slacks. However, this isn’t a strict rule—a tie can look just as great without a belt depending on what aesthetic you’re going for. [8] X Research source For instance, it’s more than acceptable to avoid wearing a belt if you’re pairing the tie with a dress or long blouse that covers the top of your pants or jeans. A brown or black belt is always a good way to go."

[11] X Research source Make it casual by wearing tailored shorts, flats, and a simple top. Put on a blazer and let the bow hang over the top for a vintage-chic vibe. Turn the bow so it’s slightly off-centered for a statement piece. You can use a regular skinny tie or a pussy bow tie for this look."

      "content": "Avoid wearing a tie with anything other than a collared shirt or blouse. Only wear a tie with shirts that support and frame the tie (e.g., button-down shirts or blouses with collars). That means no tank tops, t-shirts, scoop-necks, or halter tops paired with a tie. However, a neck tie tied into a bow can look ultra-chic with a scoop-neck or off-the-shoulder blouse, so feel free to break away from the standard.

If you want to wear a tie with something other than collared shirt or blouse, wear high-quality fabrics that complement the fanciness of the tie. For instance, wear a silk tie with a silk blouse (not an old wrinkled t-shirt!). [14] X Research source Feel free to break this rule to achieve the look you want for a casual or avant-garde look. For instance, you might pair a plain cotton neck tie with a silk blouse, tweed shorts, and cropped jacket for a playful daytime or date night look."

The tongue of the tie should fall all the way down your torso to graze the very top of your belt. Anything shorter can look a little silly. [17] X Research source If your tie is too short, consider hiding it the end of it under a blazer or vest. If you’re wearing a tie draped like a scarf, feel free to let it hang lower to play up the drama."

      "title": "Match the width of the tie to your body frame to complement your shape.",
      "content": "Match the width of the tie to your body frame to complement your shape. If you have a small frame, opt for skinny or narrow ties that are usually about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide. If you have a medium or large frame, you can go with a tie that’s around 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) to 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide. [18] X Research source This isn’t a strict rule—feel free to try all widths of ties and see which one best suits your style. An ultra-thick tie can come off looking cartoony, so when in doubt, go for a more slender size."

[19] X Research source A pussy bow is a great accessory for power suits and flowy blouses. Channel the 1920s by attaching a pussy bow to the bottom of a collared v-neck shirt or sweater (first tie the bow then attach it with a safety pin). Pussy bows are super versatile—they’ve been around since the early 1900s and they’re definitely having a comeback!"

      "content": "Stick to classic colors and thoughtful patterns. To get the most versatility, choose ties and pussy bows that are solid white, black, navy, or taupe. If you plan to wear ties and bows as statement pieces, go for bold colors like electric blues, hot reds, bright pinks, emerald greens, or neon yellows. If you like patterns, choose polka dots, florals, geometric designs, or simple stripes—and be mindful about pairing the motif with other patterns. [20] X Research source For instance, pairing a paisley shirt with a floral tie might look too busy or clash—you’re better off sticking with a solid color tie or bow. If you typically wear lots of solid colors head to toe, feel free to choose bold patterns and color schemes for your tie or pussy bow to make a statement."
