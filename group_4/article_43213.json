Here are some statistics about abuse in the United States: [3] X Research source 25-30% of women experience domestic violence. Domestic violence situations cause disability and deteriorate your health, similar to “the effects of living in a war zone.” A little over 10% of men were victimized by their partners. 1,200 women die each year from domestic violence. Two million women sustain injuries every year from domestic violence. Domestic violence occurs across all socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. Domestic violence is most prevalent in the poorest of neighborhoods and people who went to college but did not finish school. Victims of domestic violence are more at risk for alcoholism. The risk of disability (emotional, mental and physical) for victims of domestic violence is doubled. The victim’s likelihood that they cannot walk without using a device for assistance (like a cane or walker), or need a wheelchair raises by 50%. The risk of stroke for victims raises by 80%, as well as the risk of heart ailments and arthritic joints by 70%, and asthma by 60%."

Men may be less likely to call for help, even if the woman had a weapon and is willing to use it. The woman may threaten that she will injure herself in order to claim domestic abuse. She may also use an injury caused by the man protecting himself in this way. Then, she may tell the police that the man was the abuser and get him arrested instead.
