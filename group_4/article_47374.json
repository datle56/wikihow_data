      "content": "Check the label to confirm your puffer is machine-washable. Most puffer jackets are totally fine to be washed in a machine, though be careful to follow the label instructions as directed. Make sure to only use a front loader or a newer model top loader. In older top loaders, the center agitator can damage the thin outer layer of your puffer jacket. [1] X Research source No matter what sort of washing machine you use, it is important to only use the gentle cycle."

      "title": "Use a down-feather-specific cleaner.",
      "content": "Use a down-feather-specific cleaner. The down feathers inside your puffer are very sensitive, and harsh chemicals and detergents can cause damage by stripping the feathers of their natural oils, which in turn makes for brittle, breakable feathers. [3] X Research source Using natural products or cleaners specific for down jackets allows the feathers inside to maintain their fluffiness, which makes for one happy puffer jacket."

      "content": "Skip the spin cycle. Do not spin your puffer jacket in the washing machine, it can damage the down feathers on the inside. Instead, gently knead the excess water from your puffer jacket, and leave it in the shade to drip-dry for 10 minutes before putting it in the dryer. Make sure your jacket is laid flat when drip-drying and gently fluff the down to avoid clumping. [7] X Research source"

Just fill it up with warm water and use a down-specific cleaner to avoid any unnecessary damage. [8] X Research source Let your puffer jacket soak for up to 60 minutes. Regular detergents are too harsh on the down feathers inside your jacket, and will leave them clumped and brittle. For best results, make sure your cleaner is down-friendly!"

Rinse your jacket out by lightly kneading the water from your jacket as evenly as possible to avoid clumping the feathers on the inside.

      "content": "Do not leave your puffer jacket to air dry completely. Though it can seem the gentler option, air drying will often lead to feather clumping and water retention in your jacket. If the feathers do clump and hold moisture for too long, it can also cause your puffer to start smelling.
