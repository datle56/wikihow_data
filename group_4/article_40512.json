Listen to what your instructor has to say and do not attempt the en pointe work until he or she states that you are ready.

      "title": "Develop the strength necessary for pointe work.",
      "content": "Develop the strength necessary for pointe work. The feet and ankles need to be strong, with the ability to control the joints in these areas being equally important. Rising to pointe and lowering back down depend on it. The ankles also need to be stable to support a sustained balance on your toes. Strong calf muscles are also required to pull off these skills. Each of these things can be achieved through the exercises done in ballet class. It also helps to have a solid core, which can be gained from ballet. Pilates is another excellent way to strengthen the core, if dancing itself isn't doing that for you."

      "title": "Maintain a healthy weight.",
      "content": "Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight while dancing on pointe could lead to health problems, because it puts too much pressure on the toes. You may damage your ankles or, even worse break or fracture them, which will mean that you will have to leave off training for a sufficient amount of time; weeks, maybe even months depending on the injury. Over that time, your strength, skill, and flexibility, for example, will have deteriorated. This can also mean that you will be back at square one and it will take you even longer to be able to stand on en pointe."

      "title": "Take two to three classes per week.",
      "content": "Take two to three classes per week. This will help to improve technique and learn as much as you can. Practice every step correctly, knowing it will transfer to your pointe work eventually. It's common to study ballet for at least two to three years in soft shoes before going on pointe."

Once you have the shoes on, make sure that the elastic and ribbons are properly attached to your legs. Ensure that your dance instructor has approved the shoes before using them. The block end of the shoe is known as the box or the block. It is this end that you will be standing on."

Maintain the correct ballet posture - open chest, pulled back shoulders, etc. Try to \"lift\" out of your hips and towards the ceiling, don't relax into that position."

Now is when the fun starts: Squeeze your butt as if your life depends on it to get en pointe. When you go up, go up all the way up onto the box. If you don't, you can seriously injure your ankles because of the extra strain it puts on them."
