      "content": "No, you cannot use Zelle with Apple Pay. Zelle only works to transfer money between bank accounts or debit cards. It's not a payment method in and of itself, and you cannot store your money with Zelle. Zelle is simply the service that moves money between bank accounts. Zelle also doesn't work with Apple Cash, as Apple Cash is not a debit card. Zelle only works to move money between bank accounts, including debit cards that are connected to a checking account.

      "content": "Connect a debit card to both Zelle and Apple Pay. As Zelle only transfers money between bank accounts, you will need a debit card connected to your checking account. Zelle is built into most banking apps. To get started, tap the Zelle option in your banking app and follow the on-screen instructions to sign up. If you don't have Zelle in your banking app, you can download the Zelle app from the App Store . Launch the app to create an account and connect your debit card to get started. If you are using Zelle to send money to yourself, you will need separate Zelle accounts for each bank account. You will need either a phone number or email to create an account, and each phone number or email can only be used once. To add a debit card, check out this wikiHow article on adding cards to Apple Pay ."

      "content": "Use Zelle to transfer money to your debit card. If you're getting money from someone else, have them use Zelle to send money to your debit card (or bank account connected to your debit card). If you're sending money to yourself, use your second Zelle account to send the money to your primary Zelle account that's connected to the debit card you have in Apple Pay. If you use Zelle through your banking app, simply tap the Zelle option and follow the on-screen instructions to send money. Each banking app may work slightly differently, but you will likely have to select the Send money option, then choose a recipient and enter how much money you want to send. If you use Zelle through the Zelle app, tap the Send button, select your recipient (tap Access Contacts if your recipient isn't on the list), then enter how much money you want to send."

Once the money is in your account, you can use the debit card via Apple Pay. You can also transfer the money from your debit card to Apple Cash, if you prefer."
