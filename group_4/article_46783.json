      "title": "Choose the right theraband.",
      "content": "Choose the right theraband. Resistance bands come in a variety of resistance levels. You can adjust the resistance as needed. Therabands, in particular, are coded according to their color, working from beginning to advanced use in the following order: tan, yellow, red, green, blue, black, silver, and gold. Other systems also color code their bands based on resistance level. It's typically advised to start with thinner bands or those with the least resistance. As you get stronger or heal from an injury, you can advance to a higher resistance level."

      "content": "Find a stationary point from which to secure your theraband. When you're doing exercises with resistance bands, many will require that you secure one end of the band to a secure and stationary object. You can buy anchor points for walls, or you can use square knots to secure the bands to door handles or heavy machinery. Make sure it is not a movable structure. Also, objects need to be heavy and sturdy enough to resist the exercise. Tables, cabinets, or chairs are not appropriate objects to use."

      "content": "Go slowly with your resistance bands. Use slow, steady movements whenever you use the theraband. This will help ensure you're staying in proper alignment and isolates the muscles you're targeting. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It is the quality of the movement, rather than the quickness with which it is performed, that counts here. Make sure you resist the urge to move quickly upon the return movement, because this works different muscles than the movement away from your body. Also rest for about a minute between each type of exercise.
