      "content": "Fold the bandana in half to create a triangle shape. On a flat surface, pull 1 tip of the bandana to the opposite tip to form a triangle. If your bandana is already a triangle shape, skip this step. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source This technique works best with a bandana that is 90 centimetres (35 in) wide and 90 centimetres (35 in) long. A shorter bandana will work but it won’t hang down as far. Purchase bandanas online, from a dollar store, or a dress-up store."

      "title": "Place the folded edge of the bandana across your forehead.",
      "content": "Place the folded edge of the bandana across your forehead. Pick up the bandana by the 2 opposite ends and bring the middle of the long edge up to your forehead, just above your eyebrows, and let the triangle shape cover your head. Swivel the bandana about 4 cm (1.6 in) to the right. This will give you a pirate look. [3] X Research source Tie your hair up first if you want to hang your ponytail through the bandana."

    {
      "title": "Knot the 2 opposite ends of the bandana.",
      "content": "Knot the 2 opposite ends of the bandana. Tie the long ends of the bandana into a knot at the back of your head. Pull the ends of the bandana tight and once you are happy with the placement of the first knot, tie a second knot over the top. This will keep the bandana in place while you complete your pirate activities. Tuck the overhanging corner behind the knot that you created. [4] X Research source If you’re going to wear a pirate hat over your bandana, just knot the bandana once. This will make it easier for the hat to fit on your head."

      "title": "Roll the bandana into a headband.",
      "content": "Roll the bandana into a headband. Place the bandana onto a flat surface and pull 1 point of the bandana to the opposite point to create a triangle shape. Fold the long edge of the bandana over in 5 cm (2.0 in) increments until it looks like 1 long strip. [5] X Research source If you want a thinner bandana, fold it in 3 cm (1.2 in) increments. If you want a thicker bandana, fold it in 7 cm (2.8 in) increments."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the bandana around your head and secure it with a knot.",
      "content": "Wrap the bandana around your head and secure it with a knot. Position the middle of the folded bandana on your forehead, near your hairline. Hold one end of the bandana in each hand and tie them at the back of your head. If you find that the bandana is slipping off your head, undo the knot and tie it further down toward your neck."

    {
      "title": "Drape another bandana over the knot if you want a more dramatic look.",
      "content": "Drape another bandana over the knot if you want a more dramatic look. Take the bandana off your head and lie it on a flat surface. Drape the second bandana over the first bandana. Position it so that the middle of the second bandana is over the knot in the first bandana and the material drapes either side. Use a bandana that is the same colour if you want to create a traditional pirate look. If you are wanting to create a unique look, use bandanas with different colours and patterns."

    {
      "title": "Tie the second bandana around the first knot.",
      "content": "Tie the second bandana around the first knot. Hold the ends of the second bandana and knot them around the first knot. This will create extra volume at the back of the bandana and make the knot look more prominent. Use a mirror or ask a friend to help you see the back of your head. Skip this step if you have decided to use only 1 bandana."
