      "content": "Take inventory of the pieces that came with your Diaper Genie®. Read over the instruction manual that came with your Diaper Genie® to make sure you understand all the parts in the package and how each one functions. Before you start the assembly process, make sure you have all the parts listed in the instruction manual. If you are missing anything, wait to assemble the unit until you get the missing pieces. If you find you are missing any pieces, call the customer support line listed in the manual and request replacement parts be sent to you."

      "content": "Attach the top and bottom at the hinge. The first step in assembling your Diaper Genie® is to attach the top (piece A) and bottom (piece B) of the genie together. There is a hinge on the bottom of piece A and a bar at the top of piece B. While holding the top at a 45 degree angle, place the bar from piece B into the hinge and press down until they click together. You don't need to force the hinge into place. Just push it until you hear a click."

      "content": "Flip the top over and click it into place. After securing the hinge between the top and bottom of your Diaper Genie®, flip the top over the bottom of the genie and press down until they click together. At this point, your genie should look like a tall, slim cylinder."

      "content": "Prepare a liner refill for your Diaper Genie®. You will need to place the plastic liner in your genie in order to use it. To add a new refill, pull the tab on the refill to remove the plastic seal. Then, pull downwards until you’ve released about 18 inches of film (or enough to fill the bottom of the Diaper Genie®). Tie a knot in the bottom of the liner. [1] X Research source An overhand knot works best for securing the bottom of your liner."

      "title": "Roll diapers into a tight ball.",
      "content": "Roll diapers into a tight ball. After you’ve changed your baby, roll their diaper up tightly, securing it with the adhesive tape on the diaper. It is best to roll your diaper into an oblong shape or a small, round bundle. [3] X Research source The tighter you can wrap your dirty diapers, the more the Diaper Genie® will hold before needing to empty it. Do not leave the adhesive tape unsecured because this can attach to the liner in your genie, causing it to rip. Generally, the Diaper Genie® will hold approximately 34 newborn diapers at one time. This number will decrease as your child ages."

      "title": "Insert the dirty diaper.",
      "content": "Insert the dirty diaper. Once you have rolled your dirty diaper, lift the lid of the Diaper Genie® and insert the diaper. Push the dirty diaper all the way down through the clamp. Ensure that the clamp closes again after you have inserted the diaper. Once you have done this, close the lid. [4] X Research source Once the clamp closes, the Diaper Genie® twists the film directly under the clamp, sealing the dirty diaper at the top."

Once your Diaper Genie® is full, unhinge the top from the bottom by pushing the button located in the middle of the genie (where the top and bottom parts meet).

After you have unhinged the top and revealed the childproof cutter on the genie, pull the liner into the cutter mechanism and press down until it severs the liner. Tie a knot at the top to enclose your diapers in the liner. Ensure you leave enough room at the top of your diaper roll to tie a knot—usually three or four inches."

      "content": "Clean your Diaper Genie® weekly. As you can imagine, you will need to clean your Diaper Genie® routinely to keep germs and any lingering smell from your child’s dirty diapers to a minimum. The best way to do this is to clean your genie at least once a week. To do so, take the Diaper Genie® apart and wipe down both the inside and outside with a bleach-based solution. If you’d like to be more thorough, wipe the genie down with an anti-bacterial cleaning wipe several times throughout the week. Furthermore, whenever you change the liner in your Diaper Genie®, spray the inside with a disinfecting and odor-neutralizing spray. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Invest in a deodorizing filter. The Diaper Genie® doesn’t come with a built-in deodorizer, but investing in one is a good way to help reduce the daily odor from your child’s dirty diapers. You can find deodorizing carbon filters for your Diaper Genie® at nearly all general merchandise retailers, like Walmart or Target. These filters come with a case that attaches to the lid of your Diaper Genie® and several individual carbon filters. To use, simply unlatch the top of the case, place a filter inside, and snap the case closed. Filters should be replaced at least every 90 days for the best results."
