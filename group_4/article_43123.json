      "content": "Green or gray discoloration Fresh ham is a shade of pink and the fat is white (if there’s a glaze it’ll be darker shade or brown). When ham starts to go bad, it will typically turn gray, green, or even blue. You may want to cut off the discolored parts use the rest, but none of the ham will be safe to consume if some of it has changed color.

      "content": "A slimy or sticky texture Ham should have a soft and moist texture, but it won’t leave any wet or greasy residue behind on your skin. Slimy ham is a sign of bacterial growth, so don’t consume it if it’s wet or oily. Some bacteria may cause ham to become sticky, too. In any case, avoid ham that doesn’t feel right in your hand. This will be especially notable on sliced ham. If you’ve got a whole ham with a crust or glaze, you may not notice this as easily."

You may be tempted just to cut off mold, but the fact that the mold appeared at all is a sign that the ham isn’t edible anymore.

If you’ve got a bigger piece of ham, grab an airtight freezer bag or an airtight container and place the ham inside. This will help the ham retain its moisture and keep it from going bad. Set the container or bag inside the fridge. Cut the ham into smaller pieces if your bags or containers aren’t big enough."

This covers deli cuts, uncooked cutlets, sandwich meat, country ham, and honey-glazed ham. After 5 days, discard your ham as it will have gone bad.

Prosciutto, dry Italian ham, Spanish ham, and Serrano ham can last 2-3 months in the fridge. Canned ham will last up to 6 months to 2 years if it isn’t opened. Once open, you’ve got the typical 3-5 days."
