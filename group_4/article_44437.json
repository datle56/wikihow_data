      "content": "Inspect the bite marks carefully. Bedbug bites commonly resemble other insect bites , including mosquito bites and flea bites. They typically involve a raised, reddish bump but can also appear as a blister. Bedbug bites are very difficult to distinguish from other insect bites; even a clinical physician cannot usually diagnose bites simply by looking at them. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bedbugs do, however, have a unique bite pattern. Although some bites may appear alone, most bites occur in a row of three to five bites (termed \"breakfast, lunch, and dinner\") or in a cluster of red bumps (a rash called bedbug dermatitis). The bites often appear in a zig-zag formation, but may appear in a straight line if the bugs bite you in the morning. Bites tend to occur on exposed areas of the body. Studies show that they have a preference of biting the skin around the eyelids, and such areas as the neck, face, feet, and arms. In contrast to mosquito bites, bedbug bites rarely occur on the back of the knees or in the folds of the skin. The bumps or the rash typically resolve themselves within one to two weeks. However, although an individual bite or set of bites may heal, if you have not eradicated the problem through pest extermination, then you may continue to get bitten. As long as there are bedbugs, they will try to get at you."

      "content": "Pay attention to when the bite marks occur. Consider, for example, if you notice the bites after waking up when previously you hadn't noticed them. However, this can also be difficult to determine because each person's reaction time can vary significantly. Symptoms that result from the bite can manifest at any point from a couple of hours to more than a week after the bite occurred. Bedbug bites can have a long incubation period. Visible signs of the bite (a red, itchy bump) can appear up to 10 days after you were initially bitten."

      "content": "Check your home for signs of a bedbug infestation. Start with where you sleep, as bedbugs love bed frames, box springs, and mattresses. Bedbugs want to be where people are so they can get the warm blood of humans. A telling sign is red spots on the sheets . These may come from a bedbug that was squashed after feeding, or from the bites left on you when the bug finished feeding on you. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Inspect your mattress, box spring, bed frames, including the lining and seams. Look for sleeping adult bedbugs, carcasses, empty skins (their exoskeletons), and feces (this will look like little black spots or smudges). Check your sheets, pillowcases, and pillows as well. It is very difficult to see and catch a living bedbug. Adult bedbugs are tiny reddish-brown insects with broad, oval-shaped bodies. They are very good at hiding . However, finding adult bedbugs is the only way to confirm that a bedbug is what bit you.

However, there is a very good chance that your physician will not be able to firmly diagnose that you have been bitten by a bedbug because the symptoms look so similar to those that result from other insect bites and skin conditions. Nevertheless, you may feel comforted by going to see your doctor, who can confirm for you that bedbugs pose little physical threat to humans. If you're going to the doctor, keep a close record of anything you've done to treat the bites, including what you've put on them and how often.

A pest control professional will search your home and be able to confirm whether or not you have a bedbug infestation on your hands. The pest control professional will know what to look for and can also then treat your home to remove the bedbugs and prevent future bites from occurring.

These all use products you probably already have on hand. Make a paste of baking soda and water. Slowly add small amounts of water to the baking soda and stir until you have a thick paste. Apply a thick coat of the paste to your bedbug bites. Allow the paste to dry and stay on the rash for an hour or more before washing it off with warm water. Saturate a cotton ball with lemon juice, St. John's Wort, or witch hazel, all of which are natural astringents. Dab at the rash with the cotton ball to help dry it out and control the itch. Apply the gel from an aloe plant to bedbug bites. Use pure 100% aloe vera gel. Aloe contains both antibiotic and anti-fungal properties, which can help prevent a secondary infection due to scratching."

Discuss these options with your doctor if you have any doubt about their usage and whether these medications are right for you. [11] X Research source Ibuprofen (Advil) is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by reducing hormones that cause inflammation and pain in the body. It also reduces hormones that trigger fever. Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid) is a drug that works as an analgesic, relieving pain by inhibiting pain signals in the brain. It is also an antipyretic, a drug that reduces fever. Do not give to children, however. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safer than aspirin for children and has many of the same effects as aspirin. It is not an NSAID, however, and will not reduce inflammation."

Bedbug bites, like all insect bites, can become infected through excessive scratching, as underneath the fingernails lies a host of bacterial pathogens. If your bites become infected, they will appear red and swollen, feel tender, and may drain pus. Typically there will not be a fever unless a substantial area of the skin is involved. If you experience any of these symptoms, you must seek medical attention as it points to a secondary infection.
