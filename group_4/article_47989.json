      "title": "Pre-Shipment means the sender hasn't given your package to the USPS yet.",
      "content": "Pre-Shipment means the sender hasn't given your package to the USPS yet. If your tracking status says \"Pre-Shipment, USPS Awaiting Item,\" it means your package’s shipping label has been created by the sender, but they have not yet given the package to a mail carrier. The system a sender uses to create the label automatically creates this pre-shipment status. Senders may create shipping labels in bulk to help them process multiple orders. In tracking, it appears that the package is ready to go, but they may still be packing it. [1] X Research source If the sender has scheduled a pickup time with the Post Office, you’ll see the pre-shipment status until the mail carrier picks up the package. The USPS is closed on national holidays and Sundays, which also delays picking up or dropping off packages. \"Shipping Label Created\" is another USPS tracking status with the same meaning."

      "title": "Pre-shipment usually takes anywhere from a few hours to a few days.",
      "content": "Pre-shipment usually takes anywhere from a few hours to a few days. While mail carrier schedules impact the time a package has the pre-shipment status, ultimately, the pre-shipment period is in the hands of the sender. Some retailers take longer to pack and ship USPS packages , and it depends on how long it takes the sender to drop the package off at the post office or schedule a pickup. [2] X Research source During busy shipping times – especially around the winter holidays – the USPS is so busy they may take a little longer to scan a package once they receive it. USPS labels have a barcode. If the barcode doesn’t print properly, it may appear that the package is in pre-shipment even after it has been delivered."
    },
    {
      "title": "Contact the sender if pre-shipment lasts longer than a few days.",
      "content": "Contact the sender if pre-shipment lasts longer than a few days. If you see the pre-shipment tracking status for more than a few days, contact the sender first. Because the pre-shipment status means the USPS doesn’t have your package yet, the sender may be able to give you more information about where it is. Occasionally, a USPS employee misses the initial scan of a package. This makes it look like the package is still in pre-shipment after the Post Office has taken possession of it. A package is usually scanned several times during transit, so you may see it skip to another status after spending longer than expected in pre-shipment."
