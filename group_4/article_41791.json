      "title": "Find an object that’s slightly larger than your own head.",
      "content": "Find an object that’s slightly larger than your own head. Usually, a stack of books or the arm of a couch is ideal. Try to find something that’s just a few inches wider than your own head so that your headband won’t snap. [1] X Research source You can also use a headform, like for wigs, if you have one."

    {
      "title": "Stretch your headband over the object.",
      "content": "Stretch your headband over the object. Carefully open up your plastic headband and place it around the books or the arm of the couch. Make sure that it is spread open wide, but not so wide that you can hear cracking or breaking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave it on the object for at least 24 hours.",
      "content": "Leave it on the object for at least 24 hours. At the end of 24 hours, check on your headband to see if it has stretched at all. It may be slightly larger now so that it doesn’t dig into your temples as much. [2] X Research source Plastic headbands don’t have much give to them, so they’ll only be able to stretch out less than 1 in (2.5 cm). If your headband still doesn’t fit, consider buying a different style or a larger size."

      "title": "Stretch your headband out over a large object.",
      "content": "Stretch your headband out over a large object. Find a stack of books, the arm of your couch, or a headform that’s slightly larger than your own head. Carefully open up your headband and place it over the object so that it stays stretched out. [3] X Research source Use caution as you stretch your headband, as plastic ones have the potential to snap in half."

      "title": "Put a hair dryer on a medium heat setting.",
      "content": "Put a hair dryer on a medium heat setting. Hair dryers can get pretty hot, so keep yours down to a low or medium setting. Cool air won’t do anything, though, so it has to be warm. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Heat up the headband for 2 to 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Heat up the headband for 2 to 3 minutes. Move your hair dryer up and down the length of the headband to heat it up slowly. If you start to smell melting plastic, turn off your hair dryer right away. [5] X Research source If you heat your headband for too long, you could melt and ruin it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the headband cool down for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the headband cool down for 30 minutes. Your headband will be warm and pliable, so don’t touch it yet. Give it a few minutes to cool down and conform to the shape of the new, larger object. [6] X Research source If you pick up your headband before it’s cool, it will snap back to its original shape instead of stretching out."

      "title": "Cut 2 5 in (13 cm) lengths of satin ribbon.",
      "content": "Cut 2 5 in (13 cm) lengths of satin ribbon. You can use any color of ribbon you’d like to, but try to choose ribbon that’s about 1 in (2.5 cm) wide. Cut 2 pieces, and don’t worry if they look like they’re going to fray. [7] X Research source You can find ribbon at most craft supply stores. Although adding padding won’t stretch your headband, it may help stop it from digging into your head when you wear it."

      "title": "Fold each ribbon in half, then add some hot glue.",
      "content": "Fold each ribbon in half, then add some hot glue. Fold the ribbon pieces so that the ends meet, then add a pea-sized dot of hot glue to the ends. Press them down with your fingers for about 30 seconds to let the glue dry. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep folding the ribbon until it’s the width of your headband.",
      "content": "Keep folding the ribbon until it’s the width of your headband. Fold the ribbon in half again and add a dot of hot glue to keep it in place. Keep folding your ribbon until it’s about as wide as your headband is, or a little wider. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Glue the ribbon to the ends of your headband with hot glue.",
      "content": "Glue the ribbon to the ends of your headband with hot glue. Put a dot of hot glue onto the inside of the ends of your headband where it sits behind your ears, then stick the ribbon to the inside of it. Hold it in place for about 30 seconds, then add the other folded ribbon to the other side. [10] X Research source It’s okay if the ribbon sticks out a little bit, because it will be hidden behind your ears when you wear it."
