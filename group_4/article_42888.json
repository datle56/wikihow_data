      "content": "Teach the dog to sit. When your puppy is standing in front of you, touch the stylus between its ears and quickly down its snout. Slightly rub the dog a bit and slide your stylus down to the bottom of the screen. The pup should place its rear on the floor. Use the Training Icon, located in the upper right corner of the screen. Touch it and speak clearly in the microphone and say \"sit\", or \"sit down\", whatever you want to call it. You can # repeat this action until your dog learns it for any trick. Once the dog masters it, type in what the trick is, in this case \"sit\", or whatever."
