There are two main types of hard drive that you might want to add data to or remove data from: [1] X Research source External hard drive - External hard drives are USB-connected drives. You shouldn't need to set up or find an adapter for your external hard drive if you're using it on Windows, though you will need to format it for exFAT if you're using it on a Windows computer after previously using it on a Mac. Internal hard drive - Internal hard drives are built to connect directly to your computer's motherboard. You will need to remove the hard drive from its computer, determine whether it is IDE (indicated by a several-inch-wide ribbon connector) or SATA (indicated by a narrow ribbon connector), and find an IDE- or SATA-to-USB adapter."
