      "content": "Consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber every day. Fiber is one of the most important ingredients for good internal health. It moves food and waste through your digestive system. Consume 25 to 30 grams per day, either from your food or from a fiber-rich supplement. [1] X Expert Source Muhammad Khan, MD, MPH Board-Certified Gastroenterologist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. Plan your meals around getting this minimum fiber serving. Good sources of fiber are green leafy vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, and apples. Leave the skin on fruits and vegetables for extra fiber. Check labels to see how much fiber your food contains per serving and plan out your meals this way. If some food doesn’t come with a label, like fresh fruit, check online for its average fiber amount. If you have a fiber deficiency or aren’t able to get enough from your normal diet, take a fiber supplement. These are available over the counter at pharmacies."

These ingredients are difficult to digest and can cause discomfort in your digestive system. [4] X Expert Source Muhammad Khan, MD, MPH Board-Certified Gastroenterologist Expert Interview. 24 August 2021. Avoid fried, packaged, or microwaved food as much as you can for a healthier digestive system. Opt for fresh varieties instead. Processed foods also have little fiber and vitamins. Eating a lot of processed food will fill you up, but leave you deficient in nutrients like fiber, resulting in constipation and other digestive issues. Eat out less often as well.

      "content": "Eat slowly to prevent overeating. Piling food into your mouth stresses the digestive system. If you eat too quickly, you’ll end up too full because your brain can’t make you feel full soon enough. Relax and eat slowly, even if you’re very hungry. Chew the food completely before you swallow it. Then you’ll feel full before you’ve eaten too much. If you’ve just eaten and still feel hungry, wait a few minutes. Your brain might catch up to your body and make you feel full by that time."

Sticking to a regular schedule lets your body prepare itself for digestion and stay regulated. Try to set an eating schedule and stick to it throughout the week. Experts recommend eating 3 balanced meals per day, with some healthy snacking in between. Remember not to skip breakfast. Even if you're in a rush, eat breakfast to keep your digestion on schedule. Keep a food diary if you don't keep track of your eating habits. Write down what you eat and the time. Then review this information to see if you're eating on a regular schedule or at sporadic times. If you move around a lot at work and don't know when you'll be able to take a break, try packing some small snacks with you. Then you can put something in your stomach quickly to keep your digestion on a schedule. Finish eating at least 3-4 hours before you go to bed so your food has enough time to properly digest."

The daily recommended water intake is 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) for women. Use these levels as a goal to keep your digestive system healthy.

Drink whenever you feel thirsty to stay hydrated. As a general rule, drink a glass of water with every meal to aid in digestion. Drinking water is very important if you’re suffering from either diarrhea or constipation. Diarrhea drains your body of liquids, so replace them to avoid dehydration.
