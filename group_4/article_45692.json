      "title": "Find a workspace with a solid background so you can see the knot clearly.",
      "content": "Find a workspace with a solid background so you can see the knot clearly. Be careful not to pull the knot tighter when you spread out your necklace, and undo the fastener holding the ends together. If you’re dealing with multiple necklaces, unfasten the clasp or latch for each one. Try to work in a well-lit space, or turn on an overhead light or desk lamp so you can identify the knots and tangles easily."

      "title": "Add 2-3 drops of oil to thoroughly coat the knot.",
      "content": "Add 2-3 drops of oil to thoroughly coat the knot. Gently rub the knot between your fingers to reduce friction and help loosen it. The oil allows the strands of the necklace to slide past each other more easily as you untangle the knot. Alternatively, apply olive oil or mineral oil to lubricate the knot."

      "title": "Use baby powder to separate twisted or tangled chains.",
      "content": "Use baby powder to separate twisted or tangled chains. As an alternative to baby oil, dust enough powder to coat each necklace link, then gently rub the tangled areas to help loosen them. You can also use cornstarch or flour. [1] X Research source Don't use powder in combination with oil or Windex, or it will create a goopy mess."

    {
      "title": "Use Windex to loosen multiple tangles.",
      "content": "Use Windex to loosen multiple tangles. If your entire necklace is full of knots (or you have multiple necklaces tangled together), spray a light layer of Windex over everything as an alternative to oil or baby powder. Windex acts as a lubricant to loosen tangles, without damaging your jewelry. [2] X Research source Windex also makes an excellent jewelry cleaner—just spray your necklace with it, then use a clean toothbrush to buff away any surface stains or dirt."

      "title": "Place the necklace in a container, then leave it on the washer for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the necklace in a container, then leave it on the washer for 5 minutes. After lubricating your necklace with oil, powder, or Windex, store your necklace in a small jewelry container or Tupperware, and let the vibrations of your washer loosen any knots or tangles. [3] X Research source You can place your necklace on any object that vibrates like the roof of your car or a massage gun. Just make sure it doesn't fall off."

      "title": "Poke the needle in the center of the knot, then gently rock back and forth.",
      "content": "Poke the needle in the center of the knot, then gently rock back and forth. Once you get an opening in the knot, take the needle and pull apart each chain within the knot. If necessary, add more baby powder, oil, or Windex to reduce the friction between the knotted areas, then use your free hand (or another needle) to help you pull the needle away from the knot. [4] X Research source You can use any fine needle like a sewing needle, safety pin, or thumbtack. Alternatively, use a screwdriver to separate the tangles and knots If you’re trying to untangle a multi-layer necklace, work on the knots in the center of the chain before moving toward the ends.

      "content": "Fill a small bowl with warm water and a squirt of mild dish soap. To remove all traces of oil, powder, or Windex, gently swirl your necklace in the cleaning solution. Rinse the necklace off in clean water, then pat it dry with a soft cloth or paper towel. [6] X Research source If there’s any baby powder stuck in between the links of your necklace, scrub away any residue with an old toothbrush. You can also use store-bought jewelry cleaner to remove any residue on your necklace."

      "title": "Use straws, bags, or a jewelry tree to prevent knots.",
      "content": "Use straws, bags, or a jewelry tree to prevent knots. Thread your necklaces through a straw to hang them separately. Unclasp the ends of your necklace, and drop the smaller end of your necklace clasp through a straw. When the necklace comes out through the bottom of the straw, reconnect the two ends of your necklace, and hang your necklace from the clasp like a clothes hanger. [7] X Research source Alternatively, hang your necklaces on a jewelry tree . You can also store your necklaces in separate snap-closure bags when traveling. Just leave the clasp closure outside of the bag, then snap as much of the small bag as you can shut (except for the area where the clasp is hanging out)."
