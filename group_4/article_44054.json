      "content": "Pick up debris on the lawn surface. Your lawn collects a lot of junk over the years and it’s time to remove it. Sticks from nearby trees, rocks, and large weeds are all easy enough to spot and remove. Don’t forget to pick up litter left behind from a BBQ or the neighbor’s children. If you have underground sprinklers, locate and flag all heads, valve boxes, controller wiring, and any other sprinkler parts. If you don't do this, you run the risk of damaging your irrigation system. [4] X Expert Source Keith Souza Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 20 August 2021."

      "content": "Fill the holes in your lawn. If you're not planning on cutting sod, purchase topsoil at a gardening store and use it as filler. Alternatively, scrape dirt from higher points on your lawn. When you’re finished, rake over these areas to even out the soil. This is a good time to take a few soil samples for testing to ensure proper nutrient levels and proper PH balance."

      "title": "Dig up the perimeter of the lawn.",
      "content": "Dig up the perimeter of the lawn. Cutting sod means removing the top layer of the soil. Since this leaves the soil bare, it’s perfect for creating a clean garden bed ready for prep work prior to planting. Start by outlining the area you wish to dig with spray paint. Push a spade about six inches deep (15.2 cm) along these boundaries. This is deep enough for the spade to cut under grass and weed roots. You may also rent a sod cutter from a home improvement store. It’ll do the same job as your spade and save you some work if you don’t mind spending some money. Sodding is easier when the soil is damp but not saturated to the point of puddling. Wait for a light rain to pass."

      "title": "Divide the sod into one-foot strips.",
      "content": "Divide the sod into one-foot strips. Use a yardstick or your judgment here. Walk along one edge of the sod, measuring out no more than twelve inches (30.5 cm) at a time. Mark each spot by pushing your spade down like you did before. Now you’ll need to dig lines all the way across to the other side. Make the lines as straight as possible. It’s tricky, but you can lay a string or hose to guide you. [7] X Research source For best results, use a half moon shaped manual edging tool."

      "title": "Cut the sod strips into smaller pieces.",
      "content": "Cut the sod strips into smaller pieces. If you were to roll up the sod now and try carrying it, you’d throw out your back. Instead, take the time to divide the sod further. Measure between one and three feet (30-90 cm) along the length of the strips. Use your spade to dig down again, splitting the strips. Continue doing this until all the strips are divided."

    {
      "title": "Roll up the sod.",
      "content": "Roll up the sod. Go back to the edge of the sod. Try to pick up one of the strips. Your spade can help you lift it. If you see any roots clinging for dear life, sever them from the remaining soil with your spade or a sharp knife. Once the sod is free, roll it up like carpeting. Every strip after this first one will be easier to roll, so keep going and roll them all. Sod from a healthy lawn makes a great base for your lawn or garden. Either compost it or turn it upside down over the cleared area before you begin tilling. Unwanted sod may be taken to a waste center that accepts organics. Any city dump is bound to take it, but you may also be able to find home or business owners that will buy it for compost."

      "content": "Spray a glyphosate-based weedkiller over the lawn. Killing the old lawn may feel tragic, but it is the simplest way to clear a large space and start fresh. Glyphosate weedkillers such as Roundup kill grass as well as weeds. If weeds overran your old lawn, it’s important to get rid of them before you till. Make sure you cover nearby plants with plastic and keep family away while spraying. Please note: The WHO considers glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen. Its use is prohibited in some states and countries. Please check with your local laws and use caution if handling this chemical. Be sure to follow all directions properly and wait the recommended time to allow the weed killer to dissipate before beginning prep work. If you don’t get rid of the weeds now, tilling can spread them further. Don’t let them take over your new lawn!"

Drape this covering over your lawn and hold it down with stakes and bricks. Watch as the grass turns brown after a few weeks. When the grass is dried out and fully brown, remove the covering. [8] X Research source This option is good for when you don’t want to mess with chemicals or rent a sod cutter. However, be sure to leave it on long enough to kill the entire root systems of the unwanted vegetation, or it may grow back in time."

      "content": "Water hard soil to soften it for tilling. [9] X Expert Source Tony Hoang Landscaping Manager Expert Interview. 29 September 2023. Softening the soil will make your job much easier. A light rain will serve you well, but weather is unpredictable. For bone-dry summer soil, break out the garden hose. Spray water until the soil is moistened about two inches (7.6 cm) deep. Dig down that far and check to see that the soil is moist rather than soggy. Roll some of the soil between your fingers. Moist soil clumps together when rolled but falls apart when you press it flat."

Cover the soil with the substances you want to mix into it. Any amendments you find useful, such as new topsoil or sand for hard, slow-draining lawns, go first. Spread them an inch (2.5 cm) thick. Regardless of what you do, cover the area with two inches (5.1 cm) of fertilizer or compost. Look for store-bought products formulated for new lawn growth. [11] X Research source You may spread these by hand and even them with your rake, but a machine spreader saves a lot of time."

      "content": "Set the rototiller to cut soil six to eight inches deep. Rototillers are machines that break up and overturn soil. Rototillers can be rented at a reasonable cost from a home improvement store. Look on the side of the rototiller for a depth bar. Adjust it so it’s set between six and eight inches (15.2-20.3 cm). [12] X Research source If you don’t want to rent a rototiller, you can dig up the lawn with a spade or shovel. Unless you’re digging a small garden patch, this takes a lot of labor, so the rototiller is worth the cost."
