Most people don’t even realize they’re rocking—it’s a subconscious action. You might find yourself or others rocking to and fro in stressful or upsetting situations. The rocking may happen when you’re sitting down or standing up. Basically, it’s a coping mechanism to help regulate your nervous system, ease your emotions, and provide comfort. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Similarly, this is why people rock their babies when they’re upset. Studies show that a back-and-forth motion helps stimulate vestibular senses, helping the brain manage pain and stress. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Think of rocking back and forth like a hug. The motion cradles you and makes you feel calm in even the most tense situations. Rocking behavior is linked to feelings of stress, anxiety, and fear, and isn’t always a sign of mental illness. Even so, if you notice yourself rocking more than usual, it may be a sign to ask yourself how you feel inside and out."
