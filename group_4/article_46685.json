      "content": "Place the medication into the nebulizer. Unscrew the top of the nebulizer cup and put the prescribed medication into the nebulizer. Many types of respiratory medications for nebulizer treatments come in pre-measured doses. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If yours is not pre-measured, measure out the exact amount prescribed for one dose. Secure the top tightly to prevent the medication from spilling out. Don't forget to plug the air compressor into an electrical outlet if it is not battery-operated. Medications that can be put in the nebulizer include inhaled beta-agonists and anticholinergics, inhaled glucocorticoids, and inhaled antibiotics. Other inhaled medications are available for the treatment of non-respiratory diseases. Not all drugs can be aerosolized. The jet, or pneumatic, nebulizer is the most common type. Newer nebulizers are designed to deliver the entire medication during inhalation. Nebulizer performance can be affected by the nebulizer method, the mechanism of aerosol formation, and the drug formulation. If you need instructions about how to use your nebulizer, talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist."

      "content": "Attach the mouthpiece to the nebulizer cup. Although different manufacturers may have slightly different jet nebulizers, most mouthpieces will attach to the top of the nebulizer cup. Most nebulizers have mouthpieces instead of face masks, since masks can lead to facial deposits. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Connect the tubing to the cup and air compressor. Attach one end of the oxygen tubing to the nebulizer cup. On most types of nebulizers, the tubing will connect to the bottom of the cup. Connect the other end of the tubing to an air compressor used for nebulizers. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn on the air compressor to breathe through the nebulizer.",
      "content": "Turn on the air compressor to breathe through the nebulizer. Put the mouthpiece into your mouth, above the tongue, and keep your lips sealed tightly around it. Inhale slowly and deeply in through your mouth so that all the medicine goes into your lungs. [6] X Research source Exhale either through your mouth or nose. For adults, holding the nose closed can help ensure the medicine is inhaled through the mouth. Consider using an aerosol mask as an alternative to a mouthpiece for young children or people who are too ill to hold the mouthpiece. Aerosol masks attach to the top of the nebulizer cup. The mask comes in pediatric and adult sizes."

      "title": "Continue to inhale the medication until the mist stops.",
      "content": "Continue to inhale the medication until the mist stops. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Once all the liquid is gone, the mist stops coming out. The nebulizer cup should be empty. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Distract yourself by watching TV or listening to music. Set up an activity to occupy young children during the nebulizer treatment. Puzzles, books, or coloring may help the child sit still for the length of the treatment. Ideally, hold the child in your lap since the child should be sitting straight up to receive the optimal dosage of medication. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Turn off the nebulizer and clean up.",
      "content": "Turn off the nebulizer and clean up. Be sure to unplug it from the outlet and detach the medicine cup and mouthpiece from the tubing. Wash the medicine cup and mouthpiece with warm, soapy water and rinse them with clean water. Place the equipment on a clean towel to fully air dry. Make sure to do this after each treatment and daily. [9] X Research source After the mouthpiece and medicine cup have air dried, hook them up to the nebulizer again and run the machine for 20 seconds to make sure all the parts are completely dry. Don't wash the tubing. If it gets wet, replace the tubing. Also, don't put any parts of the nebulizer into a dishwasher to clean it because the heat can warp the plastic."

      "title": "Disinfect the nebulizer once a week.",
      "content": "Disinfect the nebulizer once a week. To disinfect, always follow the manufacturer's guidelines. Soak all parts, except for the tubing, in 1 part white distilled vinegar to 2 parts warm water for one hour. Discard the solution. Rinse the parts, except for the tubing, in cold water and air dry them on a clean towel. After the parts are dry, store them in a clean area in the case. [10] X Research source Clean the outside of the nebulizer with a warm, damp cloth if necessary. For cleanliness, if more than one person uses a nebulizer, do not share equipment, even if it is washed. Each person should use their own nebulizer."
