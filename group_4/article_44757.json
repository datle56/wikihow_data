[1] X Research source A corn can develop between the toes, has a core, and can be quite painful. Corns also develop along the tops of the toes, most often located just above a joint in the toe. [2] X Research source Corns are categorized as hard, soft, or periungual. A hard corn most commonly develops on the top of the toe and over a bone joint. A soft corn develops between the toes, usually between the fourth and fifth toes. A periungual corn is less common, and occurs along the edge of a nailbed. [3] X Research source A core is not always present, but is usually found at the center of the corn. The core consists of thick and dense skin tissue. [4] X Research source The core of the corn points inward and often presses on a bone or nerve which causes it to be quite painful. A callus does not have a core, and is a broader area that is made of evenly distributed thicker tissue. Calluses are not usually painful, although they can be uncomfortable. [5] X Research source Calluses usually develop on the bottom of the foot and just beneath the toe area. Calluses can also develop on the hands, usually on the palm side and just under the fingers. [6] X Research source Both corns and calluses are caused by friction and pressure. [7] X Research source"
