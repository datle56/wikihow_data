      "content": "Build your horoscopes through research and attention to the position of the sun, moon and stars. Astrology, or the study of space in relation to human affairs, has been around since before the ancient Greeks. Since then, different cultures have developed different methods of interpreting the night sky, and there are many different guidelines out there for burgeoning horoscope writers. The deeper your knowledge of these systems, the better your horoscopes will be. However, if you are just starting out, you should learn the most common system, known as the Solar House System. Serious astrologers need to know birth times and locations to write personalized horoscopes. However, for general horoscopes like those seen in the paper, the Solar House System is a careful approximation. Houses are typically known as your \"sign,\" such as Libra, Taurus, Aries, etc. If you are unsure about each sign, or need a refresher, click here to view the overviews below. For the next several steps, you can watch an original Aries horoscope for April 18th, 2015, as it is written."

For example, if you're writing about Virgos, you might start by writing about their work schedule or life at work, since they are the House of Work and Ritual. If you're talking about Tauruses, your might touch on finances. These are often your guiding principles, and they are a good way to start writing or to think about the general tenor of each house.

      "content": "Look to each sign's second and third houses for a deeper understanding of horoscopes. One of the biggest misconceptions in astrology is that every person only has one sign. In reality, your birthday only points to your first house. For example, if you're born October 5th, your first house (and most important sign) is Libra. However, if you continue along the zodiac, the next two houses are your second and third houses, here Scorpio and Sagittarius. You'll notice, reading over the descriptions of each group, that there is some overlap in features between similar months. This can help point to important trends in each group's life. [3] X Research source For example, while a Pisces is generally selfless and creative, they are also closely tied to the occasional impulsiveness and burst of inspiration found in Aries. Serious astrologists note that you have a little bit of every \"sign\" in you, based on the alignment of planets and stars at your birth. Some are just more prominent than others. Again, this is why many writers need your exact birthday and birthplace to properly determine your houses.

You're feeling flirty and conversational, but ultimately you're just having fun, not looking for anything serious."

      "content": "Watch the movement of planets and stars to anticipate big changes in life. The proclamations that \"you'll experience a drastic change in ______\" are not just pulled out of thin air. They come from the interceptions of certain planets through the night sky. Pay attention to major astrological events to help determine when changes might happen. To do so, look at astrological event calendars, found with a quick internet search. To determine what the change might be, check out which planet aligns with which house. For example: On January 5th, 2015, the Moon entered Libra. The moon, which governs the Cancers, is generally associated with identity, emotion, and one's roots, potentially leading to a \"rediscovery of a long-lost friend or lover\" for Libras. Certain events will make greater impacts depending on their relevance to the signs. For example, the moon entering or leaving Cancer's path will make a much bigger impact than entering Libra's. Mar's movement will affect Aries and Scorpio. [5] X Research source Aries, April 18th: Optimism and boundless energy fill your interactions today.

These charts are meticulously constructed to show each planet in relation to each sign, illuminating how they move and when they come in and out of contact. They are often color-coded to help you determine the most pressing issues and changes. They are invaluable tools for anyone looking to write frequent horoscopes. For example, to cap off the Aries horoscope, you might notice that Mercury, the planet of communication, is currently in Aries on April 18th: Aries, April 18th: Optimism and boundless energy fill your interactions today.

      "content": "Allow yourself to write freely and poetically when composing horoscopes. Astrology is a millennia-deep branch of study that would take a lifetime to master. Many astrologists, such as sidereal astrologists, don't even believe in the same zodiac structure. To complicate matters more, horoscopes must reach a wide audience, and lose the subtly and precision required for personalized horoscopes. As such, horoscope writing has evolved into an art form of sorts, considered by many the literature or poetry of astrology. It is entertainment -- meaningful entertainment, for sure -- but entertainment nonetheless. [6] X Research source Daily horoscopes are supposed to be conversational. The reader comes to the horoscope looking for direction or guidance, picking out of the horoscope the things that matter in their lives. They usually forget or leave the rest. In order to get a \"true\" reading, you need a personalized horoscope. Because this is impossible to write for a large audience, you must entertain and capture the imaginations of a broader group of people. Enjoy yourself while writing, and make sure your readers enjoy reading. There is no need for a dry, conversational tone."

      "content": "Avoid generalizations or very broad proclamations. This is hard when you're writing for a big audience. However, it gets easier the more your pay attention to the movement of planets and stars. While there needs to be some generalization when writing, try to look for specifics. For example, instead of saying, \"you'll experience an increase in communications,\" try to find the root cause. The influx of Mercury into your sign will increase communications, for example, but the question is how. Is it in your career (Mercury moving into Capricorn) or your love life (Mercury moving into Libra)?

      "content": "Avoid making grand proclamations every day. A big reason that people don't trust horoscopes is that they promise grand, enormous changes every other week. The careful astronomer realizes that these changes are as rare in our lives as they are among the stars. Focus instead on the subtle changes in life. Save the big, soul-changing moments for times when they seem imminent due to the planetary movement. Making grand proclamations every day makes them harder to stomach, and takes away their meaning. Since you're working in generalities, without exact birthdays or times, it is almost impossible to predict enormous and earth-shattering changes. Pepper your column with \"maybes\" \"possibles\" and \"could\" so that readers don't feel promised anything. [10] X Research source"

Astrology is not a perfect science. Generations of writers have been interpreting the stars for their fellow man since ancient times. Keep your mind open to new forms, writers, and astrological signs and you'll be a horoscope writer in no time. How do they speak broadly (to a lot of people), but still stay relatively specific?

Depending on when you were born, you fall under a different sign. This is based on the where the sun rises on the day you were born, creating your ascendant house. You can look up more complex breakdowns of each house, but you need to have the basics down before you start writing horoscopes. The following descriptions are good starting points, but you'll need to consult 3-4 other sources of house information to get a deeper understanding of the houses. [11] X Research source While these houses form the basis of horoscopes, they are not the only determining factor. The movement of planets like Venus and Mars, lunar cycles, and birthplace all have an effect. True astrologers must keep researching and studying celestial bodies other than the sun to be successful."
