      "title": "Narrative poetry tells a story in verse form.",
      "content": "Narrative poetry tells a story in verse form. The genre uses fictional devices, such as character development, plot, and scene description, with poetic formatting and language to craft a story that follows the rhythm of language. [1] X Research source Because of this, narrative poetry is generally longer with multiple themes, characters, and/or settings. Narrative poetry is one of the oldest forms of literature, as pre-literate societies relied on oral communication to pass along stories and history. [2] X Research source Beowulf , The Odyssey , and The Canterbury Tales are some of the most popular narrative poems and were written in verse based on song and memory. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a topic you feel strongly about.",
      "content": "Choose a topic you feel strongly about. This doesn’t mean you have to pick a topic of activism or social justice. The story you choose to write should be something you want to write. Think about what you want to share with your readers. Maybe that’s a personal experience or feeling or a fictional romance full of magic and dragons. [4] X Research source Brainstorming ideas and storylines can help if you’re unsure what to pick. Try writing down everything that comes to mind—a memory, image, or place. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Find the speaker or narrator of your poem.",
      "content": "Find the speaker or narrator of your poem. Who is telling your story? Is it being told through a first-person or third-person perspective? Before you start writing your poem , discover who the leading character of your story is. Perhaps it’s you, a stranger, an animal, or a legendary hero. [6] X Research source A first-person perspective uses “I” and “me” to recall events that have happened or are happening to the character. A third-person perspective uses “she/her,” he/him,” and “they/them” to describe what the character is doing. Narrative poems can be written with any point of view or perspective; just be consistent throughout your narrative. As long as your narrator is the one telling the story, you’re golden. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Outline the beginning, middle, and end of your story.",
      "content": "Outline the beginning, middle, and end of your story. Narrative poetry is a form of storytelling verse, meaning a story must be told one way or another. Even if your narrative is of a single event, it must have a start and end. Your outline can consist of a few sentences or even bullet points—it’s there to help you flesh out your story before you write the verse. One of the main purposes of narrative poetry is to entertain. Unlike other forms of poetry, a narrative poem doesn’t drive a reader forward with feelings but with plot devices. [8] X Research source Brainstorm different possibilities for your characters, setting, and plot. What you write down isn’t set in stone. Some writers find that outlining during or after writing helps them more than outlining while brainstorming."

      "title": "Open the poem with a striking image or lyrical line.",
      "content": "Open the poem with a striking image or lyrical line. The first line of your narrative poem should immediately capture your reader’s attention. Draw them into your story by putting them in the middle of the action or painting a picture of how your leading character sees the world. For example, T. S. Eliot opens The Waste Land with the famous line “April is the cruellest month, breeding.” You’re instantly drawn into Eliot’s words as a reader, wondering why April is so cruel. There’s no set rule that a narrative poem has to start at the beginning of a story, so play around with your opening scene."

    {
      "title": "Let the details drive the narrative.",
      "content": "Let the details drive the narrative. Many poems rely heavily on symbolism and description, and narrative poetry is no different. Try incorporating your five senses into your poem: what can you and your characters see, smell, taste, touch, and hear? [9] X Research source For example, in “The Fish,” Elizabeth Bishop describes a fish’s skin as “ancient wallpaper” and eyes as “tarnished tinfoil.” These descriptions help us as readers see what the narrator sees, putting us into the story."

      "title": "Strike your reader’s heart with repetition.",
      "content": "Strike your reader’s heart with repetition. One of the many advantages of telling a story through narrative poetry is that you can convey deeper emotions and feelings with poetic devices. Repeating phrases, words, and sounds appeals to the eye and ear and evokes emotion. Try adding alliteration, assonance, and consonance to your narrative poem to keep readers engaged and stress the importance of your message. [10] X Research source For example, in Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Raven,” the phrase “nothing more” is repeated as an allusion to the narrator’s deteriorating mental state. [11] X Research source Alliteration is the repetition of beginning stressed sounds through a series of words, like “swift, slow, sweet, sour.” [12] X Research source Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in the middle of words, such as “leaping” and “deep.” [13] X Research source Consonance is the repetition of words that share a similar sound, like “bed” and “bad.” [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Add dialogue to your narrative poem.",
      "content": "Add dialogue to your narrative poem. Playing with character conversations and dynamics can help you add relatability, charm, and depth to your narrative. There are no general rules for putting dialogue in poetry, but it is important to stay consistent. Choose whether you want speech to be in italics or quotation marks and stick to it. This will make it easier for your reader to follow along and stay immersed in the story. [15] X Research source Edmund Spenser chooses to use quotation marks in The Faerie Queene to separate the narrator’s voice from the characters’: “Saying, ‘yet O thou dreaded Dame, I crave / Abide, till I have told the message, which I have.’”"

      "title": "End the poem with ambiguity.",
      "content": "End the poem with ambiguity. You and your friend could read the same poem and come across two different meanings, and that’s the beauty of poetry! Narrative poetry is no different as it can also be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the reader’s experiences and current emotions. Try ending your poem with open possibilities. Maybe the hero’s world goes black, and it’s uncertain if they’re dead or unconscious, or perhaps the sun sets to represent an end or a new beginning. Robert Frost’s narrative poem “The Road Not Taken” is famously known for having two interpretations: the speaker consciously makes a choice or fate led him down a particular path. Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s short story “The Yellow Wallpaper” also receives multiple interpretations; this prose example has been defined as a ghost story, exploration of mental illness, or combination of both."

Thankfully, narrative poetry has been around for centuries, so there are plenty of poems out there!

      "content": "Carry a notebook with you wherever you go. Inspiration for your narrative poem can strike from anywhere at any time. Start a writing journal to jot down notes and keep all your ideas in one place. Try keeping a small notebook and pen in your bag or making a folder for “poem ideas” in your phone’s notes app. [16] X Research source Take notes on whatever inspires you throughout the day. Maybe that’s a sunset, graffiti, or the smell of rain on pavement. Your notes don’t have to be detailed. Try jotting down a single word or even doodling an image—whatever will jog your memory later."

      "title": "Write the poem as prose first.",
      "content": "Write the poem as prose first. If you're stuck on rhyme scheme, meter, and line breaks, try getting your story out without the poetic logistics. [17] X Research source Record yourself telling your story out loud or write it as a short story . This can help you find the narrative of your piece first, making it easier to convert everything to stanzas and lines later on. Prose generally refers to literature that's written in a straightforward manner that follows typical grammatical guidelines. [18] X Research source Basically, anything that isn’t written in verse is considered prose, such as short stories, essays, and books."

Push those worries and fears aside by immersing yourself in your story. [19] X Research source Remember, there’s no right or wrong way to write poetry. Instead of sticking to a certain format or style right away, just let the words flow. Even the most famous poets will tell you that their best work didn’t happen overnight. It takes work and revision, but the best thing you can do is simply write."

Inspiration and new ideas will strike again in no time. Letting a poem sit for a while and even working on something else can allow you to return to it with a fresh perspective. Try going for a walk, listening to music, or reading on your break to get those creative wheels turning."

[28] X Research source Like other narrative poetry subgenres, a verse novel combines prose and poetic conventions; however, it's a subgenre of narrative poetry that doesn’t haven’t specific themes or literary devices outside of structural choices. Verse novels are strictly composed of verse and the length of a book. The characters, points of view, chapters, and dialogue are written in a prose-like manner but confined to a stanza or free verse. Here are some verse novel examples: Elizabeth Barret Browning’s Aurora Leigh Homer’s The Iliad Derek Walcott’s Omeros A stanza is a group of lines separated from others in a poem.
