Wrap your inflamed skin with the cold compress for at least 15 minutes 2 to 3 times daily or as needed. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Cold compresses are one way to help relieve the itching and/or burning sensation that eczema causes. [2] X Research source Cold compresses can also reduce the inflammation of the blisters and help numb the irritated nerve endings that are generating pain. To make the cold compress last a little longer, place crushed ice in a small plastic bag and wrap it with a soft cloth before applying it to your skin. Avoid soaking your inflamed hands or feet in ice. This may give you temporary relief, but it can cause shock to your blood vessels and lead to frostbite."

Soak a piece of cloth or gauze in the solution, then wrap it around the affected area. Then, cover the entire thing with another dry piece of cotton fabric or more gauze. Wear the wrap for at least 3 hours or overnight. Talk with your doctor before trying this method. People suffering from eczema often have elevated pH levels, so applying apple cider vinegar to the affected areas can help balance out your skin’s pH. Alternatively, soak the affected area in witch hazel to help get rid of itchiness. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cedars Sinai Hospital Website of one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

      "content": "Apply aloe vera to reduce inflammation. Apply aloe vera gel multiple times per day for the first few days after you notice redness and irritation on your hands or feet. Aloe vera gel has a strong ability to soothe irritated, itchy skin and reduce tenderness caused by dyshidrotic eczema. It also significantly speeds up the healing process of any wounds on your skin. [4] X Research source Aloe vera also has antimicrobial properties, which is helpful if your eczema is triggered or made worse by fungal or bacterial infections. Aloe vera contains polysaccharides (complex sugars) that help to hydrate the skin and keep it moisturized. It can also trigger the production of collagen, which gives skin its elasticity. If you have an aloe plant in your garden, break off a leaf and apply the thick inner gel or juice directly to your irritated skin. For the best effect, place the aloe vera gel in the refrigerator and apply it after it’s chilled for a bit."

      "content": "Apply colloidal oatmeal to soothe irritated skin. Surprisingly enough, oatmeal is another home remedy that’s great for treating dyshidrosis. Add just enough water to the oatmeal powder until it forms a paste. Apply the paste directly to your skin and let it set until it dries. Rinse it off with some running water, but do so gently since oatmeal also acts as a mild exfoliator and you don't want to further irritate your skin. Oat extract contains compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, which are helpful in soothing itching.

[6] X Research source Make your own colloidal oatmeal by pulverizing a handful of instant or slow-cooking oatmeal in a blender until it turns into a fine powder. Oatmeal that is finely ground mixes with water much better. Use the paste right away after you’ve made it and throw it out once you’re done. Oatmeal ferments very easily, so you risk bacteria growing in your paste if you leave it sitting out for too long."

      "content": "Keep your skin moist by applying thick ointments or creams. Heavy ointments such as petroleum jelly , mineral oil, or vegetable shortening are commonly recommended for eczema because they hold moisture in the skin and provide protection from potential irritants. [7] X Research source Alternatively, creams such as Eucerin and Lubriderm are thicker than most lotions and may also be similarly helpful. You will have to reapply these more often than ointments since your skin absorbs them more quickly. [8] X Expert Source Mohiba Tareen, MD FAAD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 26 March 2020. Moisturize your skin throughout the day, particularly after taking a bath or shower, to keep water sealed in and to prevent skin dryness/cracking. If the eczema is particularly itchy and irritating, apply some hydrocortisone cream . Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (less than 1%) is helpful for quickly reducing pain and swelling.

Spending at least 15 minutes in a cool bath on a regular basis can actually help to hydrate your skin. [12] X Research source On the other hand, when you bathe or shower in hot water, you’re removing more of the natural oils that protect your skin. This causes your skin to dry out and become irritated much easier. [13] X Research source Apply moisturizer to your skin each time you come into contact with water to improve your skin’s hydration and strengthen the skin’s barrier. Buy a shower nozzle filter that filters out chemicals that can irritate the skin, such as chlorine and nitrites. Add ½ cup (118 ml) of household bleach to a full tub of water and soak yourself in the tub for up to 10 minutes. Rinse off when you’re done.

Avoid scrubbing your skin too vigorously with a washcloth or loofa when washing the spots affected by eczema.

If your dyshidrotic eczema is quite severe and involves lots of fluid-filled blisters, don't pick at them or squeeze them. Instead, go see your doctor to get them properly treated. The doctor will likely apply some antibiotic cream and dress the blisters properly with sterile bandages. This limits the risk of infection, minimizes scarring, and promotes healing. If the blisters are relatively big, your doctor may drain them first. [22] X Research source Your doctor may treat you right away or refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist). Change the bandages daily (or immediately if they accidentally get wet or dirty). Remove them carefully to minimize skin irritation. When the blisters do break open, apply an antibiotic ointment to the area and cover loosely with another clean bandage. Your doctor may also consider other potential causes of your skin condition.

Ask your doctor about getting a prescription if your symptoms are especially severe. Long-term side effects of corticosteroid therapy include thinning of the skin, water retention (edema), and compromised immune responses. [25] X Research source Prednisone is stronger than cortisone and is often the better choice for eczema. It decreases skin inflammation by reversing the size of capillaries beneath the skin and suppressing the immune system's inflammatory response. After applying the cream, wrap the area in plastic wrap to help the cream absorb into your skin and help blisters disappear quicker.

Immune system-suppressing creams and ointments, such as the topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel), may also be helpful for severe eczema—particularly for people who want to avoid the side effects of corticosteroids. [27] X Research source These medications suppress the body's immune response to the irritant that causes eczema, which means less inflammation, redness, and itchiness. [28] X Research source These drugs can increase the risk of skin infections and even skin cancer, so your doctor will likely only recommend them as a last resort. Immunosuppressant creams and ointments are not appropriate for children and pregnant people.

While you might think that Botox is just for getting rid of wrinkles, a study showed that 3 patients who had been diagnosed with neurodermatitis eczema experienced less itching after 1 week of receiving a Botox injection. Within 2 to 4 weeks, their patches of neurodermatitis had cleared. [29] X Research source Neurodermatitis and dyshidrosis are different types of eczema with slightly different symptoms.

      "content": "Inquire about phototherapy to help strengthen your skin. If other treatments aren't effective for your eczema, your doctor may recommend a kind of light therapy that combines exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light with certain drugs. This helps make your skin more receptive to UV radiation. [30] X Research source Phototherapy appears to work by increasing vitamin D production in the skin and killing any causative microorganisms on the skin. This results in reduced inflammation, less itching, and faster healing in about 60 to 70% of people. [31] X Research source For treating skin conditions, narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) light is the most common type of phototherapy. Broadband UVB phototherapy, PUVA (Psoralen and UVA) and UVA1 are other forms of phototherapy that are sometimes used for treating eczema. Phototherapy avoids the UVA portion of sunlight, which is very damaging to the skin and can accelerate aging and increase the risk of skin cancers."
