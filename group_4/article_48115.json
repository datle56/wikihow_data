      "content": "The 🙌 emoji represents celebration and positive vibes. The 🙌 emoji depicts someone raising their hands high over their head. This gesture is common when you see someone rooting the home team on, or praising someone. In fact, this emoji originally meant “give me ten!” as in two high-fives. You might see it used like this: “I just heard you got the gig!! Congrats! I’m so excited for you 🙌.” “You crushed that presentation 🙌!” “I know you start freshman year this week. Are you amped? I can’t wait to see what you do next 🙌!!!”"

      "content": "In fringe cases, a 🙌 emoji can represent momentum or high energy. The little lines at the top of the raised hands emoji indicate motion. Since there are relatively few emojis that are stylized this way, you can use the raised hands emoji to emphasize how hype you are, or to convey energetic movement. For example: “It’s time to get up! Where are you? I’m trying to go 🙌.” “I got up 🙌 and I turned up 💯.” “LET’S GOOOO 🙌 🙌 🙌”"

You can also use this emoji to showcase some grace and humbleness. You could say: “😔🤲. I need some help…I hate to ask, but can you cover my lunch today?” “I hate to do this, but can I maybe hitch a ride to work this week? 🤲” “I could use some $ if you got paid this week 🤲. I promise to pay you back 😊!”"
