      "content": "Use a TikTok viewer site. A TikTok viewer website allows you to look at TikTok videos without being logged in or having the app installed. These sites have limited functionality, and you might not be able to easily navigate to other TikToks (for example, you might not be able to click on someone's profile to see all of their videos). Here are some of the best TikTok viewers: UrleBird : The homepage of this site has a ton of popular TikToks to watch, or you can specify a creator's username or a TikTok's hash number. Picuki : Picuki will let you view individual TikToks by pasting the URL into the search bar on the website. It will also let you download TikToks. Trollishly : Trollishly allows you to search for a user and view all of the TikToks on their account."

      "content": "Edit the TikTok link if it won't play. If you get sent a TikTok link that won't play in your browser, you can fix it by removing parts of the URL. This especially works for users on mobile when viewing a TikTok in their browser just opens the App Store or Google Play Store instead. Open the TikTok link in your browser. Click or tap on the address bar. Remove everything in the URL after and including the question mark (?). Press Enter to visit the link again. The TikTok should play in your browser without issue."

      "title": "Go to watchwithout.com.",
      "content": "Go to watchwithout.com . WatchWithout isnâ€™t a traditional TikTok viewer, but it lets you easily watch TikToks in your browser. One advantage to using WatchWithout over just going to TikTok directly is that it bypasses TikTok's notifications to sign up or complete a CAPTCHA to view the video. You must first open the TikTok URL in your browser and copy that link to paste into WatchWithout. WatchWithout won't open the shortened TikTok links shared from the mobile app."

      "title": "Check other social media sites for TikTok reposts.",
      "content": "Check other social media sites for TikTok reposts. TikTok videos are often reposted to other social media sites, either by the creator or by other people. You can usually find TikTok reposts quite easily by just looking through the short-form video sections of these sites, but you may need to search for specific keywords (such as TikTok, for example). You could also search for your favorite TikTok creators to see if they've reposted their own TikToks on these sites. You can tell if a video is a TikTok repost because it will have the TikTok logo in the corner of the video. The social media sites that are popular for TikTok reposts are: YouTube: The Shorts button is on the sidebar of YouTube's website and in the bar at the bottom of the screen on YouTube's app. Instagram: The Reels button is on the sidebar of Instagram's website and in the bar at the bottom of the Instagram app screen. Facebook: The Video button is on the sidebar of Facebook's website and the bar at the bottom of the screen on Facebook's app. After clicking on the Video option, you can sort by Reels by clicking the Reels button on the sidebar (website) or top bar (app). Twitter/X: Twitter doesn't have a specific filter that will only display videos. You can try searching some keywords and going to the Media tab, or look for Twitter accounts that only repost TikToks."

      "title": "Consider watching other short-form content.",
      "content": "Consider watching other short-form content. The TikTok short-form video formula has been emulated with YouTube Shorts and Instagram/Facebook Reels . While many TikToks are reposted as Shorts or Reels, you can also find original content that isn't from TikTok at all. Many Shorts and Reels creators follow similar trends as TikTok creators, so there's a good chance you'll find something you like to watch. Some TikTok creators might post exclusive content to their YouTube Shorts or Instagram/Facebook Reels, so try finding your favorite TikTok creators on these platforms to see if you can find new or special content."
