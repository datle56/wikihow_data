      "content": "Stressful circumstances Everyone experiences stress from time to time, but many are unaware of how much it impacts quality of life. When you experience stress, your nervous system responds by sending a surge of adrenaline and cortisol through your body, also called the fight-or-flight response. When your stress is ongoing (like it often is in the modern world), your body is continually in this state, which makes it difficult to navigate life and make decisions.

Some conflict is normal and even healthy in relationships, but navigating contentious and troubling relationships can seriously affect how you feel, the way you react to things, and the decisions you make in your life. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Difficult relationships can also cause you to isolate yourself, and going it alone isn’t easy. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Leah Morris, life and relationship coach, recommends “assessing what it is about the relationship that's making it negative. Then, have an open dialogue with that person. If that’s not possible, focus your energy on relationships that are more positive and have a better impact on your life.”"

      "content": "Lack of self-care Many people believe self-care is an indulgence rather than a need. Others get so busy with their relationships, careers, families, and hobbies that they simply don’t have time for consistent self-care. Whatever the reason, the end result is the same–you have no outlet to process stress in a healthy way. Stressors start piling up, your well-being tanks, and life feels overwhelming. [4] X Research source If you’re just starting to explore self-care , you might try things like meditating , visualization exercises, getting higher quality sleep , keeping a journal, and improving your diet."

Food, water, clothing, healthcare, and shelter all cost money, so if you’re struggling financially, it can also feel like you’re struggling just to survive.

Even when things are going relatively well, a support system can be a major source of encouragement, stability, and positivity in life.

Over time, these harmful ways of thinking become automatic and habitual, and they can make it hard to feel good about yourself, make decisions, and progress in life. [9] X Research source Clinical psychologist Dr. Elisha Goldstein explains that, “the higher our emotions, the more convincing our thoughts feel. That's why with anxiety and depression, where we have negative thinking or worries, the [negative] thoughts seem so real.”"

      "content": "Low self-esteem Poor-self esteem can negatively impact you in so many ways–you might devalue yourself, feel unable to set and achieve goals, fear rejection, and question your abilities. When you’re in this state of mind, nothing in life feels easy or good. It can be a lonely feeling, but so many people struggle with low self-esteem–you are not alone. Poor self-esteem is also something you can actively improve. [10] X Research source Reciting affirmations is an easy way to boost your confidence. Look at yourself in the mirror and say the words aloud for the biggest impact. You can also leave sticky notes with your favorite affirmations on your mirrors, doors, or devices."

      "content": "Clarify your values to help you figure out next steps. Spend some time thinking about what’s truly important to you. [15] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source According to life and relationship coach Leah Morris, “So often when we're feeling stuck, it's because our values and life have changed and we haven't caught up to what those are. We're using the old ways of doing things when we need to reassess and recognize what's important to us so that we can move forward in a better way.” Try listing your life goals to discover your personal values . Be as clear as possible. Ask yourself questions like: What do you want to be in life or your career? What do you hope to accomplish? What experiences do you hope to have? How do you want to spend your time? For example, if having a closer relationship with your partner is important to you, you might reassess your current work-life balance. Reducing how much overtime you work during the week and scheduling a date night with your partner every weekend would give you more chances to bond. If physical fitness is a meaningful goal for you, look for new ways to fit workouts into your schedule. You could go for a power walk every night after dinner instead of turning on Netflix or the news. Or consider finding a job closer to home so you aren't spending 2 hours a day commuting–then, use that extra time to hit the gym. Reader Poll: We asked 196 wikiHow readers what advice regarding setting goals they find most helpful, and only 7% of them said telling other people about their goals so they can support them. [Take Poll] Sharing your goals with others can be a great way to hold yourself accountable, but you can still achieve your goals while keeping them private."

      "content": "Change your perspective to help you adjust. Identify the habits and thought patterns that are currently holding you back and preventing you from thriving. How can you adjust them to change your perspective ? Try to take a step back and look at things objectively, then reframe your hardships and question self-defeating thoughts to create new narratives. [16] X Research source Ask yourself questions like: Are my thoughts about this actually true? What steps can I take right now to potentially change the situation? Is there a lesson I can learn from this at the end of the day? For example, if you get turned down for a promotion, you might tell yourself that you didn't deserve it because you're bad at your job. Do the facts back that up, though? Your most recent performance review was positive and your boss said that a promotion just wasn't in the budget right now. Instead of assuming you're the problem, ask your boss about the possibility of a future promotion and how to secure it. If your boss won't commit, perhaps it's the perfect time to take your talent elsewhere. Life coach Taylor Rochestie says, \"When adversity hits, a lot of people turn to a reactive type of emotion, or reactive type of feeling. You can change that to have a proactive or active type of response because adversity will come, and it's something that you can prepare for. I believe that adversity gives us our best chance to inspire, and helps to define who we are.\""

      "content": "Develop healthy coping strategies to deal with stress. Instead of internalizing your stress or trying to power through it, make it a point to deal with it head-on. First, identify what's causing your stress and take steps to change it (if you can). Make time to get regular exercise, which can boost your mood and give you more energy. Spending time on your hobbies can be a great way to decompress and take your mind off things. Explore relaxing activities like meditation, mindfulness, and yoga that you can turn to in times of stress. [17] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Coping strategies aren't one size fits all–it can take a little experimentation to figure out what works best for you. That said, simple changes like prioritizing sleep and eating a healthy diet will always net positive results."

Try to set aside 5 minutes a day to jot down 3 things that you’re grateful for. Be as specific as you can. If making a list doesn’t work for you and you’d prefer something long form, try starting a gratitude journal . [18] X Research source Life coach Taylor Rochestie says, \"I like to believe what you seek is what you'll find. If you're actively seeking ways to be thankful, your mind is filled with positive types of feelings, positive emotions, positive thoughts, and positive words.\""

First, try to remember that comparison is the thief of joy. Everyone is unique and that's a good thing. Second, everyone has problems! Many people choose to keep their struggles private, and this is doubly true on social media. People tend to broadcast the good stuff and omit the bad, so social media is not a true depiction of their lives. [19] X Research source Other folks have excellent coping strategies in place to help them deal with obstacles, so they may seem perpetually unbothered on the outside (despite having problems). Working on your own coping skills can help a lot. Many people believe that life gets harder as you age, but studies show that the opposite is true. Older individuals report feeling less negative emotions and more positive ones than younger people. Their life satisfaction is higher, as well.
