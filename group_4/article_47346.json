[3] X Research source Simply apply the treatment directly to the stain and allow it to soak according to the instructions on the product of your choice. This is especially important for throw blankets you usually place on your couch, as they can easily get stained from any snacks or drinks you might have consumed while using them. If you’re worried about discoloration, perform a small patch test with the stain remover on an unnoticeable area of the blanket. If the color doesn’t change, you should be good to go."

If you’re using a top-loading washer with a center agitator, coil the blanket around the agitator, making sure that the weight of the blanket is distributed evenly in the drum. [4] X Research source If you’re using a front-loading washer, simply place your blanket inside the drum evenly without balling it up. If your blanket is too big to fit inside your washer comfortably, it’s best to hand wash it instead. Overstuffing the drum can cause damage to your washer and your blanket. To avoid having an unbalanced load, it’s best to wash blankets alone, so don’t toss any other laundry items in with your blanket. [5] X Research source"

Mix in mild detergent and let it spread through the water. You'll essentially be doing the same thing as a washing machine on a gentle setting, only manually, which gives you greater control over how the blanket is treated and helps ensure that every part gets clean.

[10] X Research source You may need to drain and refill the tub with fresh water a few times until it remains clear after rinsing. When the water runs clear, this means there’s no more detergent left in your blanket. Rinse at least twice when washing your blanket by hand.

Start by brushing or scraping away any solid debris on the blanket, like food or dirt, with your hands or a paper towel. [11] X Research source Next, spread your blanket out on a clean, flat surface, with the soiled area facing upward. Mix a few drops of mild detergent into a small bowl or container filled with tap water. This mixture will be your cleaning solution. Dip a clean cloth into the solution, then gently work it into the stain until it is wet and saturated. Wet another clean cloth with plain water, then press it into the area to rinse out the detergent. Repeat this process, if needed, until the soiled area looks fully cleaned.

      "content": "Wash comforters on their own and use cool temperatures. Ali recommends washing comforters in cold or lukewarm water (never hot water!) and avoiding harsh products like bleach. Since comforters are so big, Dulude adds that they should be washed by themselves, without any other clothing or bedding items in the load. Ali cautions against stuffing a comforter into a washing machine that’s too small. “If it doesn’t fit, don’t try to force it because that could damage it.” In this case, it’s probably best to take the comforter to a dry cleaner to be professionally cleaned. Ali also recommends air drying comforters because this “will retain the quality of the comforter a lot better than putting it in the dryer, and it will keep the inside of the comforter from clumping up or knotting.” If you must use the dryer, Ali says to “use it at the very lowest setting possible, and do it for the least amount of time.”"

      "content": "Wash plush blankets in cool temperatures and small amounts of water. If you’re washing a soft, plush blanket , Ali has some rules of thumb to follow. He recommends using “the least amount of water required,” and he also states that “the complete elimination of heat is a must.” In other words, it’s best to wash the blanket in cold water, set your washer’s water-fill setting to a smaller load, and dry the blanket on a fluff or air-dry setting with no heat. You can also air dry the blanket if you have the time. Another surprising tip is to avoid fabric softeners altogether. “If you use fabric softener, you’ll feel the residue,” Ali explains. “It’s harder to get the residue off of a push blanket.” In other words, fabric softener will actually make your plush blanket feel less soft, so go ahead and leave it out."

Cotton and linen blankets tend to be more durable than wool, knit, or plush blankets, so they can withstand machine washing well.

[14] X Research source Since wool can be a bit more delicate than other materials, you’ll likely need to use a short, delicate, cold-water cycle on your washing machine. You can also wash the blanket by hand to be safe. Either way, make sure to use a gentle, wool-safe laundry detergent , rather than a harsher heavy duty product. [15] X Research source Similarly, wash cashmere blankets by hand with lukewarm water and a gentle detergent. You might even want to consider purchasing specially formulated cashmere shampoo , instead of detergent, to be extra safe. [16] X Research source It’s also best to line dry your wool and cashmere blankets rather than machine drying them. [17] X Research source"

Knit and crochet blankets can be pretty delicate, so it’s best to put them in a mesh laundry bag before washing them in your washing machine. Laundry bags prevent the blankets from stretching out or snagging on anything in the wash. [18] X Research source You’ll also want to choose a delicate, gentle wash cycle, cold water, and mild detergent. Air drying a knit blanket is best, but don’t hang it up; lay it flat to dry instead. If you hang a knit blanket, it’s more likely to stretch out or become misshapen. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash small weighted blankets at home, and let dry cleaners handle large ones. Weighted blankets contain a filling element, such as beads or pellets, and they tend to be pretty heavy. Because of this, many weighted blankets will need to be washed professionally by a dry cleaner, especially if they weigh 20 pounds or more. You may be able to wash smaller weighted blankets in your washer at home, but only if the care label states that it is machine-washable. You’ll usually need to use a gentle cycle, cold water, and mild detergent. [20] X Research source Wash weighted blankets on their own, without any other clothing or bedding items. If the care label states that it’s safe to put your blanket in the dryer, use the lowest heat setting, check on the blanket periodically to fluff it, and make sure it doesn’t bunch up. If you air-dry the blanket, lay it out flat and turn it over every 4 hours to speed up the drying process. It will usually take 24-48 hours for a weighted blanket to air dry.

      "content": "Set the dryer to a low heat setting. When using a dryer to dry your blanket, keep the heat setting between low and medium. Higher heat might shrink the blanket or cause synthetic materials like polyester to scorch. If you're drying a down or wool blanket, set the dryer to tumble (without heat). [24] X Research source Because it uses no heat, tumble drying takes longer and should only be used if you're worried about damaging a natural fabric. Cotton and synthetics are resilient fabrics, which makes them totally dryer-approved (just watch out for high heat on synthetics, as they're prone to burning after a while)."

If your blanket is of heavy construction or has been washed and dried many times, it should be okay to let it go through a full drying cycle at low heat. Dry delicate or loosely woven blankets in short bursts, and keep an eye on the blanket's material as it dries. Set the dryer's timer for the desired time, or else monitor the blanket throughout the drying process. [25] X Research source Tumble drying a delicate blanket might take hours. Reset the dryer at the end of a tumble cycle and repeat until the blanket is no longer damp. Overdrying can cause shrinkage or damage. Choose the appropriate time for the blanket you're drying and give it a feel from time to time when machine drying for longer periods."

In most cases, it's preferable to allow blankets to finish air drying—this will help instill a fresh fluffiness in the blanket as the remaining moisture dissipates and spare you the grief of dealing with shrinking, scorching, stretching, and static. Smooth the blanket out by hand, then either hang it from a clothesline or drape it over something broad and flat. Let the blanket hang until it's completely dry. [26] X Research source A drying rack or ironing board can be useful for draping a drying blanket if space for a clothesline is unavailable to you. Turn the blanket over periodically to expose both sides to direct airflow."

      "title": "Press out any remaining water.",
      "content": "Press out any remaining water. If you decide to air dry your blanket after washing it, be sure that you've first removed as much moisture from the blanket as you can. This process will save you a lot of drying time. Make sure to press the blanket rather than wringing or bunching it. You can even sandwich the blanket between two clean, dry towels, roll the whole thing up, and apply pressure to it to press out as much water as possible."

    {
      "title": "Hang the blanket.",
      "content": "Hang the blanket. Using a clothesline or ironing board, straighten and suspend the blanket so it can begin to dry. Hang drying works best when it's done outside, due to the movement of the air, but you can also turn on a fan or let the blanket hang overnight if you need to dry the blanket inside. Smooth out all wrinkles and folds before hanging the blanket, or else the blanket will crease and dry unevenly. Make sure the blanket is completely stretched out when hang drying. Greater surface area means faster, more thorough drying. Wool, silks, linens, and any blankets with loose weave-work, like crochet, should always be hung and allowed to air dry. Air drying is the gentlest way to treat easily damaged fabrics and will help protect them for many more washings and drying."

If you have pets, however, you may need to up the frequency to once per month. [27] X Research source For blankets you use every night on your bed, it’s usually best to wash them weekly or every other week. [28] X Research source Comforters should be washed every 1-3 months.
