      "title": "Address any large problems.",
      "content": "Address any large problems. Before removing individual locks and small knots, look for any locks that have joined together and any large matted sections at the root. Gently pull these areas apart using your hands. Work as close to the scalp as possible while doing this. If you cannot remove these tangles without severely breaking your hair, it's best to wait until you work on the smaller locks before removing these large knots."

      "title": "Soak your locks for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak your locks for 10 minutes. Fill a sink or basin with warm water and lean back, submerging your locks completely. Let your locks soak for a full 10 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash the locks with shampoo.",
      "content": "Wash the locks with shampoo. Work small amounts of detangling or degreasing shampoo into each section of each lock. Wash each lock with hot water, as well. The water should be as hot as you can make it without burning yourself. The hot water and shampoo should help melt any wax and grease that has built up. Thoroughly rinse the shampoo out of your locks before continuing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Work conditioner into each lock.",
      "content": "Work conditioner into each lock. Apply small amounts of conditioner to each section of each lock. Rub the conditioner into each lock using your fingers. Do not rinse the conditioner out of your locks at this point. If necessary, you can wrap your hair in a towel to keep it out of your face until you are ready to continue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gently pick apart one lock from the bottom.",
      "content": "Gently pick apart one lock from the bottom. Use a metal comb to pierce the bottom of the lock and work apart the knots there. Gradually work your way up the entire length of the lock in the same manner. A tail comb is easiest to use. You can use the tip of the tail to pierce the bottom of your lock. If you're using a regular comb, you will need to work the teeth of the comb into the bottom of the lock. After inserting the comb into the lock, gently pull it apart using the comb and your fingers. Don't be afraid to apply a significant amount of pressure. If the locks are too tough to unravel, work more conditioner and warm water into the hair before trying again."

    {
      "title": "Comb out the loosened portion periodically.",
      "content": "Comb out the loosened portion periodically. After you pull apart 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so, comb through the top of the loosened section down to the very bottom. Repeat this step for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) you unravel. Removing the tangles and shed hair throughout the unraveling process will lead to fewer problems than waiting until the very end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat with the remaining locks.",
      "content": "Repeat with the remaining locks. After you unravel one lock, repeat the same process with the remaining locks. Work on each lock one by one until all of them have come undone. If you have difficulty working the locks apart with a comb, you might find it easier to do so with a metal knitting needle or long sewing needle. When using a needle, slip the point into a loop near the edge of the dread and carefully pull the loop out. Repeat as needed along the length of the lock. This can take a long time to do, but it's totally worth it if you've been wanting to switch up your hairstyle for awhile."

      "content": "Care for your hair well. Your hair will probably look unhealthy immediately after the removal of your locks, but if you wash and condition it regularly, its condition should improve quickly. Use a leave-in conditioner each time you wash your hair for the first week or so. When drying your hair, use a low temperature setting. Straighten your hair with a flat iron to manage any waves or frizz."

      "content": "Examine the locks. The hair closest to your scalp will not be locked yet, so you will need to identify areas of new growth that are still loose. [1] X Research source Most of this new, loose growth can be saved when using this method. Note that older locks tend to be solid closer to the scalp than newer locks. Also note that this process is the quickest way to remove your locks and will usually take an hour or less."

      "title": "Cut the dreads near the root.",
      "content": "Cut the dreads near the root. Cut the locks off one at a time with sharp barber scissors, snipping just above the solid portion of each lock. You will likely have between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) of hair left on your scalp."

    {
      "title": "Wash thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash thoroughly. Once you no longer have any solid dreadlock to deal with, wash your remaining hair well with warm water and shampoo. Rinse well to remove any residue. Apply conditioner to the hair, as well. A deep conditioner can repair damage and make the detangling process more successful. Washing and conditioning your hair now will make it easier to brush and even it out later, so it is strongly recommended that you do this step before you do any further tidying. Do not dry your hair at this point. Do so only after your hair has been brushed and trimmed."

      "title": "Brush it out.",
      "content": "Brush it out. Use a sturdy metal comb to brush out the remaining hair on your scalp, making it as straight as possible. Don't expect your hair to be completely smooth. Frizz is normal, but you need to brush out as many knots and tangles as possible."

      "title": "Tidy it up.",
      "content": "Tidy it up. The remaining hair on your scalp will probably look uneven initially, so you may need to even it out with scissors or clippers. The easiest thing to do is to shave the scalp clean with clippers, but doing so is not strictly necessary."

      "title": "Set aside enough time.",
      "content": "Set aside enough time. This method does not require quite as much time as a full unraveling, but it will be more time-consuming than cutting your locks out. Depending on how many locks you have, how old the locks are, and how much of your hair you intend to keep, this process could take anywhere from 2 to 15 hours."

      "content": "Determine how long to leave the hair. The exact length is yours to decide, but typically, you should plan on saving at least 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) to make this method worth the time. This method works best if you want to keep some of your hair but have locks older than four years. When you've had locks for more than four years, it is best to cut off half of your hair or more before trying to unlock the rest. [2] X Research source"
