      "content": "Pick the right time. According to plant specialist Harmony Corelitz, \"Orchids need to be transplanted every year so they can have a fresh potting medium.\" For most orchids, spring is the ideal time for transplantation, but there are also other factors to consider. Corelitz also suggests \"repotting an orchid when its roots have completely overgrown the pot, when the leaves fall off the plant, or when the roots start to look soft and brown.\" You should also transplant: [1] X Research source After the plant has bloomed and is growing new roots or leaves When it’s not currently flowering or forming new flowers If the pot breaks If the plant becomes infested with bugs If growing medium is wet and not draining properly"

      "title": "Select a suitable pot.",
      "content": "Select a suitable pot. Pot choice for orchids is important, and this includes the size and the style. Transplanting an orchid into a pot that’s too large will force the plant to focus on root growth rather than flowering. Also, for an orchid to survive, it has to be placed in a pot with drainage holes. Plant specialist Harmony Corelitz suggests \"choosing a pot that's just 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) larger than the current one.\" She also advises \"using a pot with drainage holes on the sides, so there will be good airflow and drainage.\" You can use plastic or terra cotta pots for orchids. Terra cotta pots require more frequent watering. Opt for a shallow pot versus a deep one to prevent water buildup."

      "title": "Choose the right growing medium.",
      "content": "Choose the right growing medium. Most orchids don’t grow in the ground like other plants, but instead grow on trees. Because of this, many orchids cannot grow in regular potting soil, and instead need a very loose soil that’s amended with chunks of bark and other organic matter. [2] X Research source According to plant specialist Harmony Corelitz, \"sphagnum moss or a mix of bark\" are good potting mediums. Some other popular mediums for orchids include coconut husk, perlite, fir bark, and mixtures of these."

      "content": "Water the orchid. Before transplanting your orchid, give it some water three days prior to help reduce the shock of transplanting. Don’t give it more water than usual, however. Instead, give it enough to moisten the growing medium it’s currently in.

      "content": "Soak the new medium. Many orchid media are dry, and soaking the medium before transplanting will help it absorb and retain more moisture. To soak the medium: [5] X Research source Fill the new orchid pot with as much growing medium as you'll need to repot the orchid Transfer the medium to a bucket that’s about twice as large as the new pot Fill the bucket the rest of the way with water Let the medium soak for one to two hours Strain the medium through a fine-mesh strainer Pour running water over the medium to remove dust"

      "content": "Sterilize a cutting tool. Once you remove the orchid from its current pot, you'll need a sterilized knife or scissors to trim dead roots and leaves. It’s important to use a sterilized tool to prevent the spread of viruses and diseases. One way to sterilize your cutting tool is by holding it over an open flame until the metal glows red hot. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You can also soak the knife or scissors in a disinfectant, such as iodine or alcohol.

Hold the pot with your other hand, and gently turn the orchid upside down into the hand that’s cradling the plant. If the orchid is clinging to the pot, massage it out by gently wiggling it back and forth. Only cut roots or stems if you cannot gently shake the orchid loose from the pot. If you have to make any cuts, preserve as much of the root or stem as possible. [7] X Research source"

When you’ve removed the bulk of the medium, rinse the roots under warm water to remove the remainder. [8] X Research source Removing all the old medium will ensure that your orchid gets the most nutrients possible when you transplant it, and will make sure any bugs are destroyed."

      "content": "Trim dead roots and leaves. Once your orchid is clean, inspect it carefully for dead leaves, stems, roots, and pseudobulbs. Use your sterilized cutting tool to trim away any roots that are soft and brown, any leaves that are yellowing, and any pseudobulbs that are black and shrivelled. A pseudobulb is a feature on some orchid types. It’s a bulbous growth near the base of the plant that will have a leaf growing from it.

Make sure the plant sits in the new pot at the same depth as it did in the old one, or so that the lowest leaf’s base is a half-inch (1.3 cm) lower than the pot’s rim. [11] X Research source If your orchid is sitting too low, remove the plant and add a layer of medium to the bottom of the pot. For orchids with pseudobulbs, position the orchid so the pseudobulb is at the edge of the pot. For orchids growing from a single major stem, position the orchid in the center of the pot."

Add enough medium so that it comes up to the base of the orchid. When you’ve added all the medium and packed it loosely around the roots, carefully tilt the pot from side to side to make sure the orchid doesn’t flop around. If it does, pack in a bit more medium.

Once the orchid is settled in its new pot, add enough water to soak the medium thoroughly. Over the next few weeks, you may have to water the orchid more frequently until the medium is able to absorb and retain more moisture.
