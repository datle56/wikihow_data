Tape each of these rings together so you have 3 rings lined up next to each other. Next, shove 2 pieces of rebar or stakes into the ground. Slide a noodle over the rebar and tape the 3 rings to it. The rings should be attached to and between the rebar. All that’s left to do is toss a football through the rings and see who has the best aim. [6] X Research source In the end, your DIY game should look like 3 floating rings between the upper part of a goal post. Set the game as far back as you please! If you have younger party guests, maybe only set it 1 foot (0.30 m) away from the throwing line. For older guests, try 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3.0 m)."

Each square is associated with a number from 0 to 9. Before the Super Bowl starts, everyone pays for the squares they want, writing their name in those squares. At the end of each quarter, the square that matches the last number of the team’s score wins that round and the money that went into it. [7] X Research source For example, if the Rams have 41 points and the Bengals have 31, the names in each 1 square win. Print out or create your own squares game.

You can create the bingo cards yourself using free platforms like Canva or Word, or find pre-made cards online by searching “super bowl commercial bingo.”"
