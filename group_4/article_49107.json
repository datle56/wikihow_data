If you have an existing savings account, the principal is the amount of money in the account as of your last account statement. For an existing savings account, log into online banking, check your latest account statement, or contact your bank to determine the current amount in your account."

This number is also referred to as the annual percentage rate (APR) in financial documents. It will be stated on your savings account agreement. For example, a savings account might have an APR of 1.2 percent. Deposit accounts, like certificates of deposits (CDs), use another term, annual percentage yield (APY), to refer to the annual rate. [2] X Research source Make sure you are using the annual rate (the amount of interest paid each year) and not the periodic rate (the amount of interest paid each time the interest compounds each year). For example, an account with interest that compounds quarterly (four times per year) might have a periodic interest rate of 0.3 percent, but an annual rate of 1.2 percent. Remember to use the annual rate in your calculations. For the purpose of calculating compound interest, your rate must be in decimal form. Convert it by dividing your started interest rate by 100. [3] X Research source For example, 1 percent would be 1/100, or 0.01."

[4] X Research source This means that the interest on the account is calculated and paid twelve or four times per year, respectively. Other accounts may be calculated daily, weekly, semiannually, or annually. Look through your account agreement and determine how many times per year the interest is compounded. You will use this number in your calculations for the \"compounding frequency.\" Specifically, use the following numbers: For annual compounding, use 1 (once per year). For semiannual, use 2 (twice per year). For quarterly, use 4. For monthly, use 12. For weekly, use 52. For daily, use 365. [5] X Research source"

The account will earn 1.2 percent interest (r=0.012) compounded quarterly (n=4). You decide to leave the money in the account for ten years (t=10). Using the example savings account, your completed equation would look like this: A = $ 2 , 000 ( 1 + 0.012 4 ) 4 ∗ 10 {\\displaystyle A=\\$2,000(1+{\\frac {0.012}{4}})^{4*10}}"

For a more accurate answer, keep more decimal places in your calculation. Finally, multiply the two remaining numbers to get your future account balance, A. In the example, this would be $2,254.58.

The regular contributions formula shows your the future value of an account earning compound interest that is also regularly increased with additional funds. It is the same formula used for calculating compound interest on a principal amount, plus an additional part for calculating compound interest on regular contributions.

That is, multiply n times the time period in the exponents and divide the annual interest rate, r, by n inside the parentheses. Using the example equation, this would leave you with: A = $ 2 , 000 ( 1 + 0.001 ) 120 + $ 100 ( ( 1 + 0.001 ) 120 − 1 ) 0.001 {\\displaystyle A=\\$2,000(1+0.001)^{120}+{\\frac {\\$100((1+0.001)^{120}-1)}{0.001}}} Your next step is to add the numbers in parentheses (1+0.001 in the example), this gives you: A = $ 2 , 000 ( 1.001 ) 120 + $ 100 ( ( 1.001 ) 120 − 1 ) 0.001 {\\displaystyle A=\\$2,000(1.001)^{120}+{\\frac {\\$100((1.001)^{120}-1)}{0.001}}} After that, solve the exponents by raising the lower number (1.001) to the power of the higher number (120). This yields: A = $ 2 , 000 ( 1.12743 ) + $ 100 ( 1.12743 − 1 ) 0.001 {\\displaystyle A=\\$2,000(1.12743)+{\\frac {\\$100(1.12743-1)}{0.001}}} Subtract the 1 in parentheses. The example equation is now: A = $ 2 , 000 ( 1.12743 ) + $ 100 ( 0.12743 ) 0.001 {\\displaystyle A=\\$2,000(1.12743)+{\\frac {\\$100(0.12743)}{0.001}}} Multiply and divide the two parts separately. Multiply the principal and payments by the decimal figures in parentheses and then divide the payments side by the decimal underneath it. This results in: A = $ 2 , 254.86 + $ 12 , 743 {\\displaystyle A=\\$2,254.86+\\$12,743} Add the final two numbers. Your result is the value of the account after your chosen time period. In the example, this is $14,997.86. Your 1.2 percent annual interest-earning account that compounds monthly will be worth $14,997.86 in ten years if you start with $2,000 in principal and add $100 each month."
