      "content": "See if they’re calm in alarming situations or have a cold “sociopathic stare.” This is because a sociopath can experience events that trigger strong emotions in others without feeling any emotion themselves. [1] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. They're calm, cool, and emotionally absent in situations that may frighten or upset others. If they forget to mimic someone else's emotional response, they might respond with a cold, blank stare. Whenever everyone else is flustered and panicking, but the suspected sociopath doesn't seem concerned, it indicates impaired empathy on their part. Some people are more even-keeled than others, but most eventually display some form of anxiety. Someone who never seems anxious under any circumstances might be a sociopath. The cold, blank stare is called the \"sociopath stare,\" characterized by a frighteningly emotionless look in the sociopath's eyes. If they notice their stare makes people nervous, they might use it for intimidation too."

      "content": "Look for a lack of empathy and remorse towards other people. Individuals with APD cannot understand or relate to another person's feelings, so they don't often recognize when they hurt someone with lies, manipulation, or aggressive behavior. Without the ability to empathize , a sociopath will rationalize and defend their behavior because they don't care that they did something wrong. [2] X Research source Because they don't feel remorse, a sociopath also won't accept any blame when someone confronts them about their behavior. Sociopaths tend to crave power and control over other people and pursue it ruthlessly. Their lack of empathy typically means they have no shame in manipulating people to get their way. It's not impossible for sociopaths to feel a little regret after doing something they know is wrong, like lying or cheating . The difference is that a true sociopath won't let that feeling stop them from doing it again."

      "content": "Watch out for someone superficially charming and persuasive. Sociopaths often turn on the charm when they first meet someone because they want that person to like them and be willing to do them favors. A sociopath will make grand gestures to make someone feel special but change over time. Once a sociopath feels like they can control someone, they'll become cold and manipulative. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source For example, a sociopath might go out of their way to help strangers or be incredibly generous with people they hardly know—while being the total opposite with family and close friends. Sociopaths want to be in control and get their way all the time, but to do that, they need to blend in and charm people into feeling comfortable around them first. That's why they have so much superficial charm. A sociopath's charm is just an act; their behavior is highly polarized, ranging from fake charm to completely antisocial, which means they isolate themselves from others and often experience anger or anxiety."

      "content": "Take note of someone who exploits others using emotional manipulation. Sociopaths tend to target people with insecurities and coerce them to do what the sociopath wants. They also use gaslighting to control other people's choices and actions. Gaslighting is a manipulation tactic that involves undermining someone’s confidence, so they feel like they're the problem or making up problems that don't exist. [4] X Research source For example, a sociopath might tell someone they're being irrational until they believe it's true and start relying on the sociopath to tell them what's real and what's not. If a sociopath is lying to someone, they might try to confuse and manipulate the other person by accusing them of being a liar, deflecting the blame from themselves. Lack of empathy means that sociopaths rarely have any reservations or regrets about manipulating people for their own gain."

      "title": "Look out for someone who lies and deceives repeatedly.",
      "content": "Look out for someone who lies and deceives repeatedly. When a sociopath wants to get their way, they'll lie, distort the truth, and trick others. Sociopaths lie regularly, even about the smallest things—and when caught, they'll backpedal and lie again to cover themselves. Even when forced to confess the truth, a sociopath will pretend to be sorry and fall right back on their old behavior. [5] X Research source For example, a sociopath might promise to get help and never follow through or start making changes for a little while before returning to their old ways. Some sociopaths will go to great lengths to make their lies believable. For example, a sociopath might pretend to go to work every day, even when unemployed. Sociopaths often lie about their pasts, but there are usually inconsistencies in the story. Note anything that doesn't make sense, or if someone who knows the sociopath disagrees with their version of events."

      "content": "See if they only develop superficial or short-term relationships. A sociopath typically won't have many close friends, if any. [6] X Research source They might have a few people they can regularly manipulate or boss around through intimidation but no meaningful connections. Instead, a sociopath will probably leave behind a string of exes, friends they've abandoned or betrayed, and \"frenemies\" who don't really trust them. Look for lack of connection with the past. If the person has virtually no friends from high school, college, or any part of their past life, it could be a red flag. Consider family members, too. If the person isn't in touch with any family members and never talks about them, there may be a problem. Sociopaths have trouble forming healthy relationships because they lack empathy. Building a close bond with them is tough without the ability to understand another person's feelings."

      "content": "Notice if the person has a big ego and delusions of grandeur. Sociopaths often think they're the most important person in the room. They'll be unresponsive to criticism and have an inflated sense of self, believing they can do no wrong. In addition, they tend to have a strong sense of entitlement, assuming that they deserve amazing things without considering anyone else's well-being. [7] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source The sociopath might think they're better than everyone else without evidence of their superiority. A sociopath may also have an unrealistic view of their own abilities, such as believing they are excellent singers or dancers when, in reality, they have almost no skills in those areas."

      "title": "Pay attention to repeated immature and impulsive behavior.",
      "content": "Pay attention to repeated immature and impulsive behavior. Sociopaths rarely learn from their mistakes; subsequently, they don't grow or develop like others. As a result, their behavior may appear highly irresponsible. Sociopaths also make snap decisions that serve their interests without thinking about how their choices affect others. [8] X Research source Examples of immature behavior include: Sociopaths often feel entitled and believe they should have everything they want. When it comes to sharing, they're usually reluctant. Sociopaths can be needy, expecting you to be available whenever they need you. They'll demand your time and energy without thanking you or returning the favor. Sociopaths often struggle to take on any meaningful responsibility. They'll skip work, let someone else do their job, ignore deadlines, and ignore bills due. Impulsive and erratic behavior is one of the main differences between sociopaths and psychopaths. Psychopaths are more controlled and able to plan ahead."

      "title": "Look out for sudden anger, aggression, and even physical violence.",
      "content": "Look out for sudden anger, aggression, and even physical violence. Most people have a wide range of emotions, but sociopaths are prone to anger more than anything else. They're easily irritated and likely resort to yelling and aggressive outbursts when upset. In extreme cases, sociopaths can even get violent and hurt the people closest to them when angry. [9] X Research source If they're challenged or confronted about their aggression and anger, a sociopath will attempt to point the finger away from themselves, hoping that the other person will let it go or even apologize for confronting them. The person may have sociopathic tendencies if, despite their outward calm, they can snap and become violent at any moment, then calm down again soon afterward. This is another big difference between sociopaths and psychopaths; anger is much easier for psychopaths to control, and their behavior is more detached overall."

      "content": "Notice if they take dangerous risks and disregard social norms. Sociopaths don't have much concern for society's moral codes. Consequently, they'll violate unspoken rules that most people follow without question—from minor things like telling a lie or cutting in line to hurting people or breaking the law. They're also thrill-seekers, driven by impulsivity and boredom to find taboo things that excite them.

They might also overindulge in things like food, shopping, and gambling. Sexual promiscuity can also occur when a sociopath doesn't care about social norms. A sociopath in a relationship might have multiple affairs, while an unattached sociopath might overindulge in sex."

They might be harder to ignore if they're a coworker, family member, or part of your friend group, but you can still keep your distance and avoid interacting with them alone. Remember: don't let them make you feel guilty or obligated to stay. The sociopath might figure out that you want to distance yourself and try to reel you in even more. Stay strong and remember what they're really like so you don't fall for their false charm. If possible, don’t tell them that you know they're a sociopath, as that can set off a sociopath's quick temper. Just remove yourself from the situation as quickly as you can."
