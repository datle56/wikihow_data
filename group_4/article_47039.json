[1] X Research source If you do not have the information required by the insurance company, and if this information is not accurate, you may not be able to verify the patient’s insurance. Many factors regarding insurance coverage can change over a short period of time. Things like birth or adoption of a child, marriage, divorce can affect coverage."
