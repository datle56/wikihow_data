      "content": "WYLL means “What You Look Like.” WYLL is a common abbreviation sent over DM, used as shorthand for the question “What do you look like?” People typically send this message to people they don’t know well (like a stranger or acquaintance), in hopes that they’ll get a selfie or picture of the person in response. [2] X Research source Since this question is pretty personal, you’re more likely to see WYLL in your DMs rather than in a comment or reply. WYLL means the same thing across all digital platforms, like TikTok, Roblox, texting, and more."

      "content": "Ask a new online friend or acquaintance what they look like. Maybe you made a new friend on Snapchat, or you’ve been hitting it off with someone you met on TikTok. If you’re really curious to know what they look like IRL, shoot a quick WYLL and see if they send you a picture. Don’t be too disappointed if they refuse to send anything back, though—some people might not be super comfy sending pics to people they don’t know super well. [3] X Research source “WYLL? I’ve only ever seen pics of your cat in your Snap Story lmao” “Tbh I’m so curious wyll”"

      "content": "Poke fun at someone with “WYLL” and an accompanying picture or GIF. Use “WYLL” at the start of your sentence to make fun of how someone is acting/reacting to something. Start off the message with “WYLL…” and then follow up with your silly quip, along with a picture or gif of how you’re imagining them at that moment.

      "content": "Share information about yourself if you feel comfortable doing so. Think about how you feel about the person you’re chatting with. Do you feel comfortable enough sharing something like a selfie with them? If you’ve been sharing some fun vibes with this person (and they haven’t triggered your “creeper” radar), it could be worth sending a quick selfie over. It’s completely fair to set boundaries as well, and let them know that you won’t send them any pics. Them: “WYLL?” You: [picture of yourself] Them: “wyll” You: “Lol I don’t think we’re quite there yet” You can always use a Bitmoji sticker on Snapchat if you aren’t quite ready to send an actual picture of yourself.

      "content": "Choose not to respond if you feel uncomfortable. If you’re chatting with a perfect stranger, a sudden “WYLL” message can be pretty jarring, especially if it’s sent to you right off the bat. Remember—there’s absolutely no obligation to respond to anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable, and no one is automatically entitled to any pictures of you. Pro tip: Your safety and well-being always come first, especially when you’re online. If someone ever makes you uncomfortable, don’t be afraid to block and report their account. If you’re texting someone who makes you feel weird, block their number ."

Let your friend know what you think about the comparison they’ve just made—if all else fails, a quick “LOL” or “hahaha” can do the trick. If you’d like, feel free to throw out an Uno reverse card by sending your own “WYLL” message back at them, making fun of them in an equally goofy way. Them: “WYLL waiting for Matt to text you back” [gif of a person sweating] You: “STOP I feel so called out rn 😭” Them: “WYLL waiting for the Jags to make it to the Super Bowl” [picture of a skeleton] You: “WYLL expecting the Ravens to have a good season” [gif of person putting on clown makeup]"
