In general, you can easily find a conjunction by just looking at your chart to see if planets link up together—they'll look like they're overlapping or right next to each other. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that not everyone has a conjunction in their astrological chart and this is okay! Your chart is as unique as you. If you've had your chart made for you, you might see a conjunction abbreviated as \"con.\""

      "content": "Conjunctions are considered to be easy or favorable aspects. This is because the effects of combining 2 planets' energies usually have positive results. For instance, if you've got a conjunction of the Sun and Mercury, it affects your self-esteem and communication, so your ego and mind are on the same page. This conjunction can make you a powerful communicator. [7] X Research source Sometimes, planets don't work very well together in a conjunction. For instance, the aggressive nature of Mars paired with the contemplative nature of Uranus can cause some unpredictability or volatile behavior. In general, conjunctions show you the positives in your life, especially how you're talented and where your motivations lie."

      "content": "Aspects are the angles between planets on the zodiac wheel. There are five major types of aspects, and they’re split into the categories of “easy” and “hard.” Easy aspects are softer angles thought to possess a positive impact on your life. Hard aspects are sharper angles, and they can create inauspicious or challenging planetary placements. Here are the five major aspects broken down [8] X Research source : Conjunction (soft): Two planets are within approximately 0° of each other on the zodiac wheel. Effect: The planets’ positive and negative qualities get amplified. Sextile (soft): The planets are 60° apart. Effect: Planets will harmoniously co-exist in a sextile. As a result, sextiles typically don’t bring a lot of change or drama to your life. Square (hard): Planets are 90° apart. Effect: The harsh angles of the square can create planetary tension. However, this aspect isn’t inherently negative—sometimes challenges can yield resolution and progress. Trine (soft): The planets are 120° apart. Effect: Trines create harmony, and they’re the most auspicious aspect. If you’ve got one of these in your chart, consider yourself lucky! Opposition: Planets sit opposite each other on the zodiac wheel (or 180° apart). Effect: These two planets will feel distant from one another, creating a set of competing needs and forces. You might need to focus on bringing balance into your life to make the opposition work in your favor."
