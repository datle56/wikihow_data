      "content": "Grip the card correctly. Hold the card parallel to the ground and grip the bottom of the short side of the card on the corner farthest away from you between your index and middle finger, or your middle and ring finger. This is sometimes called \"The Ferguson Grip,\" named after a famous card player. [1] X Research source Alternate finger grips for the basic throw include: For the Thurston grip , place the short side of a card between your middle and index finger so that the side runs parallel with the two fingers all the way through. This is perhaps the most common, if not the most accurate grip on the card. [2] X Research source For the Hermann grip , hold the card between your thumb and your middle finger, letting the index finger reach all the way to the opposite corner. For the Ricky Jay grip , place your index finger on a corner and place your thumb on top of the card with your three remaining fingers along the bottom of the long side of the card. Your thumb on top should be right around on top of your middle finger."

      "content": "Curl the card back into your wrist. The opposite corner of the card (top corner, closest to you) from where you're gripping it should come back and touch the inside of your wrist to cock it for the throw. Most of the power comes from the flick of your wrist, not from arm strength, so it's important to curl it back like this. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Flick your wrist forward. Unwind, keeping your arm as straight and level as possible relative to the ground to keep the card from wobbling side to side, and snap your wrist forward to throw the card. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep it in the wrist.",
      "content": "Keep it in the wrist. There should be almost no arm movement whatsoever when you first start out, to get the mechanics of the spin right. To practice, grab a hold of your arm and practice launching the cards with wrist movement alone. [5] X Research source After practicing and being able to throw cards without missing, you could try moving your arms for extra speed."

      "content": "Grip the card correctly for an overhand toss. How you hold the card for an overhand toss is up to you: you can grip by card by the corner, Ferguson style as with the Frisbee toss, or you can hold the entire long side of a card between your middle and ring finger. Experiment some with different grips to see what works best for you. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Curve your wrist and wind your arm up over your shoulder. To get started, don't put your arm into it, but perform the same basic motion as the Frisbee toss, just having rotated your wrist up and down, rather than side-to-side. When you've gotten used to it, bring the card up beside your head to put more power into your tosses. It's all in the wrist."

      "title": "Snap your wrist forward.",
      "content": "Snap your wrist forward. In one fast, smooth motion, swing your arm over shoulder and step into throw like throwing a baseball. At the end of that motion, curve your wrist out and spread your middle and ring finger slightly, releasing the card."

      "title": "Keep practicing.",
      "content": "Keep practicing. Practice the motion, try to get it as smooth as possible, getting a clean release of the card. Keeping the motion as smooth as possible is the key to getting the card to spin and not cut through the air, rather than floating on it and moving everywhere."

      "content": "Snap your thumb forward rapidly, launching the card. It'll take some practice to get the motion firm enough to send the card, but light enough not to launch off the top several cards. Your thumb should come up off the deck slightly, launching them out and away, rather than down. A bit of wetness on the pad of your thumb should help."
