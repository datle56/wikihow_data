Check to see if the WiFi is working on your computer, your friend’s phone, or some other electronic. If it isn’t, the internet may just be down wherever you are. If you’d like, call your internet service provider to figure out whatever’s going on, but this may just be a waiting game. Before you take any dramatic steps, just confirm that the internet is actually working. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "There might be something blocking the connection. Try relocating so that there’s a clear path to the router. A decent WiFi signal should be able to penetrate thinner walls, but thicker materials can interrupt a connection. [2] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 24 February 2021. Other signals, like radios and microwaves, can interfere with your WiFi as well. If possible, change your location so that you’re in eyeshot of the router. [3] X Research source Set the router on a table or stand so that it isn’t resting directly on the floor. Since routers aren’t mobile and you won’t always be able to sit in front of the router when you’re using the WiFi, consider upgrading your internet or getting a signal extender. If you’re using a public signal, there may be no way to know where the router is located. You can always ask a worker if you’re at a coffee shop or something like that, though!"

      "content": "You could be too far from the router. Since routers have limited range, try getting closer to it. If the router is in the basement and you’re on a third-floor deck, the signal may not simply reach your phone. [4] X Expert Source Luigi Oppido Computer & Tech Specialist Expert Interview. 24 February 2021. If you can, get closer to the router to see if the problem solves itself. Short of getting closer, there are a few things you can do to improve the connection : [5] X Research source Get a signal extender to increase the range of your WiFi. Place the router in a more central location, preferably on the middlemost floor (i.e. if you have a basement and second floor, put the router on the first floor). Keep the area around the router clear, especially when it comes to other electronics."

      "content": "Your phone might be picking up interference from other networks.If there multiple WiFi signals, they may mess with your connection. If you walk down the street, your phone is going to spend some of its energy identifying every open WiFi connection you come across. To fix this on Android, go into your “Settings” and turn off “Smart Network Switch.” On iPhone, go into “Settings,” select “WiFi,” and turn on “Ask to Join Networks.” [6] X Research source At home, you can try changing then router’s band (think of it like switching lanes on a highway). To do this, open a web browser and type your router’s IP address into the address bar. Hit enter and sign into your router. Go to the “Wireless Settings” menu and click the drop down “Channels” menu to change which band you’re on. [7] X Research source Some phones (especially older phones) will not have a setting like this. If you don’t find a menu option for this in your phone, you don’t have it."

Basically, it tells your phone to find the ideal WiFi signal when more than one option is available. If your phone is in between two similar signals, your phone may not be able to make up its mind. Go into “Settings” tap on the “WiFi” menu. Turn off the “WiFi+” to see if your phone’s connection stays consistent. [8] X Research source iPhones don’t have any features that are comparable, so you don’t need to worry about this one if you’re an Apple user."

The option for to reset permissions typically says “Reset Wi-Fi, Mobile, and Bluetooth,” and pressing this may solve your problem. [9] X Research source If it doesn’t, it might be an issue on your router’s side of things. Every router has different procedures for this, so read your router’s manual to see how you change permissions. [10] X Research source Typically, you’ll need to go on to a computer and enter a specific web address to access your router’s configuration page. On there, go to the “Access Control” menu and make sure that “MAC Address Filter” is off. You’ll need your router’s IP address to do this. Type “cmd” in the search bar and enter “ipconfig” in the command prompt to pull up your router’s IP. A majority of the time, the IP will be 192.168.1.1."

Settings on your phone can get screwed up for a variety of reasons, but restarting just might fix whatever the issue was. Hold the power button down on your phone and restart it. Wait for it to turn back on and check to see if the WiFi issue is fixed. [11] X Research source It’s a good idea to just restart your phone every other day or so anyway; when your phone is on for too long, it can cause all kind of issues with the performance. You can also just turn airplane mode on and then off. That basically severs your connection to the cellular network and WiFi, which may fix the problem as well."

If you’ve confirmed the WiFi is working just fine but your phone is still acting up with the WiFi, reset it to the original factory state. Make sure you’ve backed everything up and go into your phone’s settings. Hit the “Restore Phone” or “Reset to Factory Settings” and let your phone totally revert to its original settings.

You can push that in with a paperclip, but it will also reset your router back to factory settings. If you had any hiccups setting the router up originally and you had to manually change any settings to get it to work, it’s probably best not to do this."

Some routers will put out multiple signals (usually one of them is a faster option), and your phone may swap between them automatically. Your phone may also attempt picking up on an older version of your WiFi without asking. Go into your WiFi menu and “Forget” every network you no longer use or need."

If you recently installed an app and you’ve noticed that your WiFi connection is randomly turning on and off, try uninstalling the app (or disabling it manually if you really need it). If you aren’t sure which app is messing with the WiFi, you may need to uninstall multiple apps and then reinstall them one at a time to find the culprit. [15] X Research source This is particularly common with VPN apps, antivirus programs, and “WiFi prioritizer” apps. Unreputable apps and malware can also mess with your phone’s connectivity. If you’re given the option and it won’t interfere with the apps usability, don’t give apps permission to use Wi-Fi in the background when you aren’t actively using the app."
