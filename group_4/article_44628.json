Your doctor may check to see if elevating the testicles will ease your pain, which is referred to as Prehn’s sign. Look for signs of chlamydia and recognize signs of gonorrhea like painful urination or discharge from the penis.

For older men, benign enlarged prostates can play a major role in developing these infections. The bacteria accumulates when the enlarged prostate prevents the bladder from draining properly. Because of this, E.coli or other gastrointestinal bacterial can back up and cause infection. [20] X Research source Medical treatment for this includes Bactrim DS or a quinolone antibiotic. The course of treatment is around 10 days, unless the prostate is involved, which may prolong treatment.

This typically occurs after different kinds of trauma, such as slipping off of a bicycle and hitting the groin. Extreme testicular trauma can twist the spermatic cord, which calls for surgical intervention. This condition affects 3.8% of every 100,000 males under the age of 18 every year. [23] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Early recognition of a high-riding testicle and no Cremasteric reflex is sufficient to warrant surgical exploration. This can help prevent an orchiectomy, which is the surgical removal of the testicle. Even trauma that is not severe can cause swelling, tenderness, high fevers, and frequent and urgent need to urinate. The window from injury to surgery is approximately 4 to 8 hours. This will prevent too much damage to the spermatic cord, which has to be untwisted quickly to avoid removal. Despite this rush to take care of it, orchiectomy rates average 42%. However, a delay in diagnosis may result in orchiectomy and possibly infertility."
