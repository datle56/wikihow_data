If you are giving a presentation, use your hand to highlight a particular paragraph or slide that contains important information. Pointing can be used to literally make a point , or to accompany something like, \"This one's important,\" or \"Let me tell you.\" It can also be used as playful gesture to acknowledge someone. Be careful about pointing directly at someone, though, as this can come off as rude or even aggressive. [2] X Research source Make sure your hand gestures match up to your speech.

      "content": "Use hand gestures to aid in memorization. Just as talking about what you learn helps encode memories more effectively, hand gestures have a similar affect. Research shows that people who gesture while speaking or completing a task, are more likely to make it a memory than those not gesturing. Thus, gesturing while doing a task or speaking can be crucial to the first steps of storing memories away. When you have to memorize something, such as a speech, or directions, teach yourself gestures that go with each important moment. Get in the habit of gesturing while you study. People who are taught gestures to accompany new vocabulary and language are more likely to later recall those words later on by using the gestures they have learnt.

      "content": "Avoid using hand gestures that convey nervousness or diffidence. Even if you think you are comfortable talking to someone, a number of ways you move your body can betray this. Certain hand gestures show nervousness, timidity, and even submissiveness. Hands in your pockets, for example, gives off a signal you may be nervous. Hands crossed in front give off a notion of weakness or timidity as if you are in need of protection. [11] X Research source Squeezing hands together is also a gesture that can convey a \"self-soothing\" gesture that you are nervous or fearful."

      "content": "Don't cause a distraction with your hands. While hands can certainly make you a more effective communicator, and even cause people to be more comfortable around, they can also detract from your ability to communicate effectively. It is recommended keeping your hand gestures in a \"box,\" while talking to others; a space from the top of your chest to the bottom of your waist. What this means is you should keep within certain parts of your body because then it allows people to keep looking at you and what you're saying, rather than trying to track your hands.
