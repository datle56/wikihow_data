      "content": "Understand the definition of the derivative. While this will almost never be used to actually take derivatives, an understanding of this concept is vital nonetheless. [1] X Research source Recall that the linear function is of the form y = m x + b . {\\displaystyle y=mx+b.} To find the slope m {\\displaystyle m} of this function, two points on the line are taken, and their coordinates are plugged into the relation m = y 2 − y 1 x 2 − x 1 . {\\displaystyle m={\\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.} Of course, this can only be used with linear graphs. For nonlinear functions, the line will be curved, so taking the difference of two points can only give the average rate of change between them. The line that intersects these two points is called the secant line, with a slope m = f ( x + Δ x ) − f ( x ) Δ x , {\\displaystyle m={\\frac {f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}},} where Δ x = x 2 − x 1 {\\displaystyle \\Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}} is the change in x , {\\displaystyle x,} and we have replaced y {\\displaystyle y} with f ( x ) . {\\displaystyle f(x).} This is the same equation as the one before. The concept of the derivatives comes in when we take the limit Δ x → 0. {\\displaystyle \\Delta x\\to 0.} When this happens, the distance between the two points shrinks, and the secant line better approximates the rate of change of the function. When we do send the limit to 0, we end up with the instantaneous rate of change and obtain the slope of the tangent line to the curve (see animation above). [2] X Research source Then, we end up with the definition of the derivative, where the prime symbol denotes the derivative of the function f . {\\displaystyle f.} f ′ ( x ) = lim Δ x → 0 f ( x + Δ x ) − f ( x ) Δ x {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)=\\lim _{\\Delta x\\to 0}{\\frac {f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}}} Finding the derivative from this definition stems from expanding the numerator, canceling, and then evaluating the limit, since immediately evaluating the limit will give a 0 in the denominator."

      "title": "Understand the derivative notation.",
      "content": "Understand the derivative notation. There are two common notations for the derivative, though there are others. [3] X Research source Lagrange's Notation. In the previous step, we used this notation to denote the derivative of a function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} by adding a prime symbol. f ′ ( x ) {\\displaystyle f^{\\prime }(x)} This notation is pronounced \" f {\\displaystyle f} prime of x . {\\displaystyle x.} \" To form higher order derivatives, simply add another prime symbol. When derivatives of fourth or higher order are taken, the notation becomes f ( 4 ) ( x ) , {\\displaystyle f^{(4)}(x),} where this represents the fourth derivative. Leibniz's Notation. This is the other commonly used notation, and we will use it in the rest of the article. d f d x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} f}{\\mathrm {d} x}}} (For shorter expressions, the function can be placed in the numerator.) This notation literally means \"the derivative of f {\\displaystyle f} with respect to x . {\\displaystyle x.} \" It may be helpful to think of it as Δ y Δ x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}} for values of x {\\displaystyle x} and y {\\displaystyle y} that are infinitesimally different from each other. When using this notation for higher derivatives, you must write d 2 f d x 2 , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\mathrm {d} ^{2}f}{\\mathrm {d} x^{2}}},} where this represents the second derivative. (Note that there \"should\" be parentheses in the denominator, but no one ever writes them, since everyone understands what we mean without them anyway.)"

Obviously, the power rule makes finding derivatives of polynomials much easier. Before going on, it is important to note that the derivative of a constant is 0, because the derivative measures the rate of change, and no such change exists with a constant."
