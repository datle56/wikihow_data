      "content": "Get a high quality eyelash curler. There are many brands, but some are better quality than others. Use a metal curler rather than a plastic or rubber one. A high quality curler will be made of sturdy metal with rubber pads on the clamps. Plastic or rubber curlers don't get a good enough grip to curl eyelashes well. These also break more easily. Even some metal curlers can be flimsy. Cheaper products won't last as long. Good brands of curlers include Shiseido, Shu Uemura, or Tarte. Whatever brand you choose, make sure your eyelash curler is clean before use."

      "content": "Hold the eyelash curler up to your eye. It might feel cold at first, but you will get used to it. Some people recommend heating the curler with a hair dryer ahead of time. However, you should avoid doing this. A hot eyelash curler can sting or burn sensitive skin around the eyes. There really isn't much benefit to heating the curler. You can get the same effects without doing so."
