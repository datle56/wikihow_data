      "title": "A joint roller is a mechanical device that rolls uniform joints.",
      "content": "A joint roller is a mechanical device that rolls uniform joints. Most joint rollers are small devices that consist of 2 rolling parts. The rolling mechanism helps you make evenly rolled joints quickly. Joint rollers are typically made out of wood, plastic, or metal."

      "title": "Open the joint roller and add a filter on one side.",
      "content": "Open the joint roller and add a filter on one side. Look on the side of the joint roller to identify the rod that shifts positions. Then, turn the roller so the rod faces you and slide it down to open up the machine. Simply place a filter on the far end of either side of the roller. [1] X Research source Most joint rollers come in 3 lengths: 70 mm (2.75 in), 78 mm (3 in), and 100 mm (3.9 in). They make joints that are about the same width as a standard cigarette. Note : Filters aren’t technically necessary. However, they can help improve airflow and give you something to hold onto as you get to the end of the joint."

      "title": "Add an even layer of finely ground cannabis into the roller.",
      "content": "Add an even layer of finely ground cannabis into the roller. Use a grinder to finely grind the cannabis—between 0.5 and 1.5 grams is usually enough. Then, lightly pack it into the joint roller in an even layer between the 2 rods, making sure it doesn’t cover the filter. [2] X Research source Ensure you don’t under or overfill the joint roller with cannabis, as too much or too little airflow can cause it to burn unevenly and make smoking your joint less pleasurable. It may take some practice to find the right balance. If you don’t have a grinder, grind the cannabis with your fingers, scissors, a knife, or a cheese grater."

      "content": "Close the roller and roll both rods towards you for 10 to 20 seconds. Lift up the front rod to close the roller. You may need to press down on the cannabis as you close the roller to keep it in place. Then, use your thumbs and pointer fingers to roll both rods towards you. Apply even pressure as you roll for about 10 to 20 seconds. [3] X Research source Rolling the cannabis helps compact it and form it into a tubular shape. If you overfilled the roller, the excess cannabis may squeeze out of the rods. Simply sweep it off and keep rolling."

Then, stick the rolling paper between the 2 rods. [4] X Research source Note : Make sure you use rolling paper that’s compatible with your joint roller. Most packages list the length and width of the rolling paper on the front of the box."

It should form a tight, uniform roll that burns evenly . If you overfilled your joint, simply roll it back and forth between your fingers to help loosen up the cannabis and improve airflow. If that doesn’t help, you may need to reroll it. If you underfilled your joint, reroll it with a bit more cannabis."

Place a cone tip on one end of the roller with the nozzle facing outwards. Then, place a filter on the opposite end. [7] X Research source Cone rollers work similarly to manual rollers except they form cone-shaped joints. These joints have a slight taper instead of the standard cigarette shape. Adding a cone tip on one end helps create the tapered shape, though they aren’t technically necessary."

[14] X Research source Add enough cannabis so that the trough is completely filled, but not so much that you can’t close the machine. There are also electric cone fillers and injector rollers where you simply add the cannabis and a pre-rolled joint to the machine and press a button to fill it.
