      "title": "If you see one roach, search for hiding spots and signs of infestation.",
      "content": "If you see one roach, search for hiding spots and signs of infestation. With a single roach, there’s a slim possibility that it wandered in from outside. You don’t have to call an exterminator immediately, but take proactive steps to diagnose the scale of the issue: search for possible hiding areas and look for any signs of infestation (roach droppings, eggs, skin casks). Once you see 2 roaches, you have an infestation—contact an exterminator as soon as possible. [1] X Research source Roaches are nocturnal, so you won’t find them when they’re most active. If you see one during the day, get professional help ASAP—it’s usually a sign of overcrowding. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Clean out kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Cockroaches thrive in warm, humid environments, so check inside your kitchen and bathroom cabinets for potential hiding spots. Empty all the shelving for the entire room, and carefully scan for any cracks or holes in the cabinetry. Usually, 80-90% of cockroaches reside in the kitchen or bathroom."

      "title": "Search for cracks and crevices in walls.",
      "content": "Search for cracks and crevices in walls. A cockroach can wedge into an opening that’s only 1 millimeter (0.04 in) to 2 millimeters (0.08 in) thicker than itself, so check if there’s any damage to your walls, window screens, or door frames. When foraging, cockroaches usually gather in corners and travel along the edges of walls, so prioritize the perimeter of your home before inspecting interior walls. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Inspect areas around kitchen appliances.",
      "content": "Inspect areas around kitchen appliances. Cockroaches are attracted to heat sources, so look underneath your refrigerator, dishwasher, and oven to check for a possible infestation. Additionally, focus on places that may have food residue like your utensils, toaster, and garbage disposal."

      "title": "Roach droppings",
      "content": "Roach droppings Cockroach feces look like tiny black specks, similar to scattered coffee grounds, and they’re usually a good indication of the size of the population. [4] X Trustworthy Source Virginia Cooperation Extension Publications and Educational resources from Virginia Tech and Virginia State University Go to source Droppings can be found anywhere in your home, but pay extra attention to areas near food sources. If you see droppings, clean them as soon as possible: roach feces can spread disease, attract other roaches, and trigger allergies.

      "title": "Egg cases",
      "content": "Egg cases Roaches don’t lay eggs one at a time–they lay egg cases. These reddish-brown cases are made of a hard protein, and they look like small, dried out kidney beans, about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) long. [7] X Research source Egg cases typically carry 40 young, and females lay them 1-2 days before hatching. [8] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Search for egg cases around heated appliances such as your oven, fridge, dishwasher, washer, dryer, and water heater. If you find an egg case, stomp on it, vacuum the pieces, and dispose of it in an outdoor trash can. Then, call an exterminator as soon as possible. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Skin casts",
      "content": "Skin casts If you find light brown, cockroach-shaped skins around your home, you may have an infestation. Cockroach nymphs shed their exoskeletons when they reach maturity, which signals a full reproductive cycle within a nest. [10] X Research source"

To trap cockroaches , position glue traps in the corners of the room, behind large appliances, and inside cabinets. [12] X Research source Cockroaches are often caught within 24 hours of placing the traps, but check them daily to determine where the most insects are located. Discard glue traps every 2-3 days by securing them in a plastic bag placed inside your trash can. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Set up a bait station to eliminate an entire roach nest.",
      "content": "Set up a bait station to eliminate an entire roach nest. Bait stations are small plastic units filled with insecticide; cockroaches enter through small holes to retrieve the bait, then share the bait with others. Position bait stations along walls and appliances, and use roach droppings to help you determine other high traffic areas to place them. [14] X Research source Alternatively, purchase gel baits that you can apply under the lip of your countertop or hinges of your cabinet doors."

      "content": "Apply liquid concentrate to control infestations quickly. Liquid concentrate, or liquid roach deterrent, typically deters roaches for 1-2 weeks. Follow the instructions on the concentrate to dilute it properly, and mop a thin layer of solution to surfaces where you’ve seen the most roaches. [15] X Research source Alternatively, use an aerosol can to spray the deterrent into cracks and crevices where roaches enjoy hiding. Since liquid concentrate contains toxic chemicals, avoid using it near children and pets."

Spray it in any crevices to coat and kill roaches that walk through that area. [16] X Research source Insecticide sprays include harmful chemicals, so avoid using them in the kitchen or near children. If you don’t have any spray on hand, mist the cockroaches with rubbing alcohol instead."

      "content": "Sprinkle pesticide dust to dehydrate and kill roaches. Cockroaches get dehydrated when they walk through pesticide dust, so it’s a great option for long-term treatment. Use a bulb duster to apply a thin layer of pesticide dust into any cracks and crevices, especially underneath sinks, corners of cabinets, and along baseboards. [17] X Research source Thin layers of dust are more effective than thick layers, which may clump or cake together. Boric acid is the most common dust treatment, and it’s fairly lower in toxicity than commercial pesticides. [18] X Research source"
