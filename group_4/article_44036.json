Around the age of 35, your dermis (the middle layer of your skin) slows down its production of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid—all the things that keep your skin firm, smooth, and elastic. As your skin loosens, the fat pads underneath your skin can drift downward and make the lower part of your face look larger.

Many dermatologists and plastic surgeons visualize your face as an inverted triangle. When you’re young, your face tends to narrow more as you get down toward the chin. As you age, though, the triangle flips and you start to accumulate more fat and skin on the lower portion of your face, jaw, and neck, making it seem larger or wider."
