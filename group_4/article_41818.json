      "content": "Towels should be clean before stripping, and they can be wet or dry. If your towels are dirty, make sure to run them through the washing machine just like you usually would before you get started stripping them. You can also run them through the dryer if you want, but it's unnecessary. Towels don't have to be dry (since you'll be getting them wet anyway), but they do have to be as clean as possible!

      "content": "The heat of the water can cause the dye in colored towels to run. While stripping doesn't include bleach and works for any color towel, it's best to group whites and dark colors together like normal laundry, to prevent white towels from getting colored. Ensure your tub isn't too full of towels, either—there should be enough room for water to move between and around each item in the load. [2] X Research source If you want to strip a large pile of towels, complete multiple loads instead of overcrowding the tub. Strip towels separately from sheets since they have such different textures. A towel should be stripped with items of the same texture, including other towels, washcloths, and hand towels."

      "title": "Heat the water as high as possible without damaging the towels.",
      "content": "Heat the water as high as possible without damaging the towels. Check the towels' tags if you're unsure how much heat they can withstand, and then turn on the heated water. [3] X Research source Keep it running until you've got roughly the same amount of water you'd use for a bath—a full tub, but not spilling over the sides."

      "title": "Measure out each cleaning chemical and stir it into the water.",
      "content": "Measure out each cleaning chemical and stir it into the water. You’ll need ¼ cup (55 grams) of borax , ¼ cup (55 grams) of washing soda , and ½ cup (110 grams) of powder laundry detergent . Pour the chemicals into the tub, then stir the water with a long tool; a broom handle, stick, large spoon, or pole would all work. [4] X Research source Most people strip towels in their bathtub, but you can also use a large bucket to do the job if you don't have a tub. Keep stirring and check the water to ensure that the powders fully dissolve before moving to the next step."

    {
      "title": "Swish the towels around with your stirring tool after submerging them.",
      "content": "Swish the towels around with your stirring tool after submerging them. Make sure each towel you strip is completely underwater and soaked through. [5] X Research source Don't worry if you see some foaming when you submerge the towels or notice the water change color, either; both are totally normal parts of the stripping process!"

      "title": "Remove the towels once the hot water has completely cooled.",
      "content": "Remove the towels once the hot water has completely cooled. Set a timer for 5 hours, and then go about your day! [6] X Research source While waiting, you don't have to monitor the towels—stripping will happen naturally. Return once per hour to stir the towels gently but let them sit in the water otherwise. Then, after 5 hours, remove the towels and drain your tub of water. Stirring helps the washing soda and detergent get into each towel's fibers and strip away lingering buildup and residue."

      "title": "Wring out the towels and use the washing machine to remove chemicals.",
      "content": "Wring out the towels and use the washing machine to remove chemicals. You don't need to add any detergent or other cleaning supplies to the washing machine; just place the towels inside and set the machine to a rinse cycle. This way, dislodged residue will be washed away instead of spreading to the rest of your laundry. [7] X Research source If your washing machine has a double-rinse cycle, select that option instead to ensure a thorough cleaning."

      "title": "Run them through the dryer without any dryer sheets.",
      "content": "Run them through the dryer without any dryer sheets. Your towels have already been cleaned and stripped of unwanted odors, so dryer sheets aren't necessary. Set your dryer to whichever cycle or setting you normally use for towels, and dry them off completely. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "One round of stripping doesn't always clean towels entirely. Don't fret if they still seem a bit off-color or smelly; you can easily strip them again right away without damaging them. Keep stripping your towels with borax, washing soda, and detergent (the same way each time) until they're fresh and clean. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that towels become hard and stiff if you use too much laundry detergent. So cut back on the detergent to have soft and fluffy towels. [10] X Research source You can add vinegar in the wash cycle to remove all the residue from the towels. [11] X Research source Do not overfill the washer so the towels can move freely.
