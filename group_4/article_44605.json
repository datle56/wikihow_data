      "content": "Visit a doctor to find out more about what is causing your acidosis. The symptoms of metabolic acidosis aren’t always apparent and the only way to know for sure that you have it is to have tests run by your doctor. Essentially, they’ll be testing your blood to determine its pH level, and from there they will run more tests to see what is causing that abnormal level in the first place. [2] X Research source In most cases, you’ll be at the doctor for some other reason and the metabolic acidosis will be discovered through your bloodwork. It’s generally a symptom of something else rather than a disorder of its own. Common causes of metabolic acidosis may include increased acid generation, loss of sodium bicarbonate, and diminished renal acid excretion."

      "content": "Check for diabetic ketoacidosis if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. With diabetic ketoacidosis, your body isn’t producing enough insulin and your blood and urine are getting overwhelmed with ketones. It’s a serious condition that may require anything from taking an extra shot of insulin to being hooked up to an IV to replace lost fluids. [3] X Research source If you are diabetic and experience the following symptoms, call your doctor or go to the emergency room right away: vomiting, inability to keep fluids down, severe nausea, or inability to regulate blood sugar levels."

      "content": "See a doctor after having diarrhea to check for hyperchloremic acidosis. Diarrhea and extreme dehydration can cause hyperchloremic acidosis due to a loss of salts and organic acid anions. Your doctor will need to replenish your fluids through an IV and test your electrolytes to make sure they rebound to an appropriate level. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The most common symptoms of hyperchloremic acidosis are headache, vomiting, nausea, and lethargy. These are symptoms you might have from being dehydrated anyway, so it’s always best to see your doctor to make sure you’re getting the right treatment to bring you back to health."

Lactic acidosis is a form of metabolic acidosis that is caused by too much lactic acid, which can be caused by many different things: excessive alcohol consumption, cancer, over-exercising, liver failure, severe anemia, shock, seizure, and heart failure. Watch out for these symptoms and visit your doctor as soon as possible to determine if the cause is acidosis: [5] X Research source Disorientation Yellowing of the skin or eyes Rapid or shallow breathing Rapid heart rate Muscle cramping Fatigue Headaches Diarrhea Your doctor will treat the underlying cause of the lactic acidosis, so your treatment plan will differ based on that."

If you have low-functioning kidneys, they may not be able to get rid of excess acid, causing you to develop metabolic acidosis. This is something your doctor will be aware of and test for regularly, so make sure to attend all your appointments. [6] X Research source Your doctor may choose to have you take sodium bicarbonate pills to help offset the level of acid in your body, and there may be other treatment methods they consider. Always follow your doctor’s advice and check with them before trying any treatments on your own."

Sodium bicarbonate is found in many over-the-counter antacids because it does a great job reducing the amount of acid in your body. So when you’re dealing with extreme metabolic acidosis, your doctor may ask you to take sodium bicarbonate pills to help offset excess acid in your blood or urine. [7] X Research source For more extreme cases of metabolic acidosis, your doctor may give you intravenous sodium bicarbonate."

Depending on your blood sugar and pH levels, you may be hooked up to an IV to receive fluids, electrolytes, and possibly insulin. Vigorous IV fluid replacement, usually normal saline, is a significant part of treatment. This is typically necessary when a patient is hypervolemia or extremely dehydrated. [8] X Research source Once your levels are back to normal, you may be able to go home and resume your normal activities, or you made need to undergo additional testing. In some cases, you may need antibiotics or further evaluation before your doctor will let you go home."

Your doctor will let you know if this is needed. [9] X Research source Renal failure is also known as kidney failure, which is a common symptom of kidney disease. In general, people undergoing dialysis treatment receive it 3-4 times a week, and each session usually takes 3-4 hours. Depending on your circumstances, though, this could differ."

Soy, oatmeal, unsweetened yogurt and milk, ginger, fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, parsley, beans, lentils, and herbal teas are low in acidity and can help neutralize the level of acid in your gut, giving your kidneys less to process. [10] X Research source “Clean eating” or focusing on adding more whole foods to your diet could help your body maintain a normal acidity level. If you think you may have metabolic acidosis based on your symptoms, always visit your doctor before trying to fix things through your diet. There may be something more serious going on."
