      "content": "Switch things up by using your index finger. Use your index finger to flick the top blade backwards towards your hand. Keep going until the spinner is rotating smoothly."

      "content": "Practice to find what's comfortable for you. Everyone has a different preference when it comes to fidget spinners. Some people prefer using their ring finger while others prefer their index finger. You also may prefer turning the spinner backwards or forwards. Experiment with your spinner until you find what works for you."

      "title": "Secure the center of the spinner with your thumb and middle finger.",
      "content": "Secure the center of the spinner with your thumb and middle finger. Grab the spinner by the ball bearing, positioning it between your thumb and index finger. Hold the spinner tight to make sure it's secure. You can hold the spinner either horizontally or vertically. [1] X Research source You can use either hand, but it's helpful to use your non-dominant hand to hold the spinner and your dominant hand to flick."

      "content": "Switch hands or change directions. If you get bored, you can switch which hand is holding the spinner. You can also switch which direction you're spinning the blade."

      "title": "Try the convertible.",
      "content": "Try the convertible. Hold the spinner horizontally and pinch the center between you thumb and middle finger. Use your index finger to flick the blade to spin the spinner. Once the spinner is rotating steadily, lift your thumb off the spinner. This way, your spinner will be balancing on your middle finger as it spins."

      "title": "Transition into the change-up.",
      "content": "Transition into the change-up. Start with the same position as the convertible, but don't lift your thumb. Instead, once the spinner is rotating steadily, gently toss it to your other hand. Grab it between your other thumb and middle finger and keep spinning. Toss it back and forth a few times. This particular trick takes some time and patience, as it's hard to get the coordination exactly right."

      "content": "Perform the reverse sonic. Hold the spinner horizontally. Grab the spinner's ball bearing with your thumb and middle finger. Flick the spinner's blades with your index finger to get it spinning. Toss it into the air. As it falls down, grab it by the bearing between the thumb and index finger you used to toss it. Ideally, the spinner should stay spinning the whole time."

      "title": "Try the polarity switch.",
      "content": "Try the polarity switch. Hold the spinner vertically. Get the spinner turning as usual with your thumb, index, and middle finger. Twist your wrist while you toss it to get it to flip in mid-air and then grab it between your thumb and index finger once it flips. This trick takes a lot of practice, as everyone maneuvers the spinner slightly differently to get it to flip."

      "title": "Do the single or double tap.",
      "content": "Do the single or double tap. For the single tap, start with the convertible and then toss the spinner into the hair. Turn your hand sideways with the palm facing down and try to catch the spinner on the back of your hand. Keep your hand flat so the blades don't catch on your skin and the spinner keeps going. Then, toss it with your the back of your hand and, while it's still spinning, catch it with your thumb and index finger. The double tap simply means performing this move twice. This move is pretty complicated. Work on mastering the other two moves before attempting it."

      "content": "Try the hand twist. Start with the convertible. From there, quickly twist your hand in a circle, balancing the spinner on your middle finger. As you're circling, keep the spinner horizontal so it stays on your finger. [3] X Research source This move takes some work. It will be awhile before you can master circling your hand while balancing the spinner, so don't be surprised if the spinner falls off the first few times you attempt this."

Use your index finger to get it spinning. Then, quickly move your hand behind your back and throw your spinner towards your other hand. Instead of catching the spinner with your other hand, move your dominant hand to the side to grab your spinner with your thumb and index finger again. [4] X Research source"
