[1] X Research source To quickly check your connection status: iPhone/iPad: Swipe down from the top right corner of the screen (iPhone X or later, iPad) or swipe up from the bottom of the screen (iPhone SE, 8, or earlier) to open Control Center . Make sure Airplane Mode is not enabled. The button with the airplane symbol on it should be gray if it’s turned off. If cellular data is on, the icon that looks like an antenna with curved lines radiating outward will be green. If Wi-Fi data is on, the Wi-Fi icon will be blue. Press and hold any of those icons to open a more detailed menu where you can adjust additional settings. Mac: Click the Wi-Fi symbol in the menu bar at the top of the screen to see your connection status.
