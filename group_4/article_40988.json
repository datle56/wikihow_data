      "content": "Take action by starting with doable steps. If you're struggling with severe apathy, it's unwise to dive straight into the deep end of new responsibilities and ambitions. Make small changes at first and gradually work toward more significant responsibilities. Each step you take forward is a step away from apathy. [2] X Research source For example, if you feel like all you can do in a day is wake up and make it to the couch, it's probably not realistic to decide to run a marathon. Try taking a short walk each day instead. If you used to love painting but it feels hard right now, try sketching or even coloring instead."

[3] X Research source You could even give yourself a treat when you accomplish something. It could be taking a relaxing bubble bath or buying a new book you might like to read."

[5] X Expert Source Jennifer Butler, MSW Love & Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 31 July 2020.

I am changing my life.\" For example, if you have the thought “There is no point in trying, because I know I will fail,” change it to something like, “Failure is an opportunity to learn. If I don’t get it right this time, I can always try again.”"

[8] X Research source You don't have to jump immediately into running 5k races and swimming 10 miles (16 km) each morning. Go slowly and do what you're ready for.
