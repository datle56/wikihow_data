      "content": "Step back and look at the situation objectively. When looking at a flirting situation, it often takes two to tango. The other girl may initiate the flirting with your boyfriend, but your boyfriend may play a part, too. Try to look closely at their interaction to see if they're both flirting or if it's really one-sided. [1] X Research source [2] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Matchmaker Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. The point of analyzing the situation is to see how to better deal with it. Once you figure out who exactly is involved with the flirtation, you can decide whether to deal with just the other girl, your boyfriend, or both. It can also help you decide when to time any conversations you have. For instance, if she's leaning in close to him, batting her eyelashes, or puffing out her chest, she's flirting with him, especially if she engages in flirty banter. If he leans in close to her and encourages the banter, then he's flirting back. If he doesn't engage in the behavior with her, he's trying to shut down the flirting."

      "content": "Wait to deal with him. If your boyfriend is either starting or engaging in the behavior, wait to deal with him until you can talk to him in private. That way, you don't start a serious discussion in public, and you can do it when you aren't so agitated. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Give her a look.",
      "content": "Give her a look. The easiest way to send a message to someone flirting with your boyfriend is to simply take her down with a look. Stare her down without a smile until she backs away. If she doesn't get the message, you need to move on to other tactics. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take possession of your boyfriend. When she starts flirting, let her know he's your boyfriend by physically touching him.

      "title": "Emphasize your togetherness with words.",
      "content": "Emphasize your togetherness with words. Another way to stake your territory is to use your words to emphasize you are together.

It's our favorite movie, isn't it honey?\" [8] X Research source Emphasizing \"we\" and \"our\" will help most people get the message.

      "title": "Comment on it.",
      "content": "Comment on it. If the girl is obviously flirting, one way to point it out without actually being mean to make a lighthearted comment about it. That way, you call attention to the situation, so you are doing something about it, but you aren't lashing out and creating a sticky situation. [9] X Research source For example, say the girl is laughing too much at your boyfriend's jokes. You could say something like, \"Well, that was funny, but not that funny! He's always making bad puns.\""

      "content": "Pull her aside. If you don't want to cause a scene, you may need to draw her aside to talk about it. This tactic might work better with someone you know rather than a stranger. If she doesn't respond to other measures, ask if you can talk to her for a minute, then bring up the problem. [10] X Research source For example, you could say, \"You may not realize that you're doing it, but you're flirting with my boyfriend. I find it really disrespectful, and I would appreciate it if you would stop.\""

      "title": "Take it in stride.",
      "content": "Take it in stride. Another option is to simply ignore the flirting. If your boyfriend is ignoring the girl, there's no reason that you can't do that, too.

[12] X Research source If you pick a time, it can keep you from blowing up in anger in the moment he flirts because you've had a chance to talk about it.

[15] X Research source You may need to spend some time thinking about the problem to figure out why the flirting bothers you so much. Often, it comes down to trust.

For instance, he may not even realize he's flirting or maybe he didn't realize how much it upset you. Maybe to him, it's just being nice to other people. [16] X Research source Pay attention to what he's saying, instead of trying to think of the next point you're going to bring up. Don't just focus on your hurt. Listen to his feelings and intentions. Nod and ask leading questions to get to the heart of what he's saying. For example, you could say, \"I feel like what you're saying is that you don't see flirting as a big deal. Why do you feel that way?\""

I think I have a problem with you flirting because I feel like I'm not enough for you.\" You could also ask, \"Do you sometimes flirt so that I will feel jealous? I only ask so I can figure out how we can fix what's wrong with our relationship that would make you want to do that.\" Let him talk about how he thinks jealousy is affecting his flirting to help continue the conversation."

You may need to compromise to figure out a solution that works for both of you, so that both of you have your needs met as much as possible. [18] X Research source One way you could compromise is to reevaluate what you consider flirting. For instance, maybe you could start to see him having a friendly conversation with a girl as not flirting, even if you considered it flirting before, while if he's touching her or leaning towards her, you could consider that flirting. Find ways to let him know when you think he's going to far. For instance, you could whisper in his ear when you think he's flirting too much to help get his attention. Talk about it as it comes up. You don't need to have a serious conversation in a restaurant. However, when you feel like he flirted too much, try to talk about it within a day, so he can realize you're feeling hurt and help to rectify that. Be more intimate. Sometimes flirting can come from a lack of flirting with you. Take time to hold his hand, kiss him, or dance with him on the porch. All the little things add up to make you both feel more loved and secure."
