Then hold it under a faucet with running water and squeeze the pillow once it feels soaked. Keep it under the water until the pillow doesn't feel soapy. Plan on rinsing the pillow for 1 to 2 minutes to completely remove the soap. Leaving soapy residue will stain the pillow and make it harder to dry."

If you have a dryer and the care label on the pillow says to tumble dry it on low heat, put the pillow in the dryer. Add dryer balls to speed up the drying process and turn on the machine. If you don't have a dryer, clip the pillow to a clothesline that's in direct sunlight. Leave the pillow to hang until it's completely dry. The amount of time it takes to dry the pillow will depend on how hot it is and how thick your pillow is."
