      "title": "Look for watery feces to identity diarrhea.",
      "content": "Look for watery feces to identity diarrhea. In healthy birds, droppings should contain mostly brown or green with white, semi-solidified feces with a small amount of liquid urine. If your bird has more liquid in their droppings, but the fecal matter appears solid, this is a condition called “polyuria” that is sometimes mistaken for diarrhea. If your bird's beige/white feces is watery or runny, this is true diarrhea. [1] X Research source Some causes of diarrhea in lovebirds include: Bacterial infections. Viral infections. Fungal infections. The presence of parasites. Changes to diet. Non-food items lodged in the intestinal tract. Ingestion of chemicals, toxins, or spoiled food."

      "title": "Look for other symptoms.",
      "content": "Look for other symptoms. If diarrhea is the result of a medical problem, often it will be accompanied by additional symptoms. Pay close attention to your bird, and look for changes in their behavior. It can be helpful to jot down a few notes about your bird's symptoms. This kind of record can be very helpful for your vet. [2] X Research source Some symptoms to watch for include: Ruffled feathers. Tucking the head beneath the wing. General lethargy. Loss of appetite or refusal to eat. Vomiting. Blood in the stool (which may appear black or dark green)."

      "title": "Seek medical attention.",
      "content": "Seek medical attention. An occasional bout of diarrhea is perfectly normal. However, if your bird's diarrhea lasts longer than 24 hours, returns frequently, or is accompanied by additional symptoms, you should seek the advice of your vet immediately. [3] X Research source Birds tend to hide their illnesses as long as possible. As a result, when you notice symptoms in your bird, they may already be quite ill. It is a good idea to look for a vet before your bird becomes sick. If possible, look for an aviary specialist."

    {
      "title": "Offer a complete history of the problem.",
      "content": "Offer a complete history of the problem. In order for your vet to make an accurate diagnosis, they will need as much detailed history about the condition as you can provide. [4] X Research source Be prepared to discuss: When the diarrhea began. How often it has occurred. Any additional symptoms and how they have progressed. A detailed description of their diet and how they have been eating. Whether or not they have been exposed to other birds and when. Any other medical conditions your bird has been diagnosed with. Any medications your bird is taking. Your vet may also ask you to bring in a stool sample."
    },
    {
      "title": "Diagnose the problem.",
      "content": "Diagnose the problem. Diarrhea in lovebirds can be caused by a number of different ailments, ranging from serious to benign. As such, your vet will likely need to run a series of diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your bird's diarrhea, and determine the best course of treatment. [5] X Research source Some tests your vet might run include: A physical examination. A complete blood count (CBC). A serum biochemistry panel. An endoscopy. Fecal tests. X-rays."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide treatment.",
      "content": "Provide treatment. Once your vet has diagnosed the source of your bird's diarrhea, they can offer you some treatment options. Be aware that diagnostic testing and treatment for your lovebird may be expensive. Speak to your vet about costs and payment options before you proceed. [6] X Research source Some treatment options for diarrhea-related conditions include: Hospitalization to provide fluids. Antibiotic or antifungal medications. Endoscopy or surgery to remove obstructions. Medications to protect and help heal the intestinal tract."

    {
      "title": "Offer mild food and water.",
      "content": "Offer mild food and water. When your bird is experiencing diarrhea, it is important to offer a mild diet and plenty of fresh water. Provide your bird with the pellets they normally eat, but do not offer fresh fruit, vegetables, or other treats until they have been diarrhea-free for 24 hours. Also, be sure to change their water regularly. [7] X Research source If the diarrhea seems to have subsided, you may begin offering small amounts of fresh produce. If your bird will not drink water, contact your vet immediately."

      "title": "Monitor droppings.",
      "content": "Monitor droppings. Clean out your bird's cage and remove any litter from the floor. Instead of adding litter to the clean cage, place paper across the bottom. Keep an eye on this paper, and change it daily, in order to monitor the status of your bird's droppings. Be aware that some conditions in birds can be spread to humans (such as psittacosis). It is a good idea to wear rubber gloves and a mask while cleaning your bird's cage and handling the bird while it is sick. [8] X Research source Sick birds are susceptible to heat loss, so be sure to return the cage to a warm but well-ventilated room once you have cleaned it."

    {
      "title": "Provide medications.",
      "content": "Provide medications. Depending on your bird's diagnosis, your vet may prescribe antibiotic or antifungal medication for you to give your bird at home. Usually, this will come in a liquid form that can be added to your bird's water. [9] X Research source Follow all instructions from your vet. Even if your bird's condition has improved, continue to give your bird the medication for as long as your vet has advised. If your vet has advised you to do so, be sure to isolate your sick bird."

      "title": "Keep the cage clean.",
      "content": "Keep the cage clean. Diarrhea in lovebirds may be caused by parasites, bacteria, or fungi. You can prevent the presence of these irritants by maintaining a clean and sanitary environment for your bird. [10] X Research source Clean food bowls with soap and water daily. Provide fresh cage lining daily. Sanitize your bird's cage once a month (or more often if they are ill)."

      "title": "Quarantine new or sick birds.",
      "content": "Quarantine new or sick birds. Parasites, viruses, fungal infections, and bacterial infections can all be spread from bird to bird. Prevent the transmission of diarrhea-causing illnesses by placing new birds in quarantine for up to six weeks. This should also be done with birds who are ill, or any bird who leaves the home and comes into contact with other birds. [11] X Research source Ideally, keep the quarantined bird at a friend's house. If you must keep the bird at home, take it into a different room and cover the vents in that room."

    {
      "title": "Provide routine veterinary care.",
      "content": "Provide routine veterinary care. Diarrhea-causing conditions are most easily treated when caught early, perhaps even before your bird exhibits symptoms. This can be accomplished by bringing your bird to see the vet every 6 to 12 months. [12] X Research source During these exams, your vet will: Examine your lovebird. Weigh your bird. Perform blood tests. Perform a fecal exam."
