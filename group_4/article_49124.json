      "content": "This meme questions a partner’s interest outside of physical appearance. Physical attraction is a fundamental part of romantic relationships, and sometimes, what draws us to other people to begin with. In many cases, wondering if your significant other only wants you for your hot bod is a playful, lighthearted thought to entertain, sometimes out loud. Asking your S.O. if they would still love you if you were a worm is a version of this train of thought, exaggerated for comedic absurdity. [1] X Research source Asking someone this may also come in the form of an anxiety-fueled, late-night question during pillow-talk, albeit a pretty eccentric and silly one. The question sparked an outbreak as it was asked by users across myriad social media platforms, such as TikTok and Instagram , becoming a relatable meme for couples everywhere."

      "content": "At its core, the question is about unconditional love. Asking your partner if they would still love you if you were a worm is essentially synonymous with asking, “Will you love me no matter what?” We humans yearn for an authentic connection with someone else that makes us feel safe and secure enough to be ourselves. We want a relationship based on unconditional love, capable of surviving conflict, life changes, and physical transformation—which, we assume, may include turning into the squirmy dirt-dweller in question!

      "content": "This meme originated in a 2019 tweet. On Twitter, user @shutyourhell posted a tweet on June 7, 2019, featuring an imagined late-night conversation with her husband. The conversation begins with the user “crying” at 3AM and the husband asking her what’s wrong. At first, she says nothing, but when further prodded, she admits, “idk i just feel like if we were born as worms u wouldn’t like me .. would u even marry me ? whatever just forget it.\" This fictional exchange went viral, receiving over 30,000 likes in the span of 3 years. Other follow-up tweets from the user also gained notoriety, with addressing the question to the audience: “​​would u guys still like me if i was a worm .. ? idk i feel like u wouldn’t .. whatever … just forget it…” Social media users took the question and ran with it, either reposting @shutyourhell’s original tweet with their own answers, or putting a new spin on the question."

      "content": "The meme continued gaining traction and has made many pop culture appearances. Asking a loved one whether they’d still love you if you were a worm wiggled its way into pop culture— pun intended. The meme resurfaced on Twitter and on TikTok in 2022. During Halloween of 2022, supermodel Heidi Klum dressed up like a terrifyingly believable life-sized worm. This added fuel to the meme’s fire, spurring a new series of related memes and commentary. [3] X Research source In the season 3 finale of the popular Netflix show, Love is Blind , contestant Colleen Reed turned to husband Matt Bolton and asked, “Would you still love me if I was a worm?” When Dune II was released in 2024, their marketing campaign involved the iconic Dune sandworms, which further popularized the meme. The 2023 short film, Would You Love Me If I Was a Worm? likely drew inspiration from the meme. The film’s premise follows a young man going through a breakup who decides to live the rest of his days as a worm."

      "content": "The safest answer to this question is some form of, “Yes, honey!” Some social media users have explored the pitfalls of answering the question at all. On TikTok, @trail2talented explained that taking the question literally and realistically answering “no” might make one’s significant other feel unloved, while answering “yes,” might come with a new set of questions, like, “Oh, so you’d date just about anyone or anything, huh?” While these are interesting takes, here’s what we think are the best—and most romantic— ways to answer this question: “I’d love you if you were a stink bug, babe.” “If you were a worm, I’d be the early bird every single day!” “Of course. I’d give you the best dirt and snacks.” “If you’re a worm, I’m a worm.”"

      "content": "The question is a playful and silly way to gauge how much someone loves you. Asking, “Would you still love me if I was a worm?” is largely used to discern how much a partner, friend, or family member loves you beyond the physical aspect of your identity. In theory, “worm” can be replaced with just about anything— “snake,” “hippo,” “fish”— while maintaining its same effect. In its original form, the question was presented by a wife to her husband, asking for reassurance that he would love her no matter what befell them, including but not limited to bizarre twists of fate— like being turned into a worm. The question is symbolic of our yearning for unconditional love and its subtext holds more realistic implications, like, “Would you still love me if I got sick?” Or, “Would you still love me if I cheated on you?” If you find yourself on the receiving end of this question, try to see beyond the ridiculous absurdity of the conceit and use it as an opportunity to let your partner know how much you love them— lack of vertebrae and all."
