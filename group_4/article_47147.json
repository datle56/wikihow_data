      "content": "Research the prayer times. Visit the mosque's website (by performing a web search) and locate the listed prayer times. The mosque may be crowded up to 30 minutes before prayer times. If you're having trouble finding the mosque's website or the prayer times, refer to websites such as IslamicFinder.org and Salah.com . On Friday afternoons, the congregational prayer ( Salatul Jum'ah ) occurs. Thus, it may be more crowded at this time."

If you fear that your footwear may be stolen, you may keep it with you (e.g. in a plastic bag). In large mosques—especially those in foreign countries—you may wish to keep your footwear with you. Examples of large mosques include the Grand Mosque of Mecca, The Prophet's Mosque (in Medina), and the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates)."

      "content": "Follow the proper dress code. Both men and women should dress appropriately: Men: Should cover their upper body and lower body (at the bare minimum, to the knees). Examples of appropriate clothing for men are a t-shirt or long-sleeved shirt with pants or shorts that reach the knees. Avoid skin-tight clothing in favor of modest clothing that covers most of the body. Women: Muslim women should cover the entire body with modest clothing and a headscarf , except for their face, hands, and feet which they may show. A headscarf should always be worn in the mosque and must always be worn while praying. [3] X Research source According to Islam, women may remove their headscarves when completely out of sight of unrelated males. Non-Muslim women are generally not bound to these rules but should wear modest clothing and not show excess skin."

Females may be located to the side of males in the prayer space, upstairs, or in the back portion of the prayer space ( musalla ). There may be a separate entrance for women, or you may enter via one main entrance and continue to the respective hallway/stairway. Very large mosques such as the Grand Mosque of Mecca are not segregated. Do not run inside."

Idols (which are strictly forbidden in Islam [4] X Research source [5] X Research source [6] X Research source ) and images of animate beings are never used. Elaborate mosques often use patterns and calligraphy instead to decorate the interior."
