      "title": "Choose 1-2 songs for the processional.",
      "content": "Choose 1-2 songs for the processional. Normally, 1 song plays for the wedding party and the first spouse as they walk down the aisle, and a different song plays for the other spouse as they walk down the aisle to close the processional. Choose songs that are significant to you and your spouse, or pick songs that are important for religious traditions. Be sure to read the lyrics and check with the venue beforehand to make sure your songs will work for the event. [1] X Research source If you only want to have 1 song play for the processional, be sure to let the venue know that they don’t need to change the music for the end of the processional. For a more traditional wedding, or one that is based on a religious ceremony, consult with the church or your officiant to clarify your options for processional music. Normally, there will be a list of songs that you can choose from. Don’t forget to choose a song for the recessional, which signifies the end of the ceremony. Look for an upbeat and fun song to get the party started before the reception!"

      "content": "Lead the processional with the mother of the bride. Traditionally, the mother of the bride will kick off the wedding as the music starts by walking down the aisle and taking her seat in the front row. Sometimes, the parents of the other partner will join her when walking down the aisle. [2] X Research source If the mother of the bride is escorting the bride down the aisle or won’t be at the wedding, you can start the processional with the parents of the other partner, the grandparents of the couple, or the officiant of the wedding."

      "title": "Pair members of the wedding party together to walk down the aisle.",
      "content": "Pair members of the wedding party together to walk down the aisle. After the mother of the bride, the wedding party walks down the aisle. Pairing the party saves time and works well especially if there’s an even number of people. It’s best to pair couples up based on height to avoid large height disparities that can make walking together difficult. [3] X Research source The maid of honor and best man are normally the last pairing of the wedding party to walk down the aisle."

      "title": "Have your partner walk down the aisle before you.",
      "content": "Have your partner walk down the aisle before you. Instruct your partner to walk down the aisle or enter from a side door at any point in the processional before you make your way down the aisle. It’s best to keep them toward the end of the processional after the wedding party, but be sure to give them enough time to take their place at the altar before you begin to walk. [4] X Research source Often, the officiant of the wedding and the first partner will enter together and walk to the altar."

      "title": "Position the flower girl and ring bearer just before the last partner.",
      "content": "Position the flower girl and ring bearer just before the last partner. To signify the end of the procession and the arrival of the remaining partner, send the flower girl and ring bearer out just before they begin to walk. The adorable kids will entertain the wedding-goers as the other spouse prepares for their walk down the aisle. [5] X Research source Usually, the flower girl is the last one to walk before the bride, and she throws flower petals to line the aisle for the bride! If the ring bearer is too young to be trusted with the real rings, you can give him decoys to deliver to the groom at the altar."

      "title": "Walk down the aisle to close the processional and begin the ceremony.",
      "content": "Walk down the aisle to close the processional and begin the ceremony. Once the flower girl and ring bearer have made their way down the aisle, begin walking with your escort. Follow the tempo of the music as you make your way to the altar. Once you reach the altar, the processional is over, and the ceremony will begin when you and your partner are ready! [6] X Research source As you reach the end of the aisle, take your place at the altar with your partner, and look to the officiant to let them know that you’re ready to start the ceremony."

      "title": "Practice walking down the aisle before the big day.",
      "content": "Practice walking down the aisle before the big day. The easiest way to calm your pre-wedding jitters is by practicing your walk. Set up a pretend aisle in a hallway and put on your processional music to perfect your pace and posture! [7] X Research source It’s okay if your practice aisle is a little shorter than your normal aisle. The important part is making sure that you’re balanced and confident as you’re walking!"

      "title": "Walk around in your heels",
      "content": "Walk around in your heels , if you’re wearing them down the aisle. It’s important to break in your heels before the wedding and make sure that you’re comfortable in them. Put them on while you’re walking around the house, and make sure you’re taking small steps and are able to maintain good posture while walking. Be sure to practice going up and down stairs, which you may have to do to get to the location of the ceremony. If your wedding is outdoors, practice walking in your shoes on various surfaces. Be careful not to get them dirty, though! If you’re having trouble with walking in your heels, bring a backup pair with a shorter heel for the day of the wedding."

      "title": "Stand up as straight as possible to show your confidence.",
      "content": "Stand up as straight as possible to show your confidence. As you’re preparing to walk down the aisle, put your shoulders back and take a few deep breaths to loosen up. Raise your chin to avoid looking at the ground when you walk and to appear confident. [8] X Research source You can practice your good posture in the mirror before the wedding to make sure you don’t look stiff."

      "title": "Hold your bouquet slightly lower than what feels natural.",
      "content": "Hold your bouquet slightly lower than what feels natural. Many brides want to hold their bouquet close to their chest, but that can be very unflattering and make your walk more difficult. Place your hands at waist level, creating a diamond shape between your arms and your body. [9] X Research source Your elbows should be directly parallel to the thinnest part of your waist to achieve the perfect look."

    {
      "title": "Have your escort link their arm into yours.",
      "content": "Have your escort link their arm into yours. Traditionally, the bride will position herself on the escort’s arm. However, since you’re holding your bouquet, have your escort wrap their arm around yours once you’ve positioned yourself. It’ll be more comfortable for you while you’re walking. [10] X Research source If there’s a big height difference between you and your escort, you might ask them to wrap their arm around your back, instead of linking arms. This is more comfortable but is still endearing and provides support as you walk. Don’t be afraid to lean on your escort slightly if you need some support! That’s what they’re there for."

    {
      "title": "Walk at a pace just slightly slower than what’s normal for you.",
      "content": "Walk at a pace just slightly slower than what’s normal for you. You might think you have to do the “step-together-step-together” traditional bridal walk. Luckily, most brides choose to walk like normal, albeit slightly slower than their regular pace. You can even choose to use the beat of your processional music to set the rhythm for your walk. Even if your music is extremely slow, try to walk at a medium pace. That way, you can enjoy the beautiful moment, but you aren’t stalling the ceremony."

      "title": "Use the hem of your dress to prevent tripping.",
      "content": "Use the hem of your dress to prevent tripping. As you’re walking, make sure that your dress hem touches the top of your foot after each step. This will ensure that you don’t step on your dress. If you don’t feel the hem of the dress on your foot, it’s possible that you’re stepping on it, but don’t panic! Just pause for a moment and use your foot to move the dress forward. [11] X Research source You can work with your seamstress to make sure that the hem of your dress falls at the right length for walking. If your dress is extra long, consider holding it up slightly in one of your hands while you walk. This gives a very “princess” look as you’re making your way to the altar!"

      "title": "Smile and acknowledge your guests as you make your way down the aisle.",
      "content": "Smile and acknowledge your guests as you make your way down the aisle. It can be uncomfortable to have everyone looking at you and potentially taking pictures. Don’t be afraid to smile and make eye contact with your friends and family while you walk. After all, they’re here to see you! [12] X Research source Smiling is also a great way to prevent yourself from crying before you get to the altar. If you’re an emotional person, try to avoid looking at people who are already crying. Your emotions will be running high, but remember this is a very happy moment!"

      "title": "Thank your escort at the end of the aisle.",
      "content": "Thank your escort at the end of the aisle. Your escort will likely be someone who is extremely close to you. When you get to the end of the aisle, turn to them and hug them before continuing to the altar. They deserve a special moment for supporting and helping you through your walk. Some brides have two escorts, which is completely normal, especially in the US. In that case, turn to each of them individually at the end of the aisle and thank them with a hug or kiss."
