      "content": "Get checked out if your nail turns black and blue. Sometimes, a crushing injury to a toenail (like having a heavy object dropped on your toenail) can cause a “subungual hematoma,” or bleeding underneath the nail. This creates a little pocket of blood under the nail, which can be uncomfortable because of the pressure. It looks like a dark blue, black, or purple bruise like splotch beneath your nail. If the bruise is less than 1/4 of the size of the nail, it will probably resolve on its own. Otherwise, see your doctor, because you may need to have the fluid drained from under the nail to prevent further pain and injury. [14] X Research source Your doctor will drill a very small hole in your toenail to let the blood drain out. This procedure shouldn’t hurt, and draining the blood will make your toe feel better because it relieves the pressure."

If you can see visible damage to your tissue around your nail, like any tears, see your doctor.
