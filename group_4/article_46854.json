      "content": "Tilt your head to the side so your ear is facing upward. You may need to lean forward a little and turn your neck so your ear is facing as upright as possible. This will help the drops go deep into your ear canal. Remove earrings or any other jewelry that might come in contact with the solution or get in the way of your tilting your head.

You can also use a mirror or have a friend or family member count or squeeze in the drops for you.

      "content": "Keep your head tilted to hold the drops in your ear for 5 minutes. If you’re using the drops in your bathroom, scoot over to a couch or chair for about 5 minutes to keep your ear facing upwards as much as possible. You can also sit down on the side of the bathtub and lean on one elbow. You can stand if you like, but sitting or laying down might be easier on your neck and back for the next few minutes. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Place a cotton ball into your ear if you have to turn your head upright for a moment. You may hear a crackling sound—that’s the solution foaming up when it comes in contact with earwax."

      "content": "Use a bulb ear syringe to flush your ear with warm water. After letting the solution sit in your ear, lean your head over a sink or bathtub to let it drain out. Then fill the bulb ear syringe (that came with your kit) with warm water. Flush your ear canal by squeezing the bulb. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If your kit did not come with a bulb ear syringe, simply cup warm water in your hand and flush your ear that way. Use earwax drops 2 times a day for up to 4 days."

      "title": "Avoid using earwax drops if you have severe ear pain or other conditions.",
      "content": "Avoid using earwax drops if you have severe ear pain or other conditions. Intense ear pain, discharge, rash, and drainage can be a sign of infection or some other issue beyond wax buildup. You should avoid using the product and call your doctor to get it checked out. [6] X Research source If you’ve recently had ear surgery, ask your doctor before using earwax drops. Don’t use earwax removal drops if you have a perforated eardrum (a hole in your eardrum) because it could get infected. If you feel dizzy and have ear pain, you might have an ear infection—don’t use the product and see a doctor."

      "content": "Drop in 2 drops of warm mineral oil to soften and loosen ear wax. Slightly warm the mineral oil by holding the bottle or dropper in your hand for 10 seconds. You can use almond oil, baby oil, or olive oil. Then turn your head to the side and use a dropper to insert 2 drops into your ear. [7] X Research source You can also use a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide (in equal parts) to soften and loosen ear wax."

      "content": "Take a warm shower 1 to 2 days later and direct the water into your ear. The heat from the warm water will loosen up the ear wax even more. Cup your hand near the side of your head to gather water and splash it onto your ear to help flush out the wax. You can shower the same day you apply the oil to clean it out if you like, but giving the mineral oil time to sit will make it more effective. [8] X Research source Tip your head to the side to let the wax and water drain out. You can also cup water to your ear while sitting in the bathtub, just avoid bubble bath and other bath additives that might irritate your ear canal."

      "title": "Dry your ear with a clean towel or a hair dryer set on low.",
      "content": "Dry your ear with a clean towel or a hair dryer set on low. Use a clean towel to dry the outside area of your ear. Pat the area instead of rubbing it dry to prevent the sensitive skin from getting irritated. To use a hair dryer, hold it at least 4 in (10 cm) away from your ear and set it to the lowest heat and power setting. The mild heat will melt the wax even more and allow you to rub away any excess wax with a cotton ball. [9] X Research source You can use a cotton swab to wipe away any wax and moisture, but make sure that the cotton tip is still visible. Your eardrum sits about 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside your ear canal, so avoid inserting the swab any more than .4 inches (1.0 cm) inward. Use mineral oil to loosen up ear wax once or twice a week."
