      "content": "Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam and involves donating to those in need. Zakat is the third pillar of Islam and refers to the obligation of a Muslim individual to donate a certain portion (2.5%) of their wealth to those in need each year. In most countries, zakat is mandatory for all Muslims who earn above a certain threshold (based on the current value of gold or silver) in their area. It is considered a form of worship. [1] X Research source Giving zakat is a way of cleansing your money and possessions from excessive desire or greed. Because zakat is required in Islam, it is not considered to be charity or a tax. Zakat is meant to provide direct assistance to the needy and cannot be used for infrastructure or administrative costs. Zakat is also sometimes called zakat al-mal; these terms refer to the same thing and are used interchangeably."

      "title": "Zakat is based on income.",
      "content": "Zakat is based on income. Islam is a complete code of life and has its own economic principles. Zakat is one of the basic principles of the Islamic economy and is based on social welfare and fair distribution of wealth. Anyone who has more personal wealth than the nisab, or threshold, is required to pay 2.5% of their total wealth. [2] X Research source The nisab is based on the value of 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver, so the exact amount varies from year to year and even month to month. Individuals become eligible to pay zakat once they hit the threshold at any point during a lunar year. There is no set payment date. Paying zakat requires that individuals take regular inventory of their wealth and possessions, either weekly or monthly."

      "title": "Zakat can be donated directly or through a Muslim authority.",
      "content": "Zakat can be donated directly or through a Muslim authority. Individuals required to give zakat may choose who they donate to. This can be done directly by the individual (by donating directly to an organization, for example), or by appointing an agent to distribute on their behalf. Another option is to give the zakat to a Muslim authority who will then distribute the money to eligible recipients. [3] X Research source While zakat is often given to organizations, it can be given directly to eligible individuals who are in need. These individuals can not be members of the donor's immediate family."

    {
      "title": "Zakat is meant to be distributed entirely to the needy.",
      "content": "Zakat is meant to be distributed entirely to the needy. This means that the entire donation is supposed to go directly toward helping those in need. The money cannot be kept by a charity for administration costs or any other reason. Many organizations have specific forms designated for zakat to separate these donations from other charitable donations. Zakat aid must be used within one lunar year of when it was given. [4] X Research source Despite this, there is some controversy around zakat and whether it’s distributed justly. Some suspect that organizations might be keeping some of the money, as zakat doesn’t lift people from poverty as it should. Some believe that alms collectors (like charities) can also receive zakat; some organizations use this as a way to cover administrative costs related to zakat aid."

      "title": "Zakat is given to those in need.",
      "content": "Zakat is given to those in need. According to the Quran’s Surah Al-Tawba, there are 8 categories of people who qualify to receive zakat. Traditionally, Islamic scholars have interpreted these 8 categories to be the following: [5] X Research source Al-Fuqarā': the poor Al-Āmilīyn 'Alihā: the needy Al-Mu'allafatu Qulūbuhum: those sympathetic to or expected to convert to Islam , recent converts to Islam, and potential allies in the cause of Islam Fir-Riqāb: those who are enslaved, trafficked, or otherwise oppressed; slaves of Muslims who have been or are intended to be freed by means of a kitabah contract (a written contract between a slave and their master that outlines the terms for the slave’s freedom) Al-Ghārimīn: those in heavy debt from attempting to satisfy their basic needs or in pursuit of a worthy goal Fī Sabīlillāh: those fighting for a religious cause/to protect the Muslim community Ibnu Al-Sabīl: Wayfarers, stranded travelers Note that zakat should not be given to one’s own parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, spouses, or the descendants of Muhammad. It also should not be given to non-Muslims, unless they’re expected to convert."

      "title": "In most countries, zakat is required for all Muslims able to donate.",
      "content": "In most countries, zakat is required for all Muslims able to donate. Because zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam, most Islamic belief systems and countries with large Muslim populations believe it is a requirement and treat it as such. [6] X Research source However, because there is some debate amongst religious scholars about whether zakat actually helps those in need, some other countries allow individuals to choose whether they pay zakat or not. In some countries (like Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen) where zakat is compulsory, those who fail to pay are treated like tax evaders and may face legal repercussions. The requirement of giving zakat has led to many disputes throughout the history of Islam, most notably during the Ridda wars. Some Islamic scholars and development workers have criticized zakat, arguing that it has failed to lift people out of poverty and suggesting that the funds are being wasted and mismanaged. It may be okay not to pay zakat if the collector is unjust or if the money won’t be distributed fairly. While there won’t always be punishments for not paying zakat, many Muslims believe failing to pay will lead to serious consequences in the next life. It may also lead to a lack of blessings (barakah) in your life."

      "content": "Zakat can be given at any time of the lunar year. Not everyone pays zakat at the same time, as individuals become eligible to pay once they hit the nisab, or wealth threshold. It doesn’t matter when it’s paid, as long as it is paid within the lunar year. [7] X Research source While there is no set payment date, many pay it out at the end of the year once calculations on any leftover wealth are made. Others prefer to pay during Ramadan or the Hajj pilgrimage . Zakat Al-Fitr is a type of zakat specifically given during Ramadan before the Eid prayer, which must be given to provide food for the poor. This is different from regular zakat but it is still usually considered obligatory for individuals who have more food than required to meet their needs."

[11] X Research source The word zakat (with its current meaning) is found in many suras, including 7:156, 9:60, 19:31, 19:55, and 27:3. It’s also found in early Medinan suras and is described as obligatory for all Muslims. Verse 2:177 of the Quran states, “Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, needy travelers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in the heat of battle. It is they who are true in faith, and it is they who are mindful of Allah. [12] X Research source"

The caliph Abu Bakr, believed by Sunni Muslims to be Muhammad’s successor, was later the first to institute a required zakat system. He established the principle that zakat must be paid to a legitimate representative of Muhammad’s authority. [13] X Research source The second and third caliphs (Umar ibn al-Khattab and Uthman ibn Affan) continued Abu Bakr’s codification of zakat. Some believe the practice may have roots in Judaism (due to the Hebrew and Aramaic word zakut , meaning “pure” or “clear”), though others do not believe that the Qur’anic verses on zakat are related to Judaism."
