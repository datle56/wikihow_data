With a quitclaim deed, you literally quit whatever claim you have to the property -- hence the name -- and transfer it to someone else. Quitclaim deeds are the most common way to transfer property among family members when money doesn’t change hands, or gift property to someone. With a quitclaim deed, there is no risk that you might be sued by your family member or a future buyer if it turns out there’s something wrong with the deed and you didn’t have full ownership of the house, because a quitclaim deed only transfers whatever claim of ownership you have. It doesn’t guarantee that you have any particular claim. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill out the form. A quitclaim deed has blanks for your name and the name of the family member to whom you’re transferring your home. You also have to enter the legal description of your home. You can use the description contained in your original deed if you have access to that, or use government plats or the street address. Since it’s a quitclaim deed, the description doesn’t have to be as specific as it would be otherwise. It just has to relate back to your original deed. The form also will have blanks for signatures, but you shouldn’t sign the form until you are in the presence of a notary."

The TOD deed enables you to maintain full control of your property while you’re alive, but transfer it to your relative of choice when you die without going through probate. [3] X Research source As of 2015, 22 states and the District of Columbia offer TOD deeds, including Colorado, Illinois, Ohio and Virginia. Check with your county recorder’s office to learn if this option is available to you. If your reason for transferring your house to a family member is to avoid probate, a TOD deed may be a better solution for you because it allows you to maintain control of your house while you’re alive."

You may change your mind at any time and make another deed. You retain all title and ownership in your property until you die. Any mortgages or other liens on your property transfer automatically with a TOD deed. Like a quitclaim deed, you’re merely bequeathing your ownership interest in the property, whatever that may be. When you die, your chosen family member may need to present an affidavit and death certificate to take control of the property, but it’s still a quicker and easier process than going through probate."

      "content": "Contact a real estate attorney. Because warranty deeds are the most complicated method of transferring the title to your property, you most likely will want an attorney to guide you through the process. Warranty deeds, sometimes called grant deeds, come with a guarantee to the new property owner that you have good title to the property and no one else has any stake in it or claim to it. [6] X Research source Because they are so complicated, warranty deeds typically aren’t used to transfer a house to a family member when no money is exchanged. Although complicated for you, a warranty deed gives the relative to whom you’re transferring your property more confidence, because you promise that you own the property free and clear of any mortgages or other encumbrances, and that no one else has a competing claim for the property."

      "title": "Conduct a title search on your property.",
      "content": "Conduct a title search on your property. Before you complete a warranty deed, a title search reviews the legal history of the property ensure the statements in the deed are correct and the title to the property is clean. This process can be expensive and time consuming. [7] X Research source Although you can conduct a title search yourself, since property records are open to the public, a professional title searcher will do a more thorough job in less time than it would take you to do it yourself. Title insurance provides better protection against any defects in your title, either disclosed or hidden, that could cloud your deed with problems or even negate your transfer. Title insurance is expensive, and typically the cost is split between the original owner and the future owner."

Joint tenancy with right of survivorship means that when one of you dies, the other takes all interest in the property by operation of law.
