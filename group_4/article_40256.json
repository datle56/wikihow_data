      "title": "Drop the final “r.”",
      "content": "Drop the final “r.” For example, the word car is said “cah.” This is one of the most distinct speaking patterns required to master a Boston accent. You have to drop the \"r\" at the end of your words. The technical term for this linguistic quirk is “non-rhoticity.” Practice saying birds of a feather flock together, the Boston way. It's pronounced “birds of a feathah flock togetha.” [1] X Research source A famous phrase used to teach this principle is “pahk yuh cahr in hahvuhd yahd.” You might know it as park your car in Harvard Yard. [2] X Research source The reason Bostonians drop their \"r\" is because English immigrants to Boston did so. However, the Boston accent doesn't sound exactly like a British accent because of the influence of other cultural groups, like the Irish. [3] X Research source Other examples of this pronunciation include saying \"stah\" instead of star, and \"fah\" instead of far. The letter “r” sound also vanishes after other vowels, such as “ee” sounds. For example, weird is pronounced “wee-id.”"

      "title": "Speak very fast.",
      "content": "Speak very fast. Because they are dropping letters, such as the \"r\" at the end of words, people from Boston are known for speaking very fast. Because they don't round out their consonants, Bostonians are able to say a sentence faster. It takes some effort to round out the \"r\" in words. Demonstrating the speed of the Bostonian accent, try saying the sentence \"how are you.\" It's pronounced \"hahwahya.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Say the letter “a” right.",
      "content": "Say the letter “a” right. You will need to pronounce the letter \"a\" differently depending on whether it's at the end of a word or not. Add an “r” to the end of words that end in “a.\" The word pizza is pronounced pizzer. [4] X Research source Other examples of this pronunciation are the words soda and pasta. They are pronounced \"pahster\" and \"soder\" in Boston. Say \"Californiar\" instead of California and \"arear\" instead of area. To pronounce the letter \"a\" when it's not at the end of a word, open your mouth and say “ah” like you are at a doctor's office. For example, the words aunt and bath are pronounced \"ahnt\" and \"bahth\" in Boston. In Boston English, ah is pronounced more like “aw,” though. For example, the word tonic is pronounced tawnic."

    {
      "title": "Leave out other consonants.",
      "content": "Leave out other consonants. In addition to the “r,” Bostonians often leave out consonants. This is another reason they speak so fast. For example, they will drop the \"d\" and \"t\" at the end of words. There are a lot of vowel sounds in Bostonian as a result. The word “don't” is pronounced “doan.” Plenty becomes “plenny.”"

      "title": "Use words unique to Boston accent speakers.",
      "content": "Use words unique to Boston accent speakers. Bostonians have different words for some common things. For example, if you say “water fountain,” people will know you're not from Boston. A Bostonian would call it a “bubblah.” It's important to master how slang is used in common language, especially if you are practicing a Boston accent for a movie role. [5] X Research source In some areas of Boston, sandwiches are called “spuckies.” They are also called subs. If you are trying to find a liquor store, ask for the packie. Bostonians don't drink soda or pop. They call it “tonic.” So if someone offers you tonic, they aren't offering you gin in Boston. They might be offering you Pepsi. Steamed clams are one of the most common local foods. They are called steem-ahs. Roundabouts – those circles in roads – are called rotaries in Boston (but pronounce it rotah-ree). Instead of turn signal, say \"blinkah.\" Instead of remote control, say \"clickah.\" Instead of trash can, say barrel."

      "title": "Put the adjective \"wicked\" in front of words.",
      "content": "Put the adjective \"wicked\" in front of words. This is one of the most distinct Boston terms. If you like something, say it's wicked. For example, if you think the Boston Red Sox are a good team, tell people you think they are wicked good. The word pissa means something is great. Often, people in Boston will combine it with the word wicked to say something is wicked pissa (but remember to pronounce it \"pissah\")."

    {
      "title": "Understand local geographical references.",
      "content": "Understand local geographical references. If you don't have a handle on how to say words relating to the local geography, it's not going to matter if you drop your rs. If you say you want to go to the Public Gardens or Boston Commons, everyone who is really from Boston will know you aren't. These are singular words. So, you should refer to Public Garden and Boston Common, instead. But if you really want to do it right, say \"Public Gahden.\" Tremont should be pronounced \"Treh-mont.\" Say COPley, not COPEly Square (but pronounce it \"Squayah\"). The way you pronounce many Boston locations is very different from how they are spelled. So don't try to puzzle it out phonetically. Avoid Boston clichés. It annoys people from Boston when you refer to the city as “Beantown.” Only tourists call the city that."

      "title": "Speak in a Brahmin dialect.",
      "content": "Speak in a Brahmin dialect. This is the John F. Kennedy accent that is so famous. It's the elite version of the Boston accent. It's a very different Boston accent from, say, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in “Good Will Hunting.” Obviously, Kennedy is the gold standard for Brahmin dialects. To master it, why not watch some of his old speeches on YouTube? For example, you can find his opening statement in the 1960 presidential debate online. [6] X Research source U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is another politician who speaks with a Brahmin accent. If trying to speak in a Boston Brahmin accent, use the Boston English, but with a British tone. Some people think the Boston Brahmin accent is harder to find these days. It's the upper-crust accent more associated with English immigration. [7] X Research source Brahmin accents are more likely to put the emphasis on a back vowel not a front or center vowel. For example, Harvard is pronounced \"Hahvid.\" [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn neighborhood differences. Blue-collar Boston accents can change slightly depending on the specific working-class neighborhood they derive from. Speak in a Southie Boston dialect. The South Boston dialect is sometimes called “Southie.” Southie is the dialect used in working class Boston areas that were made up of Irish, Italian and other immigrant groups. Some blue-collar Bostonians replace \"r\" with \"v.\" For example, the word brains becomes “bvains.” An example of a Southie accent would be Ben Affleck's role in the movie, the Town. This accent is closest to the stereotypical Irish accent, and is most heavily influenced by the Irish. The north end and east end dialects have some Italian immigrant influence."

      "title": "Listen to people speak with the accent.",
      "content": "Listen to people speak with the accent. To learn a Boston accent, strike up conversations with real Bostonians or watch videos of real Bostonians speaking. Observe how they speak. If you listen to a lot of people speaking with a real Boston accent, it will be easier to pick up. You can also look up “Boston to English” dictionaries online that will translate common words into different dialects used in Boston. Study people who speak who have the strongest accents possible. It's easier to learn it that way. Finding a native speaker of the accent and speaking with them in person is the best yet. So go to Boston. Don't just listen to them talk, either. Study their facial movements when they talk and try to mimic them by looking into a mirror while you speak. You could hire a voice coach. They will have you listen to a native speaker, and then they will record you saying the same words. Or, they will ask you to answer questions. Then, the conversation will be more natural. There are many YouTube videos that describe how to speak a Boston accent. One of the best ways to learn how to do it is to watch the locals speaking in their natural habitat, such as a city council member talking at a meeting. [9] X Research source You can find books with CDS that will teach you how to speak different Boston accents, such as Southie."
