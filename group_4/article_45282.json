      "title": "You don't need as much strength to carry weapons.",
      "content": "You don't need as much strength to carry weapons. Two-handing gives you a 1.5x strength modifier. This means that if a sword requires 30 strength to wield, you can two-hand it with 20 strength. If you have less than 20 strength, you won't be able to effectively wield the weapon, even with two hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "You do more damage.",
      "content": "You do more damage. The 1.5x strength modifier also applies to the damage you do. It's also more effective at breaking an enemy's guard."

      "title": "You can't carry a shield.",
      "content": "You can't carry a shield. Since you'll be using both your hands to carry your weapon, you can't carry a shield at the same time. This will lower your defenses and leave you more open to attack."

      "title": "Blocking isn't as effective.",
      "content": "Blocking isn't as effective. You can still block while two-handing a weapon, but it won't be as effective. You'll receive more damage than you would if you were to block with a shield."

      "title": "Collosal weapons.",
      "content": "Collosal weapons. Collosal weapons require high levels of strength and stamina to wield. Wielding them with two hands allows you to wield them with 50% less strength. They also tend to have greater range, which allows you to keep your distance so that you don't get attacked since you're not carrying a shield."
