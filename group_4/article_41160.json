      "title": "Buy some hairspray.",
      "content": "Buy some hairspray. Most brands should suffice for a quick fix. Bear in mind that hair-spray may help affix the glitter in place on the garment, but will not hold up forever. You may need to use fabric glue or a transparent iron-on transfer for a more permanent fix. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove loose glitter and prepare to spray.",
      "content": "Remove loose glitter and prepare to spray. Shake the piece of clothing vigorously to remove any loose glitter. Lay a towel on a flat, dry surface. Then, lay the clothes flat out on the towel, with no creases. If there are any creases in the garment, the hairspray may fix them in place. Consider ironing the garment beforehand, if it's terribly wrinkly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray the hairspray over the glitter.",
      "content": "Spray the hairspray over the glitter. Be thorough: apply a thick layer, and make sure that you don't miss any spots. If you notice any problem areas where the glitter is particularly loose, make sure to give those spots extra attention. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the hairspray dry on the fabric.",
      "content": "Let the hairspray dry on the fabric. Look for drying instructions on the hairspray bottle. Allow slightly more time than the package calls for, as fabric may dry differently than hair. Once the hairspray has dried onto the glitter, pick up the garment and shake it lightly. If any glitter falls off, you may need to reapply. If not, then it's probably okay to wear, but be gentle! [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use fabric glue to fix the glitter in place.",
      "content": "Use fabric glue to fix the glitter in place. You can sprinkle glitter onto fabric glue to stick it to the garment, and then coat the glitter in turn with a water-and-fabric-glue mixture to give the glitter a protective outer layer. Glitter often flakes off when it brushes against things, so a coating of glue can help freeze the individual particles. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a glue-and-water mixture.",
      "content": "Make a glue-and-water mixture. First, dilute the fabric glue a little by adding water. There is no set proportion; just dilute it enough that it is easy to apply with a paintbrush. The mixture should be neither pasty nor thin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush the mixture onto the glitter.",
      "content": "Brush the mixture onto the glitter. Put a newspaper at the back of the fabric on which you want to work. Use a synthetic painting brush to spread, drip, or dab the glue onto the glitter areas. Take care that the glitter doesn't come off as you brush on the mixture. Make sure to cover all of the glitter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the glue dry for 24 hours.",
      "content": "Let the glue dry for 24 hours. Lay out the garment in a dry, warm, ventilated spot. Make sure that there aren't any wrinkles in the fabric, or else the glue may preserve these wrinkles for the ages. Once the glue-water coating is dry, your clothing should be ready to wear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash gently.",
      "content": "Wash gently. Hand-wash the fabric if possible so that you have more control. Fabric glue is synthetic, so it shouldn't run off when you wash it, although the hairspray method is unlikely to last. In general, hand-washing will be gentler on the glue, the glitter, and the fabric. Wash carefully and do not knead the fabric too heavily. Avoid washing in the washing machine. [5] X Research source Use cool or lukewarm water. Hot water can loosen the glue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the fabric air-dry.",
      "content": "Let the fabric air-dry. Hang it up on a clothesline or lay it out on a flat surface. A tumble-dry washing machine might tumble the glitter away, as the garment rubs up against other clothing. Furthermore, the intense heat of many quick-drying techniques (tumble-dryers, blow-dryers) may loosen the fabric glue and lead glitter to flake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear your garment carefully.",
      "content": "Wear your garment carefully. Try to avoid creating friction that might rub the glitter off; try not to rub too hard and scratch on the glitter. Try not to wear it too often; keep it for special occasions, like a costume. The more often you wear your glittery garment, the more often you will need to wash it â€“ and the more likely you will be to brush up against something! Consider buying a little jar of glitter to repair the outfit as needed. You may also need extra fabric glue. Find these things at any arts-and-crafts store."
