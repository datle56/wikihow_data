Many use it as a sarcastic and lighthearted phrase that refers to teasing or messing with someone. [1] X Research source While it’s usually not meant to cause offense, some people find it mildly offensive profanity. A variation on the term is that it can be used as an expression of disbelief similar to the phrase, “Are you kidding me?” It can also be used to let someone know that you’re joking, as in “I was just taking the piss.” A similar phrase commonly used in the UK is “taking the Mickey” or “taking the mick.” [2] X Research source The meaning and usage is identical to “taking the piss.”"

      "title": "There are a few theories regarding the origins of “taking the piss.”",
      "content": "There are a few theories regarding the origins of “taking the piss.” Some believe “taking the piss” came from the men who transported urine or collected it to make gunpowder. Others believe it is related to the slang term “piss-proud.” Neither of these has been confirmed. In the 1600s, King Charles I ordered his subjects to save their urine to make saltpeter (or sodium nitrate), one of three main components used to make gunpowder . Saltpeter men collected the urine as well as urine-soaked earth in barns and sheep pens. [7] X Research source Whether for making gunpowder or curing leather, urine was a valuable resource. Ship captains used it as ballast in the hulls of their ships and sold it when they reached port. Some say the sailors on those ships would lie about their cargo and others would accuse them of “taking the piss.” The most likely origin for “taking the piss out of someone” comes from the slang term “piss-proud” which means “unnecessarily arrogant.” To take the piss out of someone means to cut them down to size."

      "content": "There are inoffensive alternatives you can use instead of “take the piss.” While “take the piss” is extremely common in the UK, it might confuse people if you use it in the US due to its similarity to “taking a piss,” which is American slang for urinating. Also, “take the piss” can be seen as offensive or rude, depending on who you say it to. If you want to refer to ridiculing or teasing someone, use: I brought them down a peg or two. I took them down a notch. I cut them down to size. I put them in their place. If you want to express disbelief, say: Are you kidding me? Are you having a laugh? Are you trolling me? Are you putting me on? When you want to tell someone that you were joking, try: I was only pulling your leg. I was just goofing around. Just kidding! I’m only fooling with you."
