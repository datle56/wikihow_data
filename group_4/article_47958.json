      "title": "A ladybug landing on you is a sign of good luck to come.",
      "content": "A ladybug landing on you is a sign of good luck to come. The name “ladybug” goes back to farmers in medieval Europe where farmers would pray to the Virgin Mary for good crops. [1] X Research source Ladybugs eat pests that destroy crops, so if they’d show up, it was a sign their prayers were answered. [2] X Research source Basically every culture has a similar relationship with ladybugs, so if one lands on you, it’s a major signal that the universe has something good in store for you. [3] X Research source The number of spots on the ladybug determine how many years of good luck you’re going to have. If a ladybug with no spots lands on you, it’s said that you’ll meet your true love soon. If you’ve been facing a problem or you’re worrying about a tough decision, the ladybug coming to visit you is a major sign that the universe is on your side and things will work out soon."

On a ladybug, the implication is that you’re going to start a new chapter in life. If you’ve been thinking of taking a trip, you’ve been thinking about asking that cute barista out, or you’re considering taking a new job, the yellow ladybug on you is a sign that now is the time! [4] X Research source If you are perfectly happy right now and you don’t want any new adventures, the yellow ladybug may simply be a sign that it’s time to take a break."

Now is the time to start exploring a new artistic hobby or get back to that painting, movie, or song you were working on. This could also be a sign that it’s time to get creative at work or school, too. If you’ve got a big project coming up, don’t hesitate to take a little risk with how you approach it."

In fact, it’s a signal that you’re about to experience a transformative change in your life. If you’ve been facing a major obstacle or you’re going through some tough times, rest assured that you’ll turn a new leaf over soon.

      "content": "If you dream of multiple ladybugs, you may feel out of control. Were you swarmed by a wild frenzy of ladybugs last night? If so, it could mean that you’re spiraling out a bit. It may be the time to take a break, recollect yourself, and start fresh in life. Try not to be so hard on yourself when it comes to who’s in charge at school, work, or in your personal life. It’ll all be okay. [6] X Research source If you don’t actually feel out of control in your life, write it off as a random nightmare. It’s not like everything has to mean something."

      "content": "Pause whatever you’re doing and recite a wish in your head. Whether you’re walking or just scrolling through phone at the bus stop, pause as soon as the ladybug lands on you. Look at it, take a deep breath, and silently make a wish for whatever you want in your mind’s eye. You may find your wish coming true! The ladybug is an opportunity. It’s the universe’s way of saying it’s time to pay attention and set your intentions. By pausing to make a wish, you’re accepting this invitation."

      "title": "Meditate on the significance of whatever the ladybug lands on.",
      "content": "Meditate on the significance of whatever the ladybug lands on. According to some spiritual traditions, where the ladybug lands is extremely important. It could be that it’s calling your attention to a particular piece of clothing and what it means to you, or maybe there’s some symbolic significance to the body part where the ladybug is focused. Meditate on what the location may mean for you. For example, if the ladybug lands on your hand, perhaps it’s a sign that you should start working with your hands again, or give a “helping hand” to a friend in need."

      "title": "Whisper the name of your true love and gently blow the ladybug away.",
      "content": "Whisper the name of your true love and gently blow the ladybug away. If you’re crushing on someone or you’re in a committed relationship, the ladybug (especially a yellow ladybug) could be a metaphor for your love life. Tell the ladybug the name of the person you love and allow it to fly away. The ladybug is a sign luck is on your side, so your love life may improve for the better soon. If you’re into somebody and they don’t know, it may be a good time to tell them how you feel."
