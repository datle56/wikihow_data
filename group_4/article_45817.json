      "content": "Make sure that there are no people close to you. If there are some swimmers close by, move away from them. Even if they don't see you do your business, they may feel the sudden warmth and become suspicious. Move to the left or right, instead of deeper into the ocean. Do not go so far away that you can no longer see or hear other people. You want to be within sight and hearing/shouting distance, in case something happens. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep an eye out for other marine animals. The further away you go from other people, the more likely you are to come across some sea critters. Stay clear any marine life, including other fish, sharks, and jellyfish. You may hurt them, or they may hurt you."

      "title": "Avoid coral reefs.",
      "content": "Avoid coral reefs. While urinating in the ocean can be beneficial to the marine plants, it can be harmful to coral reefs. Urine helps marine plants grow—including algae. This can result in algae growing out of control on a coral reef and blocking out the sunlight it needs. This could suffocate and kill the coral reef. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay away from piers and jetties. Try to keep a distance of at least 100 feet (30.48 meters) from these places. Both piers and jetties tend to be surrounded by rip currents, which are very dangerous. [4] X Research source Rip currents are very strong ocean currents. They flow away from the shore.

These sudden waves are known as rogue and sleeper waves. They can be very dangerous if they catch you unawares. [6] X Research source"

If you do not do this, you may get sand inside your swimsuit. Make sure that your waist and everything below is still underwater. If you are wearing swim shorts, take hold of one of the legs. Give it a few quick shakes, then let go. If you are wearing a one-piece swimsuit or a bikini, start by taking hold of the bottom—the swatch of fabric right between the two leg holes. Tug down gently and then let go after a few seconds. Wash your swimsuit when you get home with some soap and warm water. This will help prevent any bad smells."
