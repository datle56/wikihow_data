      "content": "Static is a visual representation of a TV that can't get a signal. Noise, also known as static, white noise, static noise, or snow, is a random dot pixel pattern of static displayed when the antenna receiver of television sets and other display devices obtains no transmission signal."

      "title": "A TV not getting a good signal may show a blank screen or static.",
      "content": "A TV not getting a good signal may show a blank screen or static. For older and non-smart TVs, most of the noise originates from the TV's tuner. TVs use automatic gain control to handle both weak and strong signals effectively. In the absence of a signal, the gain is maximized, resulting in amplified noise. When an antenna is connected, additional noise from terrestrial signals, sunlight, or cosmic radiation may occur, but this has little to no impact on the display quality. If you have a smart TV, the static can be caused by technical glitches."

      "content": "Power cycle the TV. Unplug the TV from power, wait a few seconds, then plug it back in. If you have an external unit, like a Firestick or Apple TV, try turning it off and unplugging it from your TV."

      "title": "Check your cables and connections.",
      "content": "Check your cables and connections. Look at all the cables coming into or out of your TV, including HDMI, USB, DisplayPort, or power cables, to spot any damage. Replace any older cables as well as any cables that show signs of damage, like hard bends, frayed, or exposed wires. If you can, change ports for external devices. For example, if your Apple TV is connected to HDMI 1, connect it to HDMI 2 instead."

      "title": "Change the antenna angle if using an antenna.",
      "content": "Change the antenna angle if using an antenna. You don't want a big tree or a building in the way of your antenna, or you might get mixed signals that result in static. To get the best signal with an antenna you may need to move items in your home out of the way, or else you might not be able to pick up all available channels ."

      "title": "Change the resolution of your screen.",
      "content": "Change the resolution of your screen. For some TVs that are showing static randomly on the screen, you may need to force a resolution reset to fix this issue. This can be common with some Apple TVs, and the quick fix is to press the Menu and Volume Down buttons at the same time.
