      "content": "Repair any dents, cracks, or chips in the laminate flooring. Before you stain the floor, inspect it for any chips, cracks, or dents. Depending on the extent of the damage, fill minor damage with laminate floor patching material or replace excessively damaged planks. [3] X Research source You can buy laminate floor patching material from most home improvement stores. Fill the entire dent, crack, or chip with the floor patching material using a putty knife and let it dry for at least 24 hours."

      "content": "Sand the floor with 220-grit sandpaper. Using light pressure, hold 220-grit sandpaper over the floor's surface. Rub the sandpaper across the surface in a circular motion, smoothing out any small bumps or imperfections. [4] X Research source Sanding the floor will help give it a little grit, so your paint or finish will adhere to the floor's surface better. [5] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020. To speed up the sanding process, you can use a sanding block or orbital sander instead."

      "content": "Wipe away any residual sandpaper dust. After sanding the floor, use a damp washcloth to remove any dust left behind by the sandpaper. Use a dry washcloth to absorb excess water on the floor before applying any stains. [6] X Research source Do not stain the laminate floor until it is completely dry."

      "title": "Choose a floor finish with a rich, warm color.",
      "content": "Choose a floor finish with a rich, warm color. Although traditional wood stains don't work on laminate, laminate floor finishes can provide a similar color. Buy a laminate floor finish online with a tint resembling wood stain for a lasting color. If you want to give your floors a reddish tint, for example, choose a mahogany-colored laminate floor finish. Make sure you purchase a laminate, not wood, floor finishes. Laminate is less absorbent than wood and needs specialized floor finishes."

      "content": "Coat a section of the floor in laminate finish with a washcloth. Dip the washcloth in the floor finish and apply the protective finish to the floor in thin, even strokes. Cover 2 feet (0.61 m) sections of the floor at a time before moving on to the next section. [7] X Research source Smooth any stroke lines you notice with the washcloth for an even, glossy finish. After coating the first section, inspect the color and decide whether you like it before finishing the entire floor."

      "content": "Apply the laminate finish to the rest of the floor. Wait 30-60 minutes for the first section to dry, then repeat the process with the next section. Work from the back of the room to the front to avoid smudging the laminate finish before it dries completely.

Continue applying coats of laminate finish until you reach your desired color, waiting 2 hours between each coat.

Avoid stepping on or touching the floor while it dries to prevent streaks or smudges. [10] X Research source Over time, your finish's color may fade. Reapply 1-2 finish coats if your floor looks dull or you want a richer color."

      "content": "Choose a polyurethane-based paint in a color that mimics floor stain. For a richer color than laminate finish, you can paint your laminate flooring instead. Pick laminate paint that mimics the desired finish (cherry, maple, or honey, for example) for a strong color that's similar to wood stain. [11] X Research source You can buy polyurethane-based paints online or from most home improvement stores. Eggshell or semigloss paints are usually durable and long-lasting on laminate surfaces. You might also choose an epoxy or an enamel paint designed for floors and porches. [12] X Expert Source Patrick Coye Painting Specialist Expert Interview. 22 July 2020."

Dip a foam brush in the laminate primer and apply a thin coat over the surface in long strokes, working from the back to the front of the room. Let the surface dry for 30-60 minutes before applying any coats of paint. Choose an extreme bond primer or a primer made specifically for laminate to help the paint adhere better.
