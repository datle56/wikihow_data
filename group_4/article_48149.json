      "content": "They want to feel powerful and in control. At its core, manipulation is all about being a powerful and controlling force in any given situation—manipulators want to pull the strings and watch everything unfold according to their will. They’ll reach this goal by any means necessary, even if this means interfering with another person’s thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. [21] X Research source Manipulators don’t like being in situations they aren’t in total control of, and prefer predictable scenarios that they can use to their advantage. For instance, a person might pretend to be sick to manipulate their partner into staying home rather than going out to a club (that’s filled with lots of different people and variables that can’t be predicted or controlled)."

[22] X Research source People aren’t always manipulative on purpose—these patterns may have started because of a person’s family system with these “old” rules now being adapted to a new relationship. Manipulative individuals need to learn that the shadow side of themselves is attempting this behavior and that they’re responsible for figuring out whatever needs these manipulative habits are trying to meet."

For instance, individuals with BPD may take drastic, manipulative measures to prevent what they perceive as abandonment from occurring. [23] X Research source Certain attachment styles lend themselves to manipulative behavior, too. For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style might end things with their partner just to gauge how committed they are to the relationship.
