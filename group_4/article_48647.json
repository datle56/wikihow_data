      "content": "Chasing a goal, not a person Many of us have dreams of building a life with someone, and we usually have an idea of what we’re looking for in that person. Sometimes when we meet someone, they seem to tick all of those boxes right off the bat, and we end up obsessing over creating a whole “perfect” fantasy life in our minds. We may even wind up thinking we found our twin flame or soulmate, but this doesn’t change the fact that we barely know this person. [1] X Research source Clinical psychologist Dr. Liana Georgoulis, PsyD, suggests remembering “that it takes a good one to two years to fully know someone well. Many people present themselves in certain ways that aren’t always accurate with who they are.”"

      "content": "Attachment issues When a child experiences trauma, neglect, or abandonment from their parent or caregiver, this can later trickle into adulthood and adult relationships. Having an anxious attachment style means that out of fear of abandonment, you cling to others quickly and continuously search for validation from them. [2] X Research source Moreover, people with this type of attachment style are more likely to idealize others and create the illusion of a relationship without actually having it. [3] X Research source Dating coach John Keegan explains that these types of obsessive thoughts can even stem from the person you’re obsessed with giving hot and cold signals, triggering your brain to want to continue “the game” of winning them over. “It then becomes intermittent reinforcement, so then it's like ‘okay, this person pulls away, but I can fix it,’” he says. “So the more that person does that game, the more obsessed the other person becomes.” Remember: If you are someone who has an anxious attachment style, there is nothing wrong with you! This is your mind’s way of dealing with uncontrollable events that occurred in your life. Awareness is the first step towards creating healthy patterns in your dating life."

[4] X Research source Just because you’re obsessively thinking about someone you barely know does not mean you have OCD or any other mental health condition, however, if intrusive thoughts of your crush are affecting your daily life, it’s a good idea to explore these thinking patterns with a mental health professional.

      "content": "Depression, stress, or anxiety When things aren’t going well in our lives, it’s normal for us to search for distractions in the things around us—especially the positive things. It makes sense that we would rather think positive thoughts about our crush than focus on dealing with issues at work or family troubles. This is called escapism, and it’s a form of trying to replace those sad thoughts with happy ones. [6] X Research source"

This is why learning to be happy on your own is so important."

      "title": "Physical and sexual attraction",
      "content": "Physical and sexual attraction When we’re attracted to someone—especially in the early stages—our brain releases chemicals called dopamine and serotonin, which are responsible for happy and positive feelings. We can actually become addicted to these euphoric triggers, which, in turn, creates the sensation of attraction and lust. If you’re experiencing an obsession with someone you barely know, it could be very likely that your brain is chasing that high. [8] X Research source"

Or felt the warmth of someone's smile that looked just like your best friend in elementary school’s? Familiarity can trigger feelings of comfort, safety, and nostalgia, because the more we are exposed to one thing, the more our brains lead toward liking it. [9] X Research source So, if you barely know someone and yet feel like you’ve known them forever, they could be subconsciously reminding you of someone or something that brings you (or brought you at one time) comfort, resulting in an obsession."

While scoping out that special someone’s social media (and the numbers that come along with it) from time-to-time is a completely natural activity, checking their pages constantly could be a sign you’re obsessed."

If you went on a first date with someone and they mentioned going to the movies with friends that upcoming Friday, devising a plan to try to bump into them may not be completely unhealthy.

When our lives are fulfilled with our own hobbies, interests, and relationships, the need to continuously check our messages and calls diminishes. If you can’t go five minutes without checking to see if someone new in your life contacted you, an obsession may be on the verge."

      "content": "They’re all you think about. Thinking about a crush we barely know is healthy and completely normal; in fact, it would be strange if you never thought about them! Obsessive thoughts only occur when you can’t seem to complete normal day-to-day activities without thinking of them, they have become a distraction from getting things done, or you’re beginning to neglect work, hobbies, and interests because you’re too busy daydreaming about them."

      "content": "All your conversations circle back to them. Relating every single thing in your life to your crush is a signal that you might be obsessed. If you’re chatting with friends about your favorite flavors of cheese and you interrupt the conversation with sentiments of how your crush’s hair color reminds you of cheese, that’s an intrusive thought."

      "content": "Replace fantasy-based thoughts with reality. “Be careful not to engage in fantasizing and obsessive thoughts about that person,” Georgoulis explains. “Don’t engage in a narrative that this is the person for you. Set limits with yourself on how often you see and spend time with that person, don’t begin to rely on them heavily for emotional support, continue to stay active socially with other people and consider dating other people until you know someone well and they show you they are consistent and trustworthy.” While easier said than done, every time a fantastical or obsessive thought about your crush comes through, interrupt it with one about something else. Your replacement thoughts can be anything from your upcoming weekend plans to sitting down to make a grocery list—as long as it keeps your mind off your crush."

      "content": "Practice mindfulness meditation every day for a minimum of 15-20 minutes. To do this, Georgoulis recommends noticing “when the obsessive thinking is happening and redirect your focus instead on the activity you are engaging in in the present moment.” Find somewhere free of distractions and sit down to engage in a relaxing meditation . Make a conscious effort to redirect your thoughts and soak in the moment."

What’s more, getting your thoughts on paper forces you to confront your feelings and gain a better perspective on why you may be having these obsessive thinking patterns."

Speaking your mind and expressing your feelings to others can help you gain a fresh perspective on the situation. If your thoughts begin to affect your life in a negative way, schedule an appointment with a mental health professional to help you manage your obsession and overthinking patterns."

Instead, stop messaging them, calling them, or interacting with their social media accounts. Use this time to collect your thoughts and gauge what life could be like without worrying about this person. You may end up realizing it's better this way!"

Put that same energy into taking care of your own mind, body, and spirit; at the same time, remember that neglecting your own needs to think about someone else isn't going to make you feel better. Some common ways to practice self-care and self-love include letting go of negative thought patterns about yourself, focusing on gratitude, speaking kindly to yourself, and reflecting on your positive attributes daily."

In other words, if you can’t stop obsessively thinking about [someone] and work on mindfulness techniques to redirect your thinking, but then spend the next 4 hours on Instagram looking at his profile, the obsessive thinking will be reignited.”"
