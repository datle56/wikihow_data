      "content": "Wash your hair with dandruff shampoo if you see white flakes. If your scalp is itchy and you see white flakes in your hair, the culprit is probably dandruff. Dandruff is very common so don't be embarrassed! To treat dandruff, start by using an over-the-counter shampoo that contains the ingredients selenium or zinc pyrithione to keep flakes and itchiness at bay. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most over-the-counter shampoos can be used every time you wash your hair to treat and prevent dandruff. If an over-the-counter shampoo doesn’t work, see a doctor for a prescription-strength antifungal shampoo. Topical cortisone may also be recommended. Dandruff flakes are usually white or yellow. They're caused by seborrheic dermatitis, which is a fairly common skin condition.

      "content": "Stop using new hair products if your scalp is suddenly red and irritated. Some hair products can irritate your scalp and cause an allergic reaction called contact dermatitis. If you recently dyed your hair or used a new product and shortly after experienced a red, itchy rash, contact dermatitis is likely the cause. Stop using the product immediately to see if the irritation and itchiness subside. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Hair bleaches, dyes, shampoos, conditioners, and chemicals used for perms and straighteners are the most common triggers for contact dermatitis. If rash doesn’t go away after a few days, see a doctor or dermatologist. They usually prescribe topical steroids or oral antihistamines as treatment.

If you often find yourself scratching and picking at your scalp without something—like an itch⁠⁠—triggering it, you may have a disorder called dermatillomania. People with dermatillomania usually scratch or pick the most when they’re feeling stressed or anxious about something. Often, you may not even realize you’re doing it until you draw blood or create painful sores on your scalp.

That way, you can develop a strong treatment plan and better understand your condition.

Pay attention to when and where you tend to do the most scratching and try your best to avoid these triggers altogether. [20] X Expert Source Lydia Shedlofsky, DO Dermatologist Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Since avoiding triggers isn’t always an option, you can at least prepare by bringing along a stress ball or wearing gloves. If your trigger is something you can change, try addressing it head-on rather than ignoring or avoiding it. For example, if you're triggered by busy highway traffic on your daily commute, find an alternate route that's more comfortable for you. Mirrors are common triggers. If they trigger you, removing the mirrors in your bedroom and installing softer lighting in the bathroom can help. Remember that triggers aren’t always stressors. Scratching can happen during calm moments when you drop your guard or get distracted. [21] X Research source"
