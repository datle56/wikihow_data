Every time you take out your pitcher to pour yourself a glass of filtered water, first fill the glass with tap water and pour it into the reservoir. This way, your Brita pitcher will always stay full. Be careful when you pour yourself the glass of filtered water, as the water in the reservoir may spill out if the lid doesn’t stay securely on."
