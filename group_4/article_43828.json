      "content": "Throw salt over your left shoulder with your right hand for good luck. According to superstition, the best way to counteract bad luck after spilling salt is to toss the salt over your left shoulder. [1] X Research source In many cultures and religions, evil spirits are believed to hide behind your left shoulder. Throwing salt over your left shoulder with your right hand is thought to blind the spirits and prevent them from harming you. [2] X Research source The belief is that while you’re distracted and cleaning up the salt spill, the evil spirits are able to move in and take advantage of you. The Latin word for “Left” is sinister , which led people to associate the left side of the body with evil and wrongness. According to Christian beliefs, your left side is associated with the devil and evil, while your right side is associated with goodness and angels. In Buddhist tradition, it’s customary to throw salt over your shoulder after a funeral to keep away bad spirits. [3] X Research source Note: Many people interpret this superstition differently. Some believe it’s best to throw salt over your right shoulder while others throw salt over both shoulders. Ultimately, the correct shoulder is whichever one you feel is best! The left side of the body is considered the feminine side and is the \"receiving\" side in terms of energy. Energy flows in the left side and out the right side. If you consider how evil spirits/energy are supposed to physically be able to take over or enter the body (possession), the feminine or left side of the body (being the receiving side) makes sense as this is where the energy would enter."

      "title": "Salt was valuable in ancient times, so spilling it was seen as bad luck.",
      "content": "Salt was valuable in ancient times, so spilling it was seen as bad luck. For thousands of years, salt has been prized for its ability to season and preserve food. Because it was originally hard to produce, salt was rare and extremely valuable. Spilling salt was seen as almost sacrilegious or due to the presence of evil, so people started tossing salt over their shoulder to counteract the bad luck. [7] X Research source Salt was such a hot commodity that battles were fought over controlling salt mines. [8] X Research source Many cities developed near salt mines to capitalize on the salt trade, such as Salzburg, Austria. Interestingly, Salzburg means “Salt castle” in German! Salt may have been used as currency in ancient Rome and other cities. “Salary” comes from the Latin word Salarium which derives from Sal , or “Salt.” While there are no official records, historians believe Roman soldiers used their money to buy salt or were given salt as their compensation. Salt’s importance and value also shows up in phrases like, “Salt of the earth” and “They’re not worth their salt.”"

      "title": "In Christian beliefs, spilling salt is associated with evil and betrayal.",
      "content": "In Christian beliefs, spilling salt is associated with evil and betrayal. Salt is referenced several times throughout the Bible, where it symbolizes purity, integrity, grace, and God’s covenant. [9] X Research source Spilling salt was thus seen as something evil that’s caused by the devil. This is reflected in Leonardo da Vinci’s painting The Last Supper , where the traitor Judas is depicted spilling salt on the table. This belief also stems from the story of Lot’s wife, who disobeyed the angels’ warning not to look back at Sodom and was turned into a pillar of salt. She betrayed the angels and gave in to the devil, causing her downfall. [10] X Research source So, Christians started tossing salt over their left shoulder after they spilled salt to disable the devil and prevent him from causing evil."
