[4] X Research source Avoid in sports or strenuous physical activity. Don’t try to play through the pain. Small amounts of activity can still be done by patients with forearm tendinitis. Complete abstinence from using the affected area can cause muscle stiffness. Try low impact activities like swimming and gentle stretches to keep your muscles active without putting too much stress or use on them.
