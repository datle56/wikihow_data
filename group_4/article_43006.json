In that case, you might just have to gather your courage and tell him how you feel. Try asking him, \"I am ready to start having sex with you, would you be into that?\" or \"How do you feel about becoming more intimate with me?\" If you don’t like the idea of asking him to have sex, you could simply say, \"I'm ready for us to start having sex, but it's totally cool if you need more time.\" Saying something like this provides him with the opportunity to take the next step or decline without too much awkwardness."

Or you can try something more suggestive, tell him what you're wearing or go with the classic \"What are you wearing?\" This may lead to a steamy sexting session or phone call. When it feels right, ask him to come over and see what happens next."
