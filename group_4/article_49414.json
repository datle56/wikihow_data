Look up any words and phrases you don't understand to get a better grasp of the question. Establish what the issue at hand is. [2] X Research source For instance, maybe the question is, \"Immigration has been a heated topic on the national level for many years. With issues like the DREAM Act and President Trump's stances on policy, it's likely to remain a central issue. Using authoritative resources to back up your argument, take a stance on immigration policy, establishing whether you think it should be more or less strict and why.\" You can establish that the main topic is immigration policy from the sentence, \"Take a stance on immigration policy.\" If you're having trouble understanding the question, don't be afraid to talk to the professor.

[3] X Expert Source Jake Adams Academic Tutor & Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. If your essay will be based off a discussion had in class, ask your instructor if you can use class notes as a primary source. Look for respected news sources, as well as websites with \".edu\" and \".gov\" extensions. You may need to look up information on the DREAM Act or President Trump's policies to help you understand the question, for example. For this part, you don't need to take extensive notes, as you're just trying to get a feel for the subject."

You can use those as the main points in your paper. [5] X Research source Use Roman numerals on your page to mark your main ideas. Write a main point by each Roman numeral.

[10] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source For an example or anecdote, start by telling a short story about something relevant to your topic. For instance, you might write the following for an essay on immigration, \"When I was 4-years-old, my parents told me we were going on a long trip.

As you go, you'll bring up the main topic of your essay to give your readers an idea of where you're headed. You should present both sides of the issue in a neutral way before stating your thesis. [11] X Research source For example, you might write, \"Immigration is a highly-debated issue. It is controversial because some people fear how it affects the resources of the country the people are immigrating to, while others believe the improved quality of life for immigrants is whatâ€™s most important.\""

Otherwise, put it in your own words. You may want to begin body paragraphs with a quote from a relevant source. Then, explain or provide commentary on the quote and show how it supports your position. You can also use statistics to back up your research.
