      "content": "If a missing UPS package is marked “delivered,” it’s usually due to technical issues or misdelivery. It is extremely rare that a driver intentionally mislabels a package as delivered, because they know that their company can track where the item was supposedly dropped off. Other common reasons why your “delivered” package might be missing include: [1] X Research source Incorrect status: In this case, your package has been mistakenly marked as delivered. Wait for the package delivery period to pass before moving on to next steps. Misdelivered parcel: Check with your neighbors or other possible recipients of your package. Stolen package: So-called “porch pirates” who steal packages after delivery are increasingly common, especially if you live on a busy street or in an urban area. Failed delivery attempt: Your driver couldn’t access your building or needed you to be home to receive it. Driver deception: In extremely rare cases, a driver may mark a package as delivered before it actually was in order to avoid having late deliveries on their record. Damaged package: If your package was extremely damaged and the contents fell out, a driver may have seen that empty box and assumed the delivery had already been completed."

Check if your status says “Delivered” rather than “Out for Delivery” or “On the Way.” [2] X Research source Out for Delivery means that UPS still has your package. It may be delivered late in the evening or even the next day. On the Way means that the shipment is still working through the UPS network and will likely not change status until it’s out for final delivery. Sometimes an item says “Delivered,” but it’s just an error in the tracking system. If you don’t find your package by following the steps below, wait a day or two before contacting UPS ."

      "content": "Check if your driver left a UPS Delivery Notice. This notice typically looks like a small piece of paper left on your front door or in your mailbox. This means that your driver’s first attempt at delivery was unsuccessful, either because the package required a signature or your delivery details were incomplete. [3] X Research source Track your package to find out where it got redirected to. Use your original tracking number or the UPS Delivery Notice number. Find the delivery details included by your driver. They may have checked one or more boxes indicating where to pick up your package or when they will reattempt delivery. Release your package for delivery by signing the delivery slip in the indicated space and putting it back where the driver originally placed it. You can only release a package if it doesn’t require a signature from an adult who is 21 years old or over."

You will receive a call or email when UPS has an update on your package. [7] X Research source Even if UPS doesn’t find your package within that period, they will never delete it from the system and will alert you if they ever find it. In the meantime, UPS will investigate your claim by checking where your delivery was scanned, contacting the driver, and checking if your package was left with a neighbor or in an alternate secure location. For high-value packages containing expensive merchandise, UPS may even involve local law enforcement. UPS wants to seem like a reliable carrier, so it’s in their best interest to close your claim as soon as possible."
