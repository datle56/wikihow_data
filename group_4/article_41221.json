      "content": "Keep a journal to explore your thoughts and feelings. Journaling is a great way to get to know yourself better and define your core beliefs and values. [2] X Research source The more you understand about how your own mind works, the harder it will be to lie to yourself! Try to spend a few minutes jotting down your thoughts and feelings each day. You can also use the journal to track your actions and hold yourself accountable. If you’re not sure what to write, use prompts that get you thinking about yourself. For example, “What was a time when I felt good about myself?” “What do I really value in life?” or “What would I like to change about myself?” [3] X Research source You can get a journal with prompts built in or look for self-reflection prompts online. Keeping a record of your actions, thoughts, feelings, and circumstances can help you notice patterns that you’d otherwise miss. For example, maybe you find yourself writing a lot of entries about conflict with your significant other. This might help you be more honest with yourself about problems in your relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 329 wikiHow readers how to avoid making the same mistake, and 9% said they would ask loved ones to hold them accountable. [Take Poll] While this may not be the best strategy according to our readers, take time to think about the reasons for your mistake to understand what’s causing it."

      "content": "Work on forgiving yourself for things you feel guilty about. People often lie to themselves to feel better about things. If you’re struggling with guilt because of something you’re doing—or not doing—remind yourself that messing up doesn’t make you a bad person. Instead of trying to deny what happened, accept it and take ownership of it. Set a goal of learning from your mistake and moving on with life. [4] X Research source For example, you might say to yourself, “Maybe I haven’t always been a great friend, but I can’t change what happened in the past. The important thing is that I apologize to my friend sincerely and do my best to be there for her from now on.”"

      "content": "Take ownership of your actions, thoughts, and feelings. Deflection and projection are some of the most common forms of self-deception. Instead of trying to blame your actions on your circumstances or other people in your life, accept responsibility for the things you do and think. Ultimately, you’ll feel more confident and in control of your life once you own up and take charge! [5] X Research source For instance, maybe you keep telling yourself, “I don’t get my homework done because my friends keep distracting me.” Instead, try something like, “I keep getting distracted by other things when I should be working, but I can do something about that. I’m going to set my phone on ‘do not disturb’ and ask my friends not to bother me until I’m done.” Deflection, or blame-shifting, is when you try to blame someone or something else for your own actions or mistakes. [6] X Research source For example, if you snap at your significant other, you might blame them for being annoying instead of thinking, “Maybe I should work on reacting better.” Projection is when you see your own unwanted feelings, attitudes, or behaviors in others. For instance, if you have a tendency to be dishonest, you might become more suspicious and distrustful of the people around you. [7] X Research source"

But you don’t have to beat yourself up or blame yourself for things that aren’t actually your fault.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For instance, don’t say things like, “I always let everyone down.” That’s not helpful, and probably not very truthful, either!

I need to be careful about taking on more responsibilities when I have so much on my plate already.”"

Start by simply focusing on the sensations of your breath for a few minutes. Then, turn your attention to your thoughts. Simply notice each thought as it comes into your mind and give it a label—such as “positive,” “negative,” “self-focused,” or “focused on others.” [10] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Once you’re more aware of your thoughts, it will be easier to catch dishonest or misleading thoughts and challenge them."

Self-deception can be a really hard habit to break—especially if it’s related to extremely difficult or stressful circumstances in your life. If you feel like you just can’t stop lying to yourself, reach out to a doctor or counselor. They can help you work through your issues and develop healthier coping strategies. [11] X Research source You might benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of therapy that focuses on identifying and changing unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors. If you’re not sure how to find a good counselor, ask your doctor to recommend one."

Pay close attention to your emotions next time a difficult topic comes up, and ask yourself if you’re being totally honest about your feelings. [13] X Research source For instance, if someone gently criticizes something you’ve been doing, your first impulse might be to deny it. Instead, stop and think about your reaction. Do you feel angry? Guilty? Anxious? Those feelings might suggest a conflict between reality and whatever you’ve been telling yourself."

If you suspect you’re being dishonest with yourself about something, this is a simple way to hold yourself accountable. Write down what you’ve been telling yourself, then keep a log of your actions. After a few days or weeks, take a look at the chart and see how your thoughts and behaviors compare. [14] X Research source For example, maybe you’ve been telling yourself, “I always take good care of my teeth,” but your dentist doesn’t agree.

If you suspect a thought doesn’t quite line up with reality, take a moment to challenge it. Does the thought make sense? Can you support it with actual evidence from your life, or point to things that contradict it?

Sometimes you also lie to yourself to make things seem better than they are. For instance, maybe you’ve been saying things like, “I can quit smoking any time I want. I don’t need any help stopping.” Stop and ask yourself, “Is that really true? How did I feel last time I went without cigarettes for a while?”"

      "content": "Watch out for psychological defense mechanisms. Facing painful truths about yourself can be really tough. So tough, in fact, that your brain sometimes finds ways to protect you from them. Keep a close eye on your own thoughts and behaviors to see if you can spot these patterns in yourself. A few common defense mechanisms include: [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Avoidance. This is when you find ways to avoid dealing with uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, or situations. For example, if you owe a friend a favor but you can’t do it, you might ignore their texts instead of telling them. Denial. Like the name suggests, this involves denying that there’s a problem. For instance, you might refuse to admit to yourself that you have a drinking problem, even if your drinking habits are causing problems with your health or relationships. Projection. This involves seeing your own unwanted behaviors or traits in others. For instance, if you have a temper problem, you might accuse people around you of getting angry too easily. Displacement. This is when you take out your frustrations or other emotions on an alternative target instead of addressing the real cause—for example, if you have a tough day at work and then lash out at your partner instead of trying to work it out with your boss."

It’s totally normal to toot your own horn a bit sometimes—stretching a point or two about your accomplishments and abilities can boost your confidence and help you “fake it ‘til you make it.” [18] X Research source But when it goes too far, it can become a problem. If you find that your actual accomplishments keep falling short of your expectations, ask yourself if you’re being realistic. [19] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For instance, maybe you like to think of yourself as a history whiz, but you keep failing your exams in world civ class because you aren’t studying enough. Or, you exaggerated your skills too much in a job interview and ended up with responsibilities you don’t know how to handle. If think you might be lying to yourself about your own abilities, getting honest feedback from another person can help. For instance, you might ask a teacher, an experienced coworker, or an expert in a subject you’re interested in for an honest assessment of your skills and what you can do to improve. You can also diminish your own abilities in some cases. Your life probably reflects whether you're lying to yourself or not. For example, if you lie to yourself saying that you're not good enough, you may end up with a job that doesn't push you and makes you feel bored all the time.

Chances are that you feel guilty and are trying to make yourself feel better about the fact that you don’t really enjoy helping out. Studies show that people often lie to themselves in order to deceive others more easily.

If you think you’re lying to yourself—especially in the context of a relationship with someone else—ask yourself how your behavior looks to them. [24] X Research source For instance, if your significant other says you have a temper problem, don’t immediately dismiss what they’re saying. Ask yourself, “How often do I snap at them?
