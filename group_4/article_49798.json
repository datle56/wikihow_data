Give them your name and Social Security number, then tell them that you don't want to use the online process but you do want to file a request for reconsideration of your disability claim. They'll walk you through the rest of the process.

      "content": "Write down the reasons for denial written in your notice. The denial letter you got from SSA lists the specific reasons your application was denied. The SSA website has more information about each of these reasons and the factors that go into them. That information can help you determine how to prove the reason is wrong. [3] X Research source For example, suppose your initial application only showed that you were unable to do the job you had most recently. Disability benefits are only available to people who are unable to do any work, so your application was denied because the SSA determined there was other work you could do. This is a common reason for denial! All you need in this case is information proving that you're unable to do any work."

      "title": "Get documents and information that support your arguments.",
      "content": "Get documents and information that support your arguments. If the SSA doesn't have all of your medical records, they're more likely to deny your claim. Make sure your records are complete and accurate—doctors don't always write down everything. If your records aren't very detailed, ask your doctor to write a letter supporting your disability claim. [4] X Research source For example, if you didn't originally submit all of your medical records, the additional medical records could support your appeal, especially if your condition has worsened since your initial application. It doesn't hurt to go through the Blue Book (find it online at https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm ) and read what it says about your disability. That's what the SSA is looking for, so try to get information that makes your case look as much like the description in the Blue Book as possible."

When you're ready, click the button that says \"Start a New Appeal\" to get started. [5] X Research source If you do have to stop at any time, you can save your application and go back to it later. It's also a good idea to save frequently, just in case something happens to your internet connection."

      "content": "Type out the reasons you don't agree with the denial. Go through the reasons listed on your denial notice one by one and discuss why each is wrong. Be as specific as possible! You never know when a detail you wouldn't consider important could make all the difference. Relate the information you provide directly to the reason for the denial. [6] X Research source For example, if you were denied because SSA determined you were able to perform other work, you might write: \"When my arthritis began, I continued working. However, the pain and swelling increased to the point that I could no longer work as a secretary. I took a job as a greeter at a local department store, but within a year I was unable to stand due to arthritis in my knees and feet.\" If you're using the paper form, you'll notice that there are only a few lines for you to write the reasons you disagree with the denial.

The hearing takes place at a location within 75 miles of your address. If you're going to have trouble traveling to the location of the hearing, let the SSA know as soon as possible—there might be resources available to help you, including money for travel expenses.
