      "title": "Take turns asking players “Would You Rather” questions.",
      "content": "Take turns asking players “Would You Rather” questions. Pose a question to another player that provides two opposing scenarios in the format “Would you rather _____ OR _____ ?” Usually, the question presents two undesirable options or two options that a player would be equally interested in. The player must then answer the question by selecting one of the options. Then, they can ask a new question to another player. [3] X Research source Play continues in this pattern until players get bored or run out of questions. “ Would You Rather ” can be played with any number of people, but requires at least two players. If desired, players can choose a consequence for someone refusing to answer a question. Maybe they have to complete a dare or take a shot (if everyone is over the legal drinking age). When using a numbered list of Would You Rather questions, players can choose random numbers or use a number generator to select their questions rather than having to come up with a new question on each turn.
