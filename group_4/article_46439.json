      "content": "Go with T15, T11, T27, or T35 if your hair is naturally dark. If your natural hair color is brown or black and you’ve recently dyed it blonde, there’s likely a lot of orange in the strands. The lightest Wella toners won’t be able to cancel out the brassiness completely. Instead, opt for a richer beige shade to lift your color. These shades are also great if you want hair that’s light but not quite platinum. [1] X Research source If you want to lighten your hair after using the medium shade, wait a few weeks, then tone again with a lighter toner, like T10, T18, T14, or T28. Now that the orange has been lifted out, your hair will be able to pick up the platinum shades more effectively. To see what these shades look like, view Wella’s shade chart ."

      "content": "Choose T10, T18, T14, or T28 to get a pale or ash blonde shade. These lightest, whitest shades will get you to a platinum color if your hair is already a lemony blonde. If your hair is still brassy and orange, wait on using this light toner, because it won’t be strong enough to noticeably change the shade of your hair. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a 10 volume developer with a darker toner.",
      "content": "Use a 10 volume developer with a darker toner. Choosing a developer is important , because hair developer helps open up the hair cuticle so that it can pick up the color more effectively. A 10 volume developer is the least powerful, and works best if you’re trying to maintain ash brown hair or if you’re trying to get rid of only mild brassy tones. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a 20 volume developer on hair tinted a darker orange.",
      "content": "Choose a 20 volume developer on hair tinted a darker orange. A stronger 20 volume developer will not only open up your hair cuticle to help the toner take effect, but will also lighten your hair on its own. This makes it a great choice if you’re looking to tone your hair to a very light blonde shade or if your hair is a more noticeable orange color. [4] X Research source Don’t use a 30 or 40 volume developer at home. Higher volume developers could seriously damage your hair if not applied by a professional colorist. Restoring damaged hair is possible, but it’s best to avoid it if you can."

      "content": "Apply toner right after bleaching for the fastest results. Toner works best if you’ve already bleached your hair , because it will lighten or darken strands that are already around the shade you want. After bleaching, rinse your hair with water. If you’re toning immediately afterwards, don’t condition just yet. [5] X Research source Although many people choose to tone right after bleaching, you may need a few days to buy your toner or to decide if you want to use one at all. Don’t worry! You can tone your hair at any point after bleaching it."

It’s best to apply toner to hair that’s still a bit wet so it gets distributed evenly, so dry your hair enough so that it’s still slightly damp but not dripping. If you’re not using toner right after bleaching, simply wash your hair with shampoo beforehand and towel dry the same way."

It’s best to wait at least 24 hours before you shampoo your newly-toned hair to make sure the color won’t fade before it’s fully set in.

Use a sulfate-free shampoo made specifically for color-treated hair, which is gentle enough to help your toner stay put. Try using dry shampoo if you need to wash your hair more often.

[13] X Research source Don’t go any longer than 10 minutes or use the shampoo or conditioner any more frequently than once a week. Overusing purple shampoo will leave your hair looking dull or even gray. For the same reason, only use purple shampoo or purple conditioner, not both."

Standing under a shower for a minute or so before jumping in the pool allows your hair to soak up clean water, which means it won’t be able to absorb as much pool water. For extra protection, rub a bit of conditioner into your hair from the middle of your head down to the tips. After you get out, wash your hair as soon as you can with your sulfate-free shampoo. [16] X Research source If you can’t take a shower before you get in the pool, empty a water bottle over your head. Use the same process before and after you swim in the ocean, as well."
