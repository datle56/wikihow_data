      "content": "Open the Command Prompt (Windows only). If you're on a computer with DOS as the operating system, the command prompt should appear automatically when you boot up the computer. If you're using a Windows computer, you'll need to start the Windows Command Prompt . To do so, click the Windows Start button and type cmd . Then click Command Prompt . You should see a window with \"C:\\>\", \"C:\\DOCUMENTS AND SETTINGS\\[your name]>\", or something similar. This is called the \"command prompt.\" The letter at the beginning of the command prompt (i.e. \"C:\\\") tells you what drive letter you are in. The text after the drive letter tells you what directory or folder you are in. For access to more commands, hidden files, the ability to add and delete users , change user passwords , and more administrative abilities, you'll need to run the Command Prompt as an administrator . If you are having technical issues with Windows, you can boot your computer into the Command Prompt . This allows you to run your computer just using a command line, which is more efficient than the Windows graphical user interface. You can run programs more quickly and efficiently, as well as delete programs infected with viruses and malware."

      "title": "List the contents of a directory or folder.",
      "content": "List the contents of a directory or folder. To do so, type dir and press Enter . This lists the contents of the directory or folder you are in. The most important thing you should be able to do is to list the contents of directories and navigate them. Files are listed by file size, followed by the file name (i.e, \"countdown.txt\"). Directories and folders will have the tag \"<DIR>\" in front of them followed by the directory name. Type dir followed by the name or path to a directory and press Enter to view the contents of that directory instead of the current directory you are in. For example, type dir c:\\documents and press Enter to view the contents of your Documents directory from within any directory. If the list of contents in a directory is particularly long, add /p to the end of the directory command (i.e, dir documents /p . The list will stop and wait for you to press a key every time the text reaches the end of the screen. This can also be used in most other DOS commands that print text on the screen."

      "title": "Navigate to another directory.",
      "content": "Navigate to another directory. To do so, type cd followed by a directory name and press Enter . For example, if you wanted to change to the \"Games\" directory , you would type cd games and press Enter If the directory is in another directory, you would separate each subdirectory name with a \"\\\". For example, if you want to navigate to a folder called \"Mortar\" within the \"Games\" directory, you would type cd games\\mortar and press Enter . You can also specify the full path of the directory you want to navigate to (i.e, cd c:\\games\\mortar . If the directory has spaces in the title, you need to put the name of the directory in quotation marks. For example cd \"mortar mayhem\" . To go back to the previous directory . type cd.. and press Enter . To return to the root of your hard drive, simply type cd\\ and press Enter . This will return you to \"C:\\>.\""

If you want to want to change to another drive, such as a D: drive, a CD/DVD ROM, a flash drive, or another external device, simply type the drive letter followed by a colon (\":\") and press Enter . For example, type D: and press Enter to change to the D: drive. You can do this from within any directory. You can also format, and partition a drive using the DOS or the Command Prompt."

For example, if you wanted to start the game Mortar Mayhem, you would navigate to the directory it's in, type mortar.exe , and press Enter . You can do the same thing using batch files and other scripts. If the file name or program has spaces in the title, you need to put the file name in quotation marks. Running programs from within DOS or the Command Prompt allows you to use switches and flags that allow you to do specific things with a program, rather than just running an executable file. For example, if you design a level for the original DOOM 2 (a \".wad\" file), you would navigate to the folder that contains your WAD file and the DOOM2.exe file. Then you would type doom2.exe -file filename.wad and press Enter to launch DOOM 2 with your custom level.
