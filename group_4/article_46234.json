Then, put on a snug-fitting pair of disposable medical gloves. It is important to put on gloves when using Nystatin to treat a fungal infection.

Avoid wearing latex gloves if you have a latex allergy. However, this probably won’t be an issue since most disposable gloves are made of nitrile."

      "content": "Apply enough Nystatin to cover the affected area. Squeeze a pea-sized amount of Nystatin onto your clean (or gloved) fingertip.

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If a large area of your skin is infected, apply another pea-sized amount of Nystatin as necessary to cover it. It’s best to err on the side of applying Nystatin sparingly rather than leaving lots of excess cream that sits atop the skin."
