      "content": "Practice gaiting. Gaiting is moving your dog in a way that allows the judge to see their movement and structure. The correct gait is usually a trot, with the dogs head up. A trotting dog’s right front leg and left back leg move forward at the same time, then the left front with the right back. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Trotting is the correct pace because it shows the dog’s true structure the best. To start, use treats to lure your dog to follow you around without a lead. The dog should remain at your left side. Once the dog is comfortable wearing the collar and walking beside you, formal lead training can begin. Attach a show lead to the dog's collar, pick up the dog and carry it a short distance away from your home. Put it down and walk back toward your house at a speed that encourages the dog to trot, holding the other end of the lead. The dog should be happy to go toward home and follow you. Repeat this process, carrying the dog farther away from home each time. If your dog fights the lead, back away and offer it treats to come toward you."

      "title": "Teach your dog to “hand stack.”",
      "content": "Teach your dog to “hand stack.” To succeed, all dogs must learn to \"stack,\" or stand squarely and still. In hand stacking, you manually place each leg in position while standing or kneeling close to the dog. Dogs will have to stack several times during a show. Many people let dogs \"free stack\" most of the time, but hand stack right before the judge's examination. This ensures the best possible stance for the dog. [2] X Research source The specific position your dog should be in will vary by breed. Consult the guidelines for your breed, available from the appropriate club. [4] X Research source Sometimes with wiggly dogs it’s easier to stack them on blocks, boards or bricks that are elevated a few inches off the ground so the dog learns to trust where you set his feet and feels secure with your placement, but if he moves his feet on his own he becomes unbalanced. To train for hand stacking, keep a good-sized treat in your right hand. Keep it partially covered so the dog can only nibble on it as you adjust the positions of the dog's feet with your left hand. Adjust the dog's front legs first, moving them at the elbow. Then, keeping your left hand on the dog at all times, move to the back legs and adjust them at the hock. Never stack by touching the dog's feet, as this may cause it to shift its whole body. Repeat this until your dog is comfortable with the process. [4] X Research source Finally, teach the dog to maintain that position. Pull the food away for a second and tell the dog to stay. If it holds the position, say \"yes!\" and give the dog a nibble of the food. If it doesn't, restack the dog and try again. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Teach your dog to \"free stack.\"",
      "content": "Teach your dog to \"free stack.\" Free stacking is when your dog assumes the proper position on command, rather than with manual adjustment. This is most easily done with some training treats and clicker. To begin with, click and reward your dog whenever it stands. If it keeps standing, reward it again. Keep doing this until the dog offers the stand position spontaneously. [6] X Research source Next teach “back up.” Step toward the dog and click and treat any shift of movement backward, which should result in the dogs back legs aligning. Repeat this process with the command, clicking and reward increasingly correct backing up behavior. [7] X Research source Then, teach the dog to align its front legs with the command \"step.\" To teach this command, step back and click and treat as soon as the dog moves a front foot forward. Once the dog does this easily, say “step” just before you prompt it. Repeat this until the dog aligns it's front feet on command. [8] X Research source Finally, teach the command \"stack.\" Click and treat every time the dog is in the correct position. Repeat if the dog holds that position. Eventually, you'll be able to just use the \"stack\" command without \"back up\" and \"step.\" [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Bait train your dog. You want your dog to also look alert and happy when stacked. Most breeds should have their attention on the handler and the judge, and have their ears perked and their eyes on you. Training your dog to look at you is something you can begin the first time you feed the dog a meal. When you put the food bowl down, repeat the word “cookie\" over and over. This repetition will teach the puppy to associate a food with that word. Later, use this command to focus your dog's attention on you while offering it treats from your hand when it is in a stacked position. This causes the dog stretch its neck upward to look at you. This pose shows the dogs outline and balance to the judge."

      "content": "Teach the dog tolerate examination. In a dog show, judges will physically examine a dog, touching its body and mouth. A successful show dog will need to tolerate this without complaint. A good first step in getting your dog accustomed to this is to touch the dog all over its body daily, including inside its mouth. If you start this at a young age, your dog will quickly grow accustomed to it. [10] X Research source Next, begin giving your dog regular inspections that approximate those of a judge. Closely examine the dog's teeth. For males, touch the testicles. [11] X Research source Do this on both a table and the floor, if your dog is smaller in size. While small dogs are usually inspected on a table, some judges will begin inspection while the dog is still on the ground. Finally, when the dog is comfortable with your inspections, bring in a second person and ask ask them to do the same. This way, your dog will get comfortable with inspection by strangers."

The Resco is a loop with a slider to keep it snug on the dog’s neck. [21] X Research source For a medium sized dog, you can use a martingale lead. These leads close up enough to keep your dog's head from slipping out, but don't tighten around a dog's neck like a choke-chain. [22] X Research source They also help to train your dog to keep its head held up high while showing judges their gait, and while stacking. The other commonly used lead is the chain and show lead. This is not as elegant as the martingale, but many handlers use them for larger, boxer breeds such as the Rottweiler. These also help your dog to keep its head held high, and to not run away in the ring."
