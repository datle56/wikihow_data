      "content": "Check the label to see if the clothing is washer friendly. Most cotton or cotton-blend hoodies are machine washable. Wool, however, is not as tough as cotton and the fabric will get damaged in a washing machine and ruin the hoodie. If your hoodie is made of wool, you’ll need to take it to the dry cleaners. You can dry clean cotton, but since it’s tougher it can be machine washed many times."

      "content": "Turn the hoodie inside out. Make sure to zip any zippers before doing so to keep them from snagging on other pieces of clothing in the washer. Washing the hoodie this way not only cleans the inside material, it protects the finish of the outside of the hoodie. [1] X Research source When you turn the hoodie inside out, don’t forget to pull the hood and sleeves out of the middle of the garment. Otherwise, they won’t get cleaned properly!"

      "content": "Use cold water and mild detergent when washing your hoodie. This will help the hoodie keep its appearance for as long as possible.

Pick the delicate cycle on your washing machine to keep the material safe. [3] X Research source Cold water will also prevent the hoodie from fading. Consult the hoodie’s care tag label to see how much detergent you should use."

      "title": "Fill a bucket big enough to fit your hoodie with cold water.",
      "content": "Fill a bucket big enough to fit your hoodie with cold water. You’ll be dunking your hoodie in the cold water, so you want to use a bucket that will allow you to do this. If you don’t have a bucket big enough for the job, fill up your bathtub or sink. Water will most likely spill out of the bucket when you do this, so make sure to work in an area that won’t be affected by this."

      "title": "Apply mild soap or shampoo by rubbing it onto the hoodie.",
      "content": "Apply mild soap or shampoo by rubbing it onto the hoodie. If you’re using a bar of soap, wet it slightly and gently rub the inside and outside of your hoodie until every part has been covered. If you’re using body wash or shampoo, squeeze a small amount onto a damp cloth and rub the cloth all around the hoodie. [4] X Research source Always apply the soap or shampoo above the bucket of water. This makes cleaning up after you’re done that much easier!"

      "title": "Rinse the soap or shampoo off with cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the soap or shampoo off with cold water. Take a cloth and wipe away the visible soap or shampoo. If you miss any of soap or shampoo, it could stain the hoodie. Feel free to dunk the hoodie into your bucket of water multiple times to get all the soap or shampoo out."

Instead, press down on the hoodie with 2 hands to get rid of the extra soap and water. Press every part of the hoodie inside and out to ensure you don’t miss any soap or water. Put the hoodie on a towel to do this, as you don’t want that extra water getting everywhere. Make sure the towel is on a flat surface."

      "content": "Roll up the hoodie in a dry towel to speed up the drying process. Use a different towel than the one you used in the previous step. Lay the hoodie flat with its sleeves at its side and roll up the towel from the bottom with the hoodie on top of it. Then, stand over your sink or bathtub and press down on the towel to squeeze out any more excess water. You will need a towel that is bigger than the hoodie itself."

      "content": "Lay the hoodie on a separate towel to air-dry it. This is the third different towel you’ll need to use to dry the hoodie. Place the towel on the floor or on your bathroom counter and put the hoodie on it. Let the hoodie sit overnight before wearing it again.
