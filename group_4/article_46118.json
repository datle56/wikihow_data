[1] X Research source If you were involved in a breach, then you should change the password for the sites that it says that you were breached in and change the password anywhere else you used it if your password was also leaked in the breach. Note that sensitive data breaches won't appear on this list. Sensitive breaches are breaches that you probably don't want anybody to know that you're in if you are in them (like the Ashley Madison breach). If you want to see sensitive breaches, then you will have to subscribe for notifications and click on the link in the verification email that you receive. [2] X Research source"
