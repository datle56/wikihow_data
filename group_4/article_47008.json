      "content": "Your vape may have a battery or connection issue. Vapes come in a wide variety of styles and brands so there isn’t a universal warning system across all devices—it really depends on the manufacturer. On some models and brands of vapes, a light flashing 3 times may indicate that your battery is low or that your vape battery and cartridge aren’t connecting properly. Check your device’s user manual to get a more accurate idea of what’s going on. Tip: Experienced vapers suggest testing the different components of your vape to narrow down what’s causing the blinking. Separate your vape tank from the battery and then hit the button again—if your pen still blinks, a battery issue is a likely culprit. If it doesn’t blink, there might be a connection plate issue or a problem with the vape coil."

      "content": "You’re taking a really long hit on your vape. Many vapes are programmed to shut off if you take a really long puff (like 10 seconds or longer). If your vape started blinking right after your last puff, your device might just be telling you to take shorter hits in the future. Check your vape’s user manual to see what the exact cut-off time is."

      "title": "Your vape is short-circuiting.",
      "content": "Your vape is short-circuiting. In rare cases, a vape might blink instead of operating correctly to let you know that the device isn’t working properly. This might happen after you’ve dropped the vape on the ground or gotten it wet. In most cases, you’re better off getting a new vape (especially if it’s a disposable one); in other cases, you might be able to replace the coil in your vape to get it working again. Tip: If your device is wet, try blowing a steady stream of air through the vape while covering the lower air vents with a paper towel—this is a great way to force most of the water out. Then, stick your wet vape in a sealed baggie filled with dry rice or silica gel packets for at least a day and see if that helps. Check your vape’s user manual for specific guidance on how to troubleshoot a short-circuiting device."

      "title": "Lift up the connection plate on your vape battery if your device won’t work.",
      "content": "Lift up the connection plate on your vape battery if your device won’t work. Unscrew the battery from the rest of your e-cig and hold it with the threads facing up—the connection plate is the small, metal circle along the top of the battery. Insert a paper clip or tiny flathead screwdriver beneath the edge of the plate to lift a portion of it up. Then, guide your paper clip or screwdriver around the circumference of the connection plate to raise the rest of it up. Once you’ve lifted the connection plate halfway up the battery threads, stop adjusting it. [3] X Research source At this point, reassemble your vape—just be sure not to twist the components together too tightly, or else your device might not work properly. Tip: If the connection plate is pressed too far down into your vape battery, your device might malfunction. This strategy works especially well with vapes that have 510 thread batteries, like O2VAPE, Ooze, and Yocan."

      "content": "Adjust the connection plate on your vape cartridge if your vape won’t fire. Pick up your vape cartridge and flip it over to find the connection plate—it should resemble a small metal circle with a hole drilled down the center. Using a paper clip or tiny flathead screwdriver, pry up the connection plate slightly and lift all the way around (so it’s just slightly higher than the metal threads surrounding it). Reassemble your vape as you usually would and see if it works. [4] X Research source Tip: Don’t make too many adjustments to this connection plate, or else you might hurt the cartridge. This troubleshooting tip is particularly helpful for vapes with 510 thread batteries."

If so, lightly dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and carefully wipe down the surface of the plate. Blot away any excess rubbing alcohol with a paper towel, and then set your battery aside so it can dry completely. Once the component is dry, put the pieces of your vape back together. [5] X Research source Tip: Make sure that you’re using a high-quality cartridge or a cartridge that’s designed for your vape; otherwise, oil might leak onto the battery. Be sure to try this tip if your device has a 510 thread battery (like an Ooze, Yocan, or O2VAPE)."

On the opposite end of the USB port, look for a circular connection plate. Using a tiny flathead screwdriver or a paper clip, lift up the plate so it sits a little bit above the surrounding threads. Then, plug in your vape and look for the lights that indicate it's charging. [6] X Research source"

To fix this, simply grab a blow dryer, set it to low heat, and blow over the opening of the cartridge. Then, gently reassemble your vape. Tip: If you don’t have a hair dryer handy, grab a really thin item like a safety pin or toothpick and gently stick it into the opening along the top of your cartridge."

      "content": "Vape tasting burnt Vape hits develop a burnt taste when the atomizer (the part of your device that creates the vapor) ignites the vape’s wick instead of the e-liquid. If your hits have a pretty nasty flavor, try replacing the coil in your e-cig. If you have a disposable vape, get a new vape rather than replacing the coil."

The mouthpiece and cartridge can be cleaned with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, while the outside of the battery can just be cleaned off with a cotton swab. Then, let all of your vape components dry completely before reassembling them. Always consult your vape’s user manual before you start cleaning your device. Never soak your vape battery in water or any sort of cleaner. If your vape has a tank, take time to drain it, clean it out, and soak it in a mixture of rubbing alcohol and water."
