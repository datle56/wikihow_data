The day and year are represented by numerals, while the month is spelled out. The elements of the date are separated by the word \"de,\" translated as \"of.\" For example, if you wanted to write the date \"October 3, 2017\" in Spanish, you would write \"3 de octubre de 2017\" (literal translation: third of October of 2017).

This changes with the first of the month, when the word \"primero\" (meaning \"first\") typically is used. [5] X Research source For example, you could write January 1st as \"primero de enero.\" If you wanted to write the first of the month with a numeral, you would use a \"1\" followed by a superscripted \"o,\" like this: 1º de enero de 2017."

For example, the year \"1900\" would be spelled out in Spanish as \"mil novecientos,\" which translates literally to \"one thousand, nine hundred.\" There is no Spanish equivalent to the phrase \"nineteen hundred,\" which is how you would say it in English.
