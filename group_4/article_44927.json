      "content": "Make sure your parrot has bonded with you. You should know your bird's body language before attempting to trim its claws. If your bird does not feel comfortable with you, you should wait until you've bonded with it a bit before trimming its claws. The experience will be more traumatic if your bird doesn't trust you. [1] X Research source If your bird sings, talks, or whistles in your presence, this is a sign it is comfortable with you. If your bird flaps its wings in your presence, this is also a good sign. Your bird is attempting to get your attention and is happy to see you. Your parrot may also wag its tail, much like a dog, to convey happiness."

[2] X Research source You will need a pair of nail clippers. You can usually use nail clippers made for people as long as the blade is strong enough. If your parrot has particularly tough nails, try toenail clippers. You will need some kind of blood stopping powder in the event your bird starts bleeding. You can find this at a pet store. Make sure the powder is safe to use on birds. You will need a towel. Make sure it's a plain color, like white, as birds may be frightened of colorful towels."

Call it softly and say things like, \"Good bird\" as it approaches the towel. Let the bird stand on the towel for a few minutes. You want it to be comfortable with the towel before proceeding."

The quick is pink, and you should be able to see it in the nails. With dark colored nails, this can be trickier. Just trim a small amount of the nail at a time. With darker nails, you should only ever trim off the tips of the nails as the risk of accidentally cutting into the quick is higher."
