      "content": "Plug your guitar or bass directly into the amp. If you're using any effects pedals, are plugged in through a mixer, or have any other equipment in the chain, bypass them all for now and connect your instrument directly to the amp. If your amp doesn't pick up the radio without your other gear connected, you'll know the problem is not your amp, but either your other gear or a cable. If your amp only picks up the radio when your guitar is connected but not when the cable is connected with no instrument, it's safe to assume the problem is your guitar —especially if you're playing a guitar with a single-coil pickup. You can likely fix the problem by shielding the guitar with copper tape or shielding paint, or by adding a noise-reduction processor to the chain. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a different cable.",
      "content": "Try a different cable. In most cases, an old, poorly shielded guitar cable is why your amp picks up radio signals. Not all guitar cables are shielded equally, and over time, the insulation on the cable can break down from being stepped on, coiled and uncoiled, bent, and otherwise damaged. [2] X Research source This allows outside signals, including interference from local AM or FM radio stations, to bleed in and play through your amp. You can find shielded instrument cables on Amazon , as well as at your local music store. If you're using multiple cables with your gear, such as patch cables, you're going to need to test each cable."

    {
      "title": "Try a different power cord and/or outlet.",
      "content": "Try a different power cord and/or outlet. If you have another power cable, try replacing it to see if the cable is picking up interference. Also, try plugging your amp into a different outlet, bypassing any power strips and extension cords. Some musicians recommend tying a knot in the amp's power cord close to where the cord plugs into the back of the amp. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Move the amp.",
      "content": "Move the amp. If you're using the amp in a location close to the radio transmitter, it will be tricky to stop it from picking up your local radio station. If possible, try moving the amp to a different location, such as to a lower level of your home. However, this is not always possible—these signals are tough to avoid. If this is the issue, you’ve probably noticed other electronics in your home having similar problems. Your headphones might pick up on noise from your computer jack, or a stereo system might not play as clearly as it should."

    {
      "title": "Plug a different instrument into the amp.",
      "content": "Plug a different instrument into the amp. If you have another guitar or bass nearby, plug it into the amp that's picking up radio waves. If you can only hear the radio when a specific instrument is connected, the issue could be related to something in that instrument—sometimes the instrument lacks shielding, which you can usually fix at home , or by using a ferrite choke. To narrow things down, try plugging the instrument into a different amp. Bass amps generally block such signals, so stick to a guitar amp if possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a ferrite choke on your cords.",
      "content": "Use a ferrite choke on your cords. A ferrite choke, or a ferrite ring, is an effective signal noise filter for your instrument and power cables. You can buy them from Amazon or your local guitar shop. All you'll need to do is clip a ferrite wrap around your guitar cable near the connector and see if that stops the amp from picking up the radio. If not, you can also try adding a connector to your amp's power cable."

    {
      "title": "Check for power issues.",
      "content": "Check for power issues. Grounding problems are notorious for amp noise, including picking up radio signals. Use a cord just as long as it has to be to reach the outlet—a longer cable doesn’t have as much capacity as a short cord, and make sure it's at least 18 AWG. Grounding issues could also be caused by your amp, in which case, you'd need a technician to fix the issue."

      "title": "Test the control knobs one by one to see if they affect radio interference.",
      "content": "Test the control knobs one by one to see if they affect radio interference. Next to the guitar cable input, locate the knobs for the volume, gain, channel, reverb, and other effects. Turn the amp on and adjust each knob individually to see if the radio sound diminishes or gets stronger. If you hear the radio more when turning a knob, there could be loose wiring or a bad solder somewhere in the amp. [4] X Research source As you test the controls, reset each knob to its original position before moving on to the next one. This will help you eliminate switches as you go."

    {
      "title": "Adjust the tone to see if the preamp is the issue.",
      "content": "Adjust the tone to see if the preamp is the issue. The preamp has lower voltage capacities and changes the bass, middle, and treble tones before the sound carries through to the main amp. The preamp is also responsible for boosting your instrument's signal while removing interference. [5] X Research source One by one, adjust the level of each tone while playing your guitar to see if they have any effect on the radio sound. Remember to return each knob to its original setting before testing the next one."

      "content": "Fix loose wires or insulate frayed ones leading to control knobs. If you've found a problem with a knob, you may be able to fix the amp yourself. However, don't try this unless you're skilled at working on electronics. Unplug your amp from power, then open the back of the amp to access the wiring panel. Do not remove the amp chassis (the metal box that has tubes and wires on its outside) from the cabinet, as this can lead to electrocution. Find the wires that lead to the knob that is letting in the radio interference and check if it's loose or frayed. [6] X Research source If a wire is loose, try pushing it back into place. If it’s frayed, wrap copper tape around it to create a new layer of insulation. If you’re uncertain of what you’re doing, take your amp to a technician so they can safely examine it for you. You can tell them where you suspect the problem is coming from, which will make it easier for them to repair."

      "title": "Take your amp to a technician for necessary wiring or soldering repairs.",
      "content": "Take your amp to a technician for necessary wiring or soldering repairs. Your amp uses high voltage, which makes it dangerous to repair if you don't know what you're doing. [7] X Research source If you aren’t comfortable with the wiring in your amp, play it safe and let a professional look at your amp for you. Or, you could ask someone you know who has more experience and take a look at it. Call your local music store to see if they have a technician who works on amps. They should be able to give you an over-the-phone repair price estimate. Wiring problems are sometimes caused by broken, worn down, or loose joints. The joints have to be resoldered , which is something an amp technician can do."

      "content": "Gather some materials. If you've narrowed the RF issue down to your single coil pickup guitar, you can likely fix the problem by shielding the inside of your guitar. This will work on any electric guitar—you'll just need to be able to open your guitar to access the pickup cavities. Shielding creates a \"Faraday cage\" effect around the components that are picking up the signal. Shielding your guitar isn't hard to do, but you'll need a few supplies: Copper shielding tape Get a wider tape you can easily cut to match the shape of your guitar's inner walls, and make sure the adhesive is conductive A sharp hobby knife, such as an Xacto A multimeter The appropriate screwdrivers for accessing the pickup cavities of your guitar Scissors Rubbing alcohol Cloth for cleaning"

      "content": "Open the guitar and clean the cavity. For example, on a Stratocaster, you'll want to remove the strings , then unscrew the pickguard to expose the cavity. To ensure the shielding tape properly adheres to the walls of the guitar, you'll want to wipe the inner walls of your guitar clean. Because you'll also want to tape the inside of the pickguard, clean that as well. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cover the inner walls with copper tape, including the back of the pickguard.",
      "content": "Cover the inner walls with copper tape, including the back of the pickguard. You will need to use your hobby knife to cut pieces that fit inside the guitar. An important thing to keep in mind: Every piece of tape should overlap with another piece of tape for continuity. Remember, you're trying to line the guitar to block out signals completely, so cover as much of the inner wall surfaces as you can. Use a small tool to securely press the tape into the corners. Even something like a pencil or tweezers will work."

    {
      "title": "Test continuity with a multimeter.",
      "content": "Test continuity with a multimeter. Put your multimeter into continuity mode and touch both wands to overlapping pieces of foil. If you hear a beep, you're good. If not, you'll have to go back and look for gaps or places where your tape is bubbling or not sticking. [9] X Research source If there's continuity and your guitar's inner components are now coated in tape, you can close up your guitar and plug it back in."

      "title": "Avoid letting your amp get too hot or cold.",
      "content": "Avoid letting your amp get too hot or cold. Like any sensitive piece of electrical equipment, your amp will last longer and perform better if it isn’t exposed to extreme temperatures. Keep it away from air conditioning vents, radiators, space heaters, and other similar heating or cooling elements. For example, if you need to drive your amp to a venue in the middle of winter, let your vehicle warm up before transferring the amp. Going from a warm to a really cold location puts a lot of strain on your amp and can cause issues."

    {
      "title": "Keep your amp dry to prevent electrical problems.",
      "content": "Keep your amp dry to prevent electrical problems. Avoid using your amp as a side table or putting drinks on top of it. If you’re playing outdoors, purchase a rain cover for it in case there’s inclement weather. Electrical problems could mess with the wiring or joints and make interference more likely. If the amp is on and it gets wet, you could get electrocuted. Use caution if you find yourself in that situation."

      "title": "Protect your amp from getting jostled or dropped.",
      "content": "Protect your amp from getting jostled or dropped. Fasten a seatbelt or strap around the amp to keep it from bumping around while it’s being transported. If it’s really heavy, consider using a dolly or something similar to move it around so it’s less likely to get dropped. [10] X Research source While your amp is pretty hardy on the outside, the inside is made up of a lot of different pieces, some of which are very sensitive. Older amps are likely to get damaged if they’re knocked around too much."

      "title": "Let your amp warm up on standby for at least 1 minute before playing.",
      "content": "Let your amp warm up on standby for at least 1 minute before playing. After you turn on the amp, flip the standby switch to mute all the sound while the amp is getting ready. This gives the internal filaments time to heat up before you start playing. [11] X Research source Not warming up and sending lots of electricity and sound through your amp can cause a lot of wear and tear, plus the sound quality might not be as good."

      "title": "Protect the internal wiring with a dust cover when your amp isn’t in use.",
      "content": "Protect the internal wiring with a dust cover when your amp isn’t in use. Dust can get inside the amp and cause wiring problems, which then lead to a higher likelihood that you’ll experience interference. Especially if you don’t use your amp every day, take a few moments to cover it up while it’s off to the side or in storage. Similarly, use a clean, lint-free towel to wipe down the front, back, and top of your amp every few days if you’re using it regularly. This will keep dust from accumulating."
