You can use the phrase \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally,\" or the acronym PEMDAS, to help you remember Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. [1] X Research source For example, if the problem is 4 ( x 10 ÷ x 4 ) ÷ 2 ( x 3 × x 2 ) − 3 x 0 {\\displaystyle 4(x^{10}\\div x^{4})\\div 2(x^{3}\\times x^{2})-3x^{0}} , you would first complete the calculations inside the parentheses."

[2] X Research source For example, x 10 ÷ x 4 {\\displaystyle x^{10}\\div x^{4}} can simplify to x 10 − 4 {\\displaystyle x^{10-4}} , or x 6 {\\displaystyle x^{6}} . x 3 × x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{3}\\times x^{2}} can simplify to x 3 + 2 {\\displaystyle x^{3+2}} , or x 5 {\\displaystyle x^{5}} . x 0 {\\displaystyle x^{0}} is 1, since any number to the zero power is 1. So, the simplified problem becomes 4 ( x 6 ) ÷ 2 ( x 5 ) − 3 ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle 4(x^{6})\\div 2(x^{5})-3(1)} ."

Then, divide the exponents: x 6 ÷ x 5 {\\displaystyle x^{6}\\div x^{5}} = x 6 − 5 {\\displaystyle x^{6-5}} = x 1 {\\displaystyle x^{1}} = x {\\displaystyle x} .
