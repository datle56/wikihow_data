      "content": "Choose a belt with a little extra length. Whether you’re wearing a dress or casual belt, there should only be a bit of material left over after it’s fastened, around 2 in (5.1 cm) to 4 in (10 cm). You should be able to tuck the end of your belt into the first belt loop on your pants, or the loop on the belt itself. You can try on belts in the store to make sure you get the right length. You can also choose a belt based on your pant size. If you wear pants with a 34 in (86 cm) waist, choose a belt that’s labeled 36 in (91 cm) to 38 in (97 cm). Ideally, you should be able to secure the belt in the third hole. If you go to the 4th or 5th holes, there will be a lot of extra material hanging out; if you only fasten it through the first hole, the end of the belt might not make it to the belt loop."

      "title": "Choose cloth belts for everyday wear.",
      "content": "Choose cloth belts for everyday wear. A casual, everyday belt can be made of pretty much any material you like. Cloth belts are usually your best bet, just because they’ll match a lot of things (as opposed to something like a snakeskin belt). [2] X Research source If you want, you can also choose 1 or 2 belts with a funky, fun pattern for casual occasions."

      "title": "Pay attention to the buckle.",
      "content": "Pay attention to the buckle. Belt buckles come in lots of sizes and finishes. In general, the larger a belt buckle is, the more casual the look. Dress belts tend to have smaller buckles. If you’re picking an everyday belt, you can choose a slightly larger buckle. If you’re looking for a belt to wear with dress pants, choose a small buckle. [3] X Research source Belt widths will correspond to buckle size. So a belt with a large buckle will usually be wider. A dress belt with a smaller buckle will be more narrow. Large belt buckles tend to look more casual, while smaller, narrow buckles tend to look more formal. You don’t have to match the finish of your buckle exactly. If you tend to wear silver accessories and jewelry, look for silver buckles, but you can also wear gold buckles occasionally. Some common belt buckle types include single tongue, webbing, clip on, and clip latch buckles."

      "content": "Choose your belt’s width by the formality of your pants. If you’re wearing casual pants – light jeans or cargo pants – a wide belt is best. If you’re wearing dressier pants – dress pants, chinos, or dark denim – you should choose a narrower belt. Wide here means around 1.5 in (3.8 cm). Narrow is around 1.25 in (3.2 cm)."

      "title": "Match your belt and shoe color.",
      "content": "Match your belt and shoe color. If you’re wearing black shoes, you should choose a black belt, regardless of width. The same goes for brown shoes – wear a brown belt. [4] X Research source If you can only afford 1 belt right now, pick a black one. Black will blend in with your pants and you can therefore wear it with pretty much anything. You can also get reversible belts, with 1 black side and 1 brown side, for more variety. Your pants should be in the same color family as your shoes. So black or dark blue pants with black shoes, and khakis or lighter gray pants with brown shoes."

But matching the material of your belt and shoes will make you look even more put together! Wear a leather belt if you’re wearing leather shoes, a canvas belt if you’re wearing canvas shoes, and a suede belt if you’re wearing suede shoes. [5] X Research source If you’re dressed up, leather or suede shoes and belts are bets. If you’re going for a more casual look, a canvas belt with canvas shoes is fine."

Thread the belt end through each loop, pulling the belt through as you go. Once you reach the last loop, buckle your belt. [6] X Research source The buckling process will vary based on your belt's type of buckle (single tongue, webbing, etc.)."

      "content": "Secure your belt with a single tongue buckle. A single tongue buckle has a prong attached to one side of the frame of the buckle. Thread the end of your belt through your belt loops as you normally would. Then take the end of the belt and push it through the frame of the buckle. When the belt feels tight enough, push the prong through the closest hole in the end of your belt. Then tuck the end of the belt in the closest belt loop. To unlatch your buckle, untuck the loose end of the belt, and pull it in the opposite direction until the prong pops out of the hole. Pull the loose end back through the frame of the buckle, then pull the belt back through your belt loops."

Then thread the end of the belt up through the middle of the buckle frame, between the loop of fabric permanently attached to the belt, and the post used to secure the loose end. Once it's threaded through, fold the loose end over the post, then under the outside of the frame, pulling on the end until it feels tight. Tuck the loose end of your belt into another belt loop. Unlatch your buckle by taking the loose end of the belt out of your belt loops. Then thread it back up over the post and down through the middle of the belt. Then pull the belt out through your belt loops."

Then slide the loose end of your belt between the top of your buckle and the bottom of the frame. Once it's pulled tight, clip the buckle down to secure the belt. Tuck the loose end of your belt into the closest belt loop. To unlatch your belt, lift up on the clip. This should free the belt. Then pull the loose end back through the buckle and then through your belt loops."

Then insert the protruding end of the belt (the end you threaded through your belt loops) into the buckle. You should hear a click when the belt is secure. To make the belt tighter, pull on the loose end of the belt attached to the part you inserted into the buckle. The clip of your buckle should have a button on the top or side. Press it to release the end of the belt that clicked in to the buckle. Then pull the loose end of your belt through your belt loops."
