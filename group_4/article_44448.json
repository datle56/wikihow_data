      "content": "Determine your risk for breast cysts. Women between the ages of 30 and 40 are more likely to develop lumps or cysts within the breasts. Hormonal changes can cause cysts to develop, so you may notice breast cysts develop right before your menstrual cycle begins.

      "content": "Perform a breast self-exam at home. A few days after your period ends, check your breasts for cysts. Hold your hands on your hips and look in the mirror for any obvious changes to the shape of your breasts. Raise your arms and look again for any swelling, redness, or bulging. Lie down and hold one arm behind your head. Use your other hand to firmly rub the opposite breast in circles so you can feel any lumps. Repeat this by putting the opposite arm behind your head and feeling the other breast. [3] X Trustworthy Source BreastCancer.org Patient-focused nonprofit organization providing resources for those affected by breast cancer Go to source Ensure that you check the entire breast, from your collarbone to the top of your abdomen. If you do the self-exam a few days after your period has stopped, your breasts will be less tender and swollen which makes the exam easier."

      "content": "Talk with your doctor about possible testing. If you notice that the lump or lumps in your breast only seem sensitive as you approach or finish menstruating, you may be able to cope with the cysts without medical treatment. Talk with your doctor if the lump is firm, doesn't change throughout your menstrual cycle, or causes you pain. You may want to discuss the lump with your doctor if you want to put your mind at ease. The doctor may recommend getting an ultrasound."

      "content": "Get an ultrasound to determine if you have a simple or complex cyst. The doctor will do an ultrasound of your breasts to check whether the cyst is solid or filled with liquid. If it's solid, the doctor may want to remove the complex cyst for testing. If it's filled with liquid, the doctor can drain it or tell you how you can cope with the cyst at home. [4] X Research source You can make yourself more comfortable as the cyst naturally drains on its own. Some women find that applying heat or taking pain medication can help with the discomfort."

      "content": "Monitor the cysts for changes. Most simple cysts will clear up on their own without needing treatment. Keep track of how the lump feels, if it changes in size or appearance, and if it causes you pain. Remember to perform breast self-exams every month. [5] X Research source Try using a journal or app to write down breast changes throughout the month. This will help you see patterns of when the cyst develops, causes you pain, or drains away."

      "content": "Apply gentle heat to the cysts. If your breasts feel tender or swollen, place a warm water bottle, heating pad, or warm compress on the cysts for 10 to 15 minutes. To make a basic compress , wash your hands and run a clean washcloth under warm water until it's saturated. Wring the excess water out of the washcloth and press it against the cysts.

      "content": "Wear a bra with good support . If you have a large cyst or more than one, your breasts may feel heavier because of the excess fluid. Buy bras that fit you well and give your breasts support. Avoid bras that fit too tight or have underwires since they can prevent the lymph nodes from draining. Instead, look for bras that contain your breasts without bulging or puckering at the sides. [9] X Research source Poor-fitting bras can actually cause breast pain and discomfort, so it's important to find a bra that comfortably supports your breasts. If you need help, ask to be professionally fitted."

      "title": "Drain the cysts.",
      "content": "Drain the cysts. If the simple cysts are causing you pain and you'd like to relieve the pressure, ask the doctor about draining them. The doctor will put local anesthesia around each cyst before inserting a slender, hollow needle directly into it. The needle will fill up with the fluid from the cyst until the cyst is drained. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The doctor can study the fluid from the cyst to confirm what type of cyst it is."

Follow your doctor's prescription when taking oral contraceptives or hormone therapies, such as tamoxifen or androgens, to regulate your symptoms.

A surgeon will use general anesthesia before the surgery to remove the cysts. After the surgery, you'll be able to go home the same day to recover. The doctor may give you prescription pain medication and will give you instructions on how to clean the area where the cyst was removed. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The doctors may recommend that you stop taking aspirin or other blood-thinning medications before the surgery.
