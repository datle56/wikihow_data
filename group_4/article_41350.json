      "content": "Externalize your thoughts in a diary or with a close friend. Sometimes ignoring those thoughts altogether only makes them worse, like shaking a can of soda before opening it. Allow yourself to worry, if only for a little while. Do this by writing about your thoughts in a journal, or expressing them to a trusted family member or friend, or even just say them aloud while you’re alone.

Also, studies show that when people wrote down their thoughts on a piece of paper and then threw the paper away, they mentally discarded the thoughts as well.

[3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source When the timer or alarm goes off, shout \"Stop!\" That's your cue to empty your mind of that thought. Think of one intentional thought (the beach, a peaceful forest, etc.) and keep your mind fixed on that image or thought for 30 seconds. If the upsetting thought comes back during that time, shout \"Stop!\" again, or move on to another activity on this list to take your mind off it. Stand up when you say \"Stop,\" or snap your fingers or clap your hands. These actions reinforce the \"Stop\" command and further interrupt your thought."

In fact, laughing with a friend has a positive effect on your brain itself, reducing stress-related neurochemicals and boosting positive chemicals like serotonin and dopamine.

      "content": "Get moving to boost your mood and banish bad thoughts. Whenever you find yourself caught in negative thinking, stop and do 5-10 pushups, or do jumping jacks for 30 seconds, or something similar. These bursts of physical activity work to “reset” your brain and disrupt harmful patterns of thinking with positive endorphins, which in turn helps you move on with your day.

Remember to also drink plenty of water and eat 3 square meals a day! Keeping your body nourished also nourishes your mind."

      "content": "Practice mindfulness or do something indulgent. When you find yourself worrying, be mindful : take a few deep breaths—10 seconds in, then 10 seconds out. Identify each of your 5 senses: what do you hear, smell, touch, see, and taste right now? Then, roll and relax your shoulders. These relaxing practices help realign your body and bring you back to the present moment. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

But most of the things we’re afraid of never actually happen, or aren't as bad as we think. Remind yourself of the reasons your fear is unlikely to happen, and think about what you’ll do in the slim chance that it does happen. [9] X Research source For example, if you’re worried about a test, remind yourself, “I probably won’t fail because I’ve been studying hard, and I’m a smart and capable person.” Also, think of it as a lesson, like, “If I do fail, it’s not the end of the world. I’ll talk to my teacher about how to improve, and study harder for the next test.”"

One day you’ll wake up, and these negative thoughts will just be a memory, and you’ll wonder why you worried so much. Until then, it may be best to let yourself feel your feelings until you’re naturally ready to let go of them.
