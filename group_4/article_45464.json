      "content": "Scorpio is an extremely sensitive sign—so be careful with your words. With all of his emotional intelligence and vulnerability, Scorpio is super tuned in to his feelings (which makes him great for heart to hearts!). But on the flip side, when some guys might brush something off as NBD, Scorpio could end up feeling seriously hurt.

Remind him that you still think he’s the best—even if you need a night away for yourself. On the plus side, his sensitivity makes him an amazing confidant and source of comfort.

      "content": "In love, Scorpio might be a little too comfortable with mind games. He's extremely quick, strategic, and empathetic—he may understand others' feelings better than they do themselves. But because he's so untrusting, Scorpio may not always use his powers for good. To get a sense of his partner's true loyalties, he may resort to \"testing\" them. A Scorpio might tell you a secret just to see whether you let it slip. Assume that everything he shares with you is totally classified. A Scorpio might not text you for a couple days just to see how much you really care. When he finally reaches out make sure he knows that you're still into him."
