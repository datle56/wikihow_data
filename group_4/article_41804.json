Make sure the waist is stretched tightly across the hanger. If it isn’t, you’ll need to find a larger hanger to use."

If you don’t have an ironing board, you can also stretch the waist across a wooden chair (cover it first with a towel to protect the wood) or across a sturdy wooden board like a cutting board. You can pull on the waistline at this point as well for some extra stretching."

Do this around the entire length of the waistband. Don’t, however, go below the stitching of the waistband—if you do, you can end up with pants stretched out in odd places."

Do this until you’ve reached the desired level of stretch. But be careful not to go so far that you tear the pants. Note that this approach will stretch not only the waistband but also the rest of the pants, too."

[3] X Research source Laying down while buttoning/zipping your pants can also make them easier to get into. If you can’t get the pants on far enough to zip them up, first do a little manual pulling. Use your arm strength to pull and stretch the waistband enough that you can pull the pants on. For extra muscle power, step one foot into the waistband, using your foot to hold it to the ground, then grasp the waistband with both hands and pull as hard as you can in the opposite direction."
