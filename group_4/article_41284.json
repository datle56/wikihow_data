      "content": "It’s way harder to pick your skin without long nails. If you notice that your nails are getting long enough to pick and scratch your skin, grab the nail clippers and cut them down short. If they’re still feeling a little sharp, use a nail file to file them down and smooth them out so you can’t pick your fingers as easily. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source On the flip side, some people find that having long, fake nails helps them stop picking because it’s harder to get a good grip on your skin. If you do go for fake nails, choose rounded or square ones so you can’t jab them into your skin or scratch yourself easily."

      "content": "When you feel like you’re going to pick, cover up your fingers. Keep a thin pair of gloves nearby so you can slide them on at any time.

[2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If there are certain times you know you’re likely to pick (like at night when you’re going to bed), put your gloves on as a preventative measure until waiting until you actually start to pick your fingers. No gloves around? No problem! Grab a few bandages and wrap them around your fingers to make it harder for you to pick your skin."

      "content": "Soothing your pain can help you stop thinking about your fingers. If you have any spots where you’ve picked recently and they’re starting to hurt, try using an antibacterial cream on your fingers to stop the pain. Hopefully, if you reduce your discomfort, you can start thinking about something else instead of trying to pick your skin. If you have any open wounds or scabs, cover them up with bandages until they heal. It will both protect them from infection and also keep them covered so you don’t pick at them absent-mindedly."
