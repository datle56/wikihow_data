      "title": "Wear it on your left hand.",
      "content": "Wear it on your left hand. The ring is typically worn on the third finger of the left hand. This is the most common way to wear an engagement ring in many countries, especially in Western cultures. This dates back to the highly romantic idea that this finger has a vein that leads directly to the heart. That isn’t true, but it’s a nice thought for when you’re looking down at that pretty ring of yours. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Flaunt the ring on your right hand.",
      "content": "Flaunt the ring on your right hand. Wearing your ring on the third finger of your right hand is absolutely acceptable as well. The right hand is actually the traditional hand in countries like Russia, Greece, and Columbia. Wearing your ring on your right hand doesn’t have to signify your culture, though. It can simply be a personal preference. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Stack it on top of your wedding band. Once you’ve decided on the hand you’ll wear your ring on, consider how you will wear it after the wedding ceremony. You may decide not to have a wedding band, and that’s okay! If you have a wedding band, you will typically wear your engagement ring on top of it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose to wear it on any finger you want.",
      "content": "Choose to wear it on any finger you want. There are traditions, but in the end, the choice is yours. Wear it on whatever finger feels the most comfortable. This could be your index or middle finger. If the size of the ring is the reason why you need to wear it on a certain finger, you may want to consider resizing it."

    {
      "title": "Wear it around your neck.",
      "content": "Wear it around your neck. Sometimes wearing the engagement ring on your finger isn’t the best option for you. This could be because of your career, a physical reason, pregnancy, or simply because you don’t like to wear anything on your fingers. Choose a chain that you like and slip the ring onto the chain. Wear it around your neck as you would any other necklace. It will be even closer to your heart. You can also look into companies like Ring My Neck, which makes necklaces specifically for engagement rings."

      "title": "Keep your ring clean.",
      "content": "Keep your ring clean. A buildup of oil and dirt will prevent your ring from looking as shiny as it could look, and you may want to keep it ready to show off at a moment’s notice! To clean, put the ring into a mug filled with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Let it soak for a few minutes. Then, scrub it with a soft-bristle toothbrush and then dry it with a soft cloth. [4] X Research source It’s recommended to clean your ring once every few weeks."

      "title": "Take it to a jeweler once a year.",
      "content": "Take it to a jeweler once a year. Bringing your ring to the jeweler once a year is recommended so that a professional can determine if your ring is in good condition. Usually, the jeweler will check the prongs to make sure that your stone isn’t close to falling out. If you don’t want to take your ring to a jeweler just yet, take a look at the prongs yourself. [5] X Research source To check the prongs yourself, make sure that one of the prongs isn’t shorter than the others. Then, shake the ring while holding it up to your ear to check that nothing rattles."

    {
      "title": "Take it off before intense exercise.",
      "content": "Take it off before intense exercise. Intense exercise could mean tennis, bicycling, lifting weights, etc. The stone could pop out with a lot of fast movement. Also, using equipment, like weights or ropes, while wearing the ring could dent and scratch it. [6] X Research source You should also avoid wearing your ring at work if you handle heavy machinery."

      "title": "Avoid applying lotion and perfume when you wear your ring.",
      "content": "Avoid applying lotion and perfume when you wear your ring. We all want to smell great, but smelling like a fresh rose isn’t worth damaging your beautiful ring. The oils, chemicals, and alcohols in these products can damage your ring after a while. The gem could become clouded, and the metal could become dull. It’s okay to wear lotion and perfume, but make sure it doesn’t come near your ring. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Think carefully before resizing.",
      "content": "Think carefully before resizing. At some point, you may feel the need to resize your ring. It could feel too loose or too tight for a number of reasons, like pregnancy, a change in weight, and temperature. Think of all the reasons that could have caused this, and consider if these changes are temporary before going to the jeweler. If the ring stays too loose after a long time, then it is a good idea to take it in. [8] X Research source Getting your ring sized in the afternoon or after exercise to accommodate swelling is ideal. It’s recommended to get your ring one size up from what you need if you live in a tropical environment. Leaving the ring loose for too long can cause excess wear on the stone."

      "content": "Have your ring insured. A lost, stolen, or damaged ring is a nightmare, but that doesn’t mean it’s a problem that can’t be solved. Your partner may have already gotten insurance. If not, this is an important first step after receiving your ring. Many companies will allow you to add the insurance for the ring to your homeowners or renters insurance. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Put your ring in a designated spot. You might never want to take off your ring, but the time will probably come when you have to. Designate a place to store your ring safely. This will take the stress away from frantically trying to remember where you put it last. Keep a ring box in your bedroom, and a ring dish in the kitchen. [10] X Research source Make sure the ring dish is kept far away from the drain."

      "title": "Leave your ring at home when you travel.",
      "content": "Leave your ring at home when you travel. This isn’t necessary, but it can be a good idea when leaving for a trip where you will be moving around a lot. Moving from place to place, especially when going to the beach, may result in a lost ring in the whirlwind of the fun (or business). Consider going without a ring or wearing an inexpensive ring during the trip. [11] X Research source The ring can also be damaged when lifting bags or using bags that roll."
