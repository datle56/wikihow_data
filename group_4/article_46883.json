      "content": "Plug your test leads into the sockets on your ohmmeter or multimeter. On most ohmmeters, you will see a “common,” or negative plug (often labeled “COM”), and a “positive” plug. These may also be color-coded, with the black lead going into the negative (“COM”) plug and the red lead going into the positive plug. [1] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source If you’re using a multimeter with more than 2 sockets, plug the black lead into the “COM” socket and the red lead into the socket designated for measuring resistance in ohms (usually marked with the ohms symbol, Ω). Set your multimeter to the ohms or continuity setting. [2] X Research source Ohmmeters are typically sold along with these test leads. If your meter was recently purchased, you should not have to buy your leads separately. Be sure to plug the short, bent ends (called banana jacks) of the leads into the sockets. The longer ends, with the grips and probes, are the ends you’ll use to actually test a circuit’s resistance. Tip: Make sure your meter has a battery installed (or is plugged in). If you just bought an ohmmeter, the battery may have come pre-installed in your unit, or packaged separately with instructions for installing it."

Master electrician Daniel Stoescu says, “Always check the ohmmeter functionality by touching the leads together before making any measurements.” [3] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. When you touch the probes together, the needle on an analog ohmmeter should point all the way to the right (indicating no resistance). If the needle or screen doesn’t do this, turn the adjustment knob on your ohmmeter until the needle reads 0 ohms when the probes are touching each other. Note that the scale on analog meters reads in the reverse direction of most conventional measuring scales: less resistance is to the right and more resistance is to the left. If yours is a digital ohmmeter , the screen should read “0” (or no more than “0.5”) when you touch the 2 probes together. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Test your ohmmeter on a store-bought resistor, if you can. Get a resistor (or several resistors) whose resistance is already known. Then, use your ohmmeter to measure the resistor’s resistance and see if you get the reading that you expect to. [5] X Research source You can technically use anything that conducts electricity to test your ohmmeter, from a piece of aluminum foil to a pencil mark on a sheet of paper, as long as you know that object’s resistance value ahead of time. Place the meter’s probes on opposite ends of the conductor and look to see if the correct resistance reading shows up on the meter’s screen."

Stoescu warns to “Never use an ohmmeter on live circuits.” [6] X Expert Source Daniel Stoescu Master Electrician Expert Interview. 21 June 2021. If you’re measuring the resistance inside a circuit or wire, it has to be completely dead in order for you to get an accurate reading. This is also very important for your own safety. [7] X Research source Another source of power isn't necessary since your ohmmeter will supply all of the voltage and current for your circuit. Trying to use an ohmmeter on a powered circuit can cause incorrect readings as well as damage to the meter, the circuit, and you."

      "title": "Set your ohmmeter to the appropriate scale, if possible.",
      "content": "Set your ohmmeter to the appropriate scale, if possible. On some meters, you have the option to turn the dial in the center of your ohmmeter to change the scale of the reading, from tens, to hundreds, to thousands, and so on. For the best results, turn your meter to the lowest scale that is still higher than the resistance of what you’re measuring. For example, if you expect the circuit you’re measuring to have a resistance of 1100 ohms, then your ohmmeter should be set to X100. This means, a reading of “11” on your ohmmeter would be equal to 1100 ohms. Note that you can only do this if you have an idea of what the resistance of what you’re measuring ought to be."

      "content": "Adjust the ohm range to get an accurate reading (for analog meters). If you have an idea of how many ohms you’ll be measuring, select an appropriate range (for example, up to 6000.0 Ω or up to 60.00 MΩ) that encompasses that measurement. Typically, you’ll press the “Range” button on your meter until you find the setting you need. Most digital ohmmeters and multimeters have an auto-range function that will adjust for you. [8] X Research source You’ll need to have an approximate idea of the resistance of the circuit you’re measuring if you’re setting the range yourself. Start with a high range and gradually reduce it if you’re unsure."

Note that it doesn’t matter which probe is touched to which end of the circuit. [9] X Research source Because you’re measuring the resistance in the circuit and resistance doesn’t change with the direction of current flow, the positive probe and the negative probe can be on either end of the circuit to get an accurate resistance reading."

The lower the resistance, the easier it is for electrical current to flow through the circuit.

      "content": "Isolate the components of an electrical circuit to test them individually. Remove the resistor you want to measure from the circuit board by unsoldering the pins using a soldering iron . This will ensure that you’re not getting an inaccurate reading through another path in the circuit. [11] X Research source In other words, by testing a resistor while it’s still in a circuit board, you can’t be sure that the resistance you’re measuring is only coming from that particular resistor."

      "title": "Look for a reading close to “0” to indicate a circuit has continuity.",
      "content": "Look for a reading close to “0” to indicate a circuit has continuity. In electrical terms, continuity is the presence of a direct path for electricity to flow between 2 points or through a circuit when closed. Most multimeters have a specific continuity setting, but you can also use a plain ohmmeter (or the ohms setting on a multimeter): [12] X Research source Set your scale to the lowest setting. Touch the ends of the probes to either end of the circuit or component you’re testing (just like if you were measuring resistance). Look for a reading between “0” and “2” to indicate continuity. This means electricity is able to flow and the circuit is closed and working. On digital ohmmeters and multimeters, an infinity symbol (∞) or “OL” (“open line”) result means there is not continuity and that the circuit is open or bad."

      "content": "Multimeters read more electrical measurements than just resistance. Multimeters look similar to ohmmeters, but with more sockets, buttons, and abilities. They measure resistance in ohms, just like an ohmmeter, but can also check for continuity and measure voltage in Volts (V) and current in amperes (A). [13] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source If you’re investing in a tool for general electrical work, a multimeter is more versatile than an ohmmeter and has all the same capabilities. Both multimeters and ohmmeters can be digital or analog: Analog meters are very basic and inexpensive and usually range from 0–10 to 0–10,000 ohms. Digital meters may have similar ranges or “auto-range,” where the device will read a circuit’s resistance and automatically select the best measuring range."
