      "content": "Use green tomatoes or a tomato bred for long storage. If you want to store tomatoes at room temperature for more than a week or so, you need to start with the right kind of tomato. Pick a variety of tomato meant for long storage, such as a Long Keeper Winter Storage tomato. These varieties are heartier and stand up to long storage better. [1] X Research source You can use any variety tomato if it's still green, and it will ripen as it sits in storage. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Place dry, unwashed tomatoes in a storage bin. You can use several different methods to store the tomatoes. One method is to simply layer them in a box or basket, then put newspaper between that layer and the next one. [3] X Research source You can also store them in a box that canning jars came in, which should have separated spaces for each tomato. [4] X Research source Alternatively, use an apple box with individual paper wrappers or make a small newspaper wrapper for each tomato. Close the box or cover it with a sheet to keep light out."
