      "title": "Wrap the pareo around the back of your waist.",
      "content": "Wrap the pareo around the back of your waist. Orient the long edges on the top and bottom of the pareo. Position the back of your waist in the middle of the pareo and then hold the 2 top corners in front of you. [1] X Research source This method is popular in the Cook Islands and in Tahiti."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knot the top corners of the pareo together in front of your body.",
      "content": "Knot the top corners of the pareo together in front of your body. Pull the knot tight so that the pareo sits firmly against your waist. Tug on the knot to make sure it won’t come undone when you move around. [2] X Research source If your pareo keeps falling down, try tying it a little higher up your waist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swivel the pareo so that the knot sits over 1 of your hips.",
      "content": "Swivel the pareo so that the knot sits over 1 of your hips. This is the traditional way to wear a pareo. Lift the pareo higher on your waist to make it easier to swivel and then pull it back down to its original position. [3] X Research source If you want a unique look, leave the knot in the centre or swivel it to the middle of your back."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the pareo around your back and hold the corners in front of you.",
      "content": "Wrap the pareo around your back and hold the corners in front of you. Hold the pareo so that the long edge is centred around the back of your body, just under your armpits. Hold the top left corner of the rectangle in your left hand and the top right corner in your right hand. [4] X Research source This style works best on full-length pareos, rather than on short, shawl-length pareos."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take each of the top corners over the opposite shoulder.",
      "content": "Take each of the top corners over the opposite shoulder. Pull the top left corner of the pareo over your right shoulder and then take the top right corner over your left shoulder. Hold both the corners behind your neck. [5] X Research source This method creates a dress with halter neck straps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Knot",
      "content": "Knot the top corners behind your neck. Pull the corners back behind your neck to your desired position and then knot them together. If the pareo is too tight around your neck, simply undo the knot and tie a looser one. [6] X Research source If you feel creative, tie a bow over the knot to add a fun look to your dress."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the corners on the short edges together to make loops.",
      "content": "Tie the corners on the short edges together to make loops. Lay the pareo flat on the floor and then knot together the 2 corners on 1 of the short edges. Repeat this on the other short edge of the pareo. These knots turn the shorts edges of the pareo into arms loops for the jacket. [7] X Research source This light jacket is really useful for sun protection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drape the long edge of the pareo over your shoulders.",
      "content": "Drape the long edge of the pareo over your shoulders. Position your back into the middle of the pareo and drape the knots over your shoulders in front of you. This creates a cape-like look. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Slip your wrists through the knotted loops in front of you.",
      "content": "Slip your wrists through the knotted loops in front of you. The knots that you tied on either side of the pareo will have created small loops – these are the armholes of the jacket. Place your hands through the holes and adjust the placement of the pareo to your desired position. [9] X Research source This pareo jacket looks great over a beach dress."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position the long edge of the pareo around the back of your waist.",
      "content": "Position the long edge of the pareo around the back of your waist. Pull the top left and right corners of the pareo the same distance away from your body. This ensures that the pareo sits evenly around the back of your waist. [10] X Research source A buckle is a great way to accessorise your pareo. Use a ring buckle to create this look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thread the top left corner of the pareo through the buckle.",
      "content": "Thread the top left corner of the pareo through the buckle. Push the corner up through the left hole, thread it over the buckle, and then pull it down and out of the right hole. [11] X Research source Adjust the buckle so that it sits in the middle of your waist. Only the left corner of the pareo goes through the buckle, as the other corner is knotted later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the opposite corner right around your waist.",
      "content": "Wrap the opposite corner right around your waist. Pull the top right corner past the buckle on your waist and right around your back. This decreases the size of the knot and makes it more discreet. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Knot the corners over your right hip.",
      "content": "Knot the corners over your right hip. Take the top left and right corners of the pareo and knot them together. Tug the knot to ensure that it sits firmly against your body. If necessary, slightly swivel the pareo around so that it sits directly above your right hip. [13] X Research source If your pareo comes undone, tie a double-knot to keep it in place."
