      "content": "Recognize signs of an infection. The area around a new piercing may be red, tender, and/or swollen for a few weeks. However, if these symptoms last more than three weeks, they may indicate an infection. Similarly, yellow discharge is normal for about a week after getting a belly button piercing. If the discharge continues, turns green, or includes blood, this likely indicates an infection. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other indications of an infection include excess crust around one or both of the piercing’s holes, persistent pain or soreness to the touch, skin sensitivity, the ability to see the piercing through the skin, or any movement or loosening of the piercing itself. If any of these symptoms are present, consult your doctor."

Lie on your back and gently hold the saturated material onto your belly button area for 10 minutes. [2] X Research source Repeat this process twice daily to help kill bacteria and reduce irritation.

      "content": "Clean the piercing with mild soap or a saline solution daily. Regular cleaning is the best way to speed up the healing process after receiving a piercing. After washing your hands with soap and warm water, use a cotton swab or cotton ball dipped in saline solution or mild antibacterial soap to wash both holes made by the piercing and your belly button. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Gently rotate your piercing four times after washing. Cleaning your piercing daily will reduce the amount of time that your belly button is tender and help to prevent serious irritants such as infection.

Continue washing your piercing and the surrounding area once or twice daily until the redness, swelling, and discharge subside."

Be sure to wash both holes of your piercing, as well as your belly button and the surrounding area. Then, allow water from the shower to wash the soap away. Showering is the recommended method of washing, as bathtubs can harbor bacteria that may infect your piercing.
