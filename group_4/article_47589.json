      "content": "Pin your brooch to the breast of a blouse for a classic look. Adding a brooch to your blouse will instantly make you look more elegant and refined. Just pass the pin on the brooch into the fabric on your shirt, then push it out through the other side. Typically, a brooch looks neatest when it's pinned between your breast and collarbone. Don’t gather too much fabric when you’re pinning the brooch to your shirt, or your shirt will look puckered or bunched up. A simple brooch on a solid-colored shirt is a great way to ease into this trend. If you're wearing the brooch into the office, try putting on a white button-down and a thin cable-knit sweater on top of that. Then put the brooch on the outside of the sweater, and tie the outfit together with a simple black skirt with black tights or a simple black pair of pants.

      "content": "Use a brooch to emphasize the collar of a shirt. If you have a shirt with a relatively stiff collar, you can use a brooch to dress it up. You can place a single brooch to one side of the collar, or you can use 2 identical brooches on either side of the collar for a symmetrical look. Try clustering several brooches along one side of your collar for a unique look. For instance, in the springtime, a collection of flower-shaped brooches would look great on the collar of a chambray button-down. You can also wear the brooch on your shirt just below the points of your collar. Try wearing brooches with a pearl design to soften a Western button-down shirt. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a brooch to add sparkle to a simple dress. Whether you’re wearing a pastel-colored sheath dress, a little black dress, or a sweater dress, a brooch can add visual interest and a unique touch. Experiment with different locations for the brooch to see what looks best. [3] X Research source If your dress has ruched detailing, try placing the brooch at your waist right where the material gathers. Wearing a brooch could leave a small hole in the material, especially if the dress is made of a delicate fabric like chiffon or lace. If that's the case, either opt for a small brooch, or put on a jacket and wear the brooch on that, instead."

      "content": "Add personality to a jacket or blazer by pinning a brooch to the lapel. If you wear a suit or a blazer to work, it can sometimes be hard to incorporate much of your personal style. By adding a brooch, you’ll stand out—in a good way! Pin the brooch on your lapel just above the widest part of your chest for a flattering accent. [5] X Research source You can also wear your brooch on some kind of overcoat. If the rest of your outfit is really simple, this will make the brooch pop. [6] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020. If you have a playful personality, look for a whimsical brooch shaped like an animal, flower, or insect. For a more refined look, stick to abstract shapes, like a simple enamel circle or a jewel surrounded by pearls. Play around with the location of your brooch. Try slipping it through the top button-hole on your jacket instead of using it on the lapel. You can even use a brooch as a fastener if your jacket doesn’t have buttons."
