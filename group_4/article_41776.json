      "title": "Stand straight up with your feet shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Stand straight up with your feet shoulder-width apart. Let both hands hang to the sides. Keep yourself relaxed and don’t tense any of your muscles. [1] X Research source This is the simplest lat stretch and requires no equipment or special poses. If you’re tense or haven’t loosened up yet, then warm up a little to prepare your muscles for stretching. Walking or jogging for 5-10 minutes helps loosen your muscles. If you're inside, try jumping rope or running in place."

    {
      "title": "Point one arm straight up towards the ceiling.",
      "content": "Point one arm straight up towards the ceiling. Start on whichever arm you prefer. Extend it straight upward like you’re trying to touch the ceiling and outstretch your fingers. Press upward so you feel a minor stretch in your back and side. [2] X Research source If you’re in a place with a low ceiling, try working outside so you have enough room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your hips to the side while keeping your arm straight.",
      "content": "Bend your hips to the side while keeping your arm straight. Lean towards the opposite side from the arm you’re extending. Bend until you feel a good stretch from your armpit to your mid-back. Stop and bend back a bit if the stretch is uncomfortable. [3] X Research source Don’t bend your arm at all during this movement. This will give you a less effective stretch. You can just let your other arm hang while you do this motion, or place it on your hip if you prefer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the stretch for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Once you find a comfortable stretch spot, hold there. Wait 30 seconds for the muscle to loosen up. Then bend back up in a slow, smooth motion. Drop the arm when you’re standing straight again. [4] X Research source Keep the stretch consistent. Don’t make a bouncing or jerking motion. If you loosen up and feel like you can stretch more, bend a little further in a smooth motion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the process for the other side.",
      "content": "Repeat the process for the other side. Once you’ve stretched one side, do the same for the other side. Lift your arm straight and bend to the opposite side. Hold for 30 seconds, then straighten up and drop the arm. [5] X Research source Repeat the stretch 2-3 times on each side for the best results. Always stretch both sides so your back muscles are evenly-warmed up. Leaving one side unstretched could cause a muscle pull."

    {
      "title": "Kneel in front of an exercise ball for a deeper stretch.",
      "content": "Kneel in front of an exercise ball for a deeper stretch. Rest the exercise ball in front of you and kneel. Make sure the ball is within arm’s length from you. [6] X Research source If you have a hard floor, you might want to kneel on a yoga mat or area rug so your knees don’t hurt. You can buy exercise balls from sporting goods stores or online. Exercise balls come in different sizes. Try to get one that is about as tall as your waist if you’re kneeling down. One that’s too big or small won’t give you as good of a stretch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place both hands shoulder-width apart on the ball.",
      "content": "Place both hands shoulder-width apart on the ball. Don’t press down or squeeze the ball. Just rest both arms on it. Make sure there is enough space between your arms for your head to fit through. [7] X Research source Make sure your arms are outstretched all the way. If they’re bent, your stretch won’t be as good."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend down and tuck your head through your arms.",
      "content": "Bend down and tuck your head through your arms. Push your hips back and bend your head forward. Continue bending down until your head passes through the space between your arms. Stop when you feel a stretch from your lower back up to your shoulders. [8] X Research source The ball might roll slightly while you do this. This is okay, and helps you get a deeper stretch. If it rolls too far for your comfort, press down on it to stop it from moving."

    {
      "title": "Hold the pose for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the pose for 30 seconds. When you’ve found the perfect stretch spot, hold it to work your lats. Give your back 30 seconds to stretch out before coming back up. [9] X Research source If your back loosens up, then try to push a little further. Don’t do this suddenly or with a jerky motion. Lower yourself smoothly. To focus on one specific side of your lats, lean slightly to that side. This stretches one side a bit more. Try alternating sides for a deeper stretch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Straighten back up smoothly.",
      "content": "Straighten back up smoothly. Roll your hips forward and raise your head to straighten up. Come back to your starting position and rest. Do another stretch after and see if you can go any lower. [10] X Research source Repeat this stretch 2-3 times to loosen your whole back."

    {
      "title": "Stand in front of something solid to grab on to.",
      "content": "Stand in front of something solid to grab on to. The object should be about as high as your shoulders, though slightly lower or higher will work as well. Popular objects include a wall, the side of a car, a fireplace mantle, or fence. Some gyms also have stretching bars that would work. [11] X Research source Make sure whatever you use is solid and won’t move when you lean on it. A table or chair won’t work well unless they’re attached to the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grab the object with your hands shoulder-width apart.",
      "content": "Grab the object with your hands shoulder-width apart. Place both hands onto the object and hold on. Make sure there is enough space between your arms for your head to fit between them. Get a good grip so you don’t slip while you’re stretching. [12] X Research source Also make sure your feet have a good grip on the floor. If you’re on hardwood, go barefoot or stand on a yoga mat, for example."

    {
      "title": "Bend your hips back until you feel a stretch.",
      "content": "Bend your hips back until you feel a stretch. Keep your back straight for the best stretch. Just push your hips back and let your head lower until it passes between your arms. When you feel a stretch in your mid-back, hold the position. [13] X Research source Keep your back and neck straight during the stretch. Don’t bend your neck down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the pose for 30-60 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the pose for 30-60 seconds. Once you reach the ideal stretching position, hold the pose. Wait for 30-60 seconds to give your back a full stretch. [14] X Research source Keep still while you’re holding the pose. Don’t bounce or make jerky movements. If you loosen up and want to go further, bend further back with a smooth motion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stand back up to complete the stretch.",
      "content": "Stand back up to complete the stretch. Once 30-60 seconds pass, push your hips back forward to stand up. Repeat the stretch 3-5 more times to loosen your back up. [15] X Research source Try shaking your arms out in between stretches to increase blood flow and prevent yourself from getting sore."

    {
      "title": "Lay flat on your back with your arms at your sides.",
      "content": "Lay flat on your back with your arms at your sides. Point your palms down at the floor. Relax your muscles and keep your legs outstretched in front of you. [16] X Research source It may be most comfortable for you to do this exercise on a rug or yoga mat. This stretch is also an exercise. If you haven’t warmed up or worked out in a while, then skip this stretch and opt for a less demanding one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend your knees to bring your heels closer to your hips.",
      "content": "Bend your knees to bring your heels closer to your hips. Begin sliding your feet towards your body until they’re about where your knees were when your legs were straight. Keep both feet planted firmly on the ground. If your heels start lifting, push your feet further forward. [17] X Research source Make sure your feet can get a good grip on the floor. If you’re wearing socks on hardwood, for example, your feet will probably slide during the stretch."

      "title": "Raise your pelvis straight up until you feel a stretch.",
      "content": "Raise your pelvis straight up until you feel a stretch. Press your hips upward towards the ceiling. Imagine you’re trying to touch the ceiling with your midsection. Stop when you feel a stretch in your mid-back. [18] X Research source Keep your hands on the ground, but don't press your body up with them. Let your hips do the work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the pose for 5-10 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold the pose for 5-10 seconds. This is a difficult pose to hold, so 5-10 seconds at a time gives you enough of a stretch. Once you reach a good stretching point, hold it before lowering yourself. [19] X Research source For a more intense workout, you can hold the pose for longer. Try 30-second increments. For more intensity, see how long you can hold it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower your pelvis to the ground.",
      "content": "Lower your pelvis to the ground. After 5-10 seconds, lower yourself with a smooth motion. Stop when your hips touch the ground again. [20] X Research source Repeat this motion 5-10 times for a good stretch and workout."
