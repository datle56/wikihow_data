      "title": "Remove the large stems.",
      "content": "Remove the large stems. When the dill is dry, transfer it to a cutting board. With a sharp knife, carefully cut off the larger stems that all the fronds (the feathery leaf-like parts of the herb) are attached to. You can either discard these stems, or save them to add flavor to other dishes. Dill stems can be used to stuff and flavor meats and fish, to season stocks and soups, or even to enhance the dill flavor of pickles. Like bay leaves, dill stems should be removed from a dish before serving. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the fronds into smaller pieces for garnish.",
      "content": "Cut the fronds into smaller pieces for garnish. Dill makes an excellent garnish for soups, salads, and meats. As a garnish, you may want to use longer sprigs of dill fronds rather than minced dill. With a pair of small, sharp scissors, trim 1-inch (2.5-cm) sprigs from the fronds to use for garnishing dishes. The leafy sprigs make much better garnish than the stems, so remove any stems from the garnish and add them to the dill that you'll be mincing."
