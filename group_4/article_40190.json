      "content": "Install the basic frame and one side of the wall, leaving the wood studs exposed. You'll need the frame of the wall already installed, as well as one side of the actual wall. You will then stuff the wall with sound-proofing before sealing up the wall. If you're working on a wall, you can seal up either side first -- it shouldn't matter. If you're working on the ceiling, you want to soundproof it from the top. Seal up the ceiling of one room, then work on the floor of the room above it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Blast the exposed wall with damp-blown cellulose, a recycled insulation and sound proofing material. Made from recycled newspaper, you spray this on the wall, where it naturally fills into cracks and holes for even, solid insulation. Cover up any outlets or pipes with electrical tape before beginning. Wearing a respirator, use the damp-blown cellulose hose to cover the entire wall, starting from the bottom up. You'll need roughly 260 bags of cellulose for a 4000-square foot house. [2] X Research source The fumes are not harmful, but you should still always wear a dust mask. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Seal up the wall with the first layer of sheetrock. Clean up any excess insulation so that it is flush with the wall, then hang the first layer of sheetrock to cover up the insulation. A double sheet of drywall will significantly help dampen sound. If you're set on a single layer, however, apply soundproofing adhesive to the back of the drywall now."

Use an acoustic-damping sealant to get every edge of the drywall. Don't skimp here -- any air path you have needs to be closed off to prevent noise. Acoustic sealant remains permanently flexible, making it a great soundproofing solution. Make sure you caulk: The ceiling line The floor line Where the sheets of meet drywall. Any outlet or electrical holes."

You'll likely need 1-2 full tubes for each 6-foot sheet. While it looks like a thin, useless layer, the Green Glue forms a thin, sound-proofing layer to absorb vibrations and significantly dampen noise."

Note that, if you're not double-hanging the drywall, you can still add this glue to your first round of sheet rock to dampen some sound. Re-caulk over any exposed edges when done. Good drywall installations never let the seams overlap between the first and second layers. They are staggered. [6] X Research source"

Dry blown insulation requires that you attach a netting to the exposed wall, which catches the cellulose and holds it on the wall. It takes a bit more time, but it is doable by yourself without expensive equipment. All you need is a standard hopper. [7] X Research source"

Slide it in place and attach to the back of the wall according to the manufacturing instructions. This is much harder to work with, and get right, but it can be cheaper and makes much less of a mess. To use it: Wear a respirator at all times. Seal any electrical boxes with soundproof caulk. Cut your insulation (R-11 fiberglass works well) with a utility knife. Screw backing boards, like 1/2 plywood, to the edges of the wall to provide a base for drywall nails. Attach the resilient channels, long metal bars, horizontally across the wall.

Basically, sound is transmitted through vibrations, so touching walls will vibrate each other more than walls that don't touch. Decoupling is when you separate the walls to prevent sound transmission. Keep in mind that resilient channels are prone to failure, and is not specified by the Steel Stud Manufacturers Association, so be careful.

Even if the wall or ceiling is already built, a little sound-proof caulking can close out unwanted noises. Cover up wide or open door and window frames with an adhesive weather strip. Pay special attention to air ducts -- a lot of sounds often enter through them. [13] X Research source"
