      "content": "Be honest and tell them that you’re flattered but not interested. When telling someone you don’t want to go on a date with them, it’s important to be upfront and direct, but also kind. Dating coach John Keegan explains that it takes a lot of guts and courage to ask someone out and risk rejection, so if you’re able to reject them sensitively, it goes a long way. Here are some examples of what to say: “Thanks, I’m really flattered that you asked me out, but I’m not interested in you in that way.” “I appreciate your interest, but I don’t feel a romantic connection between us.” “I really appreciate that you asked me that, and I’m really flattered, but I don’t think we’re a good match.”"

      "content": "Focus on expressing your own feelings. Instead of using language describing why you don't want them, try putting the focus on yourself instead. Simple statements such as, “I don't see you that way, I'm sorry” and “I really like you as a person, but I don't feel a connection between us” are easier to digest than “You aren't my type.\" [1] X Research source Here are some examples: “I think you’re great, but I’m not looking for a relationship right now.” “I don’t feel a romantic spark between us, but I would love to stay friends.” “I appreciate your interest and I’m flattered, but I don’t think we’re a good match.”"

      "title": "Keep your rejection short, and don’t over-explain yourself.",
      "content": "Keep your rejection short, and don’t over-explain yourself. When it comes to turning someone down, less is usually more. Explaining your reasons to some extent can be helpful to create a sense of closure for the other person, but you don’t need to elaborate. Lengthy rejections and rambling explanations can open the conversation up to debate and misinterpretation. [2] X Research source For example: “I’m really flattered, but I’m not interested in dating anyone right now. I’ve got a lot going on at school and work, so I’m focusing on that.” “I appreciate your interest, but I’m really enjoying being single at the moment, so I’m not open to dating or relationships.” “Thanks for asking me that. I’m really flattered, but I don’t feel a romantic spark between us, and I only see you as a friend.”"

      "content": "End the conversation gracefully. You might want to keep the conversation going in an effort to try to act normal and make the other person feel better about the rejection, but the kindest thing to do is to end the encounter on a positive note and give the other person a chance to process their feelings in private, since they may feel sad, hurt, or embarrassed. [3] X Research source Here are some examples of what to say: “Thanks so much for being so respectful. I’m gonna go so you have some space, but if you’re interested in being friends in the future, feel free to reach out.” “I’m gonna head out, but I truly think you’re awesome, and I know there’s someone really special out there for you.” Once you’ve said your piece, offer a sincere smile and make a quick exit. Continuing the conversation or hanging around after the deed is done can be confusing and unpleasant for the other person.

      "title": "Tell them as soon as you realize you aren’t interested in another date.",
      "content": "Tell them as soon as you realize you aren’t interested in another date. Breaking things off after a date or two is awkward for both parties involved, and it can be tempting to ignore the situation entirely. If you pretend it’s not happening it will magically go away, right? Unfortunately, allowing silence to be your answer and hoping the other person will eventually “get the hint” can be hurtful, Keegan explains. It’s best to let them know how you’re feeling directly. Avoid waiting for “the right time” because there usually is no “right time.\" The longer you wait, the harder and more awkward the rejection will be for both of you. It can also make it difficult for the other person to move on if they don’t receive a firm and clear “no” from you, so the kindest thing you can do is provide that to them. [6] X Research source"

Let them know you’ve appreciated the chance to get to know them, and feel free to mention some of the positive traits you admire about them. Then, in a clear and unambiguous way, tell them that you’re not interested in pursuing the relationship further. Finally, wish them the best and end things on a positive note. [7] X Research source Here are some examples: “Thank you for taking the time to get to get to know me on our date the other night. You’re a really cool person, but I’m not feeling a romantic connection between us. I wish you all the best though, and I know there’s an awesome person out there for you.” “I’ve enjoyed our time together, but I don’t feel like we’re a match. I wanted to be upfront about how I’m feeling, and I don’t want to lead you on. I really do think you’re great though, and I wish you all the best.” “I think you’re a truly special person and I’ve enjoyed our dates, but I don’t think we have enough in common to pursue a romantic relationship. I think we’d be great as friends if you’re open to that, but if not, I wish you all the best on your dating journey.”"

      "content": "Be kind, but not apologetic. No one enjoys hurting another person, so it makes sense that you’d want to be sensitive and gentle in this process. It’s important to remember, however, that turning someone down doesn’t make you a jerk or a bad person. You can’t help it if you aren’t attracted to them, and it’s completely okay to break things off. Your needs and emotions are always valid, and you don’t need to feel guilty or apologize for them. [8] X Research source Remember, you aren’t obligated to keep things going in order to avoid hurting their feelings. When you don’t see a future with someone, it’s best to end things, so that you can both move on and hopefully find the right matches in the future."

      "content": "Give them space and avoid stringing them along. Don’t continue to stay in contact with a person that you have zero plans to ever actually date. Sometimes it can feel good being around someone who you know really likes you, but this can make it a lot harder for the other person to get over you. [9] X Research source It can be tempting to reach out to someone who you’ve turned down in the past, especially if you are going through a rough patch yourself, but don’t re-initiate communication unless you’re really interested. A momentary lapse of judgment on your end can cause a lot of confusion and despair for someone else, and you’ll also be putting yourself in the position to have to reject them again. If you’ve agreed to be friends , it’s best to take some time apart first. This allows you both to process your feelings and come back to the friendship when you’re in a better place.

[11] X Research source Dating coach JT Tran explains that this behavior is common in the dating world, but it often leads to loose ends and emotional wounds. If possible, a direct and honest conversation is a better choice to give you both a sense of closure, and it’s also more respectful of the other person. In a 2012 study, researchers identified seven breakup strategies and then asked people to rate them from most to least ideal. “Ghosting” was overwhelmingly identified as the least ideal way to break it off with someone.

If they think there’s a chance you’ll change your mind, it’ll be harder for them to move on, and you may find yourself having to reject them all over again down the road. If you truly aren’t interested in dating this person, make this clear, and avoid wavering or appearing indecisive. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Being unkind or overly critical You may be turning someone down for an entire host of reasons, but you don’t need to list them out. Honesty is important, but there’s no need to insult or belittle the other person if they’ve been polite and respectful toward you. It’s usually best to keep things simple and general, rather than pointing out all the things you find unattractive about them. [14] X Research source For example, if you’re not into them because you don’t like their personal style and you don’t think they’re a great conversationalist, that’s totally fine, but it would be unnecessarily hurtful to say this. Something simple, like, “I don’t think we would be a good match, and I can tell that because I have a good sense of these things,” would be preferable, explains Keegan."

Do you genuinely want them to stay in your life as a friend? Or, are you just trying to soften the blow and spare their feelings? If it’s the latter, don’t offer to stay friends—it’ll just lead to more awkwardness and confusion in the long run. [15] X Research source If you truly do want to remain friends, remember to give the person some space after you reject them.

Unless you’ve known this person for a long time or have already been dating them for several months, letting them down gently via text is not only acceptable but also preferable. The blow of rejection is softened by the neutrality of a text and allows the person to nurse their momentarily bruised ego in private. There is no reason to make physical contact with someone you don’t know well just to turn them down.
