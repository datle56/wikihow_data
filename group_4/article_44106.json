      "content": "Combine flour, sugar, and butter in a food processor. Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of flour, 1 cup (240 ml) of brown sugar, then cut 1 stick of butter into small pieces and place all the ingredients in a food processor. Pulse the mixture together until it forms fine crumbs. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix in additional ingredients for flavor and texture variations. You can use your flour, sugar, and butter base as a crumble by itself, or you can add in some cinnamon, pecans, or rolled oats into the food processor as well. Pulse until the new ingredients are fully combined with the rest of the crumble. [2] X Research source Add 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of cinnamon for a warm, spiced flavor that pairs nicely with pumpkin muffins. Mix in 1 ⁄ 3 cup (79 ml) of chopped pecans for a deeper, nuttier flavor. This flavor really complements banana, apple, or oat muffins! [3] X Research source For a hearty, chewy texture, add 1 cup (240 ml) of old-fashioned rolled oats to the mixture. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle the streusel topping over the muffin batter before it bakes. Pour your batter into a muffin baking tray, then use your fingers to evenly sprinkle the crumble over the tops. You can adjust the thickness of the streusel layer based on your preference, but a thickness of 0.25 to 0.5 in (0.64 to 1.27 cm) usually works well. [5] X Research source If you have any leftover crumble, you can store it in a covered jar in the freezer for a up to 3-4 weeks."

      "content": "Bake the muffins as you normally would according to the recipe. Follow the directed amount of time, or bake the muffins until a toothpick can slide in and out of them cleanly. The streusel will bake into the tops of the muffins, created a delicious, sweet, and sometimes crunchy outer texture. [6] X Research source If your oven has hot spots, or areas that get hotter than others, you should rotate your muffins halfway through the baking time. If you want a crunchier texture, leave the muffins in for a minute or 2 longer than normal, or use the broil setting for 1 minute to crisp up the tops."

      "title": "Sprinkle granulated sugar over the muffin batter for a sweet crust.",
      "content": "Sprinkle granulated sugar over the muffin batter for a sweet crust. Measure about 0.25 cups (59 ml) of granulated sugar and use a pinch or 2 for each muffin to create a thin layer. This way, the sugar will bake into the batter and create a delicious, crunchy crust on the muffin tops. [7] X Research source Granulated sugar tastes great with raspberry muffins."

      "title": "Use pinches of coarse sugar to give the muffins a sparkling effect.",
      "content": "Use pinches of coarse sugar to give the muffins a sparkling effect. After you fill up the muffin tins with the batter, sprinkle a thin layer of coarse sugar crystals over the top of each individual cup. Brush away any stray sugar from the surface of the pan, then bake the muffins as you normally would. [8] X Research source A coarse sugar topping pairs especially well with blueberry muffins. You can find coarse sugar sprinkles in the baking section of most grocery stores. You might also be able to find it under the term “decorating sugar.” [9] X Research source You can also substitute turbinado sugar for a similar taste and texture, but you won’t get the sparkling effect.

      "content": "Use a cinnamon sugar mixture to give the muffin top some spice. In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of cinnamon together with a spoon. Pour your muffin batter into a baking tin, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over top each cup. Bake the muffins as you normally would, and enjoy the sweet, spicy sugar crust! [11] X Research source If you’d prefer a softer crust, you can also bake the muffins first, then brush the tops of the muffins with butter while they’re still warm. Dip the tops into your cinnamon sugar mixture to coat them, then enjoy. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure out the powdered sugar, vanilla, and heavy cream. In a mixing bowl, place 2 cups (470 ml) of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vanilla, and 4 tablespoons (59 ml) of heavy cream. This will make enough drizzle for 12 muffins, so adjust the measurements as needed to fit your batch! This is a basic sugar glaze, so it will only add sweetness to the muffin without altering the main flavor. [13] X Research source For a lemon-flavored glaze, substitute 3 teaspoons (15 ml) of lemon juice for the vanilla, as well as a splash of milk for the heavy cream. This pairs really well with blueberry or poppyseed muffins! [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a hand mixer or whisk to beat the mixture until it’s fully combined. The powdered sugar should be beaten in until the glaze looks smooth and creamy, with few to no lumps. The consistency will be fairly thin, but thick enough to stay on the muffin. [15] X Research source If you want a thicker, creamier glaze, you can add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of cornstarch and continue beating until it thickens."

      "title": "Use a spoon to drizzle the glaze over cool muffins.",
      "content": "Use a spoon to drizzle the glaze over cool muffins. Load up a small spoon with glaze and gently move it back and forth a few times over each muffin. Try to keep the flow of the glaze as even as possible for the nicest presentation. [16] X Research source Make sure that the muffins are completely cool when you apply the glaze. If they’re just out of the oven or even a little warm, the glaze can melt right off the muffin. For a quicker alternative, you could also just dip the tops of the muffins in the glaze. This might look a little messy compared to the prettiness of the drizzle, but it’ll taste just as good!"
