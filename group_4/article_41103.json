      "content": "Sit or lie down. Dizziness or light-headedness usually hits when you are standing up or moving around. At the first signs of dizziness or light-headedness, sit or lie down immediately. This will usually help to relieve the spinning sensation and is safer in the event that you fall. Move slowly and carefully so that you don’t stumble and hurt yourself. [1] X Research source If you're feeling light-headed, try sitting with your head between your knees. This increases the blood flow to your brain. Lying down with your feet propped up will achieve the same result. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Remain seated or lying down for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the dizziness has passed. Get up slowly so you don’t set off another bout of dizziness. If you have vertigo (a feeling like you are falling or the room is spinning, even if you and your surroundings are still), lie down with your head propped up on a pillow or cushion. That will be more effective than lying flat on your back."

      "content": "Drink a glass of water. Dizziness is often the result of dehydration. Dehydration can be caused by not drinking enough water throughout the day or failing to rehydrate during and after exercise. It can also be an issue when you're suffering from an illness that causes vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, which can cause you to lose a lot of fluid. Once the worst of the dizziness has passed, have a drink of water or another clear fluid. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you're finding it difficult to drink a lot of water, try drinking other fluids like sports drinks, hot tea with a little sugar, soups and broths, or diluted fruit juices. Don’t drink alcohol or caffeine, since they could make your dizziness worse."

A bar of chocolate or a banana might do the trick. You can also feel lightheaded if your blood pressure drops.

      "content": "Focus your eyes on a particular spot. To prevent dizziness when spinning, many dancers focus their eyes on a fixed point. [6] X Research source The same technique can be used by people who suffer from dizzy spells, especially if your dizziness is due to motion sickness. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Focusing on a particular spot, like a crack in the ceiling or a speck of dirt on the floor, can help your senses to realize that you are not actually spinning, contrary to what your body is telling you. If you’re experiencing motion sickness while in a car or on a boat, look for a spot in the distance or on the horizon. This will help reduce the confusing signals between your brain and eyes that can cause you to feel dizzy and sick. Unfortunately, depending on what’s causing your dizziness, this might not be possible. Some types of vertigo are associated with involuntary eye movements that can make it hard to focus on a single point. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Breathe slowly and deeply. Dizziness can sometimes be a symptom of an anxiety attack. Often during anxiety attacks it feels as though you cannot get a full breath. But usually, the problem is that you're trying to breathe too fast. [9] X Research source If this is the case, force yourself to take long, slow breaths. This will help you to calm down and alleviate feelings of dizziness. [10] X Research source Try breathing slowly through your nose or your pursed lips. If it helps, count to 5 or even 10 each time you inhale or exhale. Put your hand on your belly, just beneath your ribcage. As you breathe in, draw air down into your lungs so your belly expands and pushes your hand out. Feel your belly get flatter again as you breathe out. Do this 3-10 times, or until you feel calmer and the dizziness passes."

Bright light may strain your eyes or cause you to feel disoriented and make the dizziness worse. [11] X Research source Try sitting or lying down in a dark room, or close your eyes for 1-2 minutes until the dizziness passes. If you’re outside, put on sunglasses.

Lie back into a horizontal position, keeping your head hanging at a 45° angle. Hold this position for 1-2 minutes. You should feel the vertigo subside. Turn your head 90° toward the unaffected ear. Roll onto the side of the unaffected ear. You should now be looking at the floor. Hold this position. You may experience another attack of vertigo, but this should subside within a minute. Slowly return to a seated position."

If you are prone to dizziness, it is important not to make any sudden movements, as moving too quickly can cause sudden changes in your blood pressure. Careful movements will also reduce your risk of falling. Move slowly and deliberately when sitting or standing up, and hold on to a stable surface, such as a hand railing or countertop, when possible. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When you're getting up in the morning, make sure to get up in stages. First sit up slowly in bed, then put your feet on the floor. Take a moment to relax and breathe before slowly standing up. When moving from a sitting to standing position, flex your legs first. This will help to get your circulation going and minimize light-headedness. If necessary, walk with a cane for extra stability."

However, if you are already dehydrated, try drinking a sports drink or sipping some broth. The electrolytes in these drinks can help you to rehydrate quickly and work better than water alone. In addition, increased salt intake can be beneficial if you have low blood pressure.

[16] X Research source For example, your dizziness may be caused by hunger, by standing up too quickly, or by showering with very hot water. Figure out your dizziness triggers and you should be able to head them off in advance. When you have a dizzy spell, write a brief description of your symptoms and what time you experienced them. Jot down any other details you think might be relevant, like what (and when) you last ate, what position you were in when the spell started, and whether you have any other symptoms. Make note of how long the spell lasted and how severe it was. Use a consistent scale to track severity (e.g., from 1-5, with 5 being the most severe)."

[18] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tuck away any electrical wires that you might be in danger of tripping over during dizzy spells. Avoid placing low objects, like footstools or coffee tables, in the middle of areas where you frequently walk. Use night-lights so you don’t get disoriented in the dark. Avoid thick carpeting, which makes it harder for your feet to register changes in position and posture. Use non-slip mats in your bath and on your bathroom floor. Consider installing handrails in hallways, bathrooms, or stairwells."
