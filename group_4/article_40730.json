      "content": "Obtain all necessary licenses. Licensing criteria will differ depending on where you live, but at the very least you’ll need to be able to show proof of your cosmetology certification and apply for a standard operator’s license to conduct business. Additionally, some U.S. states require that salon owners carry a seller’s permit in order to be recognized as a legal vendor of specialty products. If you haven't already, start researching cosmetology programs in your area. These courses typically take 1-2 years to complete. At the end of this time, you'll be awarded the credentials you need to operate your own salon. [4] X Research source You can file for your operator’s license, along with other licenses like different classes of seller’s permits, through the central business licensing association for your state or territory. For more information on licensing and local laws, contact your city’s business affairs board or visit your county clerk’s office.

Along with the regular cost of operation once you’re up and running, there will be expenses associated with leasing, licensing and property inspection, taxes and basic equipment and supplies. There will also be the matter of payroll once you begin hiring employees to work under you. [7] X Research source Consult with a professional business adviser or talk to the owner of the salon you frequent to get an idea of how much it will take to open your own.

These forms should be filed with the office of the Secretary of State in your locality. When this is done, you'll need to register for your Employee Identification Number (EIN), which will be used to identify your business and place you within the appropriate tax bracket as owner. [8] X Research source Your salon can be set up as a sole proprietorship if you're going into business for yourself, or as a general partnership or LLC (limited liability company) if you're bringing another person in with you. Joint ownership is a great way to split labor and expenses, but it also means your profits will be shared.

      "content": "Rent out a suitable space for your salon. Choose a location that strikes a balance between posh privacy and commercial convenience. The key here is visibility—you want to appeal to your core clientele, but also be noticeable to curious passersby who are wandering in off the street. Being situated near clothing stores, restaurants, and other spots that are popular with your customer base can be an advantage. [11] X Research source Most successful salons are part of larger shopping centers, though some can be found in small, freestanding buildings. Go with what your instincts (and budget) dictate.

Incorporating accents like bohemian wall hangings and potted plants can help create a more relaxing atmosphere.

That way, your clientele will know exactly what to expect coming in, and you can focus on providing the best service possible. Trying to wear too many hats can cause you to lose your identity—and business in the process. [20] X Research source A salon that advertises nail art, facials, chemical exfoliation, and hot stone massage all under the same roof is enough to make a potential customer's head spin.

Break down the price point of each service individually to make sure you’re coming up with a number that’s fair. [21] X Research source If you find yourself stumped about how high you should set your prices, think about the maximum amount you would be willing to pay as a consumer, then compare that figure against your specific operating budget and expenses. [22] X Research source When you’re first starting out, it may be a good idea to keep your prices low in order to be able to compete with the better-known salons in your area.
