      "content": "Stubborn True to their sign’s patron bull, Lunar Tauruses aren’t afraid to dig their hooves in and stand their ground (even when the pressure’s on). They’re the friend who unapologetically orders pineapple on their half of the pizza, or the sibling who refuses to upgrade their 20-year-old toaster (even if there’s a perfectly cheap model at the store). When it comes to Taurus Moons, there’s never any doubt about where they stand. Tip: It’s completely valid to have your own preferences and opinions, but a little bit of compromise can go a long way! Don’t be afraid to meet in the middle with your friends and loved ones—especially if you’re the main holdout.

Taurus Moons never forget anything they hear in a conversation—you can bet that they’ll shoot you a text on your birthday and have all their school assignments turned in on time. Their good memory can be a double-edged sword, though, as they aren’t quick to forget a hurtful comment or barb. Tip: Learning to forgive and forget isn’t an easy process, but it’s definitely a worthwhile one. When you choose forgiveness, you’re refusing to let negativity define or control you."
