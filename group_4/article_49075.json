There are many variations of pushups that can help you build your chest muscles, but for beginners, there's nothing wrong with basic, ordinary pushups. [2] X Research source That said, when starting push ups, avoid lowering your chest too close to the ground. Lowering yourself too close to the floor can tear tissues in the shoulder. Gradually work your way to lowering yourself slightly closer to the floor over time. Lie face down with your hands on the floor directly under their respective shoulders. Straighten your back so that your feet and your shoulders create a straight, rigid line. One repetition consists of bending your arms down to a 90 degree angle and straightening them out again. Raise and lower your body in a slow, steady motion. Do as many of these as you can! If you are an absolute beginner, you may need to start out doing pushups with your knees on the floor, but your hips and back straight."

[3] X Research source Lie face down with you hands on the bench. Position your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your feet about hip-width apart, with your toes on the floor. Keep your back and legs as straight as you can. Then, slowly and steadily lower your body so that your chest is just a few inches from the bench. Return to the starting position by straightening your arms, and repeat. Incline pushups are an easy variation, making them great for beginners. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Perform single-leg pushups. Start in the basic pushup position, with your feet spread to shoulder width or wider. Lift one foot so that it is hovering off of the ground and then complete each repetition just as you would with a basic pushup. [5] X Research source After doing a few repetitions, switch legs. For example, try to do five single-leg pushups with your left leg raised, then do another five with the right raised. Keep your glutes tight while doing these. If you want to, you can exercise your legs at the same time by moving the knee of the raised leg toward your elbow as you push up, and switching legs with each repetition. Some people call these, \"reptile\" or \"lizard\" pushups. The wider apart your feet are, the harder the push up will be, because it will shift more of your weight to one arm. [6] X Research source Single-leg pushups are among the most challenging variations. [7] X Research source You will probably need to work up to these."

Lower yourself until your arms are at a 90 degree angle, then raise yourself up until your arms are straight again. [10] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Dips are a great way to work out the inner chest muscles, which are often under-exercised with pushups. For beginners, you can actually do dips with your hands on the seat and your legs stretched out in front of you and the backs of your heels touching the floor. [11] X Research source When beginning dips, be careful with how far you lower yourself. Slowly increase your range until you can lower your torso to a 90-degree bend in the elbow. The elbow should never bend more than 90 degrees, or else a shoulder injury can occur."
