      "content": "Determine whether the floor has already been treated. You may want to wax a floor that has already been treated, since these surfaces do wear down and get dirty eventually. First, find out which type of product was used: natural ones called wax , or synthetic ones called finish . If the previous owner is unable to tell you, you'll need to examine the floor yourself: If the floor is not shiny or glossy, and you can feel the original material with your finger, it has not been treated. Wipe a small section of the floor with a cloth dipped in mineral spirits or paint thinner. If the cloth turns yellow or brown, your floor has been waxed. If the cloth does not pick up any residue, your floor has been finished."

      "title": "Choose a wax or finish.",
      "content": "Choose a wax or finish. If your floor has never been treated, you can select any wax or finish product intended for the material your floor is made from. Polyurethane is a popular, glossy option, but each product will appear slightly different, so do your research and determine which look you want. If your floor has already been treated, you'll need to choose the correct option: Wax is difficult to fully remove, since it soaks into the wood. This makes the floor unsuitable for a synthetic finish unless you hire a professional to strip the wax fully, but new wax can be applied without difficulty after stripping, or even simply applied on top if the old layer is only scratched, not dirty. If the floor has been finished, you can go over it with a floor machine with scrubbing pad attachment to remove part of the finish, then apply that same type of finish to improve the appearance. If you can't figure out what type it is, or if you want to use a different type, you'll need to strip the old finish off entirely first. [1] X Research source If you don't want to strip a previous finish, you can use a water-based silicone polish instead of waxing. Simply sweep the floor, then apply several even layers of the polish with a mop. [2] X Research source"

Having determined what type of finish is on your floor by following the instructions for Preparing the Floor, buy a stripping solution that will remove that type. Also make sure the stripping solution is safe to use on hardwood, or whichever material your floor is made from. If you can't find a product that specifically matches the type of finish previously used on your floor, try out a \"universal\" floor stripping solution on a small corner of your floor to test it."

Follow the instructions on the floor stripping solution to determine how much you need, and whether to dilute the solution with water. Have a mop ready. The trash bag is especially essential for mop buckets, since you don't want to later clean your floor with residual floor stripping solution. A \"strip mop\" is a specialized mop that will do a more effective job, but any mop will do."

Stripping solution makes the floor slippery, so plan your route in advance to avoid having to walk over it. Scrub the floor evenly and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, but do not allow it to dry. Try to agitate the finish with your mop as you apply the stripping solution. The stripping solution should change color as it removes and mingles with the finish over the next few minutes. If you are stripping a large floor, do so in small sections so the stripping solution doesn't dry."

For large jobs, an auto scrubber or rotary machine is recommended, as it will do a thorough job pulling up all the finish. If using an auto scrubber, scrub the area leaving the squeegee tool up (not in use). If using a floor machine or burnishing machine, use the stripping pad attachment. Large jobs may require multiple stripping pads."

If you don't want to buy a specialized tool, any sharp flat blade such as a putty knife will do the job. Without stepping on the slippery floor stripping solution, use the blade to work the wax away from edges, where the stripping solution and mop have difficulty pulling off the finish. You may need to scrub the baseboard as well, if it has picked up wax residue. You can purchase a special baseboard stripping pad if you are using a floor machine."

If you are trying to create a similar result using a synthetic finish, which bonds over the wood, you will need to follow the specific instructions that came with your product. Polyurethane, the most common modern finish, should be stirred, then applied as quickly as possible and in one back and forth layer across the room, overlapping the previous stroke so you keep a wet edge. You should wear an organic vapor respirator mask and keep a fan blowing out a window while you work."

If you try to wax too large an area at once, you are more likely to miss spots or apply the wax unevenly. If your first layer is too thick, the whole process could fail to set properly. Be careful not to drip excess wax onto the floor, and only use a damp,not soaked mop. Once the floor in one section is evenly covered, mop over it with broad strokes in the same direction to create an even appearance. Now you can move on to the next section."

After ten minutes of natural drying, you can point a fan into the room to make it dry faster, but do not point it directly at the waxed floor. This could interfere with the adhesive. Read the label of your floor wax for more accurate estimate of drying time."

If you don't want to track down specialized equipment, simply use a clean, dry terry cloth towel to polish your floor with a circular motion. Tie the towel around a dry mop head and you don't have to be on your hands and knees. A buffing pad can be attached under the brush of the floor machine and used to buff the floor."
