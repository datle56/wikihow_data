      "title": "He’s into you romantically and he’s trying to flirt with you.",
      "content": "He’s into you romantically and he’s trying to flirt with you . If he wants to show you that he likes you as more than a friend, calling you cute could be his first move. It shows that he really admires you, loves being around you, and thinks of you as a potential romantic partner. [1] X Research source More signs he could be flirting with you include smiling a lot, touching your arm frequently, teasing you playfully, and finding excuses to hang out with you. For example, if he puts his arm on your shoulder, makes eye contact, and smiles when he calls you cute, he’s probably flirting with you."

    {
      "title": "He likes you for more than just your looks.",
      "content": "He likes you for more than just your looks. “Cute” doesn’t only mean you’re good-looking; it means you’re the whole package. From the inside out, you’re beautiful, exciting, playful, and great to be around. Even if you’re shy, he sees you’ve got a great loveable personality. He could be interested in dating you. [2] X Research source This is especially the case if he complimented you after you did something endearing, like telling a joke, celebrating a good score on a math test, or making a funny face. The fact that he calls you cute for something you did as opposed to what you’re wearing or how you did your makeup could mean that he sees both your personality and your appearance as cute."

    {
      "title": "He thinks you’re gorgeous but he’s too scared to say it.",
      "content": "He thinks you’re gorgeous but he’s too scared to say it. Calling you cute is a pretty safe option, so it could be that he wanted to say more but chickened out. Maybe he wanted to call you hot or gorgeous but didn’t want to go too far out on a limb. [3] X Research source If he seems nervous, looks down at his shoes, or blushes when he calls you cute, that could be a sign that he wants to say more about your beauty but is scared to take the next step. If this is the case, he probably has a long list of amazing things he's noticed about you: your smile, your friendliness, your sense of style, and your intelligence, on top of how gorgeous you are. With more time, he might compliment you about things other than your cuteness."
    },
    {
      "title": "He feels comfortable around you.",
      "content": "He feels comfortable around you. If he feels at ease enough to give you a sweet compliment, that means that he can be himself around you. He doesn’t worry that you’ll judge him for being vulnerable and telling you what he likes about you. It’s a great sign for a potential relationship if he feels that comfortable with you. [4] X Research source This is especially true if he’s normally shy but gave you a compliment anyway. If he grins, gives a happy sigh, and seems more energetic after calling you cute, it means that he’s comfortable around you and is relieved that he feels free to speak his mind with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "He wants to make you happy.",
      "content": "He wants to make you happy. If he’s giving you a compliment, he wants you to feel good about yourself—it’s as simple as that! He wants to make you happy by telling you how great you are. He’s putting himself out there, for no reason other than to make you smile. [5] X Research source Giving thoughtful compliments is a great sign in a potential boyfriend. It shows that he’s observant, caring, and puts your needs first."
    },
    {
      "title": "He thinks your outfit is cool.",
      "content": "He thinks your outfit is cool. There’s a difference between “You look so cute today!” and “You’re so cute.” If he said that you’re looking cute today, it could be that he loves your outfit, your shoes, or your hair. Sometimes a compliment is just a compliment! [6] X Research source You can tell the difference between indirect flirting and a simple compliment by noticing how long he looks at you, how close he gets to you when he talks with you, and whether his tone was high-energy, loud, and friendly or flirtatious, soft, and breathy. If you’re interested in him, getting a compliment is a good sign no matter what—even if it just means he likes your shoes. Even though a compliment is not always a sign of romantic interest, it’s fantastic that he’s paying attention to you and that he thinks you’re cool. Don’t count yourself out yet."

      "title": "He loves your sense of humor.",
      "content": "He loves your sense of humor. “Cute” can apply to the hilarious spirit you bring to life. You don’t take yourself too seriously, and he’s noticed. Maybe he said it just after you made a goofy face, made the funniest dad joke, or laughed so hard milk came out of your nose. In that case, he’s saying that he finds your sense of humor attractive and that it makes him happy. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He loves the way your brain works.",
      "content": "He loves the way your brain works. Lots of guys love a sharp mind, and calling you “cute” could be a way for him to express that your way of thinking and talking is simply irresistible. He could love hearing you talk through a complicated issue, or maybe he adores the cute look on your face when you’ve just found the answer to a tough math problem. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "He’s flattering you for an ulterior motive.",
      "content": "He’s flattering you for an ulterior motive. Men sometimes flirt in order to get something out of you. It could be that he wants help on his homework or the inside scoop on some gossip, or he might want a hook-up. Either way, be aware that guys can use compliments to manipulate you into doing something that you otherwise might not want to do. [9] X Research source If you don’t know him very well but he’s acting like you’re close, that could be a sign he’s trying to manipulate you. Other warning signs could include asking you to do something right after he compliments you, only ever complimenting your looks but not your personality, or being nice to your face but never acknowledging you in front of his friends. Think about whether you like him for who he is or just because he’s complimenting you. Only give him what he’s asking for if you like him as a person and want to do it."

      "title": "He wants to feed his ego.",
      "content": "He wants to feed his ego. Even though his compliments seem selfless, he might be trying to make you like him more because he's flattering you. He could be doing it so that he feels more popular and powerful. [10] X Research source This might be the case if he seems to compliment everyone around him, and only ever gives surface-level compliments that apply to anyone (like “You’re so cute” or “You have pretty eyes”) rather than compliments that shows he actually cares about you (like “I love how excited you get when you talk about Star Trek” or “It’s so cute how your nose crinkles when you laugh”). This is a warning sign of narcissism : overwhelming someone with compliments so they grow reliant on their praise. If he respects you as an individual and he’s only called you cute a couple of times, though, you’re fine."

    {
      "title": "He wants to diminish you.",
      "content": "He wants to diminish you. Lots of people use “cute” as a normal, flirty compliment, but occasionally people say it in a way that’s belittling and dismissive. If someone says it like that, they’re trying to make you seem small, silly, and innocent, even though you’re capable and strong. [11] X Research source If he doesn’t smile or sound sincere when he says that you’re cute, it could be that he’s using the compliment to dismiss you. For example, if he rolls his eyes and says “You’re cute” when you show him something you’re proud of or when you make a mistake, he’s implying that you’re incapable and shouldn’t even bother trying. [12] X Research source This use isn’t kind or considerate, and it should be a warning sign that he’s not interested in you for who you are."

      "title": "Cute vs Hot",
      "content": "Cute vs Hot “Cute” is broader, applying to both your good looks and your charming personality. “Hot” is different from cute because it describes a sexier kind of attractiveness. Saying “you’re cute” compliments your looks more affectionately and playfully, while describing you as hot is more direct and sensual. Some people might think you can only be either cute or hot, but in reality, lots of people are both. It just depends on how you’re presenting yourself and what kind of compliment he wants to give you. If he thinks you’re cute, chances are he’d also find you hot in the right context.

    {
      "title": "Cute vs Beautiful",
      "content": "Cute vs Beautiful Calling you cute is more low-key and general, while saying you’re beautiful is a direct but basic compliment about the way you look, like how pretty your face is. Calling someone beautiful is a little more serious and mature than calling them cute. [14] X Research source \"Beautiful\" and \"cute\" aren't necessarily different: sometimes when a guy says you’re cute, he wants to say you’re beautiful but he’s not ready to be that direct yet."

    {
      "title": "Cute vs Gorgeous",
      "content": "Cute vs Gorgeous “Gorgeous” is an over-the-top way to describe your stunning appearance, while cute can be used in more situations and in more subtle ways. “Cute” is an everyday way to say that you’re easy on the eyes, fun to be around, and completely loveable from the inside out. “Gorgeous” would be used more on special occasions, like when you’re dressed up for a formal dance or a wedding."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cute vs Fun",
      "content": "Cute vs Fun “Cute” is more of a flirtatious compliment than “fun.” If a guy calls you “fun,” he means you have an energetic and easy-going personality that makes you the perfect person to hang out with, either as a friend or romantically. With “cute,” though, he means that you’re all that and more—you’re a fun person with the appealing looks to go with it."

    {
      "title": "“Aw, thank you so much!”",
      "content": "“Aw, thank you so much!” Of all the ways to respond when a guy calls you cute , this is the most reliable and flexible. Accept the compliment with positivity and gratitude. This response works well in all situations where you’re flattered by his kind words. By saying this, you’re showing him that you really appreciate the compliment and that it made you feel great."
    },
    {
      "title": "“I know 😉”",
      "content": "“I know 😉” This flirty response works well over text and in person, as long as you say it with a cheeky wink. It shows that you’re confident and independent, but you still appreciate the compliment. You show that he’s not telling you anything you don’t already know—you’re amazing, and if he’s only just realizing it he’s late to the party."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Thanks, you’re pretty cute yourself.”",
      "content": "“Thanks, you’re pretty cute yourself.” If you appreciated his compliment, it’s a great idea to flip it back on him and make him blush, too. Giving him a compliment in return will show him that you’re interested in him, too, and it’ll make his day. When you return the compliment, give him a compliment that’s as flirtatious as his or more if you want to show him you’re interested, like saying he’s “cute” or “hot.” Pick a more specific thing to compliment him on. For example, you could compliment him on how cute his eyes are, or his smile. If you want to de-escalate the flirtation but protect his feelings, giving a surface-level compliment is a good way to do that. If he says you’re really cute, and you respond by saying you like his shirt, he might assume that you don’t like him as much as he likes you because your compliment was less flirty than his."
    },
    {
      "title": "“That’s the best compliment, coming from you :)”",
      "content": "“That’s the best compliment, coming from you :)” Say this over text or in person to show that you value his opinion and love hearing his compliments. This response shows that you’re interested in a more subtle way, and also implies that he’s pretty cute, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "“Thanks, but now’s not the time for that sort of thing.”",
      "content": "“Thanks, but now’s not the time for that sort of thing.” If you're not interested, redirect or shut down the conversation. If you don’t like that he called you cute, or it’s not the right time or place for flirtation, change the topic or walk away to show you’re not interested in flirting with him right now. You can also say: “I don’t know you well enough for you to talk like that,” “That’s nice of you to say, but let’s keep my looks out of this,” or “Thank you. Going back to what we were talking about…”"
