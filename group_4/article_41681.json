      "content": "Refine your towel drying technique. It’s important to be gentle when towel drying your hair, as rubbing your hair together too roughly can cause frizziness. Hold the extra absorbent towel around the tips of your hair to absorb moisture and slowly work your way up your hair, absorbing as you go. Then gently tousle your hair with the towel, making sure not to rub the ends of your hair together if you have long hair."

      "content": "Brush wet hair until it’s dry. If you don’t want to use a blowdryer, gently towel dry your hair and continue to brush it until it’s dry if you can. Brushing helps to separate your hair and remove moisture. Brushing also encourages straightening because it slightly pulls on your hair and helps it not curl up as it usually does. If you don’t want to continually brush, you can brush your hair in spurts, with 5-minute breaks between each spurt to let it air dry."

Apply the mask by using your hands to scoop up the mask and work it through the strands of your hair. Let it soak into your hair for 1 hour while you wear a plastic shower cap, then wash it out of your hair with water. [9] X Research source Hair masks work best if you use them once or twice a week.

      "content": "Make a milk and egg mask. Another variation on a milk mask is a milk and egg mask. Mix 2 cups (480 ml) of whole or coconut milk along with 1 egg in a large bowl, whisking to completely break up the yolk. Place the bowl in the sink or on a table and sit directly in front of it, then lean back and soak your hair in the bowl for 10 minutes. After ten minutes, take your hair out of the bowl without squeezing out the excess moisture from the mask and put your hair up in a bun if you have long hair. Wrap plastic wrap around your head and let the mask soak in for another 30 minutes, then unwrap and wash out the mask with cool water so the egg doesn’t cook. [10] X Research source Wrapping your head with plastic wrap retains the moisture of the mask and the warmth encourages the mask to soak in."

      "content": "Use hair ties to encourage straightening. Wet your hair, either from showering or from rinsing your hair briefly in the sink. Section your hair into 2 low ponytails and secure each ponytail with a hair tie near the base of your neck. Use another pair of hair ties to loosely tie the ponytails 2 inches (5 cm) below where the first ponytail ties are. Keep applying hair ties every few inches until you reach the end of your hair. In the morning, take out the hair ties to reveal your straightened hair. Try to tie the hair ties loosely, as tying them tightly may leave dent marks or crimps in your hair. If you have curly hair, this will help loosen your curls but won’t make your hair completely straight."

Brush or comb your hair, then divide it along the central part into 2 sections. Take the left section and comb it over the top of your head toward the right section. Wind it around your head until you reach the end of your hair, then pin the section in place at the back of your head with bobby pins. Do the same on the right side, flipping the hair over to the left side and pinning it in place.
