This is not possible with all polynomials, but it's a good approach to check first. [1] X Research source Example 1: Solve for x in the polynomial 2 x 3 + 12 x 2 + 16 x = 0 {\\displaystyle 2x^{3}+12x^{2}+16x=0} . Each term is divisible by 2x, so factor it out: ( 2 x ) ( x 2 ) + ( 2 x ) ( 6 x ) + ( 2 x ) ( 8 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle (2x)(x^{2})+(2x)(6x)+(2x)(8)=0} = ( 2 x ) ( x 2 + 6 x + 8 ) {\\displaystyle =(2x)(x^{2}+6x+8)} Now solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula or factoring: ( 2 x ) ( x + 4 ) ( x + 2 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle (2x)(x+4)(x+2)=0} The solutions are at 2x = 0, x+4=0, and x+2=0.

      "content": "Identify polynomials that act like a quadratic. You likely already know how to solve second degree polynomials, in the form a x 2 + b x + c {\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c} . You can solve some higher-degree polynomials the same way, if they're in the form a x 2 n + b x n + c {\\displaystyle ax^{2n}+bx^{n}+c} . Here are a couple examples: Example 2: 3 x 4 + 4 x 2 − 4 = 0 {\\displaystyle 3x^{4}+4x^{2}-4=0} Let a = x 2 {\\displaystyle a=x^{2}} : 3 a 2 + 4 a − 4 = 0 {\\displaystyle 3a^{2}+4a-4=0} Solve the quadratic using any method: ( 3 a − 2 ) ( a + 2 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle (3a-2)(a+2)=0} so a = -2 or a = 2/3 Substitute x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} for a: x 2 = − 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}=-2} or x 2 = 2 / 3 {\\displaystyle x^{2}=2/3} x = ±√(2/3) . The other equation, x 2 = − 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}=-2} , has no real solution. (If using complex numbers, solve as x = ±i√2 ). Example 3: x 5 + 7 x 3 − 9 x = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{5}+7x^{3}-9x=0} does not follow this pattern, but notice you can factor out an x: ( x ) ( x 4 + 7 x 2 − 9 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle (x)(x^{4}+7x^{2}-9)=0} You can now treat x 4 + 7 x 2 − 9 {\\displaystyle x^{4}+7x^{2}-9} as a quadratic, as shown in example 2."
