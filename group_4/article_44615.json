      "title": "Ask your doctor about prescription topical antifungal cream if you have nipple thrush.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about prescription topical antifungal cream if you have nipple thrush. The easiest way to treat thrush is with a prescription cream, so if you suspect you have it, schedule an appointment with your doctor right away. If your doctor prescribes a topical antifungal, such as nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole or gentian violet, follow your doctor’s orders or the label instructions on how often and when to use it. At each dosing, apply enough of the cream to completely cover your nipples. [2] X Research source If your physician's application instructions are different than the ones on the label, prioritize the orders given by your doctor. Do not cover the area with a bandage or any kind of wrap, as this can increase the chances of skin irritation. However, you can wear your normal clothing, including a bra. In most cases, you’ll need to apply the cream to your nipples 4 to 8 times daily after breastfeeding for 14 days. Some strains of candida may be resistant to topical antifungal medications. If your symptoms don’t ease during the course of treatment, ask your doctor to recommend another medication."

      "title": "Apply an azole antifungal cream for an OTC option.",
      "content": "Apply an azole antifungal cream for an OTC option. If you can’t get to the doctor right away or your thrush didn’t respond to the prescription cream, you can use an over-the-counter azole cream to treat your thrush. Apply this cream several times a day, especially after feedings. If any of the cream is still there the next time you get ready to nurse, wipe it away with a tissue or paper towel before you breastfeed. [3] X Research source These may be labeled as a yeast infection cream like Monistat (miconazole) or an antifungal like Lotrimin (clotrimazole). If you started out with the prescription cream, finish your entire prescription before you switch to an over-the-counter option, unless your doctor directs otherwise."

      "title": "Ask your doctor about an oral antifungal medication.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor about an oral antifungal medication. If topical treatments do not help, then using an oral antifungal medication may be necessary. Your doctor may prescribe fluconazole (Diflucan) if your infection does not respond to topical medicines. You’ll likely start off with a high dose, such as 200 to 400 mg, and then take a smaller dose of 100 to 200 mg daily until the infection clears. [4] X Research source Ketoconazole is another option if fluconazole does not help."

      "content": "Take the entire course of your medication, even if your symptoms improve. Follow the label instructions or your doctor’s orders on how long to use the medicine. Otherwise, the infection could return, and it may be harder to treat if the fungus develops a resistance to the medication you used. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your symptoms may improve after about 2-3 days, but it can take a week or more for the infection to clear up fully."

      "content": "Try taking supplements along with your medicine. Certain supplements may help your body fight off a yeast infection. However, it’s important to use these in addition to a prescription or over-the-counter treatment, and not in place of it. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try taking Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets as directed on the package, for instance. The beneficial bacteria in this probiotic are already naturally found in your body, and they may be able to help your body correct a yeast imbalance.

[9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source These medications will need to be administered orally by a dropper. The doctor will give you precise dosing instructions based on your baby’s age and weight, or they will advise you to follow the dosing instructions on the medication’s label. Do not give any medications to your baby without talking to your pediatrician first. Since thrush is so contagious, it’s important to treat your baby’s thrush at the same time as your own. If anyone else in your family has a yeast infection, including a diaper rash, vaginal yeast infection , or foot fungus , treat that at the same time as well. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Offer your baby short, frequent feedings while you have thrush. Breastfeeding can be extremely painful if you have thrush, but it may be easier if you feed your baby for a shorter time, but more frequently. Also, try starting with the least painful breast, since your baby is likely to feed from that side longer. [11] X Research source For instance, if you normally feed your baby for 20 minutes every 2 hours, try feeding them for 10 minutes every hour, instead."

      "content": "Use crushed ice to numb your nipples before you nurse. Place some crushed ice in a plastic bag or wrap it in a paper towel, then apply the ice to your nipples for about 5 minutes before you nurse. This may help relieve some of the pain that you experience during breastfeeding. [12] X Research source Discard the bag or paper towels after you use them on your nipples; otherwise, they could spread the infection. Don't apply ice directly to your skin, and don't leave it on for longer than 5-10 minutes, as doing so can damage your skin."

[13] X Trustworthy Source US Office on Women's Health U.S. government agency providing resources for women's health Go to source Avoid freezing this expressed milk to use later. The yeast will not be killed by freezing it, so it may be possible to reinfect your baby with this milk. If even pumping is too painful, you can supplement your baby's diet with formula."

When you’re finished, dry the clothes on the hottest setting on your dryer or hang them in the sun to dry. Ensure that your clothing and undergarments are completely dry before wearing them.

[26] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your nipples look flattened, misshapen, or white after you breastfeed, the pain is likely due to a poor latch.
