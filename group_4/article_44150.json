      "content": "Download a fitness tracker app. There are many different apps on the market for smartphone users to choose from. Some of the most popular include RunKeeper, MapMyRun, and Nike+Running. These apps typically come equipped with features like a stopwatch, step counter, and tools for averaging speed and pace. [1] X Research source The majority of these apps are free for download. The full versions of some programs, like Nike+Running, may only be accessible with the purchase of specialty training products. For best results using a fitness tracker, you’ll need to use a device with GPS compatibility and plenty of memory to store workout data."

      "content": "Set the app to your fitness level. When you first load the app, you’ll be asked for a few pieces of information pertaining to your fitness level and the type of exercise you’ll be performing. Fill in the slots corresponding to your age, sex, height, weight, and running style. The more info you provide, the more individually tailored your experience will be. [2] X Research source Knowing a little about you will allow the app to help you set realistic goals and compare your performance to other runners with similar stats. Some fitness tracking programs may request additional details, such as your GPS coordinates, average elevation, and even the type of shoes you’re wearing. This info is used to generate more accurate feedback after each run. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep your device near the center of your body. Lace up your trainers and hit the streets. While you’re running, it’s best to keep your device in your pocket or on an armband where it can take more consistent physical readings. The app will be working in the background to follow your movement. You’ll be able to either put in a predetermined distance and have the app alert you when you’re nearing your target or run until you’re tired and check how far you’ve gone. Most programs use audio cues to keep you updated so you’re not forced to stop and look at the screen to check your progress. If you’d prefer to view the readout yourself, tuck your device into an armband so you can take an occasional peek, or simply carry it in your hand."

      "content": "Check your stats through the app. At any point during your run, you can take a look at your device and see how you’re doing. The main screen will display the distance you’ve traveled and current time to the millisecond. More sophisticated apps may also show you your average pace, changes in elevation, and heart rate. [4] X Research source When your session is over, you can choose to either clear your workout data or save it to refer back to during future outings."

      "title": "Purchase a wearable fitness tracker.",
      "content": "Purchase a wearable fitness tracker. Like a basic fitness app, a tracker will tell you your time, distance, and average pace. Unlike an app, however, these devices are also loaded with advanced tools like heart rate monitors and pedometers. As a result, the data they provide tends to be far more reliable. [5] X Research source A good smartwatch will set you back between $50-200, but can be an excellent investment if you run almost every day. [6] X Research source For even more precise readings, go with a fitness tracking system that uses separate shoe pods. [7] X Research source Runners who are serious about analyzing their performance will get more out of a wearable fitness tracker than a basic smartphone app."

      "content": "Program the device with your physical data. Put in each piece of information as accurately as possible so that the tracker will be properly calibrated for your body. You should only have to do this once. However, it may be a good idea to update your details periodically as your fitness level or body composition changes. [8] X Research source You may also have to specify the type of activity you’re performing, since fitness trackers are also used by cyclists, swimmers, and other athletes. Some trackers offer a list of health-related goals for users to choose from. When you select 1 or 2 of these goals, the device will program specialized workouts for you to help you achieve them.

      "content": "Review the information collected by the tracker at your leisure. Glancing at the readout on the tracker will tell you the distance you’ve traveled since the start of your run. Along with your total distance, you’ll see your current time, heart rate, average pace, and elevation. You can pause the device at any time should your run happen to be interrupted. [10] X Research source If becoming a better runner is your goal, it will be important to keep an eye on your average pace. Pace refers to how fast you’re capable of running a certain distance. Most fitness trackers save workout data automatically. If you’re running out of storage space on the device, you also have the option of syncing your archived stats to the cloud.

      "title": "Set up in Lane 1.",
      "content": "Set up in Lane 1. This is the easiest place to calculate distance. From the inside lane, a single lap around the track is 400 metres (1,300 ft). You can adjust your starting position to plan for various distances, ending at the finish line each time. [12] X Research source Running distances will only be exact from Lane 1. For every lane you move outward, you overall distance will increase by roughly 7.5 metres (25 ft). [13] X Research source Be sure to take the length of each lap into account if you plan on recording your numbers in a workout journal."

      "content": "Count the number of laps you run. The lines painted along the circumference of the track indicate the distance from different starting points, with the numbered start/finish line as the designated endpoint. If you start at the first curved line behind the start/finish line and run 4 laps, for instance, you've gone 1 mile (1.6 km). For longer workouts, add up the total number of laps you've run and divide it by 4 to find out how many miles it translates to. [14] X Research source Other distances are just as simple to map out. For a 1,500 m (4,900 ft) run, start at the first curved line beyond the start/finish line, then run 3 full laps and end at the finish line. For a 2 mile (3.2 km) run, you’ll begin at the 2 mile (3.2 km) marker, or the second curved line behind the start/finish line and run 8 laps for a total distance of 3,218 metres (10,558 ft). [15] X Research source One of the biggest advantages of running on a track is that allows you to set your own distance before you ever get started, rather than having to guess at it as you go."

      "content": "Begin your run from 1 of the designated starting positions. Situate yourself on the line that corresponds to the distance you want to cover. When you’re ready, get moving. Every time you cross the finish line, keep count of how many laps you’ve completed, and how many more you have left. [16] X Research source Pass other runners on the right as you run around the track, if other runners are going counter clockwise. If other runners are running clockwise, pass them on the left."

      "title": "Increase your overall distance in future workouts.",
      "content": "Increase your overall distance in future workouts. On your next session, take off from the set of lines just behind where you started last time to add 100 metres (330 ft). If you’re an experienced runner, or you’re training for a marathon, it might serve you better to tack on distance in mile or half-mile increments. Push yourself to bring your numbers up over time. [17] X Research source Runners typically calculate distance in increments of 200 metres (660 ft), 400 metres (1,300 ft), 600 metres (2,000 ft), 800 metres (2,600 ft), 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), and 1,200 metres (3,900 ft). Round numbers will make it easy to tab out your totals. [18] X Research source You can also customize your starting position and overall distance with a tape measure and markers. If a particular distance gives you trouble during a run, stick with that distance for a while and work on improving your pace instead of tacking on extra meters. Pace is as important as stamina, except long distances over 400 metres (1,300 ft)."
