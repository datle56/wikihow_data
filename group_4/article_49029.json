These guidelines are also recommended for unfinished spaces, outdoor areas and sheds, laundry rooms, and anywhere else near sinks, hot tubs, and other water sources. [1] X Research source At minimum, you'll need an outlet that includes a GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter), also called a RCD (residual-current device). This will shut off the power if it gets wet. Installing brand new sockets in these locations is best done by qualified electricians. Replacing a damaged socket here may be doable by yourself.

      "title": "Test the voltage.",
      "content": "Test the voltage. Never assume that the wires are dead without testing. Test a live circuit first to confirm the tool is working, then test the circuit you're working on. If you get a voltage reading, the outlet is still live and cannot be worked on. A non-contact voltage tester is easy to use, but less reliable. While you are grounded, place the tool against each hole in the outlet. If it lights up, or if its display reads anything other than zero, the outlet is live. [3] X Research source A multimeter is more reliable and gives a more accurate result. To test voltage with a multimeter , set the tool to its AC voltage setting in the 100V range (230V or higher for most European countries). Test by placing the red probe to the live socket (the small vertical hole in a US socket), then keep it there while you put the black probe first into the neutral socket (the taller vertical hole), then the ground (rounder hole). [4] X Expert Source Ricardo Mitchell Electrician & Construction Professional, CN Coterie Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. Warning : In the UK and some former UK colonies, some houses are wired in a ring circuit. These DIY tests are not sufficient in these cases. Never work on a circuit in these areas until an electrician has identified the type. [5] X Research source This article does not cover safety information for ring circuits."

If you see more terminals than described above, you are probably in one of these situations: When replacing an existing socket in the UK, you'll often have to fit two wires of each type to matching terminals. Installing a new socket only requires one set of wires. [9] X Research source A US two-socket outlet generally has a metal tab connecting the two live terminals, and another for the two neutrals. If there is only one wire of a given type in your wall, you can attach it to either terminal to power both sockets. A GFCI (RSD) outlet has two sets of terminals. Use the line terminals for these instructions. The load terminals (usually marked with yellow tape) are used to connect other devices to GFCI protection. [10] X Research source"

You can do this using a wire stripper or a utility knife . Take care to avoid nicking the metal of the wire, which can cause electrical faults later. [11] X Research source Err on the side of under-stripping so you can correct later. Some outlets have a built-in guide: place the wire in the short groove on the back and mark the end of the groove as your strip point. [12] X Research source Note that this guide may be for the \"push-in\" connector instead of the recommended wrapping method. If the three wires are enclosed in one PVC jacket, find the end of the bare copper ground wire. Grab this with needle-nose pliers and tug down to split open the seam of the jacket to access the other wires. [13] X Research source"

To prep for this, bend the stripped end into a U shape, so it will fit snugly around the whole screw. [14] X Research source Wire strippers have holes in them for this purpose. Slip the end of the wire in and twist. If you don't have a wire stripper, use needle-nose pliers. Many outlets have push-in connectors, or small holes below the terminal that hold the wire in with a spring clamp. If you use this, all you need to do is push the wires into the holes. However, these clamps can lose tension and eventually weaken the connection. [15] X Research source"

[16] X Research source Before you do this, be about 700% sure you are using the correct wire: USA: [17] X Research source Live cable is black (if there are two live cables, the second one is red) Neutral cable is white or grey Ground cable is uninsulated, green, or green & yellow EU & UK : [18] X Research source Live cable is brown (red for pre-2004 UK) Neutral cable is blue (black for pre-2004 UK) Earth (ground) cable is green & yellow"

When the test has been activated, a multimeter should read zero voltage from the outlet."
