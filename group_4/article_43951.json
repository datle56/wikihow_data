      "content": "Lay the 2 lines parallel, overlapping the ends by about 6–8 in (15–20 cm). Lay the monofilament line on top and the braided line on the bottom so they run parallel in opposite directions. Overlap the ends by at least 6–8 in (15–20 cm) to give yourself plenty of line to work with. [1] X Research source The double uni knot is the simplest and fastest way to tie a braided line to a monofilament line. It’s also one of the most reliable knots you can use to join any 2 lines together."

      "content": "Create a loop about the size of your fist with the mono line. Loop the overlapped end of the monofilament line down and back over itself. Pull the end up and lay it across the parallel braided line. [2] X Research source It’s easiest to practice tying the knot with the lines lying on a table or other flat work surface."

      "title": "Wrap the end of the mono line loop 7-8 times around the parallel lines.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the mono line loop 7-8 times around the parallel lines. Grab the end of the loop you just made and wrap it around both lines through the center of the loop. Pull the end of the mono line out of the loop after you wrap the lines 7-8 times so it is pointing the original direction it was going in before you created the loop. [3] X Research source Make sure you have enough line to pull on after wrapping it 7-8 times. If there isn’t enough slack, then start again with a bigger loop."

      "content": "Make a loop with the braided line. Double the end of the braided line up and back over itself. Pull the end down across the parallel mono line. Make sure you have left enough at the end of the loop to wrap it around the 2 parallel lines."

      "title": "Wrap the end of the braided line loop 4-5 times around both lines.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the braided line loop 4-5 times around both lines. Take the end of the loop you made with the braided line and wrap it around both lines through the center of the loop. Pull the end of the braided line out of the loop in the original direction it was facing after 4-5 wraps. If there isn’t enough line at the end of the loop to wrap it 4-5 times, then start over with a bigger loop. You can always cut off excess line later if you make it too big."

      "content": "Pull both ends of the lines apart to tighten the knot. Grab both sides of the joined lines, 1 in each hand, and pull them slowly in opposite directions to cinch the knots closed. You will now have 2 uni knots right next to each other connecting the braided and mono lines tightly, hence the name double uni knot. [4] X Research source The double uni knot is about 90% sure to hold when tied properly."

      "content": "Make a loop at the end of the braided line. Double the braided line back over itself to create a loop. Make the loop at least 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) long so you have plenty to work with. [5] X Research source The albright knot is an alternative knot you can use to tie a braided line to a monofilament line. You can use it to tie any lines of 2 different diameters together."
