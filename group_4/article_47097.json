Because turning off Profile View History and Post View History also prevents you from seeing who views or watches your TikTok content, it's not ideal for everyone. Another option is to view the person's profile (or watch their TikTok video) when you're not signed into your account. There are two ways to do this: You can log out of TikTok on your Android, iPhone, or iPad at Settings and privacy > Log out , and then search for the TikTok user or video you want to watch. If you don't want to log out, open a web browser on your computer, phone, or tablet and go to https://www.tiktok.com . Once you're there, search for the video or user you want to check out."
