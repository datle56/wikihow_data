Instead of trying to be all things to all people, success is more attainable by targeting a need and fulfilling it. [1] X Research source One of the best examples of this strategy can be seen by the success of franchise sign printing businesses, which target budget-minded business owners who only need occasional signs and banners, which can be spotty (inconsistent demand) or loaded with competition. They do not attempt to offer anything but quick-turnaround signs and leave brochures and envelope printing to traditional offset printing businesses. [2] X Research source"

Caution : Any verbal or written agreement like You [the printer] know what looks right, so you can okay the proofs for color and quality is loaded with the danger of customer rejecting the finished product. For example, they may require: Product match, excellent quality – very precise color, hue, and tone for high end products. Color match, excellent quality – usually precise Process Matching System (PMS Colors) by screen values (tones created by dot sizes) of the 4 process colors (cyan, magenta, process yellow, and black). Or just pleasing color , of medium quality – which is not so precisely matched. Caution : that means pleasing to the customer , not to you. Commercial quality printing is probably a cut above desktop publishing, done in your-office (above typical office printer, copier, or duplicator quality). It requires sharp line art and text – fineness of line work does not vary from page to page, screen color or halftone detail is consistent. Any choice of printing process (or brand of paper) shown on a quote to your customer is for them to choose. No, you can not substitute a more profitable method or material. Unless they agree in writing to a change, they can demand that it be redone at your expense -- if you did not follow written specifications precisely."

Once you determine what your competitors are using in their printing businesses, start looking to purchase your own printing equipment. You’ll need to find the highest quality, yet still affordable, equipment for your niche. The wrong equipment can make or break your business.

This includes any licenses, certifications, permits such as a state sales tax permit (in the USA, under the United States Constitution guarantee of \"freedom of the press\" -- printers, printing companies, writers, editors and publishers can not be required to be licensed to be able to perform such work or services). You will need fire department certificates, fire extinguishers and other safety equipment, safety procedures, safety rated chemicals, zoning, building use and occupancy permits and other items required for your specific operating location. Even if you start a home-based printing business, you will likely need some kind of permit or license from your particular national, state and local governments. Call or meet with your local economic development agency to find out where to go next. You should familiarize yourself with Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requirements, including their and other agencies such as Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) “postings” (required posters about safety and employment opportunity, etc.). Record keeping, tax withholding, reporting, and paying taxes and social security quarterly for employees (including part-time) are necessary. If you only use independent, outside printing contractors to do occasional printing that you cannot do personally, then you could be a \"printing broker\" (non-affiliated, wholesaler) and not have employees. Quarterly estimates of income, record keeping, reporting of actual proceeds, and paying your personal proprietorship or corporate (limited liability corporation [LLC]) taxes and social security for yourself is your responsibility to learn and complete each year."

A food manufacturer might think they need a traditional vinyl banner for an event but they don't understand the pitfalls of using it in various scenarios. What they really need is a portable tabletop sign that can be utilized at events, sales meetings, and other public awareness activities. The more your customers understand what a product can do, the happier they will be with the finished product."
