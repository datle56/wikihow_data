This applies to most singular nouns, as well as plural nouns that don’t already end in S. If a singular noun ends in S, you’ll still add another S after the apostrophe.

      "content": "Add an apostrophe in place of missing letters to form a contraction. A contraction is a shortened form of a word or group of words that omits certain letters or sounds. In this case, the apostrophe represents those missing letters. In many cases, contractions are made up of a noun or pronoun and a verb or helping verb. [5] X Research source Ex: has n’t (has not) Ex: wo n’t (will not) Ex: she ’s (she is) Avoid using contractions that don’t exist, like “shouldn’t’ve.” We often say these in real life, but they aren’t appropriate for formal writing. Be very careful with the word “it.” Use an apostrophe with the word “it” only when you want to indicate a contraction for “it is” or “it has.” “It” is a pronoun, and pronouns have their own possessive form that does not use an apostrophe."

Because of this, you must add an apostrophe and another S to the end to show possession. According to some style guides, it is technically okay to only add the apostrophe if it’s a proper name that ends in S, but most guides prefer adding another S at the end.

While apostrophes are not used to make actual nouns or other words plural, they are used to create plural forms of individual letters, numbers, and other symbols, like ampersands. In most cases, simply add an apostrophe and an S at the end of the symbol. [8] X Research source Ex: “I got three A ’s on my report card.” Ex: “There are two 5 ’s in my phone number.” Ex: “That page has too many & ’s written on it.” If this seems confusing for numbers, avoid the problem altogether by spelling out the word of the number, like “ones” instead of “1’s.” Only do this for numerals that are ten or lower, however."

This is most often used in relation to years. Just remember that the apostrophe goes before the remaining numbers, not after.

This applies to all singular names, including those that end with an S, like James. If the name is plural, like when referring to a family’s last name, add only an apostrophe. [10] X Research source Ex: Mary ’s cat Ex: China ’s foreign policy Ex: Miles ’s book Depending on the style guide you follow, it may be appropriate to add only an apostrophe after a name that ends with ‘s’ (ex: Jame s’ ). Most style guides prefer adding an apostrophe ‘s,’ however (ex: James ’s ). If you’re referring to an entire family showing possession, make the name plural first. For example, the last name “Jones” would become “Jones es’ ”"

      "content": "Add an apostrophe and an S to show a contraction of a name. Just as apostrophes are used to form contractions with pronouns and verbs, they can also be used to form contractions with names and other proper nouns. Add the apostrophe after the name and in place of the words or sounds you’re omitting. [11] X Research source For example, instead of writing “Ben is coming,” you’d write “Ben ’s coming.” Instead of saying “Jessica has been working late,” you’d say “Jessica ’s been working late.” Instead of saying “Greg is really funny,” you’d say “Greg ’s really funny.” Technically, it isn’t grammatically correct to form a contraction using a proper name, as adding an apostrophe ‘s’ is supposed to indicate possession. While this should be avoided in formal writing, it’s generally okay to use in informal writing or in conversation."

If the name ends in S and has two or more syllables, only add an apostrophe to make it possessive.

In some cases, adding an apostrophe to a pronoun would make it a contraction instead, like with the pronoun “it.” [13] X Research source For example, “his,” “hers,” “its,” “yours,” “my,” and “ours,” are all possessive pronouns. None of them require an apostrophe to show possession. Adding an apostrophe to “it,” would make the word “it’s,” which is a contraction of “it is.”"

      "content": "Do not use apostrophes to make words plural. If you’re trying to make a word plural, simply add the usual suffix, like ‘s’ or ‘es.’ This includes words that already end in an S, as adding an apostrophe would make them possessive rather than plural. [14] X Research source Ex: the plural of the last name “Johnson” is “Johnson s ,” not “Johnson’s” Ex: If you have more than one apple, write “apple s ,” not “apple’s.” This includes acronyms, like “CD.” The plural form of CD is “CD s ,” not “CD’s.” To make a year plural, like 1980, write “1980 s ” not “1980’s.” The wrong use of an apostrophe to form the plural is called the greengrocer's apostrophe since grocers are often the worst (or at least the most visible) offenders."
