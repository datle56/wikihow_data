      "title": "Use a soaker hose for best results.",
      "content": "Use a soaker hose for best results. Wrap the hose in a spiral around the tree, starting outside the canopy's perimeter and finishing 12 inches (30 cm) from the trunk. Turn the hose on, and let the water soak into the soil. Keep running the water until the top 10 inches (25 cm) of soil are moist. This can take a few hours depending on the size of the tree and how dry the soil is. [1] X Research source A soaker hose is a porous hose that slowly releases water over a period of time."

      "title": "Try a regular hose if you want something that is quick and easy.",
      "content": "Try a regular hose if you want something that is quick and easy. Place a hose on the ground next to the trunk and turn it on. Every 30 minutes, pick the hose up and move it to another spot around the trunk. Do this for a total of 1 to 2 hours, or until the tree is fully watered. [2] X Research source You may have to adjust the water pressure on the hose so that it comes out in a slow trickle rather than a forceful gush."

    {
      "title": "Switch to a bucket if you can't reach the tree with a hose.",
      "content": "Switch to a bucket if you can't reach the tree with a hose. Fill a large bucket with water and carry it over to the tree. Pour the water onto the soil around the tree. Keep making trips until the soil is fully watered. You will need at least 10 gallons (37.8 L) for a young tree--more for an older one. [3] X Research source If you have a lot of trees to water, consider loading multiple buckets onto a wagon, then pulling the wagon over to the trees."

      "title": "Use overhead sprinklers as a last resort.",
      "content": "Use overhead sprinklers as a last resort. These are a good way to cover large areas, but they don't provide a lot of moisture, and the moisture they do provide gets lost to evaporation. You should only use overhead sprinklers if you live in a cool area that doesn't receive a lot of sunlight. [4] X Research source If you must use a sprinkler, keep the water low so that it focuses on the ground rather than the leaves. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't rely on your lawn's irrigation system.",
      "content": "Don't rely on your lawn's irrigation system. Many lawns have irrigation systems, which are great for things like flowers and grass. This is not enough for a tree, however. Trees need a deep, soaking every 1 to 2 weeks rather than a shallow sprinkling every few days. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Research how much water your tree needs.",
      "content": "Research how much water your tree needs. Different types of trees will need different amounts of water, so it's important that you get off to a good start. If your tree did not come with a care tag, research the tree's species online. You can also look at books in the library, ask an arborist, or visit your local nursery. [7] X Research source Some trees will require more water, such as the red or silver maple, or the paper or river birch. Other trees will require less water, such as the Arizona cypress, Japanese Zelkova, the white fir, or the Kentucky Coffeetree."

      "title": "Water the soil to a depth of 10 inches (25 cm).",
      "content": "Water the soil to a depth of 10 inches (25 cm). Most of roots are going to be concentrated within the first 10 inches (25 cm) or so of soil. Watering the soil to a depth of 10 inches (25 cm) will ensure that these roots get enough water. You can tell if you've watered deep enough if you dig down 10 inches (25 cm) and the soil is still wet. [8] X Research source When the first 6 inches (15 cm) of soil are dry, it is time to water again. Test the soil by driving a screwdriver into it. The screwdriver will come out damp and dirty."

      "title": "Keep newly-planted trees evenly moist for the first 2 to 3 years.",
      "content": "Keep newly-planted trees evenly moist for the first 2 to 3 years. Focus on the root ball for the first few months. After that, you can expand your watering towards the perimeter of the canopy. After 2 to 3 years, the tree will become established, and you can reduce the watering. [9] X Research source Water your tree at least once per week. During hot, dry seasons, water the tree 3 times per week."

      "title": "Water 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the drip line for established trees.",
      "content": "Water 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the drip line for established trees. Watering a tree within the drip line is a good rule of thumb, but once a tree becomes established, its roots may extend beyond the drip line. Plan on watering about 3 feet (0.91 m) beyond the drip line to ensure that the roots are evenly soaked. [10] X Research source The drip line is the perimeter of the canopy."

      "title": "Take the environment and season into consideration when watering.",
      "content": "Take the environment and season into consideration when watering. Despite your tree's age, there are times when you will need to water your tree more or less often. For example, young trees need to be watered every 1 to 2 weeks. If you are entering a wet season, however, you won't need to water your tree as much due to all the rain. On the other hand, you will need to water your tree more often during hot and dry seasons. Other things to consider include: [11] X Research source Root and tree health: a sick tree or a tree with damaged roots will need more water to recover. Soil type: More-porous soil will need more water than less-porous soil. If your soil contains lots of sand, be prepared to water often, and vice-versa for clay-based soil. Tree species: drought-tolerant trees don't need much water while moisture-loving trees do. Research your tree to find out exactly how much water it needs. Remember that watering too much can harm your tree."

      "title": "Do not water around the trunk.",
      "content": "Do not water around the trunk. If you water around the trunk, you risk the soil and trunk rotting, which can kill your tree. You should water 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) away from the trunk of the tree. This is especially important for established trees. [12] X Research source You should water young trees near the trunk. Once the tree becomes established, you can water further away from the tree."

      "title": "Water in short bursts and give the water time to soak in.",
      "content": "Water in short bursts and give the water time to soak in. It is best to water the tree in short bursts rather than all at once. When you water the tree, allow the water to run until it starts to pool, then turn the water off and let it soak into the soil. Repeat this watering and soaking process until the first 10 inches (25 cm) of soil are moist. [13] X Research source Watering in short bursts will allow more oxygen to reach your tree."

      "title": "Avoid watering the tree during the hottest part of the day.",
      "content": "Avoid watering the tree during the hottest part of the day. This will vary depending on where you live, but in general, it is anywhere between 10am and 6pm. If you water your tree during this time, you risk losing the water to evaporation. Instead, water the tree before 10am or after 6pm. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Apply 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of mulch to help conserve water.",
      "content": "Apply 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of mulch to help conserve water. This will not only keep water from evaporating, but it will also prevent grass from growing around the tree and using up all the water. Apply a 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) layer of mulch in a 3 ft (0.91 m) wide ring around your tree. [15] X Research source You don't need to do this every time you water the tree--just the first time you plant the tree. Don't pile it against the trunk or you may get rot. If the mulch starts to rot, replace it. Organic mulch, such as pine straw or shredded bark, works the best."

      "content": "Plan your watering according to the water restrictions. Different cities will have different restrictions. Some cities will only allow you to water gardens on certain days, while other cities will have no restrictions on trees. If you have no restrictions, water your trees as usual. If you do have restrictions, water your trees whenever you can. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Focus on younger trees if you have multiple trees on your lot.",
      "content": "Focus on younger trees if you have multiple trees on your lot. Older trees can survive on a deep watering once a month during a drought, although twice a month would be better. Young trees are much more delicate, however, and should be watered at least once per week. Once the drought is over, gradually reduce how often you water your tree until you are watering every other week. [17] X Research source Water older trees to a depth of 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) once or twice a month during a drought. Water younger trees at least once per week with 5 to 15 gallons (18.9 to 56.8 L) of water during a drought."

      "title": "Choose trees over annuals and grass during a drought.",
      "content": "Choose trees over annuals and grass during a drought. Grass is cheap and easy to replace, and annual plants will die by the end of the year anyway. A tree will be much harder and more expensive to replace. When you have a water restriction, you should use whatever water you have on your tree. [18] X Research source Don't abandon your lawn entirely. Water it from time to time, even if it looks dead. This way, the grass will be able to regenerate once the restrictions are lifted."

      "title": "Do not fertilize your tree during a drought.",
      "content": "Do not fertilize your tree during a drought. Instead, focus on watering the tree. If you fertilize your tree, you will cause it to enter a growth spurt--which means that the tree will need even more water. It is best to leave your tree stunted during a drought. It will be smaller, but it won't need as much water. [19] X Research source Many fertilizers contain salts, which can harm the roots during a drought. Do not use lawn fertilizers high in nitrogen. Don't use weed-and-feed products either. They are a fertilizer/weed-killer combo."
