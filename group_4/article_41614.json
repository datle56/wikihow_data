      "content": "Roll the strap up end-over-end, starting with the hook. First, detangle the strap, taking care to remove any knots and twists in its length. Then, hold the end with the hook in one hand and lay the rest of the strap out loosely on a flat surface (such as a table, a truck bed, or the ground). Fold the hook over onto the strap, then continue folding it end-over-end until the entire strap is wrapped neatly around the hook. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure the roll with clamps, a ratchet buckle, zip ties, or rubber bands. A strap clamp or a ratchet tie-down buckle are best for keeping the roll tightly wound, but you can also wrap it up with a zip tie , a velcro tie , or even a heavy duty rubber band . Avoid just tossing the roll in storage without securing it, or it will eventually come undone and become tangled. If you use a ratchet : Leave about 2 feet of the strap unfolded. Fold up the smaller strap connected to the ratchet underneath it, then place the ratchet directly on top of the folds you made so far. Thread the remaining end through the slot on the ratchet (you may need to repeat this step more than once to get to the end of the strap). Finally, crank the ratchet so it tightens the roll together. [2] X Research source If you use a clamp : Make sure the teeth of the clamp grip the center of the roll firmly to prevent it from unraveling. If you use a tie : Thread one end of it through the roll's center (where the hook is located) before securing it tightly to the other end outside the outermost fold of the roll. If you use a rubber band : Double or triple-wrap it around the entire width of the roll to make a tighter hold."

      "content": "Store the rolls in a cool, dry place out of the elements. Extreme heat, moisture, grease, chemicals, and dirt will cause your ratchet straps to break down faster. A worn-out tie-down strap is unsafe to use and liable to split apart when you apply tension to it. That's why it's crucial to store them in a dry container (such as a toolbox) or room (such as a garage or a basement) where they won't be exposed to the elements. Always check your ratchet straps for signs of wear and tear before using them. Look for cuts, snags, crushed webbing, broken threads, or abrasions where the polyester threads have been rubbed and loosened from the webbing. If you see any of these issues, throw the strap away.

      "content": "Stow the straps in your toolbox for on-the-go access. Ratchet straps are best stored in your toolbox so they're easy to access when you're ready to use them . Most toolboxes worth their salt — whether they're the metal drawers in your garage or the portable plastic box you tote around in your vehicle — are designed to be sturdy and durable. They'll protect your ratchet straps (and other tools) from rain, dust, dirt, chemicals, and other substances that might cause them to erode."

      "content": "Put them in a storage bag to conserve space. Bags are flexible, don't take up much space in your vehicle, and will keep your ratchet tie-down strap safe from the weather while you're not using it. Some strap storage bags come with multiple compartments, so you can store several straps together without worrying about them tangling up. You can also store them separately in durable nylon bags or even plain old grocery sacks to save even more space."

Conserve space in your workshop or garage by hanging the ratchet straps on nails or pegs on a pegboard . Thread a heavy duty carabiner through the top folds of the roll or the device you used to secure the roll together and use that to hang the strap from the pegboard."

      "content": "Rinse the strap off with hose water and hang it to dry. Hanging it outside will help it dry faster. If it's raining or humid outside, you can hang it in your garage and point a fan at it on medium or high power. Once the strap is fully dry, roll it up and put it in storage. [6] X Research source Clean your ratchet straps whenever they start to look visibly dirty. You may have to clean them more frequently if you use the same straps all the time."
