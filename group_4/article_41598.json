      "content": "Remove the mussels from the bag and set them in a bowl. Prepare your mussels for storage as soon as you bring them home. Take the mussels out of the bag or container they came in and pour them into a bowl, tray, or other open container. Don't worry about organizing them neatly—piling them up in the container won’t hurt them. [1] X Research source Feel free to keep the mussels in a mesh bag or store them loosely. Don't store mussels in a closed container or bag, as they can die and be unsafe to eat. They need to be in an open container to breathe and stay fresh. [2] X Research source Alternatively, place a smaller bowl upside down in a larger bowl and place the mussels on top. Or, pour them in a colander and set it on top of a tray. This allows the liquid the mussels produce to drain to the bottom of the bowl without soaking the mussels. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the container with a clean, damp cloth or paper towel. Placing a damp towel over the mussels helps them retain moisture while still enabling them to breathe. Don't add any water directly to the container, though, as this can kill the mussels.

      "content": "Place your mussels on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator. Set the mussels on the bottom shelf of your fridge where they won't leak or drip onto other foods. [6] X Research source The bottom of the fridge and towards the back is typically the coldest area, which ensures your mussels stay chilled and fresh. [7] X Research source The optimal temperature for storing fresh mussels is between 32 to 40° F (0-4° C). Make sure your mussels don’t get colder or warmer than this range."

If you can’t eat them right away, mussels can stay fresh in the fridge for no more than 4 days. [8] X Research source If you haven’t used your mussels after 4 days, throw them away. If you don’t plan on cooking your mussels 1 to 2 days after buying them, freezing them might be a better option, which we’ll explain below. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour out the liquid at the bottom of the container daily. As the mussels sit in the container, they produce a small amount of liquid. Just carefully pour out the liquid at the bottom of the container each day so the mussels don’t sit in the water. [10] X Research source If you store your mussels in a colander, empty the tray or dish underneath it every day."

      "content": "Check on the mussels daily and throw out any spoiled ones. When you drain the excess water in the mussels’ container, make sure they’re all still alive and fresh. Fresh mussels have a mild salty smell, like the ocean, and close their shell when you tap them. If any mussels are damaged, smell rotten, or don’t close their shell, throw them away. [11] X Research source If you’re not sure whether a mussel is alive or dead, it’s best to be on the safe side and throw it away. [12] X Research source Wait to clean and debeard your mussels until you are ready to cook them, since this process can kill the mussels."

      "content": "Clean and debeard the mussels . Place the mussels in a colander or bowl and run them under cool water. Gently rub them with your fingers or scrub them with a wire brush to remove any dirt, debris, or barnacles. Then, look for any stringy fibers coming out of the sides of the mussels (which is their “beard”) and pull them off with your fingers. [13] X Research source Check for any dead or damaged mussels as you clean them. Throw away any mussels that don’t close their shell, smell spoiled, or have cracked shells. Cleaning and de-bearding your mussels typically kills them, so don't do this until you are ready to put the mussels in the freezer."

      "content": "Freeze the mussels in a freezer-safe plastic bag for up to 3 months. Place the mussels in a heavy-duty freezer bag or a freezer-friendly container and squeeze out as much air as possible. Then, set them in your freezer and store them for up to 3 months. [14] X Research source Mark the date on your bag or container with a permanent marker so you know how long the mussels have been frozen before you use them. Frozen mussels typically have a softer texture than fresh mussels. Mussels frozen for more than 3 months can be safe to eat, but their quality typically declines sharply. They often have a mushy texture and less flavorful taste."

Or, place them in a bowl of cold water for about 1 hour. [15] X Research source Thawed mussels keep in your refrigerator for up to 2 days. [16] X Research source Don't refreeze your mussels after thawing them. This significantly reduces their quality and can increase the risk of bacterial contamination. Do not thaw frozen mussels at room temperature, as this can lead to bacterial growth. [17] X Research source"

While there are conflicting opinions on whether it’s safe to eat unopened mussels, [19] X Research source it’s typically best to throw them away. Unopened mussels may be undercooked or dead, which at the very least makes them unpleasant to eat. [20] X Research source"
