      "title": "Identify a young budgie by a striped cap.",
      "content": "Identify a young budgie by a striped cap. Young budgies have stripes or bars on the cap of their head that stretch all the way down to the base of the upper beak. According to Lederer, if a budgie is less than 3 or 4 months old, “they’ll normally have a completely stripey head.” [1] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. The base of the upper beak is known as the cere. A budgie with stripes stretching down to its cere has not experienced its first molt, when it loses the striped feathers on its head."

      "title": "Look for a white or yellow cap to identify birds older than 3 or 4 months.",
      "content": "Look for a white or yellow cap to identify birds older than 3 or 4 months. When a budgie is 3-4 months old, it will molt and lose its striped head feathers. Lederer explains, “As [budgies get] older, the stripes on their face and forehead are replaced with plain patches of color or pure white.” [2] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. Your parakeet will have a cap of yellow or white feathers depending on its variety. If the budgie has no stripes on its head, it has experienced its first molt and is more than 3-4 months of age."

      "title": "Don’t rely on the cap feathers if the budgie is a rare variety.",
      "content": "Don’t rely on the cap feathers if the budgie is a rare variety. While an examination of the budgie’s head feathers is a good indicator of age for most birds, there are some exceptions to the rule. There are several varieties of budgies whose age cannot be identified through their head feathers. If you have a lutino, albino, or recessive pied budgie, you will need to use other methods to identify the bird’s age. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Examine the color of the beak and cere to identify very young budgies.",
      "content": "Examine the color of the beak and cere to identify very young budgies. Baby budgies that are less than 12 weeks old will often have excess pigment or melanin in the beak and cere. This will often result in a beak that appears black or darker than an older bird. [4] X Research source The excess pigment in the beaks of baby budgies is absorbed as they age, resulting in the development of a normal beak color of pink, light brown, blue, or violet."

      "title": "Identify a baby budgie by its black eyes.",
      "content": "Identify a baby budgie by its black eyes. According to Lederer, “In budgies under 4 months old, the entire eye will be black.” [5] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. Baby parakeets have not developed an iris, or the ring of color that surrounds the black pupil. If there is no color in your bird’s eye, it is 4 months or younger."

    {
      "title": "Look for a dark gray iris to identify adolescent budgies.",
      "content": "Look for a dark gray iris to identify adolescent budgies. “Between 4 and 8 or 9 months, the iris will be a little paler,” explains Lederer. [6] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. As a budgie ages, its irises will develop accordingly. While a baby budgie has no iris, an adolescent parakeet will have dark irises, usually a deep shade of gray. Try to examine your budgie’s eyes in natural sunlight if possible. For example, try opening the curtains or blinds near the budgie’s cage."

      "title": "Identify a mature budgie by a light gray or brown iris.",
      "content": "Identify a mature budgie by a light gray or brown iris. “Very pale irises usually indicate a bird who has reached the grand old age of at least 8 months,” Lederer says. [7] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021. As budgies mature, their irises continue to develop and lighten. If a parakeet has a light gray or brown iris, it is probably older than 8-12 months. This method won’t work for recessive pied or dark-eyed clear budgies, as these varieties never get iris rings.

      "title": "Examine the letters and numbers on the bird’s leg band.",
      "content": "Examine the letters and numbers on the bird’s leg band. Many budgies have a leg band that can help identify the bird’s origin and age. [9] X Research source For many bands, the birth year of the bird is indicated in the third set of numbers on the band. If the band is blank, it will not give you specific details about the bird’s age or background. The first set of letters will usually identify the company that issued the bird band. The second set of letters and numbers identifies the breeder. The third set of numbers will identify the year the bird was born, usually in two digits. The fourth set of numbers will tell you the pedigree number of the bird."

      "title": "Determine your budgie’s age by the color of the identification band.",
      "content": "Determine your budgie’s age by the color of the identification band. If your budgie’s band was issued by the American Budgerigar Society, the most widely recognized organization issuing budgie ID bands, you can tell the bird’s age by the color of the band. Other organizations, however, may use different colors for different years. [10] X Research source Visit the American Budgerigar Society’s website to match your bird’s identification band color to its birth year. Keep in mind that certain colors can denote multiple budgie birth years. For example, a budgie with a black identification band was born in 2013 or 2019. A bird with a red identification band was born in 2018 or 2012, and budgies with orange bands were born in 2016 or 2010."

      "title": "Contact the breeder, previous owner, or pet store for more information.",
      "content": "Contact the breeder, previous owner, or pet store for more information. If you are having trouble figuring out how old your budgie is, try asking the person who gave or sold you the bird. Ask them exactly how old the bird is and if they have any documentation that can verify the bird’s age. Breeders and pet stores often keep documentation on the birds they sell that may help you determine the age of your budgie. Be aware that some people may say a bird is younger than it is, as younger budgies are typically more valuable than their older counterparts. If a parakeet came from an aviary setting, it may appear older than it actually is. Birds that come from breeders often look older than if they were raised alone or with only a few other budgies."

      "title": "Budgies typically live between 7-15 years in captivity.",
      "content": "Budgies typically live between 7-15 years in captivity. Budgies, or the common parakeet, can live anywhere from 7 to 15 years in captivity. This is almost twice the lifespan of wild parakeets, who typically live between 4-6 years due to predators. Your budgie’s life expectancy depends on its nutrition and overall health. To care for your budgie , give them plenty of space in their cage, feed them the appropriate pellets and seeds, and schedule yearly checkups at the vet. [11] X Research source"
