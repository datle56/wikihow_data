You will use each column for different kinds of content in order to better organize your notes.

The left hand column of your notes should be reserved only for main points that you can associate with content in the following two columns. Keep the notes you take in the left hand column brief. Think of it as subject headers. [3] X Research source Notes in the left hand column should be short and provide a title of sorts for information you’ll be writing in other columns. You may want to record formulas in the left column that coincide with ones you use when writing problems in the middle column."

When copying math problems off of the board, make sure to write down each step your teacher uses, so you can go back and model your work after it in the future. When doing the problems yourself, ensure you don’t omit steps you complete in your head, so you can refer to it again if you forget how in the future.

Dividing your note sheets makes it easier to write down and to retain information for when you take a test. You may want to use a marker to draw the lines that divide your page to make them easier to see while note taking. [6] X Research source Draw one horizontal line across your page five lines from the bottom. Draw one horizontal line across the top line of the page. Draw a vertical line connecting the two about two inches from the left margin."

The title section should be written across the top line you drew, and include the name of the class you’re taking notes in, the date, and the topic you are covering in class that day. Some examples of a title section would read: Algebra 1 – 6/4/2016 - Two-variable Linear Equations Geometry – 8/1/2015 – Transversals Calculus – 10/10/2014 – Chain Rule"

During the class, take short hand notes by copying main points your teacher writes on the board or writing important things your teacher says. Try to use abbreviations where possible to reduce how much you have to write, and leave a blank space between each new idea. This is also where you will copy down or work on math problems. Try to keep each topic and the math equations they involve together in your notes. Leave the other boxes blank during class. [7] X Research source Keep your notes brief and simple. Only write as much as you need to in order to remember the main points. All of your note taking in class will be within that large box on the page."

As you read through them, identify the main ideas, points, dates or topics in your notes and list them in the left column you created with the vertical line. [8] X Research source Try to list the main points in the left column alongside where the notes relating to them are in the box on the right.

[10] X Research source The left hand box might say things like, “Linear Equations,” as well as an example such as “ax+b=0.” The right hand box would contain all of the notes you took in class, including any equations you solved. The summary box at the bottom may say something along the lines of, “ax+b=0 is considered the standard form, and not all equations will start as such.

Remember that the objective is to learn, so don’t be afraid to ask questions. [12] X Research source Some professors may ask for you to hold your questions until after the lecture. Make sure to write them down to help you recall what you wanted to ask when the time comes. If you aren’t comfortable speaking in front of the class, try approaching your teacher after class to clarify things you are unsure of."

In order to take effective notes, you will need to learn to pick out the important portions of what your teacher or professor says during their lecture. Disregard conversational material and focus on things your teacher places an emphasis on during class. Make sure to make note of any new topic, questions you have, and anything the teacher places a large emphasis on while covering the course material. [14] X Research source If there was assigned reading prior to the class, make note of anything covered in the lecture that differs from how it was presented in the book. Your teacher likely wants you to follow the methodology taught in class. Things teachers write out on the board are usually important and should be considered when note taking. Make sure to record new topics, formulas needed to solve equations, and anything the teacher suggests is important. [15] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020."

      "content": "Review your notes after class. Taking great notes can help you to retain information in the first place, but studying for an exam or test should always include a thorough review of your notes. You should always go over your notes again after class, then refresh your memory by reviewing them once more before a test. You may also want to compare notes with a classmate to help ensure you both took down all of the important information. [16] X Research source Studies have shown that after a week, you can usually only recall 35% of what you learned in class. Retention and recall can drop as low as 21% after two weeks. Reviewing your notes or going over them with a friend can refresh your memory and help to ensure you retain more of the course material."

If you feel as though you could write faster or take more efficient notes using a laptop computer, you should consider doing so. Some teachers and professors don’t permit open laptops in their class, so make sure laptop use is permitted before you start. Laptops can help you to organize your notes and even type them faster in some cases. Make sure you don’t allow yourself to get distracted by using other applications on your laptop during the lecture. You may want to ensure the laptop you use to take notes in math class has a keypad to record numbers faster."

      "title": "Use an audio recorder in class.",
      "content": "Use an audio recorder in class. It can sometimes be hard to keep up when taking notes in class. Using an audio recorder during class can allow you to revisit portions of the lecture that you may have missed, or listen to the entire class again while you’re studying to help clarify topics or refresh them in your mind. [17] X Research source If your teacher or professor does not address the use of recording devices ahead of time, you may want to ask them before recording them. Digital recorders often allow you to transfer recordings to a computer to better control which portions you want to listen to."

      "title": "Skip words, not numbers.",
      "content": "Skip words, not numbers. When taking notes, it’s perfectly normal to skip unnecessary words, use abbreviations or even come up with your own shorthand. However, don’t allow yourself to skip steps when writing out how to complete math problems, or copying them from the board. [18] X Research source Although you may know how to complete a problem in class, you might have trouble remembering how to in the future. Writing out all of your work will help you to recall each step in the future."

      "title": "Use color for emphasis.",
      "content": "Use color for emphasis. There are a number of ways you can incorporate different colors into your note taking methods to emphasize the importance of sections or to help you organize your notes. Use different colors to write titles, draw lines between sections, or to help you pick out important elements. [19] X Research source Use a highlighter to highlight important things as you take notes or after class when reviewing them. Try different colored pens for titles or to add emphasis to sections. Use markers or colored pencils to make colorful divisions between topics or sections."

    {
      "title": "Use a form of shorthand.",
      "content": "Use a form of shorthand. Sometimes the concepts you need to take notes on in math class involve more than just numbers and equations. When your teacher or professor is going over concepts that require you to take notes that aren’t math problems themselves, use a form of shorthand to limit how much you have to write. [20] X Research source Try leaving out unimportant words. An example could be, instead of writing “Pythagoras made influential contributions to mathematics,” try simply writing, “Pythagoras was influential.” Use abbreviations and punctuation to reduce your writing. Your notes only need to make sense to you, so feel free to use + (plus) signs instead of the word “and,” km instead of kilometers, or any other abbreviations you can easily understand."
