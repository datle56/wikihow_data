      "content": "Get a soft towel or t-shirt ready. When you’re towel drying your hair, it’s best to use a very soft towel or even an old t-shirt instead of a coarse, nubby towel. Using softer material will prevent your hair from getting tangled and damaged when you dry it. When you use a soft towel, your hair cuticles lay flat, so they dry in nice, glossy waves or curls. When you use a coarse towel, they’re more likely to frizz. You can buy special towels made just for towel drying hair. Make certain that it is made with a soft material. Check for towels in beauty supply stores or online. Consider using towels made of microfiber."

      "content": "Squeeze wet hair gently with your hands. Right when you turn off the shower, when your hair is still dripping water, run your hands over your hair and gently squeeze out the extra water. It's easier to towel dry your hair when streams of water aren’t still running out. [2] X Research source Don’t twist your hair, as this can easily damage it. Very gently gather your hair into sections and squeeze out the extra water. It’s best to do this while you’re still in the shower."

      "content": "Blot and squeeze your hair dry with the towel. Grab a section of hair and gently blot and squeeze it with the towel, working from the roots all the wall to the tips. Keep doing this with each section until your hair is totally towel-dried. Your hair will still be damp, but no longer dripping wet. [3] X Research source Do not wring out your hair or squeeze it too hard. Just use the towel to gently absorb moisture. Do not rub your hair with the towel, as this will cause frizzing. Just squeeze and blot."

      "content": "Use a fresh part of the towel to keep blotting. Once you finish going over each section of hair with the towel, you can use a fresh towel or a dry part of the towel to go over each section once more. This step is not strictly necessarily, but it’s a way to get your hair as close to dry as possible using only a towel. As your hair dries further, it’s more likely to tangle, so be extra careful not to rub your hair with the towel. Once your hair is mostly dry, it’s ready to be styled."

      "content": "Have a large, soft towel ready. A towel wrap is a good system to use if you have long, curly, or thick hair that tends to hold onto moisture for a long time. You can wrap up your hair while you’re getting ready for the day, then take it down and style it when it’s still a little damp. You’ll need a large, soft towel long enough to wrap your hair.

      "title": "Bend over and place your towel over the back of your head.",
      "content": "Bend over and place your towel over the back of your head. Make sure all of your hair is hanging straight down, and use your hands to finger-comb it into place. Position the towel horizontally across the back of your head, so that the bottom of the towel is aligned with the bottom of your hairline. Make sure all of your hair is hanging in the same direction, so it’ll get wrapped up nicely in the towel. If some of your hair is folded back in a random direction it could end up messing up your style when it dries."

      "content": "Twist the towel. Starting right next to your forehead, use your hands to twist the towel in one direction. Your hair and the 2 sides of the towel should all be part of the twist. When you’ve twisted the towel to the very end, put the end of the twist on top of your head. Don’t twist too hard, since this could pull at your hair. Twist just tightly enough so that the twist stays in place. You can hold the end of the twist in place with a hair clip."

Instead, gently pull a wide-toothed comb through your hair, starting near the tips and working your way up to the roots. [5] X Research source If you have very curly or kinky hair, you may not need to comb it at all. Combing could cause the individual hairs to separate and frizz. Experiment with your hair to find out what method works best for you. No matter the type of hair you have, you need to detangle it. If you don’t use a comb, at least use your fingers."
