Make sure that the tank top is centered and that the shoulders align with those on the T-shirt. Trace the sides and straps onto the shirt. Be sure to extend the sides to the hem of the T-shirt. [2] X Research source If you don't have a tank top, you can use a fitted T-shirt instead. You are only tracing the sides and outside of the straps. Don't trace the collar or inside the straps. Tank tops taper towards the bottom. Be sure to continue tapering the lines towards the bottom edge of your T-shirt. Don't draw the sides straight down."

Pin the sides of the shirt together, then sew them on your sewing machine using a zigzag stitch and a matching thread color. Start just below the armpits and finish at the hem. Backstitch when you start and finish sewing to keep your stitches from coming undone. [4] X Research source If you don't know how to sew, use hot glue or fabric glue instead. Let the glue set before moving on. Remove the pins as you sew or glue the fabric."

Sew the hems as close as possible to the raw, cut edge using a zigzag stitch and a matching thread color. Remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing, and to remove the pins as you sew.

If you see any loose or hanging threads, cut them off with small scissors, as close to the fabric as possible. Skip this step if you used fabric glue. If you used hot glue, look for any whisker-like strands of hot glue, and pull those off."

For an added touch, you can cut the collar off. If you hemmed the armholes, you should hem the cut collar too. If you left the armholes raw, then you don't need to hem the cut collar. [6] X Research source If you want a fancier collar, you could cut the front into a V-neck or a scoop neck."

Tuck the sleeves back into the shirt when you are done. [14] X Research source The pockets will end up being a little above your waist. This all depends on how wide the shoulders of your T-shirt were."
