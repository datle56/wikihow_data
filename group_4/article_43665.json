      "content": "Use a gentler word like \"terrible\" or \"awful.\" Even though a lot of people use the word \"sucks\" and think nothing of it, it can still come off as harsh (as most slang words do). Some people also think it's a bad word because of its association with oral sex. [1] X Research source If you're hesitant about using it, there are plenty of other words you can say in place of \"sucks\" to offer sympathy or express how bad something is. Those options include: \"That's terrible!\" \"That's awful!\" \"That's ridiculous!\" \"That's horrible!\" \"That's frustrating.\" \"That's insane!\" \"That's unbelievable!\" \"That's rough.\" \"That stinks!\" \"That's the worst!\""

      "title": "Use a more complete sentence like \"I'm really sorry to hear that.\"",
      "content": "Use a more complete sentence like \"I'm really sorry to hear that.\" Saying, \"That sucks\" or a variation of the phrase with a different word can come off as a little insensitive and trivial. For example, if someone tells you about an unpleasant or traumatic experience, responding with, \"That sucks\" may make you sound like you don't really care about their problems. You'll convey more sympathy and respect if you reply with one of the full sentences with non-slang words below. \"I'm so sorry this has happened to you.\" \"I'm really sorry to hear that.\" \"That's a terrible thing to go through.\" \"I can't even imagine how awful you must be feeling.\" \"I just can't believe this is happening.\" \"No one should have to experience that.\" \"What a horrible experience.\" \"You're so strong and brave for handling this situation.\" \"I wish there was a way I could help.\" \"If there's anything I can do to help make this better, please tell me.\""

      "title": "Focus on your precise feelings about the situation, as in \"I'm so frustrated.\"",
      "content": "Focus on your precise feelings about the situation, as in \"I'm so frustrated.\" If you feel frustration, anger, or irritation about something, you may get your emotions across more effectively if you use more specific language than \"This sucks.\" It may also help you feel better to verbalize what's troubling you instead of simplifying your feelings down to a two-word phrase. Try these options the next time you need to vent (without saying the word \"sucks\"). \"I'm so frustrated about this right now!\" \"I just feel really angry about this.\" \"This has been a really bad day.\" \"It fills me with rage!\" \"That just gets my goat.\" \"This is really overwhelming and stressful.\" \"This is a bad situation.\" \"This is really hard to deal with.\" \"This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.\" \"That [movie/book/plan] was so poorly executed.\""

      "content": "People say \"That sucks\" to offer sympathy to someone in tough times. You'll often hear someone say this to a friend, family member, co-worker, or even a stranger after they talk about going through a rough experience. Below is an example of how \"That sucks\" sounds in a conversation in which one person is expressing sympathy for someone else. Speaker 1 : \"I was in a car accident last week and my car was totaled.\" Speaker 2 : \"That sucks! Are you okay?\""

      "title": "The proper way to use this phrase is \"that sucks.\"",
      "content": "The proper way to use this phrase is \"that sucks.\" \"That's\" is a contraction of \"that is\" or \"that has.\" [2] X Research source It's not correct to say, \"That is sucks\" or \"That has sucks\" because \"sucks\" is not a noun. It's correct to use \"that's\" when you're pointing out a person, place, or thing to someone else. For example, you could say: \"That's the restaurant we're going to eat at,\" or \"That's my friend, Janice.\" What about \"this sucks\"? Some people use \"This sucks\" to describe something they think is bad. In this case, the person saying it is usually referring to a negative experience they're having rather than what someone else is going through. Here are a couple of examples where saying \"This sucks!\" can convey your feelings of disappointment or anger. \"This movie sucks! I've never seen a worse film.\" \"This day sucks! Nothing good has happened to me since I woke up this morning!\""

      "title": "\"Suck\" is perceived as a bad word by some people, but not by others.",
      "content": "\"Suck\" is perceived as a bad word by some people, but not by others. Language experts think that the word \"sucks\" was once used to refer to participating in the act of oral sex. Over time, though, it's evolved into a mere negative descriptor (almost like a curse word), used to refer to something being bad or unfortunate. Today, a lot of children, teens, and young adults say it without even knowing about its potentially sexual connotation. [3] X Research source Whether or not \"sucks\" is a bad word is subjective. Every individual has to decide for themselves if they want to say it or avoid it."

      "title": "Only use \"sucks\" in informal situations with people who don't mind it.",
      "content": "Only use \"sucks\" in informal situations with people who don't mind it. Avoid using this word in professional settings, like work or school, or when speaking with respected individuals, like your elders or the higher-ups at your company. Even at home, use caution saying, \"sucks,\" especially if you're a child. Many parents and grandparents – especially religious ones – view \"sucks\" as a dirty word and may not want you saying it around them. [4] X Research source It's best to only say \"sucks\" around people you've heard use the word themselves so you can be fairly certain they won't mind hearing it from you."
