      "content": "Be honest about your feelings. Do you actually love her or is this lust or infatuation? Could you stand losing her friendship? Do not be friends with her in hopes that you can change her mind about you. This is unfair to her as friendships should be based on trust and respect. If you truly love her, you will be a good friend first and foremost. Analyzing your own feelings can be difficult but there are a few scientifically proven signals that may indicate whether you’re in love. Do you exhibit any of these feelings? [2] X Research source If you believe that she is unique, it may be because your brain has elevated levels of focus and attention. If you think that she is perfect and only focus on her positive qualities, it may be because your memory has increased to accommodate your new feelings of love. If you feel like you’re a wreck over your new love, it is because research has shown that being in love involves similar brain activity to being addicted with similar mood swings. Going through adversity can also make you fall in love because your brain produces more dopamine, a chemical responsible for reward and pleasure. If you feel you are obsessing over her it may be because your brain has decreased the levels of central serotonin, which is associated with obsessive behavior. People in love have also shown signs of emotional dependency in which they want to be together all the time and hope to stay together forever. When you’re in love you may feel like you’ll do anything for her because you have a greater sense of empathy for the woman you love. Studies have shown that being in love is about an emotional union, not about sex. Studies have also shown that people in love feel that their love is uncontrollable."
