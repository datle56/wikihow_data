      "content": "Why this works: tease her and you'll get her to laugh. Get her to laugh, and she'll be more excited to respond. Lightly poke fun at how long she’s taking to reply, and she’ll see you in a whole new light. Take extra time to come up with a super creative opener to really impress her. To keep things lighthearted, add a self-deprecating or complimentary twist to your text. [1] X Research source “Here’s your medal: 🥇 for slowest response time 😉. Meanwhile, I win gold for falling for an amazing girl who leaves me on read 🥇🥳” “Lucky for you, you’re as cute as you are slow at texting…🤭” “My little sister responds to texts faster than you and she can’t even really read yet 🧐. (It’s actually so cute, she just sends me unicorn emojis 🥺🥺)”"

      "title": "Why this works:",
      "content": "Why this works: you’ll create a joke that she can join in on. Initiate a funny bit about her slow response and not only will she find you hilarious, but she’ll also have an easy, exciting way to rejoin the conversation. Send a text where you act like she has a great reason for not responding to you. Get creative and try to keep your tone sweet and silly. “Omg 😍. Love how much time and effort you’re putting into writing the perfect response. You must really like me 😇” “Oh no…did you come down with that crazy bug that’s going around?? Leave-on-read-itis. Heard it’s incurable. You have my condolences ❤️” “You just KNEW I had a busy week at work so you didn’t want to text and distract me…wow. So considerate. You really are one of a kind 😉”"

    {
      "title": "Why this works:",
      "content": "Why this works: not only is it funny, but it’s a little romantic, too. It could really pull on her heartstrings to have you mention a future together—even jokingly. To subtly grab her interest, make a playful reference to your “relationship’s” future. Send her into a fit of laughter by making a silly (but still sweet!) reference to how much you like her. “Dw, it’s okay. When we’re on our tenth anniversary, we’ll hardly even remember that time you forgot to text me back. 🥺😅” “With communication like this, our future marriage counselor is gonna have their work cut out for them, dang 🥱😶” “When we're madly in love, I'm totally gonna remind you of the time you left me on read for like a week 🤕\""

    {
      "title": "Why this works:",
      "content": "Why this works: movie and song quotes are playful and disarming. Make her laugh , and she’ll forget why she was hesitant to reply in the first place. Plus, she may just have been busy and worried about how to respond after her long silence. So send a funny, lighthearted message to ease the tension. Reference a movie you know she likes for bonus points. For extra laughs, alter lyrics to fit your situation. “Waiting for you is like waiting for rain in this drought…useless and disappointing 😋💅🏼” ( A Cinderella Story ) \"Hello...It's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet. 😋\" (Adele) “Hey I just met you, and this is crazy, but you have my number…so text me maybe? 🤓” (Carly Rae Jepsen)"

    {
      "title": "Why this works:",
      "content": "Why this works: memes are casual and can feel personal. Send her a meme or link and let her know that it made you think of her. Brainstorm TV shows, jokes, or memes that you know she loves and use those for inspiration. Mention you just “happened” to see this content that you know she’ll love. This gives her a relaxed opening back into the convo. If the two of you have joked about loving Parks and Rec , send her a link to a quiz that tells you which character you are. Find a funny meme about growing up in the midwest if she’s mentioned that she’s from the region. Along with your meme or link, write a laidback, sweet message: “Hey! I just had to send this. Made me think of you. Hope you’re having a nice day 🤘🏽”"

    {
      "title": "Why this works:",
      "content": "Why this works: you're offering to add value to her life. Your crush may just be the type of person who’s extremely busy. Send a text that can help her in some way, and you may get a response—even though she has a full plate. Scroll through your text conversation and look out for promises you might’ve made to help her. Then, send a text offering again. “Hey, did you still want those guitar lessons? I’ve actually been looking to get into teaching again, so I’d love to use you as a test subject. 🙂” “I was just going through my collection. Did you still want to borrow that Labi Siffre record? I’ve got it pulled for you if you want 🥳” “Hi there! I could still show you that vintage bookstore if you wanted. I know how much you love a good hole in the wall. 😺”"

      "title": "Why this works:",
      "content": "Why this works: it shows you’re considerate and empathetic. Reach back out to make sure she’s okay. When someone doesn't respond, it could be because something major is happening in their life. Show her that you care about her wellbeing, and when things slow down, she might feel extra incentive to reach back out. Either way, your sweet message could capture her heart! [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source “Hey, I don’t mean to pry. Just checking in. Is everything okay?” “Hey there. No worries on responding—I just wanted to make sure you were okay.” “Hi! No pressure…I just wanted to make sure everything was okay with you. If you ever need to talk, I like to think I’m a pretty good listener 🤗”"

      "content": "Why this works: you remind her of your convo while playing it cool. You’re following up on an unanswered text—so playing it cool may seem impossible. But send over a quick emoji, question mark, or ellipse, and it’s mission accomplished. Remind her of your interest while keeping your cards close to the chest. This could definitely hook her interest ! [3] X Research source \"?\" \"🤔\" Or, simply send a blank text as a reminder."

      "content": "Why this works: you’ll get your answer and appear totally unbothered. Address the fact that she hasn’t responded to you and that the ball’s in her court. Use silly emojis or throw in a funny twist. This way, she’ll see that she needs to respond to you if she wants to keep the convo going. But you're letting her know in a way that feels offhand, funny, and ultimately, attractive. “Okay, partner. Believe it’s officially your move 🤠” “This is me officially leaving the ball in your court: ➡️💨🎾.” “Alright, feel free to boogie on back to these texts if you ever want to talk🕺🏻💃🏿”"

      "content": "Why this works: her life situation could change down the line. For all you know, she got back together with an ex a couple of weeks into your text convos (hence, her silence). Follow up with her in a few weeks or months, and she may be thrilled to text with you again. Stay friendly, keep your texts concise, and don’t text more than once. Send a simple follow-up to check in: “Hey, just checkin’ in. How have ya been?” If she doesn’t respond to your follow-up, no worries. In your flirtationships, you deserve someone who's excited to be speaking with you."

      "content": "Why this works: one way or another, you’ll find out if she’s into you . Set a boundary in a direct, honest message. Mention that at this point, you have to assume that she’s just not interested. It may be tempting to lash out if you’re feeling hurt, but you deserve to leave the convo feeling good about how you acted. Plus, act considerate, and she may reach back out down the line. [4] X Research source Let her know that you were glad to meet her: “Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed talking to you.” Explain that you’re taking her silence to mean she’s not interested: “Communication is important to me. I’m assuming that you’re not interested.” Finally, wish her well and let her know she can reach out later (if you want that): “I wish you the best! If things change, you know where to find me 😇”"

      "content": "If she’s not interested, you can move on to someone who is. Leave your flirtationship on the best possible terms so that you’ve been respectful and you get to walk away feeling good about how you treated her. Keep your cool and avoid lashing out. If she doesn’t respond to your amazing, super clever follow-up, delete her number. Or just don’t text her again—whatever feels right!"
