As soon as you notice any redness, itchiness, or swelling around your nail plate, remove any gel products with acetone nail polish remover. This will help limit exposure to allergens and prevent symptoms from worsening. Symptoms should alleviate within the first week. However, if discomfort persists, treatment from a licensed medical professional. If you have gel artificial nails, try wrapping your nails in plastic food wrap instead of foil to remove them.

Wash your hands with warm water and fragrance-free hand soap once the polish is off. Apply a sensitive skin moisturizer to soothe your skin.

For instance, after painting your nails, you may spread CD to your eyes if you scratch an itch around them, causing them to swell and itch."
