It’s a versatile greeting that can be used to ask what someone is up to right now, or simply strike up a conversation. It means the same thing on Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp, and over text. [1] X Research source People most often send “WSP?” on its own as a way to start a convo. Some people add a follow-up question, like, “WSP? How are you?” or, “WSP Jason! What are you up to this weekend?” It doesn’t matter how it’s capitalized. “WSP,” “Wsp,” and “wsp” all mean the same thing."
