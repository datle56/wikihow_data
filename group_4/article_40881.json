      "content": "Don't take love for granted. If you're lucky enough to have a special someone, then you should make your time together meaningful. Don't stop doing the things you love with the person you love, making time to say \"I love you\", or just spending time with your special someone. Being around your loved one and having positive interactions with him or her has been proven to make people happier, so don't shrug off this obvious mood-lifter if you have the chance to use it. If you do have a partner, then having regular sex, at least a few times a week, has proven to help people stay in a good mood, too! You may think that, just because your worries are work or school related, that your loved one won't be able to make you feel better about it. That's where you're wrong!"

      "title": "Get regular exercise.",
      "content": "Get regular exercise. This will release endorphins that will improve your mood. Regular exercise is one of the most important habits that you want to cultivate. On average, you should get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, but you don't have to do the same boring old thing every day. You can go running three times a week and walk the other four; you can do yoga four times a week and give yourself an off day or two. Just make sure to be as active as you can every day, whether this means taking the stairs instead of the elevator or walking instead of driving."

      "title": "Spend time with your friends.",
      "content": "Spend time with your friends. Hanging out with friends will keep you feeling energized, excited about being alive, and like you're really spending time with the people who care about you. Of course, if you're always hanging out with friends when you have a free moment, you may actually feel a bit overwhelmed and like you have no time to decompress. Make sure you do make time to see friends at least once or twice a week, if you can. The next time your friends beg you to come out when you're feeling too lazy or sorry for yourself, come out! You'll feel better right away. Of course, if you're not feeling it, you don't have to hang out with your friends. But if you make spending time with friends a bigger priority, then this habit will lead to a better mood, long term. And hey, if you spend time with friends who tend to be happy and love laughter, then they'll make you feel happier, too. If you're hanging out with a bunch of Debbie Downers, then you won't be on your way to a better mood."

      "title": "Get enough sleep.",
      "content": "Get enough sleep. Make sure to sleep for at least 7-8 hours a day and to go to bed and wake up around the same time every night to get into a healthy routine. One of the easiest ways to stay in a good mood is to be well-rested. Waking up feeling full of energy will make you feel much more ready to face the day and much more excited about everything ahead of you -- and more capable of dealing with it. Make sure that sleep is a priority over watching late-night TV or doing other tasks you can save until the morning."

      "title": "Think positive thoughts before bed and after you wake up.",
      "content": "Think positive thoughts before bed and after you wake up. Read a good book or watch a feel-good movie and then journal before you go to bed. Have a positive conversation with your loved one before you drift off. Whatever you do, don't do anything too stressful, like writing a paper or upsetting, like watching crimes on the nightly news, before you drift off, or you'll be more likely to have bad dreams and restless sleep and to wake up cranky. When you get up, read a good book or the sports section of the paper. Also, give yourself a few minutes of peace before you turn on your phone or computer; this will help you feel like you're present in the moment before you really start your day. Try decreasing the amount of negative news you consume overall. Don't tune out major events, but don't constantly consume negative news, either. Negative information tends to be more memorable, and it can impact how you feel throughout your day. [1] X Research source Try decreasing the amount of social media you use, too. Too much time on social media can make you compare your life to others. Since social media often shows the best parts of other people's lives, consuming too much can make you feel unnecessarily bad about your own life. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 29 January 2021. Start off with a healthy breakfast, which can have lean proteins like turkey and healthy veggies like spinach, and don't skip this meal no matter what. Have light snacks throughout the day, like yogurt or fruit, to keep you energized, and avoid overeating or going more than three hours without eating at least a little something. Your energy levels affect your mood, and it's important to have regular and healthy meals to feel up to speed."

Whether you're working on your novel or love sculpting, make sure to give yourself enough time to pursue your passion throughout the week, even if it feels like you have a million other things going on. At the end of the day, doing what you really love will make you feel better than doing what you really need to do, and if you want to be a happy person who is able to stay in a good mood, then you've got to make time for what you really love."

      "content": "Meditate. Take just 10 minutes out of your day to find a comfortable seat in a quiet room, focus on your breath, and feel each of your body parts relaxing, one at a time. Focus only on your breath rising in and out of your body and let the rest of your thoughts melt away. Making a habit of meditating every morning, evening, or whatever you feel like it has been proven to help people stay in a good mood. There are a number of smartphone apps available to help guide and time your meditations. These can be especially helpful if you're new to meditating. If meditation isn't your thing, you can also try yoga , which can also help you focus, unwind, and live a happier life."

      "content": "Make a plan for the future. Though you may not be in a good mood just because you didn't get enough sleep or for another reason that can be addressed pretty easily, you may not be able to stay in a good mood because you don't feel a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment. Setting a goal, even a small goal, can help increase your self-esteem. [5] X Research source If you think there are major reasons you struggle to stay happy, such as a dead-end job or a difficult relationship, try setting a goal to make a major change. Then, break your larger goal into smaller actions and focus on one action at a time. Every time you complete one, you will feel a little better and be a little closer to your goal."

      "content": "Don't let the little things get to you. A lot of people lose their good moods because they get upset about things like losing their umbrellas, having a bad interaction with a mean coworker, or being stuck in traffic. Sure, these little things are annoying on your own, but you have to learn to remind yourself that in the long run, none of these things will really matter to you. Focus on the happiness of the bigger picture and learn to say, \"Well, that wasn't great, but it's not going to ruin my mood!\" It takes practice to be all zen and not let the outside world get to you. If you need time, take time to understand what happened, see how you can learn from it, and then move right on."

This may sound too obvious to work, but really, spending just a few minutes a day turning on your favorite music when you feel yourself getting cranky can make a big difference. Whether your definition of uplifting music is Rod Stewart or Pit Bull, blast your jams -- or use your headphones -- and see how much better you feel afterwards. If you sing along or even spontaneously burst into dance, you'll feel happier even faster!"

      "content": "Write down your thoughts. Whether you have a journal or a blog, making a habit of writing down your thoughts at least a few times a week can help you stay in a better mood. Journaling allows you some quiet time and lets you reflect on the things that happened to you so you don't feel overwhelmed by them later. It helps you focus on what is important to you and allows you to forget about your phone, your Facebook, or any other distractions in your life while you focus on the things that really matter to you."

Though you may be dreading it, once you do it, you'll feel happier! You'll be surprised by the difference this makes in your mood."

      "content": "Be present. Living in the moment on a daily basis can really help you stay in a good mood. Instead of worrying about that thing you said to your friend two weeks ago or stressing out over that project that's due in three months, focus on whatever you're doing and give your energy and attention to it. When you're with your friends, give them all of your attention. If you're reading a book, put your phone away. If you're walking, notice the houses around you instead of fretting. Living in the moment like this will make a big impact on your mood."

Don't think that you're too busy for a walk -- anyone has time for just a few minutes of outdoor walking, and it's guaranteed to make you feel happier and more productive. One of the reasons you may not be staying in a good mood is just because you've been cooped up working all day.

But socializing with just anyone, whether you take a few minutes to ask your coworker about his weekend or you chat with the barista at your favorite coffee shop, will elevate your mood, too. Just getting out there and talking to people will make you feel less lonely and isolated, and will keep you from being down in the dumps.

This can be anything from your health to the amazing ice cream shop across the street. Keep writing, no matter how small or silly you think the thing you're grateful for is. Once you finish your list, read it over -- see if you can keep yourself from smiling! It'll be impossible."

      "content": "Touch your toes. Just stand up and bend down to touch your toes for a few seconds -- you don't have to actually reach them.

Once you get down there, slowly roll up, one vertebrae at a time, and you'll feel your outlook getting better."
