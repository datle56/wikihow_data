      "content": "Choose a date, time, and virtual venue for the baby shower. The first order of business is deciding when and “where” your baby shower will take place. Make sure you pick a date that works for you and gives guests enough time to plan ahead and send gifts. Then, decide how you'll host the baby shower; choose the video chat service or party hosting site that works best for you. [1] X Research source Virtual venue options include services like Zoom , Skype , Facebook , and Google Meet . If you’re unsure which option to pick, see our in-depth guide to video chat services below!"

      "title": "Pick a theme and decorations for the baby shower.",
      "content": "Pick a theme and decorations for the baby shower. This is optional: you can absolutely host a virtual baby shower without a theme, but choosing one can be a fun way to get into the spirit of the occasion and get guests involved, too! So, think about what kind of shower decorations you might want to include and what dress code, if any, might be fun to encourage. [2] X Research source For example, some theme ideas include: Twinkle twinkle little star (with star and night sky-themed decor) Nautical (think boats, water, anchors, sea creatures) Safari, jungle, or woodlands (with animal and plant-themed decor) Garden party (with lots of floral, butterfly, and bee decor) In terms of decor, think wall hangings, balloons, streamers, and other things you can easily hang up to display in the call's background. If you don’t want to decorate, you can pick a virtual background for your video call instead (and encourage guests to use it)."

      "content": "Set up a baby registry. Before sending invitations, make sure your baby registry is set up so guests will know where to go to pick out gifts. You can set up a baby registry at a particular store or online business or opt for a universal registry (or one mainly dedicated to cash gifts). [3] X Research source Some baby registry options include Amazon , Target , Walmart , Pottery Barn , or MyRegistry ."

    {
      "title": "Send out invitations to the shower ahead of time.",
      "content": "Send out invitations to the shower ahead of time. You could opt for digital invitations, mail paper invitations the old-fashioned way, or send invitations through your virtual venue if applicable (with Facebook or WebBabyShower, for example). Send your invitations at least 4 to 6 weeks before the party to give guests plenty of time to RSVP and include a link to both the virtual event and baby registry. [4] X Research source You can create customizable digital invitations using sites like Evite , Paperless Post , and Greenvelope . After the shower, send your guests thank-you notes as well! It’s usually polite to send those around 1 to 2 weeks after the baby shower."

      "content": "Create an agenda for the shower, including games and activities. Time to plan the party! Figure out what games and activities you want to do during the virtual baby shower, then draw up a schedule to ensure you can fit in everything you want to do. You don’t need to stick to the schedule exactly, but it can help you keep the party running without losing track of time. [5] X Research source For example, you might set aside around 15 to 20 minutes to greet guests, chat, and catch up with everything. Then, you might designate the next hour for games, wrap things up with a gift opening for 15 minutes, and then have goodbyes. You can make your party as long or short as you like; a typical virtual baby shower could last anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 or 3 hours. Need some game ideas?

      "content": "Share a drink or dish for guests to prepare, optionally. While you don’t have to share any recipes, it can be a fun way to make your virtual party feel more like a traditional baby shower! Come up with a snack, dessert, or drink recipe to share with your guests so they can make it for the party (and whip it up yourself so that you can enjoy it, too). [6] X Research source For example, you could make adorable rattle cupcakes or baby-themed cookies for your shower. To make the virtual baby shower feel extra special, you could send party favor boxes to your guests beforehand (with snacks, ingredients, or other cute trinkets to use at the party). Some guests might not want to buy extra food or ingredients, so you might want to make this an optional part of the shower—and clarify that to your guests."

      "content": "Zoom Zoom is free to use and lets you create video calls with up to 100 connected devices (which should be more than enough, though you can connect even more for a fee). You can use the Zoom website or download the free app, and all your guests will need is an internet connection and web browser; they don’t need an account to attend the shower. [7] X Research source If you use Zoom for your shower, the host must simply set up a virtual room with an ID and password (which you can give to all the guests). The only downside is that Zoom’s free version only allows you to host meetings for up to 40 minutes, though you can always simply close that meeting and start a new one if you don’t want to purchase more time."

      "content": "Skype Skype is also totally free to use and can be accessed with any computer, tablet, or mobile device. As a bonus, there’s no limit on how long your video call can be (as long as it doesn’t exceed 24 hours, which is unlikely), and you don’t have to download the app if you’re using it on a computer. [8] X Research source Skype’s main downsides compared to Zoom is that it only allows up to 50 connected devices, and group calls don’t have password protection."

      "content": "Facebook Facebook can be a super convenient site for hosting your virtual baby shower since you can create an event and send invitations to everyone in the event group, then host a video call with all your guests through Facebook Messenger’s video chat system. Best of all, it’s for free! For protection, however, make sure to set your event to private. [9] X Research source"

It’ll cost money to use, but it’s essentially an all-inclusive baby shower package with unlimited invitations, themes, games, a virtual guestbook, a private photo and video album, and a built-in video chat feature. You can also build a site for your baby shower and customize it. [10] X Research source The main downside here is price: it costs $79 to host a baby shower through this site. You can also try out a demo for free to help decide if it’s worth the cost!"

So, if you go this route, the downside is that you’ll need to have guests sign up for Gmail if they haven’t already (though it’s not hard and won’t cost them anything). [11] X Research source"

      "content": "FaceTime FaceTime is a completely free video service that allows up to 32 connected devices, and you can join using an internet connection or cellular data (if you have a data plan). However, the main downside of this option is that it’s only available to Apple devices—like iPhones, iPads, and Apple computers—and requires an Apple ID to sign in. So, it’s not ideal if you have guests without Apple devices."

Anyone who has done that thing must put down a finger, and the last person with a finger still up wins the game. You might learn some funny stories from your guests! Example statements include: [12] X Research source Never have I ever craved something bizarre during pregnancy. Never have I ever been peed on by my baby. Never have I ever had to sing the same lullaby twice in a row. Never have I ever broken a bone as a child. Never have I ever gotten more than a dollar from the Tooth Fairy."

It’s normal for expecting parents to throw their own shower, but it’s also very common to ask a family member or close friend to help. So, if you’re busy or have a lot on your plate, consider including a co-host in your shower plans! [14] X Research source If your baby shower co-host lives far away, you can always make plans over text, email, or social media. Since the baby shower is virtual, long-distance planning shouldn’t be much of an issue!"

      "content": "Have guests send gifts beforehand to be opened at the shower. In the invitation, simply ask guests to mail their gifts; that way, you can open them on camera so everyone can still see and participate. Alternatively, guests can hang onto their gifts and open them on camera, then mail them to you (or drop them off) later. You can also give both options and let guests decide what works for them! [15] X Research source You may want to skip the gift opening and spend more time on games and socializing instead—and that's fine, too! There are plenty of ways to show off gifts sent to you after the shower. If you have a Facebook event, you can post photos of the gifts—or email all the guests with pictures. If you use a paid service like WebBabyShower, you can post photos and videos to your site for up to 6 months after the shower."

With a welcome party, you can introduce the baby to loved ones (and they can still bring gifts and well wishes for you and the baby). Of course, don’t overexert yourself by throwing a party if you also have a newborn to look after; you can always ask a co-host to help manage everything. [17] X Research source With a welcome party, you can still play games, open gifts, chat with everyone, and celebrate—virtually or in person. However, it’s also okay to refrain from throwing any party at all. You might not be the kind of person who wants a baby shower or welcome party, and there’s nothing wrong with that!"
