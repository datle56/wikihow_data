If you have 1 ⁄ 2 –4 in (1.3–10.2 cm) of unlocked hair at the ends of your faux locs, you can detangle these sections to keep them looking nice. You can use either a detangling spray or leave-in conditioning product. Spray a light, even layer over the very ends of your hair.

      "content": "Use your fingers or a medium-tooth comb to separate your hair. After you’ve applied a detangling product, comb through the ends of your hair to get rid of knots and tangles. Separate the hairs gently to avoid damage. [2] X Research source A comb can help get rid of stubborn knots, though your fingers also work well to untangle your hair. If your faux locs are connected all the way to your ends, you do not need to do this. Separating your hair may mess up the integrity of your faux locs."

Then, run your hands through the ends of your hair. Use more oil as needed. [3] X Research source Using an oil hair product protects the ends of your hair from breakage as you wash your scalp. Use a natural oil like olive, coconut, or jojoba oil for best results; however, you can also use oil products formulated for hairstyling."

This keeps your locs in great shape as you cleanse your scalp. To do this, get an applicator bottle with a plastic tip and squeeze in about 1 oz (29.6 mL) of sulfate-free shampoo. Then, fill the bottle the rest of the way with water from your faucet. Screw on the cap and shake up the bottle to mix the shampoo thoroughly. [5] X Research source Sulfate-free shampoo reduces frizz and protects your hair better than shampoos with sulfate ingredients. You can purchase applicator bottles from beauty supply stores. These are 8 oz (236.6 mL) plastic bottles that help apply hair dye and products."
