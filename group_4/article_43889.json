      "content": "Unwind 2 to 3 feet (61 to 91 cm) of fly line and form a loop at the end. Use your thumb and forefinger to form a small loop that is 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in diameter at the end of the fly line. Pinch the end of the loop tight between your fingers. [1] X Research source You can get high quality fly line at your local fishing supply shop or online."

      "content": "Roll out 1 foot (30 cm) of backing line from the spool. You won't need this much backing line, but it's easier to work with more line than you need. Keep the backing line attached to the spool -- the unspooled, loose end is known as the live end. Use thin backing line made for fly fishing, as it will be strong enough to work properly."

      "title": "Insert 10 inches (25 cm) of backing line through the loop.",
      "content": "Insert 10 inches (25 cm) of backing line through the loop. Slide the backing line up through the loop and place it at the end of the loop, between your thumb and forefinger. There should be at least 10 inches (25 cm) of backing line hanging off one side of the loop, called the tag end. [2] X Research source Maintain a firm grip on the backing line and the loop on the fly line with your thumb and forefinger. Make sure neither line slips or moves."

      "content": "Wrap the tag end over the fly line and the live end of the backing line. Pinch the backing line tight against the fly line with your thumb and forefinger on your left hand. Use your right hand to wrap the tag end of the backing line around the loop. Hold the tag end tight with your right thumb and forefinger as you wrap it away from your left hand, towards the end of the loop. [3] X Research source The backing line should cover the loop in the fly line as you wrap it."

      "content": "Loop the tag end over the fly line 10-12 times. Continue to hold the fly line and backing line tight between your thumb and forefinger as you wrap the tag end of the backing line over the loop. The spool end of the backing line should sit against the loop and be drawn into a knot as you wrap the tag end. [4] X Research source Use your middle finger to guide the tag end over the loop so the backing line sits snugly against the loop. Wrapping the tag end over the fly line several times will ensure the knot is tight and strong."

The knot should slide towards the end of the loop, making the loop smaller and smaller. Keep pulling the live end of the backing line as you push the knot so it stays tight. [7] X Research source Stop pushing the knot once it reaches the end of the loop on the fly line, as you do not want it to slide off the fly line."

Wrap the thumb and forefinger on your right hand around the live end of the backing line. Pull both lines tightly at the same time so the knot is secure. You can also pull tight on the tag end of the backing line while pulling the fly line to make sure the knot is extra tight. To ensure the knot is secure, hold the tag end of the backing line with a pair of forceps or pliers and pull it tight while holding the fly line."
