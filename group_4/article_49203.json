      "content": "Summarize the email in a 6-8 word subject. It is important to make sure you include a subject, since an email that does not have a subject may be ignored. Your subject should be short and to the point and it should highlight the main message of the email. The ideal subject gives the reader all they need to know or informs them they need to make a decision. People who receive hundreds of emails a day may only open emails with particularly compelling subjects. Make sure to place the most important words in the subject first because the entire subject may not be visible on a mobile device. Ideal subjects are 6-8 words and personalized to the recipient.

Make your emails as short as they can be while still providing all the details necessary. [2] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Your sentences should be short and to the point. Before sending your email, read over it and eliminate any irrelevant information. Generally, if you have provided excess or off-topic information, delete it. Some people try to create and send emails containing five sentences or less. If you can do this, it is a good guideline for keeping an e-mail brief and to the point. You can do this by answering the questions, “Who am I? What do I want? Why am I asking this person? Why should they do what I am asking? What is the next step that I/they/we will need to take?” However, this applies to the average e-mail, not an e-mail that demands a lot of detail, or a quick \"thank you\" to your co-worker who sent you that link.

      "content": "Ask clearly for the action you want the reader to take. Do not make the reader guess that you are asking for a decision, or advice, a referral, or a purchase. Ask for directly and unequivocally for what it is that you want, need or expect! Asking clearly is especially important if you are sending to multiple people. And, make sure to call out the name of the specific person you need to make the decision. For example: \"Elizabeth: Would you prefer I go down path A or path B here?\" Alternatively, if your email is only informing someone of something rather than asking for an action, clearly label the email as \"FYI\" in the subject or in first sentence."

      "content": "Use a formal tone. The tone of your email should remain professional and straightforward. Strive for a confident and courteous tone. [5] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Try to leave emotional or informal language out of the email entirely. Avoid contractions and abbreviations whenever possible. Remember, full-length phrases often seem more formal. For example, the following email is too informal for business: Thanks for the snakes you sent. I’m sorry to say that two were dead. Send more soon, plz. Talk to ya later! A more formal version of the previous email: Thank you for your shipment of the four ball pythons to our store, Pets Alive! on March 2, 2015. Unfortunately, two of the snakes appear to have been hurt during the delivery and were deceased when I opened the snake crate. I would like for you to send two replacement snakes as soon as possible. Please email me or call the store with further questions or to make arrangements for a new shipment. Sometimes a more informal e-mail is appropriate \"in house\" with co-workers you know well and if it is in line with \"work culture\". However, do not use text abbreviations, use complete sentences, and do not write anything that you would not want your boss to read."

      "content": "Proofread your email. Do your best to ensure that your email does not include grammar or spelling mistakes and uses standard punctuation - no ALL CAPS, for example. Many email programs include a spell check option; if your email has one, use it! Poor grammar almost certainly will undermine the message that you are sending, so, if possible use an grammar checker. If you are sending an email to a large number of people or if the email is particularly important, you may want to have someone (or several individuals) proofread it before you send it."

Some potential closings: [7] X Research source I look forward to your response, I hope to hear from you soon, Thank you for your time, My best to you, Thanks for your consideration, You may end your Pets Alive! email to the snake distributor by saying, “Thank you for your attention to this matter.”"
