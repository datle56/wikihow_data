      "content": "Work on conditioning your lips instead of picking. Do you absentmindedly pick away the dead skin that builds up on your lips? When you feel a bit of skin flaking off, it may be impossible to resist picking it. However, picking your lips doesn't actually make them less dry or healthier. Instead of picking the skin off, try putting that energy into making your lips healthier. The result will be supple, dry-skin-free lips that look great, rather than rough-looking lips that bleed where you pick them. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your picking habit is actually a persistent bad habit or nervous tic, it'll take more than conditioning your lips to fix the problem. See How to Break a Bad Habit for help on putting a stop to your lip picking for good. If you're worried you can't stop on your own, see a therapist and determine whether you might have Compulsive Skin Picking disorder, which is closely linked with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder . This is very difficult to solve on your own, so seek the help of someone who can advise you."

      "title": "Brush your lips with a toothbrush.",
      "content": "Brush your lips with a toothbrush. Moisten your lips with warm water, then use a clean toothbrush to gently brush them in a circular motion. This will remove the buildup of dry, dead skin that's causing your lips to be chapped and flaky. While picking your lips often removes too much skin and results in bleeding, brushing your lips removes just the top layer of dead skin, keeping the protective layer in place. [2] X Research source A clean loofah is another good item to use to brush your lips. Just make sure you don't use an older loofah, since these can harbor bacteria. Do not scrub your lips too hard with the brush. It's OK if your lips are still a little rough after brushing. You may need more than one session to completely get rid of the dead skin."

      "title": "Try a sugar scrub.",
      "content": "Try a sugar scrub. This is a great option if your lips are very chapped and sore, since it's a little gentler than using a brush. Make a simple mixture of one teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of honey. Spread a little on your lips and use your fingers to massage the scrub across your lips. It will remove the top layer of dead skin without damaging the layer underneath. When you're finished, rinse your lips with warm water.

      "content": "Repeat until your lips are free of dry skin. It may take more than one conditioning session to get your lips back into shape. Every few days, repeat the process of exfoliating your lips. In between sessions, wear an emollient product on your lips during the day and at night while you sleep. Don't repeat the process more than once a day, since that could cause skin irritation."
