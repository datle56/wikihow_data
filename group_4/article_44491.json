      "content": "Check the bird for other symptoms. When your bird has diarrhea, catch it and examine it. Look for other symptoms that may give you more information about your bird’s condition. It may be a simple digestive problem, but it may be something different. [2] X Research source Check for stained, wet, or soiled feathers and clinging feces around the bird’s vent (the opening under the tail where it poops). You should also examine the beak and eyes for discharge. This might indicate an illness or infection affecting more than just the digestive system. If your parakeet is lethargic, take it to the vet immediately. Watch for puffed up feathers, excessive sleeping, and unusually low activity levels."

      "title": "Give the bird fluids.",
      "content": "Give the bird fluids. Mix a solution of 10 ml (2 teaspoons) of glucose and 1.4 liters (0.4 US gal) (3 pints) of water. Measure out 6 ml (about 1 teaspoon) each day, and divide it into around 5 or 6 doses. Warm the dose and give it to the bird with an eye dropper or oral syringe. [5] X Research source Glucose is a type of sugar. You may be able to get glucose replacement fluid or powder from your vet, or buy glucose sweetener at a grocery or department store. Ask your vet about the best way to give oral fluids to your parakeet. If your parakeet is very ill, it may be unable to swallow."

      "title": "Give your parakeet prescribed medications.",
      "content": "Give your parakeet prescribed medications. If your parakeet’s diarrhea is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection, your vet may prescribe antibiotics or antifungals to treat the underlying infection. Talk to your vet about the best way to give medications to your parakeet, and follow their instructions carefully. [7] X Research source If your parakeet is too sick to swallow medications, the vet may need to give it medications via injection or crop feeding. The vet may prescribe medications to help improve the functioning of your parakeet’s digestive tract. Never abruptly stop giving your parakeet a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your vet."

      "content": "Keep your parakeet’s environment clean. If your bird is ill, it is important to keep its cage and accessories sanitary in order to prevent reinfection and the spread of disease to other pets or humans. During and after your parakeet’s illness, do the following regularly: Wash food and water dishes with hot, soapy water every day. Wash the cage, toys, perches, and any other equipment with hot soapy water and sterilize with a bird-safe disinfectant, such as Lysol, at least every other day. Change the cage lining papers every day. Moisten them with a disinfectant first to minimize your risk of inhaling dried feces."

      "content": "Determine if the bird experienced a change. If the bird is alert, eating, and drinking, it may not be sick. Instead, it may have experienced a change that caused a digestive upset. If this is the case, it will probably be fine in a couple of days.
