      "content": "Follow up an interview with a quick email expressing thanks. Be sure to let your interviewer(s) know how much you appreciate their time and consideration with a thank-you email. “I would suggest setting it the next day, about 15 minutes before they start their work,” says business and executive career coach Elaine Lou Cartas. So if they start work at 9 a.m., “send it at 8:45, so it's right at the top of their inbox.” Not only is a thank-you courteous, but it will keep you on the interviewer’s radar, making it more likely you’ll get the job. Cartas advises tailoring your thank-you to the interviewer and citing personal things they mentioned in the interview. For instance, “‘Greg, it was so great to know that we both came from the same college,’ and then reiterate like why you would be a good fit for the position.” Thank you for taking the time to interview me for the position. Thank you for interviewing me. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to have an interview. I enjoyed speaking with you about the [position] at [company name]. I really appreciate the time you spent interviewing me. It was nice meeting you in person. I appreciate your time. Thank you for reaching out to me. I enjoyed meeting with you. I appreciate your time and consideration in interviewing me for this position. I sincerely enjoyed speaking with you about the position. I want to take the time to thank you for meeting with me."

[2] X Research source “Thank you for helping,” without “your,” would also be correct, as it is thanking the person for offering assistance (in other words, “helping” as a verb is correct here)."
