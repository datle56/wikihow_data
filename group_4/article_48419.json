Diaper bags can hold a lot of stuff, but overpacking makes it hard to find what you need in a hurry (and it’ll weigh you down after a while, too!). [1] X Research source So, make sure you have these essential items before tossing anything else into that spare side compartment: Spare diapers (1 for every 1–2 hours you’ll be out, plus an extra) [2] X Research source Baby wipes Baby cream or ointment Diaper rash cream Disposable or reusable changing pad (some diaper bags have one built in) or a towel [3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Think of these as your “handy to have just in case” items; if something seems too important or useful to leave home, it probably belongs on your “essentials” list (what’s essential and what’s just nice to have can be different for everyone, so if you’re unsure, go with what you think is best for you and your baby).

      "content": "Pack only what you need for your outing. Diaper bags can get heavy fast, so think through your day and pack only what you’ll realistically need (for example, you probably don’t need baby sunscreen if you’re going out in the evening). This way, there’s less to fumble around with when you need to reach into your diaper bag for something specific. [5] X Research source If you won’t have to carry your bag a lot (like if you’re riding in the car all day), overpacking isn’t so inconvenient. If you have to do a lot of walking and carrying, though, you’ll be glad you only brought what you needed! To help save space, pack travel sizes of things like sunscreen or diaper rash cream and keep them in your bag (save the full-sized bottles for home). Packing tip: try to keep most of the external pockets open so you can easily toss items in there in a hurry while you’re out and about."

      "title": "Use smaller bags to keep your items organized.",
      "content": "Use smaller bags to keep your items organized. Instead of keeping everything loose in the bag or constantly forgetting which compartment or pouch something goes in, organize related items into smaller bags that live inside your diaper bag. [6] X Research source That way, you can just grab and look through the small bag you need instead of clawing through every item you packed in the main compartment of the diaper bag. You can use any fabric bags or zipper pouches you have around the house, or even just gallon freezer bags labeled with a permanent marker. Alternatively, purchase diaper bag organizers to create compartments within your diaper bag. [7] X Research source You might choose to break down your bags like this: A diaper supplies bag with diapers, wipes, diaper cream, and a changing pad. A clothes bag with a change of clothes, a light blanket, burp cloths, and a hat. A food bag with bottles and water, pre-measured formula, or other snacks (for toddlers). A personal bag with your phone, keys, wallet, etc."

      "title": "Pre-portion your bottles and formula.",
      "content": "Pre-portion your bottles and formula. Pack baby bottles filled with enough water to mix a serving of formula, then measure out individual portions of formula and store them in sandwich bags, reusable bags, or small containers. That way, you can just dump a serving of formula into the bottle, shake, and have a snack ready in a flash! Pre-portioning also saves you from having to pack an entire container of formula, too. Some diaper bags come with insulated compartments to keep formula bottles, breast milk, and water bottles cold."

      "content": "Make sure the lids to all your containers are tightly sealed. Check the lids to all your creams and ointments, water, formula, breast milk, snacks, and any other liquids or lotions you have in your diaper bag. The last thing you want is to open your bag in a hurry and discover everything is covered in baby formula or apple sauce!"

      "content": "Totally empty, clean, and refill your bag about once a week. Plan to regularly dump everything out of your bag and check for garbage and empty containers that need to be replaced or refilled. This keeps excess clutter from building up and making it harder to find what you need. [8] X Research source While your bag is empty, look for any spots or stains on it. This is the perfect time to wipe down and disinfect your diaper bag."

      "title": "Consider the style, size, and number of compartments a diaper bag has.",
      "content": "Consider the style, size, and number of compartments a diaper bag has. Style-wise, diaper bags come in messenger- or purse-styled bags and backpack-style bags. Choose whatever works for you and your family. Some couples like how unisex messenger-style diaper bags look and find them easier to pass between parents. However, a backpack-style diaper bag is popular because it frees up both your hands for strollers or pets (and may be easier to carry when it’s super heavy). [9] X Research source Consider the size you need, too. If your baby frequently needs bulky items like multiple bottles of formula or milk or several changes of clothes, then a larger bag may be more useful than a more compact one. Lastly, look for bags with external pockets (great for things like your phone and keys or for quickly stashing garbage or loose items on the go). Examine the inside for pockets and pouches, too. Generally, having lots of pockets makes for easier organizing. Some diaper bags also come with an attached changing pad (if you don’t own one already, this could be a useful option).

      "content": "Diaper bags are designed to hold everything you need to care for your baby. Technically, any bag, backpack, or big purse could be used as a diaper bag. However, diapers bags come with lots of compartments, pouches, and pockets that can hold all the accessories you need. Some compartments are even specialized to suit specific baby items, like insulated compartments to keep baby food or bottles cold. [11] X Research source Diaper bags are also usually made of material that’s easy to wipe clean and hard to stain, making them ideal for withstanding spilled food or diaper time messes (and saving your other bags from baby messes). Plus, using a dedicated diaper bag means you won’t have to constantly change out your baby supplies to free up that spare purse or backpack when you need it for something else. Many families use one diaper bag for all of their children who may need it, but it’s common to have separate bags for each child, too."
