      "title": "Think about why you don't like the person.",
      "content": "Think about why you don't like the person. Take a moment to consider why you don't like the person. Did something happen? Is it just a trait in the person that you don't like? It's important to figure out why because it can help you make amends. Sometimes, we don't like people because they are a bit too much like us. In other words, you may not like that the person is a bit snobby without realizing that that's a trait you don't like in yourself. Coming to that realization can help you accept the other person. Part of the solution is forgiving the trait in yourself, too, and working to be better. One way you can be better is trying to make friends with the person you dislike. It isn't easy, as even adults have trouble with these kinds of relationships, but you can work to make it better."

      "content": "Apologize if appropriate. If you dislike the person because you had a blow up, consider if it was partially your fault. Most of the time, when two people have an argument, both people are at least partially to blame. Try apologizing for your part in it to make amends between you two. [1] X Research source For instance, you could say, \"I know we haven't been getting along since we had that huge fight. I really hate that. I really am sorry for the names that I called you and the things that I said. I'm sorry for my part in our fight. I messed up, and I'm truly sorry. Can we be friends again?\""

      "title": "Figure what you like about the person.",
      "content": "Figure what you like about the person. Now that you've figured out why you don't like the person, try figuring out what you do like about them. Figuring that out means you have to talk to them and observe the things they do. Start with something small if you have to. Maybe you like their handwriting or the way they style their hair. As you look for things you like, the hate you have for the person will lessen. [2] X Research source It doesn't hurt to mention what you like to the other person. Try offering a compliment to them once you notice something you do like. You might get a hostile response, but you've opened a positive bridge of communication."

      "content": "Try spending time with them outside of class. Many times, if you get to know a person, you may find you have things in common that you never knew you did. Try inviting the person to sit with you at lunch or to go with you to the mall. You may find that you actually like being around the person, or at the very least, that you can tolerate them.

      "title": "Ignore the person's hostility.",
      "content": "Ignore the person's hostility. If you can't make friends, you have to move on to more drastic measures. One way to deal with a person you dislike is to simply not deal with them. That is, if the person is openly hostile to you, don't respond to the hostility. Simply keep doing what you're doing. For instance, you can try concentrating on your own work or counting to ten in your head."

      "title": "Look for why they may be mean.",
      "content": "Look for why they may be mean. People are often mean for reasons you'd understand. That is, sometimes people are mean to try to make themselves feel better because they feel bad about themselves. Maybe they don't have a very good home life, or maybe they don't do as well in school as they'd like. If you can figure out why a person is mean, you may be able to feel compassion towards the person instead of hatred."

      "content": "Be polite. It's always good to be polite, even when you're dealing with a person you don't like. It's still important to say please and thank you or to pass a paper over when asked to do so. Don't be openly rude to the person. You don't have any reason to be mean, even if you don't like the person.

Everyone has nervous or fidgety habits from time to time. However, if the kid next to you asks you to stop, go ahead and stop. Don't try to keep going just to annoy them. It will only make it worse.

It's fine not to like someone, as long as you are still polite to each other. However, if someone is being mean to you, taunting you, or harming you in a physical way all the time, that crosses the line into bullying. [7] X Research source Bullying can include the other person calling you names or threatening you. It can also mean that the person is tripping you, shoving you, or kicking you. [8] X Research source They might spread rumors about you or your family. Know that bullying doesn't just happen in face-to-face conversations. It can also happen through notes, graffiti, or on the internet."

That is, in a clear voice, tell him to stop calling you names, stop kicking your chair, stop laughing at you, etc. Try not to use an angry voice. A calm voice works better in this scenario.
