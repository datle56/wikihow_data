      "content": "Post an announcement photo. If you’re looking to let as many friends know as possible in as cute of a way as possible, then stick with a classic, public IG or Facebook post. Or, if you love the hands-off approach but just want to reach a few close friends, create a group with a cute name (Sally’s Squad, maybe?) and post it there. [1] X Research source Pose with your partner or a best pal with cute signs to hint at your pregnancy. Yours could point to your partner and say, “Soon-to-be parent,” and theirs could say, “Bun in the oven.” Use a theme close to your heart. For instance, if you and your partner are Potterheads, you might dress up in Harry Potter attire, hold your sonogram, and caption the pic, “Mischief managed.” For a funny twist, post a photo of you eating tons of notorious craving foods (think, pickle juice, ice cream etc.). Give it a mysterious caption: “Guess what…” For more creative ways to announce a pregnancy on social media, check out this article ."

The benefit here is that this ultra-sweet announcement idea lets you get creative—but it’s also still super hands-off. [2] X Research source For a classic pose, hold your sonogram over your bump in a beautiful or sentimental location. Your next beach vacation would be perfect! Send a photo that highlights your little baby’s future shoes. Hold a super cute pair of tiny tennis shoes, have everyone else hold theirs for comparison, and smile big. Use a seasonal theme. Send a photo of you two in front of a Christmas tree with a present in front of your belly. Caption the photo, “New gift on the way…”"

You can keep a bottle as a special keepsake, so get creative and make a label you love! [3] X Research source There are tons of adorable messages you can use to tip off your friends. Try something mysterious and cute, “Someone in the room can’t drink me…” Use a subtle, champagne-related pun, “ Dom Pregnant-non .” Or if you’d rather cut to the chase, choose a straightforward message: “Drink up! We’re celebrating :) Lola is PREGNANT!”"

[4] X Research source Or, make your message extra cute (and obvious) with foods made to look baby-related. For example, deviled eggs can be hollowed out to look like a crib. Stick a hot dog slice inside and use chocolate sprinkles as a face. Now you've got a baby."

There are so many directions you can take this one; just make sure that you introduce the idea of a “bun in the oven” at some point. [5] X Research source Simply say the phrase and see if they get the picture: “Sorry, guys! The food is not ready. Still have a bun in the oven…” Or, ask a friend to check on the food. Inside the oven, leave a bun with a frosted message: “Bun in the oven!” Wait for your pal to come spread the news. Bring a roll or “bun” to each of your friends. Frost a letter on each baked good and make them unscramble the message to uncover your special surprise."

[10] X Research source Buy your child a shirt that reads, “Only child” with the message crossed out. Simply bring them in the room and let your friends figure it out. Or, help your kid bake “Big brother” cupcakes to pass out to your friends. Wait for the realization to set in and get ready to celebrate. You can also work this idea into a card or post.

[15] X Research source However, this doesn’t mean you have to wait until the 12-week mark to tell your loved ones you’re pregnant. Confide in those you trust when you feel the time is right.

Know that it’s possible for someone to be extremely happy for you while also mourning what would’ve or could’ve been. [17] X Research source Give your friend space if they need it. Offer a comforting word to let them know that you understand if they have mixed emotions. Try saying something like, “I know this may be difficult, but I have some exciting news I’d like to share.
