If you don’t already have one, you could set up this feature on your account by visiting a branch of your bank. As an alternative, you can make the transfer in person at a bank branch. [1] X Research source You can also try depositing the funds using a check written on the account your Euros are in, but many U.S. banks will refuse to process foreign checks. If they do process it, they usually charge hefty fees. [2] X Research source"

Each bank is assigned its own number, and your recipient will need to get the code for their bank so that the funds can go through. [4] X Research source You may need to use an ABA routing code for the bank instead of the SWIFTBIC code. This nine digit number will be on the bottom left side of the recipient’s checks.

However, you should be able to use a wire transfer to send the funds from your bank to the forex, who will then convert the funds and send them to the U.S. bank. You can find a forex company by searching online. You will need to open an account with the forex broker you plan to use, which takes a couple of days.
