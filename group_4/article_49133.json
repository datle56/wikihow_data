      "content": "Cut the wrapping paper 6 in (15 cm) longer than the gift. Place the gift in the middle of your wrapping paper. Wrap the paper around your gift and mark where it overlaps by 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Then, adjust the gift on the paper so there’s about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of excess sticking out from each end of the cylinder. Then, just cut out the paper with a pair of scissors. [1] X Research source It’s okay if your measurements aren’t perfect. Just make sure that you have about an even amount of paper on each end."

      "title": "Wrap the paper around the cylinder.",
      "content": "Wrap the paper around the cylinder. Place the gift in the center of the paper with the printed side of the wrapping paper facing downwards. Make a tiny 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) inch fold on one long edge of the paper. Put a piece of double-sided tape on the fold and wrap the paper around the cylinder. Once the paper overlaps, press down on the fold to secure the tape. [2] X Research source If the gift shifts out from the center of the roll while you’re wrapping it, push on either end to readjust it."

      "title": "Twist the paper at both ends.",
      "content": "Twist the paper at both ends. Grab the excess paper at each end of the tube and gently twist it clockwise. Keep twisting the paper so it’s tight against the cylinder without ripping. Then, stick a piece of tape around the twisted part of the wrapping paper to hold it in place. Finish up by fluffing out the excess paper at the end to make the gift look similar to a candy wrapper. [3] X Research source This method works best for cylinder-shaped gifts that do not need to stand upright."

      "title": "Tie the ends with ribbon.",
      "content": "Tie the ends with ribbon. Add some decorations and finishing touches with a few pieces of ribbon. Tie a piece into a bow around the twisted part of wrapping paper on each end of the gift. [4] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Use a ribbon that matches or complements the color of the wrapping paper you used for a nice, professional look."

      "title": "Measure and cut the paper",
      "content": "Measure and cut the paper so it can wrap around the cylinder. Place the gift at the edge of your wrapping paper and hold the paper in place. Roll the cylinder until the paper wraps around it entirely, and mark the paper so it has a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) overlap. For the ends of the gift, fold up the paper on either side to ensure it reaches the center from each side. Once you have the measurements done, cut the paper with some scissors. [5] X Research source When in doubt, cut a little more paper than you think you need. Trimming off the excess is much easier than trying to attach more paper. Use a thicker, more durable wrapping paper since it won’t tear as easily."

      "title": "Wrap the paper around the cylinder and tape it in place.",
      "content": "Wrap the paper around the cylinder and tape it in place. Lay the wrapping paper so the decorative side is face-down, and set the gift in the center. Make a small 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) fold along one of the long edges of the paper. Stick a strip of double-sided tape along the fold. Then, wrap the unfolded end of the paper around the cylinder. When you reach the folded end, press the tap against the loose end of the paper to secure it. [6] X Research source It’s okay to use single-sided tape in a pinch. Just hold the paper tightly as you wrap it around the gift. Attach the tape where the edges overlap so it only sticks to the paper."

      "title": "Fold the loose paper on the cylinder’s ends to form pleats.",
      "content": "Fold the loose paper on the cylinder’s ends to form pleats. Start with one end of the gift. Push the seam of the wrapping paper toward the end’s center with your thumbs. Hold down the part you just folded with one finger, and use your other hand to pull the loose edge of the paper toward the center. The paper pattern will start looking like a fan with pleats. Continue folding around the cylinder until the end is completely pleated. Put a piece of tape in the middle to secure the pleats. [7] X Research source After you finish one end, flip the gift over to fold in the other end."

      "title": "Cover the ends with scrap paper to hide the folds.",
      "content": "Cover the ends with scrap paper to hide the folds. Cut out a small circle of wrapping paper, either using the same paper or a complementary color, for each end of the gift. Put a piece of double-sided tape on the back of the circle and press it over the pleats to cover the folds and give your present a clean, professional look. [8] X Research source It’s okay to leave the pleats uncovered if you like how they look."

      "title": "Finish your present with a bow or ribbon.",
      "content": "Finish your present with a bow or ribbon . Stand the cylinder-shaped gift upright and place it on the center of a long piece of ribbon. Pull the ribbon up the side of the gift and tie a knot in the center at the top. Cut the ribbon so that there are two long tails of ribbon on either side. Then add a bow to the center of the gift on top of the ribbon knot. [9] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020. Curl the ribbon and let it hang down the sides of the gift to make your gift pop out. Alternatively, put a bow on the top of the gift without adding a ribbon for a simpler look. Choose a bow and ribbon that complement the color of the wrapping paper. For example, if you are using red paper with gold stars, you may want to use a gold ribbon and a gold bow. You could also tuck foraged foliage into the ribbon to make your gift look gorgeous. [10] X Expert Source Amy Guerrero Arts & Crafts Specialist Expert Interview. 9 October 2020."

      "content": "Place the gift in the center of the wrapping paper. This method works best for cylinder-shaped gifts that can stand upright, such as a bottle or jar. Lay out a large sheet of wrapping paper that’s thick and can support the weight of the gift. Set the gift so it’s standing up in the center of the paper."

      "content": "Pull the opposite corners together at the top of the gift. Grab the 2 opposite corners of wrapping paper and pull them together so that they meet over top of the gift. Hold the 2 corners in place, and slowly bring the remaining 2 corners up to meet them. Pinch all the corners together with your finger and squeeze the paper close to the gift."

Smooth the paper on the side of the gift out and pull the edge of the paper tight. Work your way around the top of the cylinder until the folds look like a fan. Then, just put a piece of tape down over the pleats to hold them down. Pleating the top of your gift gives it a more professional look than leaving the paper bunched up on top. If there’s excess paper at the top that overhangs the edge of the gift, trim it with a pair of scissors."
