      "content": "Apply a mild soap or cleanser to your underarm area. You can use your normal soap or body cleanser to wash your armpit hair. If you’re using a bar of soap, simply rub it into your armpit hair. If you’re using a liquid cleanser or body wash, squeeze a dollop of the product onto your hand, washcloth, or loofah. Then, swipe it over your armpits.

Only use the soap on your underarms, though, as it can dry out your skin. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you're out of soap, you can use shampoo to wash your armpit hair in a pinch, as it can also clean skin. However, keep in mind that soap formulated for your body does a better job of cleaning your skin than shampoo does.

      "content": "Pat your underarms dry after you bathe or shower. Make sure you totally dry your armpits after a shower because water might get trapped in your armpit hair. Sometimes this can lead to skin irritation. Use a clean towel to blot away excess water from your bath or shower. Pay special attention to the area around your underarms to make sure it’s dry. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your armpit hair still feels wet after you towel off, you might want to let your underarms air out for a few minutes so the hair has time to dry. How long it takes for your hair to dry depends on the thickness and texture, but it shouldn’t take longer than a few minutes."

For instance, you might shower before bed if it relaxes you or in the morning if it helps you wake up. Be sure to soap up your armpits, groin, and feet, as these areas tend to get smelly. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You don’t actually need to use soap on your entire body unless you prefer it. You only need to soap areas that get sweaty and moist, which are your armpits, groin, and feet. However, it's okay to soap up your entire body if you only do it once a day. Using soap too often on these areas will dry out your skin."

You probably don’t need to wash your armpits more than once daily, but it’s totally safe to do so if you’re very concerned about body odor.

      "content": "Wear natural fabrics that absorb sweat so it doesn’t stay on your skin. Fabrics like cotton, wool, and silk soak up sweat better than synthetic fabrics, like polyester or rayon. Since the sweat isn’t sitting on your skin as long, this helps control body odor and sweat build-up on your armpit hair. Check the labels on the clothes you buy to make sure they’re made from natural fabrics. [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"

While it’s a common problem, you might be annoyed and embarrassed if your antiperspirant-deodorant is leaving a white residue in your armpit hair. Unfortunately, solid stick antiperspirant-deodorant can leave visible clumps behind. To avoid this problem, try a roll-on liquid, gel stick, or spray antiperspirant-deodorant to control sweat and odor. [14] X Research source Liquids, gels, and sprays typically provide better odor protection than solid antiperspirant-deodorants when you have armpit hair because the product can reach your skin under the hair more easily. You may need to try several different kinds of antiperspirant-deodorant to see which works best for you. Everyone reacts to each product differently."
