      "content": "Find the bathroom and make sure it is open for business. This is more difficult than you might think. Some public bathrooms in small towns in Italy, for reasons stubbornly unclear, are closed during the lunch hour and on Wednesdays. If you can't find a public bathroom, try the train station. If the train station is anywhere close by, beeline right over there in full confidence that you will most likely find free restrooms which are somewhat functional."

      "title": "Keep searching.",
      "content": "Keep searching. If there is no open bathroom in the public square, and the train station is just too far and you know you can't make it, then your best bet might be to find a restaurant or a caf√©. And yes, you will be expected to sit down, have a drink, and then use the facilities. You are thinking that drinking more fluids, just so that you can use the bathroom, kind of defeats the purpose. True enough. You have run up against one of the great conundrums of traveling in lovely rustic, old lands."

      "content": "Hand off your stuff. Give your bag, your sweater, that cute little sunhat, and any other handheld belongings to your friend. Or give it to your husband, your boyfriend, or to anyone who has the skill to be able to stand outside waiting for you for quite awhile, holding all that precious stuff you always drag around with you. Hopefully it's not raining. Once inside, the last thing you want, is to have to put any of your treasures on the floor of this bathroom. There is not likely to be a hook in the bathroom, nor a nice clean surface of any kind, at any height. Nor is the bathroom all that likely to have a spotless and dry floor."

      "title": "Bring a flashlight.",
      "content": "Bring a flashlight. While some bathrooms in Italy are equipped with lightbulbs and functioning electricity, some are not! Some of the doors in bathrooms run all the way from the floor to the ceiling. If the light inside that little stall is out, when you close that door, you might as well be shut up deep in the darkest Kentucky cave. This is not ideal. You need to be able to see for these delicate maneuvers. Bring that flashlight."
