On any modern Android, there's no way to get back into a locked phone without the password, biometric, or PIN without doing a factory reset. This also does not work with iPhones."

Then press and hold in the input field and tap Paste . Repeat that process until the characters are no longer highlighted. You should have about 10-11 copies of the original 10 asterisks.

If you were signed in to your Android with a Google account and have backups enabled, you'll be able to restore from your backup after the reset to get your data back.

This is the feature named by Google, and it's switching names, so you might be more familiar with the term \"Smart Lock\" or \"Extend Unlock,\" depending on what your phone calls it. If you have a newer Android, you can't use the hack with an emergency call to unlock your phone. Instead, use settings like Smart Lock/Extend Unlock to prevent getting locked out in the first place. Find Smart Lock in Settings > Lock Screen > Smart Lock. Find Extend Unlock in Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Extend Unlock . Add when you want the phone to remain unlocked, like if it detects it's on your body, if you're in a specific location, or if it detects another device. For example, you can set Smart Lock/Extend Unlock to prevent your phone from locking whenever you're at home or if you're wearing a smartwatch. You'll need to input the password whenever the phone restarts, like after an update."
