      "content": "Fire at the center of the board. Game expert Ashton Wu leans toward the strategy of aiming toward the center of the board first. Statistically, this gives you more chances of hitting one of your opponent’s ships. [1] X Research source The four-by-four squares in the middle of the board are likely to contain a carrier ship or battleship. Need a breakdown of Battleship’s rules? Check out our playing guide !"

      "content": "Use parity (whether ships have odd or even holes) to up your chances. Imagine the board as a checkerboard, where half the squares are dark and half are light. Each ship covers at least two squares, meaning every ship must touch a dark square. Therefore, if you fire randomly at only even squares or only odd squares, you will minimize the number of turns you need to hit every ship. [2] X Research source Once you have a hit, cease firing randomly and commence targeting the ship in question. To keep track of the light and dark squares, look at your own board and imagine that the diagonal line of squares from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is dark. Imagine the squares from the top right corner to the bottom left corner are light. You can count out from there to ensure each square you're targeting is the right color. This strategy is also referred to as the “Hunt.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Move away when you have two misses in the same segment. If you strike out twice when firing, try firing into a different segment of the board. The chances that you just missed a ship are lower than the chances that you missed by a wide margin. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Reduce the target area after you make a hit.",
      "content": "Reduce the target area after you make a hit. After you make your first hit, work on minimizing your target area or where the rest of the ship likely is. Keep your focus on the target area rather than the entire board. This helps you narrow down a specific ship. Since ships in Battleship range from 2 to 5 spaces long, it may take you several turns to sink the ship you have hit. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Fire around the area of your hit.",
      "content": "Fire around the area of your hit. Begin by striking above, below, or to one side of the space you have hit to discover and hit more of the ship. If one of your strikes is a miss, try the area on the opposite side of the space that was a hit. Keep striking until you have taken your opponent's battleship. [6] X Research source You’ll know when you have taken your opponent's ship because players are required to announce when a ship has been sunk."

      "title": "Continue this method to hit more of your opponent's ships.",
      "content": "Continue this method to hit more of your opponent's ships. After you have sunk the first of your opponent's ships, resume firing randomly (or in the center of the board) to find another ship. Then repeat the process of firing around the hit space until you have sunk another ship. Playing the game this way reduces the number of turns that it takes to sink all of your opponent's battleships, and it can also increase your chances of winning. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Space ships out so that they don’t touch.",
      "content": "Space ships out so that they don’t touch. If your battleships are touching, there’s a chance your opponent will sink two ships back to back. To reduce your opponent's chances of finding a second battleship after hitting one, some players suggest spacing your battleships out so that they don’t touch. Try to keep one or two spaces between each of your battleships to reduce the chances of your opponent finding one of your battleships. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Try placing ships so that they touch, but don’t overlap.",
      "content": "Try placing ships so that they touch, but don’t overlap. Even though having your battleships right next to each other is seen as a weakness by some, other players see this as a potential strategy. By placing two ships so that they are touching, but not overlapping, you may be able to confuse your opponent about the type of ship they’ve sunk. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that placing ships close together can work in your favor, but it can also be a risky strategy, as it may lead to your opponent discovering one or more of your other ships."

    {
      "title": "Place your ships vertically.",
      "content": "Place your ships vertically. The more vertical ships you have, the better. Horizontal ships take up more space on the board and could, in turn, be easier to target. To avoid this, place most of your ships vertically so they take up multiple columns instead of one. [10] X Research source Many players say they scan the board left to right rather than up to down. Because of this, they may be less likely to hit vertical ships. For example, place a ship on A1, B1, and C1 rather than A1, A2, and A3."

    {
      "title": "Use multiple techniques at once.",
      "content": "Use multiple techniques at once. By playing multiple strategies at once, you can throw off your opponent. You get five ships per game, so place them wisely. [11] X Research source Keep three closer together and two farther apart, or four vertically and one horizontally. The more versatile your ship placement is, the harder it’ll be for an opponent to find."

      "title": "Pay attention to your opponent's moves.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your opponent's moves. If you play with the same opponent often, another way you can improve your chances of winning is to place ships where your opponent rarely strikes. Keep a mental record of the spaces your opponent strikes most often and avoid these zones. [12] X Research source For example, does your opponent tend to start their strikes on the right side of the board, to the center, or in the lower left corner? Identify your opponent's most common strike areas and avoid placing your ships in these zones. The most common places of attack, according to players, are columns 1, 5, and 10."
