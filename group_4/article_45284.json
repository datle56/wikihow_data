Your first 2 steps each last 1 quick beat—count out “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,” and take your first 2 steps on “1” and “2.” The leader takes their first step forward with their left foot, and the follower mirrors, taking a step back with their right foot. Then take another quick, short step with your other foot. [1] X Research source Take comfortable, even steps that feel natural for both you and your partner. Imagine that you’re just walking, but to the rhythm! Some variations follow the first quick step with an immediate step or tap from your other foot to realign. If you like, incorporate this tap when you get a better grasp of the dance."

      "content": "Take 2 slow steps that last for 2 full beats each. Slow your movement so that both of your next steps take 2 beats instead of 1. Step forward with your left leg if you’re the lead, or step backward with your right leg if you’re following. [2] X Research source If you’re counting out the rhythm, take a slow step on “3, 4,” and another slow step on “5, 6.” You’ll step the same way as you did for the first step, but this time it will be slow."

      "content": "Move counterclockwise around the room as you dance. The line of dance is an imaginary line that goes around the dance floor. Faster dancers stay to the outside of the dance floor, while slower dancers move closer to the inside. The line typically moves counterclockwise, but always follow the flow! [3] X Research source If people are line dancing, they'll do it at the center of the dance floor inside the line of dance. Once you’re comfortable with the basic steps, mix it up by turning 180 degrees during the quick steps, so that the leader is now the follower."

Keep holding hands all the while, but keep your grip loose to help your hands shift during the spin.

The turn lasts the duration of the 2 quick steps. While the leader takes 2 quick steps, the followers spins. You don’t need to do a turn every sequence–your partner will get dizzy!

As the follower, place your hand in your partner’s so that your palm faces down, with your fingers resting in the crook of their thumb, just like ballroom dancers do. [10] X Research source Keep your grip loose to avoid hurting your partner’s hand. For a more casual, comfortable posture, lower your hand to shoulder-level, or drop it even further.

This allows both of you to see your surroundings, and offers a slightly more natural dancing position. [11] X Research source Line up your right foot so that it points between your partner’s feet for a sturdy, agile stance. If you can’t see over your partner’s shoulder, allow them to be the leader so they can guide you around the dance floor."
