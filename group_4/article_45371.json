      "content": "A VPN masks your IP address from another location, allowing access to blocked sites. Using a VPN is more secure and anonymous than using a web-based proxy server. Once you add a VPN , you wonâ€™t need to go through hoops to visit sites anymore. Just open your browser and surf the web. Most VPN software requires payment, but some can be used free with ads. If you don't have administrative privileges on your computer, as is common for employees at work or students at school, you will not be able to use this method. This method is ideal for accessing blocked websites on your phone . All you have to do is visit your app store. Many of the same software brands available for computers also have a version for phones. The most popular VPN providers include: NordVPN, CyberGhost, and Surfshark. All you need to do is download, install, and open the VPN to visit the blocked site."

      "content": "Sign into the web-based proxy server and enter the blocked site's URL. Proxy servers act as medium, visiting a blocked site for your computer and showing it to you. However, they are less secure than VPNs and offer less anonymity. Some proxies might monitor your online activity. A good proxy service will not have too many ads or popups. Advertisements are very common and can be a big downside to using many free proxy servers. This is the best option if you're using a public computer, like one at work or school since you don't need to download any additional software."

      "content": "Some sites might be too complicated for a simple web-based proxy to unblock. If you're trying to use YouTube, Twitter (X), Amazon, or other dynamic sites, the web-based proxy or installed VPN might not work correctly on its own. In this case, a browser extension can do the trick. Some larger VPN services have browser extensions bundled in your purchase. You can find lots of proxy browser extensions available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge."

      "content": "There's a chance that the blocker is blocking the URL and not the IP address. A URL is what you usually use, like https:.//facebook.com, and an IP address is a series of numbers, which you don't normally use. To find a website's IP address on Windows and Mac, do this: Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and enter ping (name of the website) . It'll look like this: ping facebook.com . You can also use the command nslookup (name of the website) in Command Prompt or Terminal. The website's IP address will be under \"Non-authoritative answer\" for Windows, and next to \"Address\" for Macs. Press Enter and take note of the string of numbers you see. The repeated set of numbers is the IP address. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the Tor browser as your normal browser to visit blocked sites. If you have admin privileges on a computer, download Tor from its site and use it to visit blocked sites. Since it hides your IP from the destination server and hides the destination server's IP from your ISP, Tor is a very effective tool for bypassing blocked sites. Tor is very slow compared to the other options, so it's not the first solution."
