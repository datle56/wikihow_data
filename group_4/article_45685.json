      "content": "Examine the door with your eyes. Look for scratches in the paint or any other noticeable damages to the door and frame. Also check for grime or any sticky buildup that may just need to be cleaned. Close the door and run your eyes along the gap between the door and the frame, noting places where the gap is very thin. It is best to inspect an exterior door in a sunny or well-lit area."

      "content": "Run a piece of heavy stock paper around the closed door. This is very useful if you can’t determine where the door is sticking by physically examining it. The paper should glide smoothly around most of the door. Wherever the piece of paper gets stuck is the problem area."

      "title": "Look for sticking areas as you open or close the door.",
      "content": "Look for sticking areas as you open or close the door. Try closing the door with your hands on the bottom, the side, and the top. This will allow you to feel where there is the most resistance as you close it."

      "title": "Note the time of year.",
      "content": "Note the time of year. If the door seems to be only slightly sticking, it is probably caused by changes in humidity. Wood expands when humidity increases, and shrinks when humidity decreases. [1] X Research source It is important to understand this, because a door that sticks in the summer may not stick in the winter. In this case, you would try a less drastic solution, such as lightly sanding the door, or else it may be drafty and shrunken come winter."

    {
      "title": "Rub the problem area with bar soap.",
      "content": "Rub the problem area with bar soap. This should reduce the friction and allow the door to close more smoothly.

      "title": "Run your air conditioner.",
      "content": "Run your air conditioner. One of the functions of the AC is to remove excess moisture from the air and decrease the humidity level in your home. While this can be a costly solution, it will help with your sticking doors. As the humidity in your home is lowered, the wood door will shrink in size."

      "content": "Decide if the door hinges are causing the trouble. When a door is opened and closed repeatedly, it’s no surprise that they can start to tarnish.

Play around with it until it fits perfectly. [9] X Research source If that didn't work, the hinges might be bent. Remove the hinge pin and use a wrench to slightly bend the hinge knuckles back so when you reinsert the pin, it pulls the door back just enough to open easily.
