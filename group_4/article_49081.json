      "content": "Purchase a set of hand weights if possible. It is good to buy varying dumbbell weights because you can then progressively challenge yourself as you progress with your weight training. The standard combination of weight to buy is two 5 pound (2.2 kg) weights, two 10 pound (4.5 kg) weights, and two 15 pound (6.8 kg) weights. To test whether or not a set is good for you, pick up the smallest weight in the group. Lift and lower this hand weight 10 times. If you are exhausted and don’t think you could do more than 10, that weight set is too heavy. [1] X Research source Similarly, If you have spent a lot of time working out and think that these weights won’t challenge you, purchase heavier weights. Employees at your local sport goods store should be able to help you determine which set of weights will work best for you."
