      "content": "Come to class prepared. Have all of your note-taking materials organized and ready to go before your class, meeting, or lecture . If you take notes by hand, have extra pens or pencils and a notebook with plenty of blank pages. If you use a laptop, make sure it’s fully charged and bring a charger just in case. [1] X Research source It also helps to review notes or background reading from your previous class. This helps bring you up to speed so you’re ready to pick up where you left off. If you wear glasses, have them with you so you can see important information on the whiteboard or screen. Sit somewhere you can effectively see and hear the speaker."

      "title": "Be an active listener.",
      "content": "Be an active listener. When note-taking, many people make the mistake of writing down every word without really comprehending what is being said. Instead, actively listen by focusing on what’s really being said and asking questions about what you don’t understand. This will help you know what is important to write down. [2] X Research source Don’t be afraid to ask questions. Think about it—if you find something confusing now, it’ll be twice as confusing when you review your notes later. Determine the best time to ask questions, then raise your hand to get the instructor's attention. They'll appreciate that you're listening attentively and want to understand. Do your best to understand the information during class so you won't have to work so hard during the review. If you have trouble focusing in class, academic tutor Daron Cam says, “Make sure you get enough sleep, [and] request to sit in the front row. [If] someone’s distracting you in class, please advocate for yourself and don’t be afraid to ask for seating changes.” [3] X Expert Source Daron Cam Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020."

      "title": "Focus on keywords and concepts.",
      "content": "Focus on keywords and concepts. The most important way to improve your note-taking skills is to focus solely on taking down keywords and concepts. Write down individual words or phrases that are most relevant to the topic at hand—things like dates, names, theories, and definitions. Prioritize new information that you’ve never heard before, and don’t waste time writing down what you already know. [4] X Research source Think about what you want to retain. Why are you taking the class or attending the seminar? Why did your employer send you to the conference? Use these questions to determine what information is most important. Academic tutor David Jia says, “A lot of people will take too many notes and literally write everything down. At that point, they spend too much time and have all these notes of really obvious stuff they didn’t need to take notes on. Then, it takes them forever to go back into the notes to look for the information they need.” [5] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 23 February 2021."

      "title": "Color-code your notes.",
      "content": "Color-code your notes. Use different colored highlighters to emphasize keywords, dates, and definitions. Try writing different parts of your notes (like questions, definitions, and conclusions) in different colored pens, like red, blue, and green. Color-coding stimulates the creative side of your brain to make your notes more interesting. This helps you link color with memory, allowing you to remember the contents of your notes more easily. [6] X Research source Don’t go overboard with highlighting, however. If you highlight everything, you won’t know what’s most important!"

      "title": "Keep your notes organized.",
      "content": "Keep your notes organized. There’s no point taking notes if you can’t find the information you need! Keep your notes in a separate notebook, folder, or binder for each subject so nothing gets lost. Start your notes for each class period on a fresh sheet of paper and write the date at the top. Make sure your writing is legible so it’s easy for you to quickly find the information you need to study. [7] X Research source It also helps to use headings, subheadings, and numbered lists to easily distinguish major and minor points. Use wide margins when writing down your notes. This will prevent the page from becoming too overcrowded and will give you extra space to write in any additional information once you review your notes. When taking lecture notes, test prep tutor Jennifer Kaifesh says, “Try to highlight keywords/concepts, and, whenever possible, organize your notes in a clear, structured way. Even better, record the lecture on your phone and type up notes after class when you have time to hit ‘pause’ and search confusing terms.” [8] X Expert Source Jennifer Kaifesh Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 8 November 2019."

      "title": "Take notes in your own words.",
      "content": "Take notes in your own words. Don’t write down what your teacher or lecturer says verbatim. Paraphrase what you hear in a way that makes sense to you. This will help you understand and remember what you hear. Try to paraphrase everything except for any information that specifically needs to be noted exactly. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Use symbols and abbreviations.",
      "content": "Use symbols and abbreviations. Abbreviating words or using shorthand allows you to take notes more quickly and avoid falling behind. Use common abbreviations like “etc.” for “etcetera”, “info” for “information,” “gov” for “government,” and so on. Using symbols like “=” or “>” for “equals” and “greater than” respectively can also save you some time, as you don’t have to write out the words. [10] X Research source The average student writes 1/3 word per second, while the average speaker speaks at a rate of 2/3 words per second, so it’s easy to fall behind if you write out every single word. Try using your own abbreviations, as well. For example, use “wd” for “would,” “cd” for “could,” and “w/” for “with.” Just make sure you’re able to decipher your own shorthand later on. Create a key if necessary. Try to abbreviate long words that appear again and again throughout the class. For example, instead of writing “popular sovereignty” 25 times over the course of a history class, write “pop sov.” If you use shorthand and the speaker is still going too fast, consider bringing a recording device to your next class. This will allow you to listen a second time and fill in any gaps in your notes."

      "content": "Take notes from your textbook. After a class or lecture, supplement your notes with information from your textbook . Start by reading any introductions and conclusions, headers and sub-headers, and the first and last line of every paragraph to determine what the chapter is about. Then, read the text thoroughly and highlight any keywords, facts, concepts, or important quotes. Add this information to your notes. [11] X Research source Try not to copy full sentences from the text, and instead paraphrase the information in your own words."

Add your main points as bullets, then include additional relevant information as nested bullet points below your main point. The finished page resembles an outline for a paper, hence the name. [12] X Research source When to use this method: When you need to write down information quickly (like during a lecture) or to see a hierarchy of information Pros: Highlights key points, groups related points, highly structured and visibly organized Cons: Doesn’t work well for subjects that require a lot of diagrams, graphs, or other visuals"

      "title": "The Cornell method",
      "content": "The Cornell method Cornell notes are one of the most popular note-taking methods, designed to make you actively think about what you’re writing. Divide your paper into 3 sections—a 2-inch horizontal section on the bottom, a 2.5-inch vertical section on the left, and a large section on the right. Write all your class notes in the large section, comments and questions in the section on the left, and summarize the information you learned in the bottom section. [13] X Research source When to use this method: Use Cornell notes when you know you need to study a lot, as it’s easy to revise with the page setup. Pros: Helps you find the main ideas, the summary gives you a better understanding of the information, notes are logically organized and easy to skim Cons: Takes more effort than other note-taking methods, requires extra time to set up the page"

Divide your page into two columns, then add topic headers for each main idea. Expand each section with key points directly below the main idea. After completing notes for each idea, draw a box around the entire note section and header. The final page will contain several different-sized boxes for each topic and its notes. [14] X Research source When to use this method: Use this method for revision, using a different page for each course or topic. Pros: Helpful for studying and revising, provides a quick overview of each topic Cons: Not suitable for lecture notes, can be a hassle if you’re drawing the boxes freehand (as opposed to using a note-taking app)"

Set up a grid where each column has its own category of information and each row has its own topic. Add words, phrases, and main ideas in the square correlating square where the rows and columns intersect. [15] X Research source When to use this method: Use the Charting method when you need to compare items across a certain set of characteristics. Pros: Good for comparison, summarizes a series of items in a systematic way Cons: Not good for linear note-taking or notes that follow a story or progression of information"

      "content": "The Mapping method The Mapping method is a visual note-taking method that allows you to divide your notes into branches to establish relationships between topics. Write your main idea at the top of your page, then draw arrows to the left, right, and below, and add your subtopics. Add supporting ideas to your subtopics the same way. [16] X Research source When to use this method: Use this method when individual points require a lot of explanation or when your notes follow a linear progression. Pros: Easy to create and follow ideas, easily demonstrates relationships between information, allows you to elaborate on points without cluttering your page Cons: You may run out of space depending on how many branches you need (usually works better for note-taking apps than handwritten notes)"

      "title": "The Mind Mapping method",
      "content": "The Mind Mapping method Mind Mapping is similar to the Mapping method, as it is a visual way to show connections between information and ideas. Start with a central topic in the middle of your page, then add branches and sub-branches to connect related ideas. Mind maps are a great way to synthesize new ideas, as your ideas easily flow from one to the next. [17] X Research source When to use this method: Mind Mapping is good for revising and brainstorming new ideas. Pros: Breaks down large ideas into smaller pieces, allows you to create and discover new connections between ideas, visually presents how ideas are related Cons: Not the best for recording lectures or meetings in the moment"

      "content": "The Zettelkasten method The Zettelkasten method is designed to help organize knowledge for long-term reference and development. Write one idea on a notecard (a “zettel”) and store it in a box (a “kasten”). Then, create connections between your notes by using tags. This allows you to create a growing encyclopedia of knowledge about a certain topic. [18] X Research source When to use this method: While the Zettelkasten can’t be used during a lecture, it works well if you need to learn a lot of information about a certain topic, like for your college degree. Create a Zettelkasten during your first year and continue adding information throughout your college career. Pros: Stores all your knowledge in one place, easy to review because of concise notes Cons: Can take some time to set up, better for long-term knowledge than short-term revising"

      "content": "Memorize your notes. Consistently review your notes for 20-30 minutes each night to memorize them for a test . This way, you’ll actually know the information so you don’t have to cram the night before. Here are some popular memorization techniques: [21] X Research source Line-by-line method: To memorize a chunk of text, read the first line a couple of times, then try to repeat it out loud without looking at the page. Read the second line a couple of times, then try to repeat the first and second line out loud. Keep going until you can repeat the entire text without looking at the page. Story method: Turn the information you have to memorize into a simple story. For example, to memorize the first 3 elements of the periodic table (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), use a story like “(H)arriet and (He)nry went to the (Li)brary.” The sillier the story, the better. Mnemonic devices: This helps you remember a list of words in a particular order. To make a mnemonic, take the first letter of each word and come up with a short sentence where each word starts with those letters. For example, to remember the lines on a musical staff (EGBDF), use the mnemonic “Every Good Boy Does Fine.”"
