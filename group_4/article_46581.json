      "content": "Use a hand-held device if you can sit or stand upright unassisted. This type of urinal is recommended for individuals who have limited mobility and can support themselves when sitting or standing. Hand-held devices are also useful if you would like the freedom to dispose of the urine without assistance and reuse the device easily. There are several different styles of hand-held urinals, including: [2] X Research source Jug shaped: This is a common style for female urinals, with a deep and open receptacle that is easy to urinate in. You can use them while standing or sitting. Bottle shaped: This is another common style that consists of a narrow, hollow chamber with an opening that is designed to fit the female anatomy. You can use bottle-shaped urinals when standing or sitting in a chair with your pelvis tilted slightly forward. Some brands of this style are also made use when lying down or on your side. Dish-shaped: This style has a flat base and is shallow, with a cover that surrounds the central opening of the urinal. You can insert this style under you when you are in bed or a chair. A moulding with a drainage bag attached: This style is designed for individuals who are looking for an easy way to dispose of the urine. The small moulding sits between your thighs and drains through a tube into a drainage bag attached to the moulding. You can then dispose of the drainage bag or empty it and reuse it. The moulding is usually cup-shaped, like a funnel, and used when standing or sitting."

      "content": "Make sure the urinal is lightweight and easy to clean. If you are using a hand-held device, you should buy a urinal that is made of a lightweight material like plastic and has a handle for easy lifting and placing. The urinal should also be easy to empty and to clean with soap and water. Body-supporting urinals should also be made of a lightweight material like plastic and have grip areas for easy holding. You should be able to easily empty and clean the urinal with soap and water. Some female urinal brands also have graduation marks on the side to indicate how full the urinal is and remind you when it is time to empty it. If you need to go to the bathroom often, you may look for a urinal that is larger and can hold a larger amount of liquid. If you are receiving assistance from a helper, like a nurse or caretaker, you may go for a urinal that holds a smaller amount of liquid, as it will likely be emptied often."

Your ideal position will depend on any injuries you may have on certain areas of your body and your comfort level when going to the bathroom. [4] X Research source If you cannot be on your feet when urinating, you may choose to sit in a chair when using the urinal, with your pelvis tilted slightly forward and your legs apart. If you have pain in your knees or hips, you may choose to use the urinal while standing so you do not need to squat or put unnecessary weight on your knees or hips. If you have lower back pain or injuries on your back, you may use the urinal on one side while lying down."
