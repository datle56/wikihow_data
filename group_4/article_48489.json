      "content": "Wait 6–12 months for your belly piercing to heal before changing jewelry. When you first pierce your belly , it will be swollen and tender, so leave in the jewelry your piercer gives you. After 1 or 2 months, your belly piercing may look okay from the outside, but it’s still healing internally and could cause an infection if you try changing it. Leave the jewelry in for at least 6 months to be safe, but wait up to 1 year if you still feel tenderness around your belly button. [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Trying to change your piercing too early could prolong your healing time, cause more pain and irritation, or lead to infection. If an infection becomes severe, you may have to permanently take out your belly piercing. Since a navel piercing moves around any time you stretch or move your core, it takes a little longer to heal compared to other piercings. If your piercing hasn’t healed within 12 months, then visit your piercer so they can see if there are any issues prolonging your recovery."

      "content": "Your skin around the piercing is no longer red or swollen. It’s completely normal for your skin to swell or look red as your belly button piercing is healing. As you continue to recover, your skin will return to its normal color and the swelling will go down. Once the swelling and redness stay down for 2–3 weeks, it’s a good sign your piercing has healed completely. [2] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source If you’ve taken anti-inflammatory medicine, like ibuprofen, it may also make your swelling go down. Wait until the medication wears off before checking the piercing site to determine if it’s healed or not."

      "content": "The area around the piercing site feels dry and crust-free. As your belly piercing heals, it may leak a clear discharge that has a crusty texture when it dries. Dab a clean paper towel onto your navel piercing and check if there are wet spots from any discharge. If you still see discharge forming, then let your piercing continue to heal. If the paper towel comes back dry, then you’re ready to change your jewelry. [3] X Research source If the discharge looks white, yellow, or green, then it could be a sign of infection. If you notice your piercing looks infected , leave the jewelry in and contact your piercer to let them know your symptoms."

      "content": "Your piercing feels painless whenever you touch it. As your skin heals, it will feel tender or painful any time you move or bump your piercing. As you’re taking care of your navel piercing , pay attention to how sensitive it is to light touches or movements. If your belly piercing is fully healed, it will move back and forth without any pain or irritation. [4] X Research source Avoid playing with or forcing your piercing to move around since you could prolong your healing time. Only use a gentle touch to gauge whether it’s healed."

Use a commercial solution, or make your own saline with ¼ teaspoon (6 g) of table salt with 1 1 ⁄ 2 fluid ounces (44 ml) of distilled water. Wet a gauze pad with the solution and hold it against your piercing to soften any discharge. Gently slide your belly piercing up and down so the solution gets inside.

Take out your new belly button bar or ring out of the packaging and run it under warm water. Lather fragrance-free soap on your jewelry before rinsing it off with clean water. Then, just pat your jewelry dry with a paper towel. [7] X Research source Stick with antegrade titanium or steel jewelry since it’s surgical-quality and least likely to cause irritation or an infection. If you choose gold jewelry, make sure it's 14 karats or higher so it doesn’t break down. [8] X Research source"

If you have a ring, carefully push on the side of the bead to pop it out. Gently pull the old piece of jewelry through the piercing to remove it completely. Immediately slide the new piece of jewelry in through the bottom hole of the piercing, and attach the bead to hold it in place. [9] X Research source If you feel any pain while you’re trying to remove the jewelry, stop right away since the piercing isn’t fully healed. Leave the jewelry in so you don’t cause any scars or infections. Put in new body jewelry as soon as you take the old one out.

Wet a gauze pad with a commercial or homemade saline solution and hold it against your belly piercing. Let the saline solution soak into the piercing for about 3–5 minutes so it has time to soften any crusty discharge. Slowly move your piercing up and down in the hole to spread the solution, and pat it dry with a paper towel. [11] X Research source If you don’t have saline solution, antibacterial soap makes a great alternative."

Any time you bump or move your piercing while it’s healing, it has the potential to reopen the wounds on the inside and make your healing time longer. Try to only touch your piercing when you’re cleaning it to help reduce your recovery time. Touching your piercing could also transfer dirt and bacteria inside, which could potentially lead to an infection."

If you continue doing exercises like sit-ups, crunches, or intense yoga poses, your belly piercing may move around or put pressure against your skin and cause irritation.
