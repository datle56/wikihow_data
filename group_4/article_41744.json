      "title": "Pick a 1-way stretcher to expand the width of your boots.",
      "content": "Pick a 1-way stretcher to expand the width of your boots. There are a few different types of stretchers, and it’s important to pick the right kind based on how your boots need to be stretched. If your boots are too narrow but otherwise fit great, you can use a 1-way stretcher to make the soles wider. Many shoe stores sell boot stretchers and you can also find them online. They generally cost about $20-$40. Boot stretchers can increase your boot size by 1/2-1 size total. If your boots are 2 sizes too small, though, you may need to buy a new pair."

      "title": "Opt for a 2-way stretcher to lengthen and widen your boots.",
      "content": "Opt for a 2-way stretcher to lengthen and widen your boots. When you turn the handle on a 2-way stretcher, it both expands and elongates your boots. If your shoes are too narrow and if your heels or toes are consistently getting pinched or blistered, this is a great option for you. [1] X Research source Wooden stretchers are the most durable option and add a nice scent to your boots, whereas plastic stretchers are less expensive and easier to travel with. Check out the reviews of different options when you go to make your purchase."

      "title": "Use a boot-calf stretcher to widen the calves of your leather boots.",
      "content": "Use a boot-calf stretcher to widen the calves of your leather boots. You can buy a boot-calf stretcher on its own, or you can get one that is combined with a 1- or 2-way stretcher to adjust the fit of the entire boot at once. If just the calves of your boots are a little too tight, use a boot-calf stretcher on its own. These instruments are great for both hiking boots and zip-up or slip-on boots. There are even stretchers that will specifically target the instep of a boot in case that area is too tight for comfort."

    {
      "title": "Buy 2 boot stretchers so you will have one for each boot.",
      "content": "Buy 2 boot stretchers so you will have one for each boot. Most boot stretchers are sold in pairs, but some sources sell them individually. If you’re ordering online, make sure to check and see if you’ll be getting 1 or 2 stretchers with your order. If you aren’t in a rush, you could purchase a single stretcher and use it over a few days and stretch each boot individually."

      "title": "Insert the boot stretcher while it is unexpanded.",
      "content": "Insert the boot stretcher while it is unexpanded. You must get the stretcher into place in the boot first before you make any sizing adjustments. Slide the stretcher into the boot as far as it will go so that the tip of the toes fits snuggly into the end of the boot. You’ll use the same process for a 1-way or 2-way stretcher. [2] X Research source If you’re using a calf stretcher on its own, you just need to put the stretcher down into the calf section of the boot. It shouldn’t go into the actual sole section at all.

      "title": "Expand the boot stretcher until you see resistance in the leather.",
      "content": "Expand the boot stretcher until you see resistance in the leather. Turn the handle clockwise to start the stretching process. Continue turning the handle until you see from the outside that the leather is being stretched. The handle will adjust both the width and the length of the stretcher if you’re using a 2-way stretcher. [4] X Research source If you’re worried about over-stretching your boots, apply a light amount of pressure and then increase the amount of stretch each subsequent night until you get to the desired size.

      "title": "Leave the boot stretcher in place overnight for 6-8 hours.",
      "content": "Leave the boot stretcher in place overnight for 6-8 hours. If you leave the stretcher in place for less time than this, it won’t have much of an effect. It’s also totally fine for you to leave the stretcher in place for longer periods. [6] X Expert Source Moe Draper Shoe Care & Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 5 April 2021. Depending on how much your boots need to be stretched, it may take 2-3 nights to get them to the right size. Be patient and try the boots on every morning to see how much progress has been made.

      "title": "Use a leather-stretching spray while wearing the boots for a custom fit.",
      "content": "Use a leather-stretching spray while wearing the boots for a custom fit. Spray the inside of the boots rather than the outside to keep the leather in good condition. If you spray the outside, the leather could get discolored. Put the boots on while they are still wet from the spray to get the boots to stretch to fit your foot. [8] X Research source These products can be bought at shoe stores, convenience stores, and online. You can usually get a small bottle for under $10."

      "title": "Spray alcohol mixed with water inside your boots to stretch the calves.",
      "content": "Spray alcohol mixed with water inside your boots to stretch the calves. This method can work for the entire body of the boot, but it works especially well for calves that are a little too tight. Mix a 1:1 ratio of rubbing alcohol and water in a clean spray bottle. Saturate the inside of your boots with the spray, and then wear the boots until they’re completely dry. [9] X Research source You can repeat this method as often as you need to. If you don’t want to wear the boots while they’re wet, use a calve-stretcher in conjunction with the spray for the best results."

      "title": "Wear wet boots to stretch them to the size of your foot.",
      "content": "Wear wet boots to stretch them to the size of your foot. Submerge your boots completely in a bucket of water. Leave the boots to soak for 5 minutes. Then, put the boots on and wear them around for 30 minutes or until they have dried. While they’re drying, massage a conditioning cream into the leather to help them retain their new, stretched shape. [10] X Research source Leather conditioning cream can be bought online, at a shoe store, or many convenience stores, usually for less than $10."

      "title": "Wear thick socks to break in new boots and stretch the leather.",
      "content": "Wear thick socks to break in new boots and stretch the leather. This method works best for new shoes that are just a little too tight or that pinch your toes. Put on 1-2 pairs of thick socks (as many as you can wear while still being able to put on the boots), then put on your boots and walk around in them for 30 minutes at a time. After 4-5 days of doing this, your boots should be broken in and should fit better than they did before. [11] X Research source This process can be a little uncomfortable, so do it when you’re at home and will be able to take the boots off after 30 minutes or so. Having to wear the extra socks and have that excess pressure on your feet all day long wouldn’t feel great."

      "title": "Wear your boots and reshape the leather with a hairdryer.",
      "content": "Wear your boots and reshape the leather with a hairdryer. Put on a pair of thick socks and then put on your boots. Use a hairdryer to blow hot air on the boots for 3-5 minutes. Be careful to not apply heat for much longer than that as it could damage the leather. [12] X Research source The heat relaxes the leather and reshapes it to fit the extra bulk provided by the thick pair of socks you put on. You can repeat this process daily if needed."

      "title": "Expand your toe space by freezing water in your boots overnight.",
      "content": "Expand your toe space by freezing water in your boots overnight. Take a gallon-sized plastic bag and fill it halfway with water. Settle the bag into your boot and use something to prop up the heel so that the water stays primarily in the toes. Freeze the boots overnight. In the morning, take the boots out of the freezer and let the water defrost before you remove the plastic bag. [13] X Research source As the water freezes, it expands, creating a natural stretcher for your boots."
