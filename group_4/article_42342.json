Remove breakable items from the area where you plan to keep your puppy. Keep all electrical cords raised or covered, and close all low windows. Lock away toxic cleaning supplies/chemicals. Get a trash can that is too tall for him to get into and too heavy to knock over, or store the trash can in a cabinet.

Consider “Bil-Jac” or “Zuke’s Mini Natural” treats. Look for treats about the size of a pencil eraser head. If your treats are larger, break them up into smaller pieces. Make sure you get a variety: crunchy and soft. The soft will be good for training, and the crunchy will help clean teeth."

When you first get your puppy, ask the breeder, rescue group, or shelter what food your puppy was eating with them. You can continue that diet when they first come to their new home. If you want to make a change, do so after a few weeks, and transition to the new food gradually, over a week or so. Changing foods abruptly can cause vomiting or diarrhea. Buy a puppy food with no dyes, artificial flavors, or preservatives, as many dogs are allergic to these additives. A raw or home-cooked meal is a serious commitment, as you will need to take extra steps to prepare the food and ensure your puppy's nutritional needs are met. Discuss these options with the veterinarian first."

It is normal for puppies to have short bursts of energy followed by long naps. While your puppy's body is still developing, avoid rough play and strenuous exercise. Save long (over one mile) runs until he's at least 9 months old. Give your puppy about an hour of walk-time a day, broken into two to four walks.

Make sure to talk about deworming medication during your first vet visit. The veterinarian may recommend deworming for routine parasites like roundworms right away. Or, he or she may want to get a stool sample for fecal analysis to verify parasites before prescribing medication. Deworming is a good idea not only for your puppy's health but also for your own. Many of the parasites that infect your puppy can be passed to humans and cause health problems in your family.
