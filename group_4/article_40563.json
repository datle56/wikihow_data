What do you enjoy doing? What are your strengths? Make a list of everything that you think you could possible monetize. [1] X Research source Don’t write off any of your skills or passions.

      "content": "Consider the market. While most skills can be effectively monetized, you probably want to consider early on who needs particular skills. If you want to make freelancing your full-time job, you may want to pick a skill that you think a lot of people would be willing to pay for, or at least broaden the scope of what you are willing to do. Conduct a little research on the marketplace before you get started. For example, strong academic writers may find work easier than an expert on 15th century German footwear. Consider how many people will need what you’re selling, and decide if you can broaden your scope."
