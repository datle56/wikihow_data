      "content": "Let your hair air-dry, if possible, to prevent frizz. Heat is the main culprit of dry, frizzy hair, and hairdryers can wreak havoc on your beautiful curls. Fortunately, because your hair is so short, it should not take very long for your curls to air-dry. If your hair is soaking wet, scrunch it dry with a microfiber towel or an old T-shirt. Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel, since this can create frizz. If you must blow dry your hair, use a diffuser to prevent voluminous frizz."

      "content": "Detangle damp hair with a wide-toothed comb. Avoid detangling your hair with a regular hair brush or fine-toothed comb since they can create frizz. Instead, work a wide-toothed comb through your hair. Start by combing out the ends and gradually work your way to the roots to prevent additional tangles. In a pinch, you can also detangle your hair by running your fingers through your curls. Try using a wide-tooth comb in the shower to detangle it while itâ€™s wet."

      "content": "Apply styling mousse while your hair is damp to define your curls. How much styling mousse you use depends on how short your hair is. Start with a dime-sized amount, then add more as needed. Work the mousse into your hair evenly from root to tip.

      "content": "Apply styling mousse to damp hair. A good styling mousse will help give your curls the ideal texture for tousled looks. Work a generous amount of mousse into your hair from root to tip. [3] X Research source If you want textured, beachy waves rather than defined curls, use a sea salt spray on damp hair instead of the mousse. If you have natural hair, you may want to use a styling gel instead, since it has more moisture."

Hold the blow dryer under the ends of your hair while you point the diffuser at the ceiling, scrunching occasionally as you dry small sections at a time. Use low heat and take your time so you don't blow out your curls. Defined, springy curls are key to this look! If you're going for tousled waves rather than defined curls, you may want to let your hair air-dry most of the way before hitting it with the diffuser."

Next, use a rat-tail comb to tease your hair at the roots, then use a brush to lightly comb the tips back towards your crown.
