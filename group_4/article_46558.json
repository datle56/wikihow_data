      "content": "Measure out your coffee before dumping it in the filter. Dip your coffee measure into your coffee, which likely holds 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of coffee. Level the scoop of coffee out and then dump this measurement into the coffee filter. Brush off any extra coffee grounds along the edges of the rim using your fingers. If you’re using a coffee pod instead of ground coffee, place the pod in the filter instead. Check that the pod you’re using has an ESE label on it to ensure it works with the machine. If you have access to a scale , take time to measure out the espresso grounds before putting them into the machine. Coffee can hold twice its weight in water, so whatever amount you put into the portafilter should yield double the dosage."
