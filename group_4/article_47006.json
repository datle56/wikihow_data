Many manufacturers have incorporated security measures like QR-code verifiers. If your package is missing a code, or contains incorrect or misplaced branding, it may be fake. [2] X Research source In the UK, the health warning must cover 30% of the front and back of the package. In the U.S., look for the word ‘chemical’ in the health warning.
