Casually proposing that the two of you do something together can remove some of the anxiety and worry you may feel about asking her outright about her feelings for you. For example, you can ask her what she is doing tonight or this weekend. If her plans are open or not fixed, you can share what you would like to do and ask her if she wants to go to along with you. [16] X Research source If she says she’s busy, it could mean she’s not interested but it could also mean she’s actually just busy. Ask her if there are any other days that she would be free to do something and see what she says. For example, you can ask: What are you doing this weekend?” If she says “Nothing” or “I was thinking of seeing a movie,” then you can say “I was planning on going to the movies, want to go together?”"

[17] X Research source For example, if she has been talking about trying a new pizza place nearby, tell her you have also been wanting to try it and suggest that you go together. If there is a school event coming up that she has been texting you about, tell her you have been looking forward to it and see if she wants to go with you. Maybe she’s been texting with you about an upcoming exam in a class you both share. This is a great opportunity for you to suggest getting together to study for it."

[18] X Research source By making the first move, you are taking the pressure off, which she might appreciate, especially if she is shy. Be prepared for her to say she’s not interested. Humans are complicated and even if she has sent you all the right signs, it’s possible that she could still say she’s not that into you.

[20] X Research source If you ask her a direct question and she doesn’t respond at all, you can take that as a sign that she’s not interested. Ghosting isn’t very kind, but it’s not uncommon for people to simply avoid responding if they feel uncomfortable, awkward, or guilty about rejecting someone."
