You can establish a church at varying levels and the better you define your aims for the church, the easier it will be to establish your tax-exempt status. Establishing a ministry, for example, is somewhat different than forming a corporately structured church, housed in its own building. [2] X Research source Consider: Your possible membership . How many do you reasonably expect? Your location . Where will you worship? Your commitment . Will this be a part-time job, or a full-time calling? Your financial aims .
