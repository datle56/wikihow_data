      "content": "Club soda and sparkling water are different types of carbonated water. “Sparkling water” typically refers to naturally carbonated water that comes from a spring, well, or similar location. [1] X Research source Club soda, on the other hand, is regular water that’s manually carbonated and has additives like potassium sulfate and potassium bicarbonate mixed in. [2] X Research source Carbonated water is an umbrella term for any type of bubbly water infused with carbon dioxide, including water that’s naturally or manually carbonated. [3] X Research source Some people may use sparkling water as a synonym for carbonated water (along with “bubbly water” or “fizzy water”), though—it really depends on who you’re talking to.

      "title": "Sparkling water",
      "content": "Sparkling water Sparkling water is naturally carbonated water that’s found in natural sources like springs and wells—the bubbliness is typically caused by sulfur and salt compounds that are present in the water. [5] X Research source Depending on where it comes from, sparkling water can have natural additives like calcium, sodium, and/or magnesium. [6] X Research source Some people refer to this drink as mineral water. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Club soda Club soda is plain water that has carbonation and extra additives mixed in, like potassium bicarbonate and potassium sulfate. [8] X Research source Club soda doesn’t have a super unique flavor (compared to drinks like tonic water), so it’s often used to add an effervescent touch to a mixed drink. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Seltzer water",
      "content": "Seltzer water Seltzer water is plain, manually carbonated water without any additives. Unlike club soda, seltzer water doesn’t have any potassium sulfate or potassium bicarbonate added in—it’s just water plus a little bit of carbonation. [10] X Research source On its own, seltzer water just tastes like effervescent water. Many brands add a variety of sugar-free flavorings to their seltzer (like lemon-lime, mixed berry, or orange) to give their water a little more zest. Handy gadgets like SodaStream make it easy to prepare seltzer water at home."

      "title": "Soda water",
      "content": "Soda water Back in the late 1700s, “soda water” was just a synonym for manually carbonated water. In more recent years, it’s become an umbrella term for both club soda and seltzer water, depending on who you ask. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Tonic water",
      "content": "Tonic water Tonic water is carbonated, but it typically has a sweetener (like corn syrup) mixed in, along with quinine (which makes the beverage taste a little bitter). It’s one of the titular ingredients in the popular “G&T” drink, which features a mixture of gin and tonic water. [12] X Research source You can transform regular seltzer or sparkling water into tonic water using tonic syrup ."

      "title": "Yes, club soda and sparkling water can taste very similar.",
      "content": "Yes, club soda and sparkling water can taste very similar. Club soda has minerals like potassium sulfate and potassium bicarbonate added in, which add a slightly saltier touch to the drink overall. Some varieties of sparkling water naturally contain different minerals which can make them taste a bit salty as well (or sometimes bitter). [13] X Research source If your drink recipe calls for sparkling water, club soda should work in a pinch—at the end of the day, they’re both carbonated and unflavored water. Certain sparkling water brands might taste a bit different from one another since their water is sourced from different places. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "No, carbonated water isn’t bad for you. Some people worry about the higher acidity in carbonated water affecting their teeth, but this isn’t actually a big issue. So far, research shows that regular and carbonated water has about the same impact on your tooth enamel overall. Still, if you’d like to go the extra mile in protecting your teeth, here are a few things you can do: [15] X Research source Sip plenty of fluoride-enriched water in addition to carbonated water. Enjoy your carbonated drink all at once rather than sipping it over a long period of time. Limit how much citrus-flavored water you drink, since citrus flavoring can be pretty acidic. Steer clear of sugar-flavored drinks or sodas , which aren’t carbonated water at all."
