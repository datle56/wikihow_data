[8] X Research source However, sometimes relationships don’t work despite having a lot of chemistry and love for each other. As dating coach Lisa Shield explains, “If it didn’t work, there were issues and problems in that relationship. Couples get so focused on getting back together…that they don’t know they’re not having a functional relationship.” If you truly want to get back with your ex, Shield advises that you “learn how to interact better, how to listen, how to communicate, [and] how to have boundaries.”"

Just because you have a soul connection to an ex doesn’t mean you’re compatible or that you were happy together. If you’re ready to move on to a happier and healthier relationship with someone new, that may be something you can manifest.
