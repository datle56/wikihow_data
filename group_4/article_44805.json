[5] X Research source Talk to your doctor before using an ice pack if you have certain medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Reynaud’s syndrome. These conditions can cause your blood vessels to become blocked or constricted when exposed to cold. Be cautious if you have any numbness around the injured area, since you may not notice if the cold is hurting your skin."

For example, you might start by doing a light 10-15 minute walk every day, then work up to longer and more intense workouts, such as a 30-minute run."
