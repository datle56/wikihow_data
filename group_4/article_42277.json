      "content": "T4T is an abbreviation of “trans for trans.” The term became more well-known in the early 2000s on Craigslist personal ads, where trans people carved a separate space for themselves beyond the “m” and “w” binary on the platform. [1] X Research source T4T is still used by trans individuals on modern dating apps who are seeking out safety and connection from a partner who will understand their trans experiences. A desire for safety and understanding is deeply understandable, especially when you look at trans statistics. Research published by the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2015 shows that over 45% of surveyed trans individuals were victims of sexual assault, while over 50% dealt with intimate partner violence.

      "content": "T4T represents advocacy, support, and love in the trans community. While T4T is commonly associated with dating apps, it taps into a much deeper and more pervasive theme within the trans community. [3] X Research source T4T represents carving out an intentional space by trans people for trans people—it’s about the care and support that exists within trans circles and the importance of trans people advocating for fellow members of their community. T4T is about creating environments where trans people can exist solely as themselves without cisgender influences or expectations.

      "content": "T4T was popularized on Craigslist in the early 2000s. Back when Craigslist still had personal ads (which were officially banned in 2018), trans users would include “t4t” in their listings to show that they were trans individuals seeking other trans individuals. This helped remove the need for trans people to post in the cisgender-dominant “m” and “w” labels. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Only trans people should use T4T.",
      "content": "Only trans people should use T4T. T4T is rooted in the trans community, and its sole purpose is to foster connection, community, and advocacy within said community. If you’re a cisgender individual, you don’t have a good reason to use T4T in any capacity, dating app or otherwise. Using “T4T” on a dating app as a cisgender person is a pretty dishonest thing to do, as T4T is so deeply centered within the trans community. It’s great to be open-minded and accepting of your potential date’s gender identity, but it isn’t great to specifically search for trans people on a dating platform (especially while masquerading as a trans individual by using “T4T” in your profile)."
