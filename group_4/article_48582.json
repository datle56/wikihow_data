      "content": "Lower into a squat with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your core engaged and your back leaning slightly forward. Your toes should be pointing out at a 45 degree angle and your thighs parallel to the ground. [1] X Research source A slight arch in your back adds some sensuality to the pose. This can be a very challenging position to hold because it really works your leg muscles. Take a break if you need to."

      "title": "Raise your left arm in front of you to chin level, with your hand in a fist.",
      "content": "Raise your left arm in front of you to chin level, with your hand in a fist. This will set you up for the \"whip.\" Think of it like holding an imaginary steering wheel with 1 hand. Rotate your arm from side to side while it’s in front of you as if you were driving a car. [2] X Research source Keep your right arm hanging loosely at your side or resting on your hip. Try not to let your extended arm drop down in front of you while you dance."

      "title": "Pulse your hips up and down in small movements, keeping your arm up.",
      "content": "Pulse your hips up and down in small movements, keeping your arm up. This is the move known as the \"whip.\" Stay in the squat position while you bounce your hips, keeping your feet planted firmly on the ground. Your knees will bend slightly while you bob up and down, but most of the motion should come from your hips and core. [3] X Research source You can also move your hips from side to side as you move up and down."

      "title": "Raise your right arm over your shoulder and let your left arm hang down.",
      "content": "Raise your right arm over your shoulder and let your left arm hang down. Continue rocking your hips while you do this. This move is known as the “nae nae.” Your hand will be open in the air, almost as if you’re waving to someone. [4] X Research source You can also move your shoulders from front to back in a subtle shimmy while you’re swaying to personalize the move."

      "title": "Do the \"whip\" on both sides, swinging your left arm and then your right arm forward.",
      "content": "Do the \"whip\" on both sides, swinging your left arm and then your right arm forward. This is the same motion you made previously but sped up and switching arms. Raise your left arm first, and then as it lowers, raise your right arm. For extra emphasis, stomp with the opposite foot while you raise your arm. For example, when you bring your left arm up, stomp down with your right foot."

      "content": "Raise your left arm over your shoulder, letting your right arm hang down. You’re repeating the nae nae on the other side now. Remember to keep your hand open with your palm facing out while you sway your hips. [5] X Research source Add some individual flair by bending your knees towards the ground while you nae nae so you sink lower. Changing levels is a technique dancers use to make their performance more interesting."

      "content": "Practice putting all of the moves together and repeating them. Now that you know the basic moves, work on doing them faster until you can dance to the tempo of the song. Practice them slowly to make sure you have the technique down, then gradually build up speed. You can add in some freestyle moves or other hip hop dance moves to mix it up."

      "title": "Try the stanky leg if you want to mix up the “whip” part of your dance.",
      "content": "Try the stanky leg if you want to mix up the “whip” part of your dance. Stick 1 of your legs out in front of you while you’re in a squat, placing your foot on the ground. Lean your entire body away from that leg while you move your planted foot in small circular motions. Your foot shouldn’t come off the ground while you’re rotating it. [6] X Research source The stanky leg feels most natural if you do it with the leg that’s opposite of whichever arm you have out in front of you. For example, if your right arm is raised, do the stanky leg with your left."

      "content": "Incorporate the “watch me” move to show a little attitude. This motion is similar to the whip move, except you’re alternating raising your arms in front of you to the beat of the music. As your left arm drops down, your right arm rises, and then vice versa. [7] X Research source Move your shoulders up and down while you swing your arms, too, for a more dramatic effect."

      "content": "Do the “duff” if you want to add a military vibe to your dance. This move looks like a soldier marching. Bend your right arm at the elbow as you lift it up to your chest, lifting your right knee up at the same time. Then repeat on the left side. Make the motions sharp and clean. [8] X Research source You can tilt your head towards the arm and leg that are being lifted to exaggerate the dance move, too. Fist your hands when you’re bending your arm up for a more pronounced movement."

      "content": "\"Break\" your legs for a cool visual effect. No, you won’t literally be breaking your legs. It’s just the name for this crazy-looking dance move. Stand with your legs together, then bend your knees and swing your legs from side to side. Keep your knees pressed tightly together the whole time as you cross your arms below hip line vigorously. [9] X Research source Stay loose so you can move your legs more fluidly. The stiffer you are, the more awkward you’ll look."
