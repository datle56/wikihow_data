      "content": "Look for delayed speaking and reading skills in young children. Kids with dyslexia may be slower to start talking or learning the names of letters, numbers, and colors than their peers. They also have a hard time learning to read, write, and spell, and are often behind the expected skill level for their age or grade level in these areas. If you think your child might have dyslexia, ask their teacher how their skills compare to those of other kids their age. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most kids are able to start reading and writing in kindergarten or first grade. If you’re feel that your child is struggling to make progress with those skills, talk to your pediatrician about getting them tested. Some signs to look out for in preschool-aged kids include mispronouncing common words, struggling to name familiar objects, and having difficulty learning simple songs and rhymes. Try not to worry! All kids learn at their own pace. And if your child is diagnosed with dyslexia, rest assured that there are lots of treatments and interventions available to help them become successful learners."

      "content": "Check for problems with spelling in older children or adults. Spelling is tough for a lot of people. But it can be really difficult for people with dyslexia, because the brain has trouble connecting letters with speech sounds. If you or your child struggle with spelling even basic vocabulary words, then look into getting tested for dyslexia. [3] X Research source For example, someone with dyslexia might often confuse similar-looking letters (like “d” and “b”), mix up the order of letters in a word, or have trouble remembering which letters make which sounds. Kids in the K-2nd grade age range (around 5-7) may have trouble learning the names of letters or remembering the sounds they make. They may also struggle to remember common spelling rules. [4] X Trustworthy Source Understood Nonprofit organization dedicated to resources and support to people with thinking differences, such as ADHD or dyslexia Go to source Older kids (3rd grade and up) may have difficulty spelling consistently, and may even spell the same word several different ways within the same writing assignment. Teens and tweens with dyslexia also have a hard time remembering common abbreviations."

People with dyslexia often spend so much time just trying to figure out individual words that they have trouble following the overall meaning of what’s on the page. [5] X Research source Think about whether you struggle to understand things you just read. Or, if you’re concerned your child might have dyslexia, try having them read a simple passage and then asking them a few questions about it. For example, you might have your child read a page from a picture book, then ask them questions like, “What was the bear looking for? What did he do when he heard people talking inside the tent?” This may become more obvious in older kids and adults. For example, teens and tweens with dyslexia often have an easier time answering questions about text if someone reads it out loud to them.
