Hit the timer for 30 seconds and let it run before taking it out. [2] X Research source If your microwave doesn't have a defrost mode, setting it to low will work the same.

Using a spoon or utensil, stir your Cool Whip as best you can and put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds. Repeat the stirring and microwaving process in 30-second intervals until the Cool Whip is thawed and at the consistency of your liking—this should take around 2-3 minutes. [3] X Research source User beware, no one likes runny, yellow Cool Whip! To avoid a disaster, don’t be bold and microwave your Cool Whip for a solid 2-3 minutes—this will turn your dessert into soup. Once your Cool Whip is thawed, you won’t be able to refreeze it and try again if you mess up. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and underheat it—better too cold than liquidy. Cool Whip goes great with desserts like homemade sponge cake topped with strawberries!"

[7] X Research source Don’t leave your Cool Whip out for over 2 hours. Because Cool Whip is a dairy product, it can spoil easily. If you live in a hot climate, 1 hour will likely be all it takes to thaw, but 2 hours is more realistic if it's colder where you live."
