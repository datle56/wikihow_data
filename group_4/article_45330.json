      "title": "T-shirt bra",
      "content": "T-shirt bra When you picture a typical bra in your mind’s eye, you’re probably thinking of a T-shirt bra . This style features two full-sized cups, underwire, and a smooth, simple fabric. The T-shirt bra is a basic, simple, and versatile option, usually without any added embellishments or extra padding. It also goes with just about any ensemble (except strapless or super wide-neck tops), which makes it a great everyday bra for many people. [1] X Research source Breast type: All breast types and sizes. Support: Regular support. Occasion: Everyday (work, school, etc). Wear with: T-shirts, sweaters, sweatshirts, casual ensembles in general. Pro tip: Since this is more of an “everyday” bra, start with neutral colors that will work under a wide range of tops. Black, nude, white, and gray are all great options! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Demi bra",
      "content": "Demi bra A demi bra is also known as a “half-cup” bra, which makes sense considering that “demi” comes from the French term for “half.” Whereas a regular bra has full cups that cover your breasts entirely, a demi bra has smaller cups that only cover about half of your breasts, cutting across the middle. This creates more cleavage, while also allowing you to wear lower-cut tops or dresses without your bra peeking out. [3] X Research source Breast type: Since this style has smaller cups and less support, it tends to be most comfortable for people with small to medium-sized breasts. Support: Regular to low support. Occasion: Everyday as well as dressier occasions. Wear with: Lower-cut necklines. Pro tip: Demi bras work especially well with dresses or blouses that have sweetheart or square necklines. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Balconette bra",
      "content": "Balconette bra Like demi bras, balconette bras feature smaller cups that cover less of your breasts, enhancing the appearance of cleavage for lower-cut tops. Balconette bras also have wide-set straps and underwire to create a fair amount of lift, just like demi bras. One difference between the two is that balconette bras have more of a straight neckline, while demi bra necklines are more sweetheart-shaped. Breast type: Best for small to medium-sized breasts (due to smaller cup size). Support: Regular to low support. Occasion: Dressier occasions (weddings, parties, fancy dinners, etc). Wear with: Low-cut blouses and dresses, broader necklines. Pro tip: Balconette bras tend to have a more luxurious lingerie-type vibe, so consider going for a pretty lacy style."

    {
      "title": "Plunge bra",
      "content": "Plunge bra A plunge bra has a deep-V neckline. [5] X Research source Whereas demi bras and balconette bras cover about half of your breasts, a plunge bra only covers about one-third of your breasts, which makes it perfect for your lowest-cut tops or dresses. Plunge bras also have underwire and angled cups to help create lift and enhance cleavage. Breast type: Best for small to medium breasts due to small cup size. Support: Regular to low support. Occasion: Dressier and more formal occasions (weddings, cocktail parties, etc). Wear with: Deep plunging necklines, very low-cut blouses and dresses. Pro tip: Certain plunge bras have more of a rounded U-shaped neckline, while others have the classic sharp V. [6] X Research source Opt for the style that’s closest to the neckline of the dres or top you’ll be wearing!"

    {
      "title": "Push-up bra",
      "content": "Push-up bra A push-up bra has extra padding inside each cup to lift your breasts upward, and the cups are also angled toward each other to push your breasts closer together. This enhances your cleavage significantly and makes your breasts look larger than their normal size. Push-up bras typically have underwire to create more lift and support, as well. [7] X Research source Breast type: All breast sizes, but works especially well for people with smaller breasts who are looking to create a little more volume and cleavage. Support: High support. Occasion: Dressier occasions (weddings, cocktail parties, dates, etc). Wear with: Lower cut shirts, blouses, or dresses. Pro tip: You can also turn a regular bra into a push-up bra with silicone gel bra inserts . Just purchase them separately from a lingerie store or online, place them inside the cups of your favorite bra, and voila! You’ve got a push-up bra. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Longline bra",
      "content": "Longline bra A longline bra goes lower than the bustline, extending further down your torso and ribcage. [9] X Research source This creates a little extra coverage and provides some more support for larger breasts, but the style works for all breast types. Breast types: All breast sizes, but especially good for larger breasts. Support: Regular to high support. Occasions: Everyday wear, dressier occasions. Wear with: Any type of top or dress. Pro tip: Some longline bras can even be worn on their own as crop tops for a daring and flirty look! [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Racerback bra",
      "content": "Racerback bra A racerback bra has straps that come up around your neck like a halter, then join around your mid-back and sit between your shoulder blades. [11] X Research source This works perfectly for racerback tops, since they share the same neckline. The strap style also helps distribute the weight of your breasts more evenly, which makes this style extra comfortable for people with larger breasts. Breast types: All breast sizes, but great for people with larger breasts looking for more comfort and support. Support: Regular to high support. Occasions: Everyday wear. Wear with: Racerback tops or dresses, T-shirts, casual tops. Pro tip: If you’re someone who struggles with bra straps slipping down your shoulders, this may be the style for you! There’s no strap slippage with racerback bras, so you won’t have to worry about it anymore."

    {
      "title": "Halter bra",
      "content": "Halter bra A halter bra has a single strap that goes around your neck, instead of two separate straps. This allows you to wear the bra under a halter top or a halter dress without your straps peeking out on your shoulder blades. They also tend to be pretty low-cut, which makes them ideal for plunging necklines. [12] X Research source Breast type: All breast sizes, but this style may be slightly uncomfortable for people with larger breasts, since it only has one strap around your neck for support (rather than a strap across each shoulder). Support: Regular support. Occasions: Everyday wear, dressier occasions. Wear with: Halter tops, halter dresses. Pro tip: Although the typical goal is to hide a halter bra discreetly under a halter top or dress, if your halter bra is made with a pretty lacy material, it can also be cute to show it off under a top with a regular neckline. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Convertible bra",
      "content": "Convertible bra Convertible bras have detachable straps that you can wear tons of different ways. For example, you could criss-cross the straps across your back to create a racerback bra, use only one strap around your neck to create a halter bra, or detach the straps altogether to create a strapless bra. In other words, a convertible bra is a jack of all trades, and it’s basically like having a bunch of bras in one! [14] X Research source Breast type: All breast sizes. Support: Regular support. Occasion: All occasions. Wear with: Any style top (including racerbacks, halters, and strapless tops). Pro tip: If you have a one-shoulder dress or top, try wearing your convertible bra with just one strap attached. [15] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Full-coverage bra",
      "content": "Full-coverage bra This style features larger cups, more side coverage, wider straps, and underwire. Full-coverage bras offer more support and lift than regular bras do, so they’re perfect for people with larger breasts. [16] X Research source They also prevent the side-spillage that can occur with smaller cup styles. Breast type: Larger, fuller breasts. Support: High support. Occasion: Everyday wear. Wear with: Casual ensembles. Pro tip: Although full-coverage bras are great everyday bras for fuller-breasted people, they also come in prettier/fancier styles if you’re looking for something special for a more formal occasion. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Contour or shaper bra",
      "content": "Contour or shaper bra Contour bras (also called shaper bras) are designed specifically to provide lots of support and lift while also smoothing around your underarms and back, so you don’t have to worry about any spillage. They also have structured cups and underwire to create a more sculpted silhouette. Breast type: Works for all breast sizes, but especially good for larger, fuller breasts. Support: High support. Occasion: Everyday wear. Wear with: Casual ensembles. Pro tip: If you don’t like the look of underarm or back spillage in your regular bra, give a shaper bra a try!"

    {
      "title": "Minimizer bra",
      "content": "Minimizer bra Minimizer bras are designed to make larger breasts appear smaller, while still offering a comfortable, supportive fit. These bras work by slightly compressing your chest, which takes a few inches off the circumference of your bust. [18] X Research source Breast type: Larger, fuller breasts. Support: Regular to high support. Occasion: Everyday wear. Wear with: All ensembles. Pro tip: People with larger breasts often may struggle to feel confident in oversized clothes because regular bras can push these garments outward too much or cause them to fall strangely. If you’re in this situation, a minimizer bra could be the perfect solution!"

    {
      "title": "Strapless bra",
      "content": "Strapless bra A strapless bra is exactly what it sounds like—a bra without straps. Although it’s ideal to wear a strapless bra under strapless tops and dresses, it can be tough top find one that doesn’t slip throughout the day. Quinn has some specific advice to prevent this pesky issue. “I like to choose the ones that have a little silicone grip on the edge of the bra, which helps keep the breasts where you place them,” she says. Breast type: Since this style lacks straps for support, it tends to work best for smaller breasts. Support: Regular to low support. Occasion: Dressier occasions. Wear with: Strapless tops or dresses. Pro tip: If you’re trying on strapless bras and they all seem to be slipping, even with silicone lining, try going down a band size. Quinn explains that many people try to wear bras that are actually too big for them, and this can be especially problematic for strapless styles."

      "title": "Bandeau bra",
      "content": "Bandeau bra Bandeau bras , also called tube bras, are a comfier alternative to strapless bras. These simple bras usually have no built-in cups or underwire, and they’re made out of stretchy, spandex-like fabric. They don’t offer a ton of support or lift, but they do tend to be super soft and comfortable under more casual ensembles! [19] X Research source Breast type: Best for smaller breasts since they offer minimal support. Support: Very low support. Occasion: Everyday wear. Wear with: Casual outfits. Pro tip: Lacy or colorful bandeau bras can look super cute under tops with cut-outs or low sides. [20] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stick-on bra",
      "content": "Stick-on bra Stick-on bras have adhesive cups that stick to your breasts. They don’t have straps or a band, so they’re perfect if you want something unnoticeable to wear under a backless and strapless top or dress. [21] X Research source They tend to be less supportive than regular bras, so they usually work best on smaller breast sizes. Breast type: Smaller breast sizes. Support: Very low support. Occasion: Dressy and formal occasions. Wear with: Dresses or tops that are both backless, strapless, or both. Pro tip: If you’re wearing a dress that’s already pretty supportive and you don’t need a stick-on bra, try out adhesive nipple covers. This will create a smooth, rounded look, without adding too much extra bulk. [22] X Research source"

      "title": "Front-open bra",
      "content": "Front-open bra A front-open bra clasps in the front, between the two cups, instead of in the back. This design makes them super easy to take on and off, and they’re ideal for people who struggle with clasping bras in the back on their own. Front-open bras come in a variety of styles, including T-shirt, demi, plunge, push-up, and more. [23] X Research source Breast type: All breast sizes. Support: Regular support. Occasion: All occasions. Wear with: Any outfit style. Pro tip: Some women with larger breast sizes find front-open bras to be more supportive and easier to maneuver."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unlined bra",
      "content": "Unlined bra Unlined bras have thinner fabric cups with no extra padding. This creates a more natural silhouette and a comfy feel, so they make great everyday bras. Unlined bras also come in a variety of necklines and styles, so you can usually find one to compliment any outfit. Breast type: All breast sizes. Support: Lower support. Occasion: Everyday wear. Wear with: Casual ensembles. Pro tip: Keep in mind that the thin fabric of unlined bras doesn’t offer much nipple coverage, so if this bothers you, you might want to go for a padded option."

    {
      "title": "Bralette",
      "content": "Bralette Bralettes are a perfect middle-ground between style and comfort. They usually feature pretty designs with lots of lace and sheer fabrics, so they look super cute peeking out under a top or dress. They also don’t have built-in cups, extra padding, or underwire, which makes them very soft and comfortable to wear. Some clasp in the back like a regular bra, and others slip over your head. [24] X Research source Breast type: These bras offer less support, so they typically work best on small to medium breasts. However, there are some bralettes out there that are specifically designed to offer a bit more support to fuller-breasted people. Support: Lower support. Occasion: Everyday wear and some slightly dressier occasions. Wear with: Cute tops or dresses, especially lower-cut ones. Pro tip: Some bralettes have enough coverage to be worn on their own as tops for going out."

    {
      "title": "Seamless bra",
      "content": "Seamless bra Like bralettes, seamless bras have no structured cups, underwires, or extra padding. Unlike bralettes, however, seamless bras are made of sleek fabric with no lace or embellishments. They’re designed to be very comfortable and totally invisible under your clothes, even if you’re wearing a super form-fitting outfit. [25] X Research source Breast type: All breast sizes. Support: Regular to lower support. Occasion: Everyday wear. Wear this: Any ensemble. Pro tip: If you don’t want the outline of your bra to be visible underneath a form-fitting top or dress, opt for a seamless bra."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sports bra",
      "content": "Sports bra Sports bras are designed to provide support and comfort while you work out. They’re typically made of stretchy, moisture-wicking material, and they compress your breasts against your chest to minimize movement and bounce. [26] X Research source Breast type: All breast sizes. Support: High support. Occasion: Gym, outdoor workouts, exercise classes. Wear with: Your typical gym apparel. Pro tip: Different sports bras have different levels of support and compression. Opt for extra support for higher-impact activities (like HIIT workouts or running), and go for slightly lower support for low-impact exercise (like yoga class or walking). [27] X Research source"

      "title": "Maternity or nursing bra",
      "content": "Maternity or nursing bra Nursing bras have cups that detach and fold down, making it easy for a new mother to breastfeed her baby. These bras are typically made out of comfortable, stretchy material, and they don’t usually have underwire or extra padding. [28] X Research source Pro tip: Ohayon-Crosby recommends choosing a bra made out of natural fibers, rather than polyester or other synthetic options. “Natural fibers are less likely to irritate you, especially in the breast area,” Ohayon-Crosby explains. “I would say bamboo is a great option, and cottons in general, anything that comes from a natural base.” Ohayon-Crosby also suggests getting a nursing bra with a fun or pretty design to boost your confidence in the postpartum period. “There's some really cute bras out there now for breastfeeding, and also just for post pregnancy […]Having something that has a little lace or a color that you like brings confidence too. Don't think that you have to wear something that's ugly just because it's practical!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Padded bra",
      "content": "Padded bra A padded bra has cups that are made out of a thicker, padded material. This creates a smooth, rounded shape, and it also can add a bit more volume, depending on how thick the padding is. This actually isn’t a specific bra style, but rather a blanket term for several types of bras. For example, most push-up, demi, and T-shirt bras would fall under this umbrella."
    },
    {
      "title": "Underwire bra",
      "content": "Underwire bra Underwire bras have a wire stitched into the underside of the cups, which provides extra structure and support. Just like “padded bra”, the term “underwire bra” doesn’t refer to a specific style—it’s more of a general term that encompasses a wide range of styles. It could apply to any bra that features an underwire, including T-shirt, push-up, demi, and balconette bras."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wireless bra",
      "content": "Wireless bra A wireless bra is any bra that does not have an underwire. These bras come in a wide variety of styles as well, including T-shirt, demi, push-up, and more. Many people opt for wireless bras because they find underwire bras to be uncomfortable or poke-y. Although wireless bras tend to offer a little less supportive than regular underwire bras, many of them have very thick, sturdy bands, so you're still getting some support and lift.

      "title": "Make sure you know your correct bra size.",
      "content": "Make sure you know your correct bra size. No matter what style you choose, your bra won’t look right if you’re in the wrong size, so your first step should always be taking an accurate measurement. [30] X Research source Many lingerie stores will offer to measure you if you’re shopping in-person, but you can also measure yourself at home if you’d like. Here’s how: Stand up straight without a bra on, and use a tape measure to measure around your back and under your breasts, where the band of a bra would sit. Note down the measurement in inches. If it’s an even number, this is your band size. If it’s an odd number, round it up to the nearest inch. Next, put on your favorite regular bra (not a push-up bra). Measure around the fullest part of your chest and make note of that number. Subtract your bust measurement from your ribcage measurement. The difference in inches will tell you your cup size. 0 inches = AA, 1 inch =A, 2 inches = B, 3 inches = C, and so on. For example, if your ribcage measurement is 32 inches and your bust measurement is 34 inches, this is a difference of 2 inches. Your bra size would then be 32B. [31] X Research source"

      "title": "Try on lots of different styles and brands.",
      "content": "Try on lots of different styles and brands. “Once you know your size, ideally you should try on bras from a number of different brands because the cut, the fabric, and the style of each will make a difference in the fit,” explains Quinn. “The goal is to find one that feels supportive while being as comfortable as possible. The best bras should feel like you have nothing on,” she says."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take your breast size and shape into consideration.",
      "content": "Take your breast size and shape into consideration. Because bras can vary in the amount of support or coverage they offer, it’s a good idea to pick styles that will be comfortable to wear for your specific breast type. For example, if you have larger breasts, you may find that halter bras place too much weight on your neck and don’t offer enough support. Or, if you have smaller breasts, you might not like unlined bras because they don’t create much of a smooth, rounded shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "How can you tell if a bra is the wrong size?",
      "content": "How can you tell if a bra is the wrong size? There are a few telltale signs you can look out for to determine whether a bra is the wrong size for you. These include a band that keeps riding up in the back, straps that slip off your shoulders, straps that dig into your shoulders too deeply, and extra room or gaping in the cups. If your breasts are spilling out of the tops or sides of the cups, this is another clue that your bra is ill-fitting. If you notice any of these signs, it’s best to re-measure yourself or visit a bra store for some assistance. [32] X Research source"

      "content": "What type of bra is best for beginners? A simple, comfortable design is key for a first bra. [33] X Research source Bralettes or sports bras made out of stretchy fabric are great choices, since they’re comfy while also offering some support. If you’re looking for something a little more like a regular bra, a wireless T-shirt bra is a great basic option."

      "title": "What bra style is best for everyday wear?",
      "content": "What bra style is best for everyday wear? This truly depends on the person. Some people prefer to wear bralettes or sports bras on a daily basis because they’re so comfortable and low-key. Others opt for a T-shirt, demi, or balconette bra for a bit more structure and support. It’s all about choosing something that makes you feel comfortable and confident!"
