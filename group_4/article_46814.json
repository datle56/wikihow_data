If you plan to level items that are a far distance from each other, you may opt for a longer tube. Keep in mind the longer the tube, the more water you will need to use. [1] X Research source Most home improvement stores will have plastic tubing that can be cut to any length you want, typically for about 20 to 30 cents per foot."

      "content": "Attach one end of the tube to a bucket with a spigot as a reservoir (optional). You can use a tube without any other attachments for your water level if you wish, especially for short distances or quick measurements (if this sounds like you, skip this step and continue with step 3). However, if you plan on using a water level frequently and want a more durable tool, consider this step to create a water reservoir connected to your tube: [2] X Research source Drill a ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide hole in the side of a 1-gallon bucket near the bottom (you may need a bigger bucket to measure longer distances). Drill another ½ inch (1.c cm) hole through two 1.25 inch (3.2 cm) fender washers . Thread one washer onto a 5/16 inch (0.79 cm) hose-end brass fitting . Slide the fitting through the hole in the bucket from the inside so the washer sits against the inside wall of the bucket. Thread the second washer onto the fitting so it sits against the outside wall of the bucket. Seal the entire setup with silicone caulk to make a watertight seal."

      "content": "Attach 1 end of the tubing to the flat side of a stake or dowel. If you’re not using a bucket as a reservoir, put the stake in the ground or clamp the stake to the end of a work table. Use nails or tape to attach the tube to the stake, making sure the open end of the tube is facing directly upward. [3] X Research source Make sure there are no kinks or knots in the tube so the water can flow easily through the tube. If you’re using a bucket reservoir, just place your bucket on a flat surface. The weight of the water inside (once you fill it up) will hold the reservoir and tube in place."

      "content": "Mix 1-2 drops of food coloring in a bucket of water to make it easier to see. In a separate, clean bucket, add enough water to fully fill the inside of the length of the tube. Add a few drops of food coloring (preferably a dark color like blue or red) to dye the water. This will make it easier to precisely spot the level of the water in the tube. [4] X Research source Or, use antifreeze or windshield wiper fluid instead so the liquid is colored and easy to see. These liquids also don’t freeze as easily as water, making them ideal for leveling in cold weather."

      "content": "Hold the other end of the tubing and fill it with the dyed water. Keep this end at the same height as the end of the tube that’s attached to the stake, filling the tube until the water sits 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) below the attached end of the tube. [5] X Research source Use a funnel or container with a narrow spout to avoid spilling water while you fill the tube. If you’re using a bucket reservoir, pour the water into the bucket. Suck on the open end of the tube to begin siphoning the water out of the bucket and fill the tube. Check that there are no air bubbles in the water once you have filled the tube, as this can throw off the level measurement. If you see air bubbles, continue siphoning or pouring water through the tube until it is flowing freely out of the other end. This will flush out any air bubbles that are trapped in the tube. [6] X Research source If you’re not sure if there are air bubbles, hold the 2 open ends of the tube flush with each other vertically. The water level in both ends should be at the same height—if not, then air bubbles in the tube are throwing off the measurement. [7] X Research source"

The water level is often used to determine the level spot on 2 items that are at a distance from each other, such as posts or stakes in the ground. Make sure the items are in the ground or set up on a clamp attached to a work table so they are stable and firm.

[9] X Research source Or, if your tube is free at both ends, hold one end of the level against a post set up where you want to measure from. Make sure the open end of the tube faces upward. Place 2 nails on either side of the end of the tube to keep it in place. The nails should be just wide enough to catch the tube but not pinch it. You can also use a clamp on the top of the end of the tube if you do not want to put holes in the post or if the item is not made of wood and cannot be nailed into. If you’re using a bucket reservoir, set the bucket on the ground or an elevated surface. Instead of looking for the meniscus in the tube, you’ll use the water line inside the bucket as a reference."

The tool was made of 2 glass cylinders with a water-filled tube connecting them. When the water hit the same mark inside both cylinders, the surface being measured was even. Ancient peoples like the Egyptians and Romans also used water to level surfaces. For example, the Romans used large tanks of water to determine if the ground was level enough to build on."

      "title": "How do water levels work?",
      "content": "How do water levels work? Water levels work because a liquid will always seek its own level. In other words, the surface of any continuous body of water (or whichever liquid is inside your level) will always strive to stay at the same height all over, no matter the container’s size or shape. [17] X Research source Water levels just display this natural phenomenon inside a clear tube. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "How far can you use a water level? Technically, a water level will work and be accurate over any distance as long as the tube is long enough and you have enough water to fill it. However, super long distances aren’t always practical for a water level, and they’re best suited for short and medium distances. For most DIY projects, a water level tube that’s up to 100 feet (30.5 meters) long is the longest you can work with accurately and easily. [19] X Research source For longer distances, professional surveying tools, like a tripod-mounted builder’s level, are needed for easy and accurate measurements."

      "title": "What is a water level used for?",
      "content": "What is a water level used for? Water levels compare the relative height of 2 objects so you can adjust them to be equal with each other. They’re useful for projects like leveling fence posts, dock piers, floors, and foundations or walls for small structures like sheds and garages. Water levels are a popular tool among DIYers because they’re inexpensive to build yourself and straightforward to use."
