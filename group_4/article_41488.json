If your air fryer is already turned on or you’re already cooking with it, pressing the off button will clear all of the settings and turn off the fryer. Locate the button labeled “On/Off” and push it to stop cooking and turn off the unit. [1] X Research source Don’t operate your air fryer with wet hands so there’s no chance you could accidentally shock yourself or damage your fryer. Some air fryers may require you to push the button twice. If the fryer won’t turn off quickly, try holding the button down until it powers off."

If there are smaller items that need to be shaken halfway through cooking, remove the basket by the handle and give it a good rattle to shift the food items around before replacing it. Press the “Start/Pause” button again to continue cooking. [2] X Research source Allow the air fryer to cool for about 30 seconds before you open it so you’re not blasted with a wave of steam."

If your air fryer uses a dial as a timer and you’ve set a cooking time, ending the time you set will automatically stop it. Turn the dial until it reaches “0” and the air fryer will stop cooking.

      "content": "Pull the plug out of the wall outlet to cut off power to the air fryer. If you’re finished with your air fryer, you’re storing it, or you just want to kill the power to it immediately, unplugging it will stop the flow of electricity to your unit. Find the wall plug and grasp it at the end near the outlet to pull it out without damaging the cord. [4] X Research source If you just finished cooking with your air fryer, wait at least 15 minutes to let it cool down before you clean or store it. Avoid yanking or jerking on the cord or you could damage or fray it. If you plan to store your air fryer, slide the cord into the storage compartment so it’s neat and out of the way."

Place your air fryer on a flat, sturdy surface such as a countertop or table and plug it into a wall outlet that’s not too far away so the cord isn’t stretched out. Locate the power button and press it to turn on your unit. [5] X Research source You should see lights come on the unit to indicate that it’s receiving power and is turned on. Turning on the air fryer won’t make it start cooking."

Use the digital screen or turn the temperature dial to the cooking temperature that you want for the food that you’re cooking. Pull out the basket by the handle, put your food inside of it, then slide it back into place in the air fryer. For the best results, wait about 3 minutes to allow the air fryer to preheat so the food begins cooking at the right temperature as soon as you put it in. [6] X Research source Don’t overfill the basket or the food won’t cook evenly. A light will turn on to indicate that the air fryer is preheated. You don’t necessarily have to preheat your air fryer, but your food will cook more evenly if you do!"
