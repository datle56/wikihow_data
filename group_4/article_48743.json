      "content": "A tall guy makes a woman feel safe and secure. While short men are just as capable of looking after their partners, tall guys exude a sense of safety that many women appreciate. When a shorter woman is with a taller man, she might feel like she doesn’t have to worry about her own security or protection. [1] X Research source In modern times, though, many women aren’t looking for someone to “protect” them in daily life. Women are just as capable of defending themselves as men are, no matter how tall they might be!"

      "content": "On average, tall guys make $800 more per year than short guys. For both men and women alike, every inch they are taller is about a 1% increase in their salary. Experts aren’t exactly sure why this phenomenon happens, but women may be going after tall men because they subconsciously think they earn more.

      "title": "Since more tall men like short girls, the reverse is also true.",
      "content": "Since more tall men like short girls, the reverse is also true. It just makes sense: if all the tall men are constantly seeking out short women, then short women are going to start seeking out tall men, too. Guys tend to go after short girls because they make them feel taller, which can boost a guy’s confidence. Not all tall guys go after short girls, though. Have you ever seen a couple with a super tall guy and a super tall girl? Some studies suggest that we tend to seek out partners who are around the same height as us because we feel comfortable when our partner is similar to us."

      "content": "Tall guys tend to emanate a sense of machismo because of stereotypes. When you think of a stereotypical “man,” he’s probably bearded, tall, and has a deep voice. While not all men have these features, tall men tend to fall into the “masculine” category more often. And a lot of women are looking for a masculine man to complement their feminine ways. [3] X Research source Even if you aren’t the tallest guy around, being confident can help you give off an air of masculinity. When you hold your head high and walk into a room with confidence, you’ll automatically seem more manly."

      "content": "Most actors in movies and TV shows are taller than average. Think of your favorite male movie star: is he a tall guy? Most men on screen are taller than their romantic counterparts. Since this portrayal is in the background of our minds, women often go after tall men to emulate what they see on TV. [4] X Research source Even short guys in the media will use lifts or stand on boxes to appear taller on screen. Ever seen Tom Cruise in real life? He’s only 5’7”, but you’d never know it from his on-screen portrayals!"

      "content": "Society tends to expect women to find a guy who’s taller than them. While it’s absolutely fine if couples are varying in height, many women find it easier to date tall men. That way, the general population will accept them without question, and they won’t face any judgment. [5] X Research source Of course, there are lots of women who don’t care about what society thinks, and will just pursue the guy that they like the most."

      "content": "Traditionally masculine men make women feel girly. While not all women want to feel feminine in their daily lives, a lot of women like tall men because it emphasizes their own femininity. If you know a super girly girl who’s exclusively into tall guys, that might be the reason why. Again, this dives a little bit into a sexist stereotype—not all couples subscribe to traditional gender roles."

Many people believe that tall guys are better at cuddling because they can wrap their partners up with their bodies. That’s not to say that short guys can’t be great at cuddling , too! Height matters even less when you’re laying down or snuggling on the couch together."

[8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Tall guys generally have an easier time staying within a healthy weight range because tall people tend to be long and lean."
