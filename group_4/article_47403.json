      "title": "Start with YouTube.",
      "content": "Start with YouTube. YouTube is the largest and most popular video streaming site by far. It's also a good place to listen to popular music, including current hits. YouTube is also rife with homemade shows and series of all kinds. These usually have low production value but can be quite entertaining and informative. Movies and mainstream TV shows can be found on YouTube, but more popular and well-known properties usually get taken off the site for copyright reasons. There are, however, a whole lot of movies in the public domain (not under copyright anymore)."

      "title": "Check out hulu.com.",
      "content": "Check out hulu.com. Hulu is a mainstream video site like YouTube that bridges the gap between free content and professional content. It features a rotating menu of films and TV shows for free, plus a more expansive monthly pay service. Hulu tends to have a lot of free TV shows, but very few A-list shows. There's usually a mix of older and newer shows available. Hulu's free film selection is fairly small, but it's easy to search. Again, expect a mix of old and new titles."

      "title": "Spend some time at vimeo.com.",
      "content": "Spend some time at vimeo.com. This site is a direct competitor to YouTube. As with YouTube, all of Vimeo's content is free, but users can pay a fee to upgrade to higher-quality streaming and more space to upload their own videos. Vimeo features independent, professional-quality work, such as artistic short films, as a point of pride. It also features plenty of ordinary user-created content. TV shows and wide-release movies are rare on Vimeo, but obscure and small-budget projects abound."

      "content": "Know that you can still get in trouble for streaming illegal content. If you do not download a movie or show and instead stream it off a website, you are not legally responsible for the movie. However, putting up video for other people to stream is illegal if you do not own the copyright. It is also illegal to stream video for a public performance or to download any part of the video. [1] X Research source If you do not own the rights to something you are always, in some small way, legally at risk when streaming."

A Google search should reveal a few quickly. Commonly used sites include Project Free TV, Megashare, Putlocker, Sockshare, Dailymotion, and WatchCartoonOnline. A good template to find videos is: \"(movie or show) full (put either *movie* or *episode* here) free.\" For example, \"Game of Thrones full episodes free.\" More specific queries will get more specific responses, such as Game of Thrones full episode 3, season 2, free.\""

They are more like filing cabinets, holding links to every movie and episode they have access too. Once you click on a link from you internet search you'll go to a page with series of links, often with names like VidShare, PutLocker, MooShare, etc. These links have the actual videos in them, and are usually ranked by usability. There is often a \"score\" next to each video, telling you how good the quality is. Never click on a \"download\" link, or click links outside of this list, as they are usually spam."

      "content": "Consider foreign sites if you cannot find your video. There are many foreign streaming video sites that exist in a legal gray area thanks to lax or out-of-date copyright protection laws in countries such as China and Russia. Though a dubious choice at best, these sites sometimes feature streaming media (especially major movies) that can't be found for free anywhere else. Exercise caution when dealing with foreign sites. Malware and spyware are common. Never download anything from these sites, and be sure that your antivirus program is up to date. Expect extraordinarily slow load times. Unlike YouTube and other popular Western sites, most of these sites use outdated hardware that causes their videos to load slowly even on fast computers."
