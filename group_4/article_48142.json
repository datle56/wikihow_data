      "content": "The airline staff will have to gate-check your carry-on. Don’t worry—you won’t be charged for this, and you won’t have to get off the plane. The staff will take care of your carry-on for you by tagging it as checked baggage. [1] X Research source You’ll still have to go to a baggage-claim area when you arrive to pick up your checked item. If the airline staff put it in the plane’s belly or the galley, where food and drinks are kept, your luggage still has to get processed. Your baggage will go down a ramp when the plane lands and be collected. Airline staff will unload it and send it to the baggage-claim area."

      "content": "Airline staff will check your bag if it doesn’t fit. Airlines aren’t going to squeeze your bag into the overhead bin if it isn’t a good fit. Lots of flight companies are getting more and more strict about what they’ll take on board. [2] X Research source Airlines are really trying to save time. Now, a lot of them have special devices like scanners to check the dimensions of baggage right away. If your luggage doesn’t make the cut, the staff will tell you it’s too big, and they’ll check it. While it’d be nice, there’s really no way to get around an airline’s size restrictions. Whether you’re in coach or first-class, you have to follow the same rules."

      "content": "You can pick up your bag at the baggage claim. The airline staff will make sure it’s tagged so it goes to the right destination. Once you land, head over to the baggage claim area. Look for the carousel that matches your stub and wait until you see your item. [3] X Research source When you check in, you’ll be asked to make sure you’ve removed all straps, hooks, and other attachments on your baggage. You don’t want your luggage or anyone else’s to get damaged! Your luggage will go through processing machinery and get moved around a lot. Ask the airline staff exactly where your luggage is going. The baggage-claim area you need to go to may be connected to one of your layovers, like an airport you land in before your final stop. Keep an eye on your stub and don’t lose it! Your stub is your best bet for proving luggage is yours when you get to the baggage-claim area."

      "title": "Only if it fits below your seat.",
      "content": "Only if it fits below your seat. Otherwise, the airline staff will check it. Anything you want to put under your seat is called a “personal item,” but if it won’t actually fit there, then it’ll go in an overhead bin or you’ll have to pick it up at a baggage-claim area. [4] X Research source Airlines are more relaxed about carry-ons, so if your bag is too big to go under a seat, it still has a good chance of making it to the overhead bin. If there’s actually space, you can still bring your item. You might be charged extra if the airline staff needs to put your bag in the overhead bin. You might be able to take some items out of your bag, like snacks or electronics, and put them in your pockets to make it fit under the seat."

      "content": "You might have to if there’s limited space. Overhead bins fill up quickly, and other passengers can rush to stow their carry-ons in them. There’s just no guaranteeing you’ll get the overhead bin right above you or even nearby. Unfortunately, you can’t actually claim the overhead bin right above your seat, even if that’d be more convenient! There may be some passengers who don’t follow the rules and sneak in more than one bag. When they do that, they might fill up overhead bins closer to your seat."

      "content": "Be the first to board to get priority access to overhead bins. Many airlines give you a preferred status if you earn points by flying a lot, and that will let you skip to the front of the line. You can pay an extra one-time fee to purchase priority boarding for some flights. [5] X Research source You’ll still need to arrive on time for the best spot in line. Airline staff will let people through once boarding begins. If you’re late, a lot of travelers will board first and get to use the overhead bins."

      "content": "Yes, you can open it, just be careful! Wait until the fasten-seat-belt sign isn’t on and there isn’t any turbulence. Pay careful attention to what other passengers are putting in overhead bins and how they’re stowing their items. If people are packing everything in a jumbled way, all of that can fall out when you open the overhead bin later. Be kind to everyone else and stow your items with care. Other people want to open overhead bins, too, and it’s best to make sure they can do that safely. Wait until the plane isn’t turbulent and moving a lot to open an overhead bin. You can also ask someone else to give you a helping hand, too. That way, you’re less likely to hurt yourself."
