      "title": "Purchase a saliva test kit or get one from your doctor.",
      "content": "Purchase a saliva test kit or get one from your doctor. One of the easiest ways to test your cortisol levels at home is with a saliva test kit. Your doctor may provide a saliva test kit to take home with you, or you can purchase an over-the-counter saliva test kit online or from a drugstore. Commercial saliva test kits that test cortisol levels include the ZRT salivary test kit, the HealthConfirm Stress Hormone Plus kit, and the Everlywell Women’s Health Test. According to their manufacturers, these test kits are all processed by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certified labs."

      "title": "Take the test at the time(s) specified in your test instructions.",
      "content": "Take the test at the time(s) specified in your test instructions. Your cortisol levels change throughout the day, so your doctor or the manufacturer or your test kit may recommend collecting your sample at a specific time of the day or night. Some saliva tests are collected between 11 p.m. and midnight, when your cortisol levels are relatively low. [1] X Research source Other kits recommend testing first thing in the morning, while your cortisol levels are at their highest, and again in the late afternoon (around 4 p.m.) when your levels are lower. Check the test instructions carefully or ask your doctor when to collect the sample. Some test kits, such as the HealthConfirm Stress Hormone Plus kit, require you to collect samples at several times throughout the day."

      "title": "Avoid eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth before sampling.",
      "content": "Avoid eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth before sampling. Eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth 15-30 minutes before taking the sample could make the results less accurate. If you need to have a snack or brush your teeth, time it so that it won’t interfere with your scheduled time for collecting the sample. [2] X Research source Some test kits may instruct you to rinse your mouth with cool water before collecting your sample."

      "content": "Remove the cap from the saliva collection tube. Most cortisol saliva test kits consist of a tube containing a collection swab. Uncap the tube so that the swab is exposed, and be very careful not to touch the swab with your fingers. [3] X Research source Touching the swab could contaminate it and interfere with the test results."

      "title": "Insert the collection swab into your mouth to collect the saliva.",
      "content": "Insert the collection swab into your mouth to collect the saliva. Tip the tube so that the swab slides into your mouth. Roll it around in your mouth for about 2 minutes so it gets saturated with saliva. When you’re done, spit it back into the tube. [4] X Research source Don’t chew on the swab while it’s in your mouth. Some over-the-counter test kits require you to spit directly into the collection tube rather than using a swab."

Holding onto the sample for too long could affect the results. [7] X Research source If you aren’t able to send in the sample immediately, store it in the refrigerator until you’re able to do so.

      "content": "Avoid doing vigorous exercise before you start the test. Another way to test cortisol levels is to collect all your urine over a 24-hour period. Refrain from exercising for at least 24 hours before the test starts, since this could affect your cortisol levels.

Before you begin the test, ask your doctor if you need to temporarily discontinue any of your medications. If so, ask how long in advance you need to stop taking them.

Others may require you to hold your finger above the tube and allow the drops to fall in. Avoid squeezing too hard or wiping your fingertip on the side of the tube, since this could damage the blood cells. If you don’t manage to collect enough blood, get a fresh lancet and prick another spot on the same finger. You can also try using a different finger if you prefer. If your finger is still bleeding when you’re done, put on a bandaid and apply gentle pressure for 30 seconds."
