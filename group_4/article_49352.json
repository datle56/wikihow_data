Covalent compounds are written out as molecular formulas due to the fact that each compound is a distinct, separate molecule. [1] X Research source Covalent compounds have the first element written out completely while the second element is named with the suffix “ide.” For example, diphosphorus trisulfide has a chemical formula of P 2 S 3 . [2] X Research source Below are the prefixes for 1-10: 1: Mono- 2: Di- 3: Tri- 4: Tetra- 5: Penta- 6: Hexa- 7: Hepta- 8: Octa- 9: Nona- 10: Deca-"

The first element written is “first name” of the compound. Use the periodic table to find the chemical symbol for the element. [3] X Research source For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The first element is nitrogen and the chemical symbol for nitrogen is N."

Memorizing the Greek prefixes will help you to be able to write chemical formulas quickly without looking anything up. [4] X Research source For example: Dinitrogen has a the prefix “di-“ which means 2; therefore, there are 2 atoms of nitrogen present. Write dinitrogen as N 2 ."

      "title": "Write the chemical symbol for the second element.",
      "content": "Write the chemical symbol for the second element. The second element is the “last name” of the compound and will follow the first element. For covalent compounds, the element name will have a suffix of “-ide” instead of the normal ending of the element. [5] X Research source For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The second element is fluorine. Simply replace the “ide” ending with the actual element name. The chemical symbol for fluorine is F."

Using this prefix, write the number of atoms as a subscript to the right of the chemical symbol. [6] X Research source For example: Hexafluoride has a prefix of “hexa-“ which means 6; therefore, there are 6 atoms of fluorine present. Write hexafluoride as F 6 . The final chemical formula for dinitrogen hexafluoride is N 2 F 6 ."

The more examples you practice with, the easier it will be to decipher chemical formulas in the future and learn the language of chemistry. Sulfur dioxide: SO 2 Carbon tetrabromide: CBr 4 Diphosphorus pentoxide: P 2 O 5"

The first name is the cation (positive ion) while the last name is the anion (negative ion). Cations are written as the element name while anions are the element name ending with the suffix “ide.” [7] X Research source The chemical symbol for each element can be found on the periodic table. Unlike covalent compounds, Greek prefixes are not used to indicate the number of atoms of each element. You have to balance the charges of the elements to determine the atoms. For example: Lithium oxide is Li 2 O."

[8] X Research source There’s no good trick to remembering these, you just need to memorize them. There are only 3 cation polyatomic ions and they are ammonium (NH 4 + ), hydronium (H 3 + ), and mercury(I) (Hg 2 2+ ). They all have a +1 charge (though, technically, 2 mercury atoms are bonded together, which creates a 2+ charge, with each mercury cation containing a 1+ charge). The rest of the polyatomic ions have negative charges ranging from -1 to -4. Some common ones are carbonate (CO 3 2- ), sulfate (SO 4 2- ), nitrate (NO 3 - ), and chromate (CrO 4 2- )."

[9] X Research source There are a few rules to keep in mind that help you identify the charges: All group 1 elements at +1. All group 2 elements are +2. Transition elements will have Roman numerals in parentheses to indicate their charge. Silver is 1+, zinc is 2+, and aluminum is 3+. Group 17 elements are 1-. Group 16 elements are 2-. Group 15 elements are 3-. Remember, when working with polyatomic ions, use the charge of the complete polyatomic ion, rather than the individual ions."

Once you have identified the charge of each element (or polyatomic ion), you will use these charges to determine the number of atoms present of each element. You want the charge of the compound to equal zero so you will add atoms to balance the charges. [10] X Research source For example: Lithium Oxide. Lithium is a group 1 element and has a +1 charge. Oxygen is a group 16 element and has a 2- charge. In order to balance the 2- charge of the oxygen, you need 2 atoms of lithium; therefore, the chemical formula of lithium oxide is Li 2 O."

Do as many as you can until you feel comfortable writing chemical formulas. Calcium Nitride: Symbol for calcium is Ca and symbol of nitrogen is N. Ca is a group 2 element and has a charge of +2. Nitrogen is a group 15 element and has a charge of 3-. To balance this, you need 3 atoms of calcium (6+) and 2 atoms of nitrogen (6-): Ca 3 N 2 . Mercury(II) Phosphate: Symbol for Mercury is Hg and phosphate is the polyatomic ion PO 4 . Mercury has a 2+ charge as indicated by the Roman numeral II next to it. Phosphate has a 3- charge.
