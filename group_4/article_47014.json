      "content": "“Velcro cat” is a term describing an extra clingy cat. These cats are sometimes called “Velcro cats” because of the way they stick to their owners (like Velcro) and give much more affection and attention than the average cat. Whereas cats are often described as aloof and independent, Velcro cats follow their owners around and always want to be with them. [1] X Research source Still, while it often feels great to have a loving cat, keep in mind that there’s a difference between friendly behavior and over-the-top clinginess."

      "content": "Having a Velcro cat can be good, but it can also be an issue. If you want a loyal shadow and like your cat’s affectionate behavior , then odds are you’re a great match for each other! However, it’s a good idea to ensure your cat’s behavior is just affection and not caused by problems like health issues or lack of enrichment. And, if your cat’s clinginess worries you, it may be time to consult a vet. [2] X Research source Basically, a Velcro cat with no other health issues or stressors can be a fantastic companion! But, if their clinginess is associated with ongoing problems, it should be addressed. Velcro cats being \"good\" or \"bad\" can also be subjective. Some people might really want an affectionate, clingy cat, while others might not (depending on lifestyle or just personal preference)."

Do they try following you even when you’re going to the bathroom? Do you watch where you walk because you’re so used to tripping over them? Velcro cats form deep attachments and get a sense of security from being near you. [3] X Research source How do cats normally behave? A non-clingy cat may still seek you out but is usually comfortable being alone."

      "content": "They cuddle up with you constantly. Anytime you sit down, a Velcro cat will try to sit on your lap or curl up next to you, as close as possible. They may even demand to follow you to bed (and sleep there with you all night). Cuddling is a sign of trust and a strong bond between you and your cat, but a cat that does it nonstop might be overly attached. [4] X Research source How do cats normally behave? Non-clingy cats may cuddle sometimes but also feel comfortable sleeping in their own beds and sitting away from you."

They might even sit on whatever you’re using (like a book or laptop) or do things they aren’t supposed to do, like knock things over, bite objects, or scratch furniture because they know it’ll get your attention. [5] X Research source How do cats normally behave? Non-clingy cats can play by themselves while you’re busy and usually only try to get your attention by rubbing or headbutting when they’re hungry."

They may also nudge, paw, or rub up against you while demanding to be petted or picked up. While this behavior can express affection, it may also show your cat’s excessive need for attention if they do it all the time. [6] X Research source How do cats normally behave? Non-clingy cats may still lick, knead, or groom you to show affection—they just do it sometimes as opposed to constantly."

They may also have separation anxiety when you leave home, whether you’re going to work, school, or running errands. This can lead to acting out while you’re gone, scratching furniture, knocking things over, or doing other things they’re normally not supposed to do.

This isn’t a problem all Velcro cats have, but sometimes, you may notice that your cat will refuse to eat or drink unless you’re at home—or, in some cases, nearby in the same room. This can be because your cat feels safer when you’re there and needs your presence for security. [8] X Research source How do cats normally behave? Non-clingy cats are happy to eat whenever they’re hungry, even when you leave the room (or the house)."

      "content": "Cats may be clingy for several possible reasons. The first thing to rule out is a medical issue of some kind; since cats can’t tell you when they’re not feeling well, they might try communicating through “Velcro” behavior. However, if your vet has determined that there’s nothing medically wrong with your cat, here are a few other causes of clinginess: [9] X Research source They’re getting less attention than usual. If you aren’t spending as much time with your cat as you used to (whether because of schedule changes, work, or some other reason), your cat may just be trying to get that time with you again. Their routine has changed. Any significant transitions or changes to a cat’s routine—like you suddenly working from home or traveling and hiring a sitter for your cat—can cause them to get clingier around you. Their environment has changed. If there’s a new pet or person in the house, or you’ve made changes to the house itself (or even moved), your cat may get anxious and go to you for attention and comfort. They’re bored. If your cat doesn’t have enough enrichment around the house, they may get bored and go to you for entertainment instead. They were separated from their mother too early. Cats separated from their mothers early may develop separation anxiety and bond very strongly with you, which can interfere with their sense of security and independence."

It may give you peace of mind to eliminate any health issues, especially if you’ve noticed other signs that something might be wrong or suspect your cat is suffering from a particular ailment.

      "content": "Give your cat plenty of toys and enrichment. If your Velcro cat is bored or anxious, an enriching environment can help! Find ways to give them some extra physical and mental stimulation, such as toys that allow for independent play, food puzzles, or cat trees that give your cat a great view of the outside (and all the different critters there). [12] X Research source For example, you could try hiding treats around the house to send your Velcro kitty on a scavenger hunt or give them a toy filled with catnip that they can play around with. If you only have one cat, consider adopting a second to keep your kitty company (if you have the means). To keep your cat from following you from room to room, DeVoss says, \"make sure the cat has plenty of environmental enrichment in the rooms you do want them in. This includes quiet places to rest, multiple soft beds, high places to explore, scratching devices, toys, food puzzles, and treats. It’s challenging to tell a cat 'no'; you have to show it what you want it to do instead.\""

If they start scratching the door or meowing, don’t give in. Similarly, don’t make eye contact or pet them when they start meowing for attention. Keep doing what you’re doing, then interact with them once they calm down and stop meowing at you to provide positive reinforcement. [13] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source DeVoss doesn't recommend punishing your cat when it does something wrong: \"Cats need their owners to be reliable, dependent, and not scary.\" Instead, ignore the bad behavior until the cat learns to stop. Your cat may get even more clingy or persistent at first, but stick to your guns. Leave the area when they get clingy, or calmly place them in another area without extra interaction. In time, they’ll learn that bad behavior won’t get your attention anymore and will stop doing it. \"To effectively train a cat,\" says DeVoss, \"reward the behavior you want to see more of. This is called positive reinforcement. There are other species that respond better to positive punishment; cats are not among them.\""
