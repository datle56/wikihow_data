      "content": "Help your newborn get plenty of rest. Newborns need to get lots of rest to continue growing healthy and strong -- some can rest up to 16 hours a day. Though once your baby is three months or so old, he may be able to sleep for 6-8 hours at a time, in the beginning, your baby may only sleep for 2-3 hours at a time and should be woken up if they haven't been fed for 4 hours. Some babies have their days and nights confused when they are born. If your baby is more alert at night, try to limit nighttime stimulation by keeping the lights dim and your talking low, and be patient until your baby begins a normal sleeping cycle. Make sure you place your baby on their back to lower the risk of SIDS. You should alternate the position of your baby's head -- whether they're leaning to the left or the right -- to eliminate the \"soft spot\" that can appear on a baby's face if they spend too much time sleeping with his head in one position."

      "title": "Consider breastfeeding your newborn.",
      "content": "Consider breastfeeding your newborn. If you want to breastfeed your baby, then feeding your baby the first time you hold them after they are delivered is a great place to start. You should turn your baby's body toward you, so you are holding their chest toward yours. Touch their upper lip with your nipple and pull them to your breast when they open their mouth wide. Once they do this, their mouth should cover your nipple and as much of the areola as possible. Here are some things you should know about breastfeeding your baby: [1] X Research source If the baby is getting enough food, it will produce 6-8 wet diapers a day, along with steady bowel movements, alert when they're awake, and will steadily gain weight. Don't stress if your baby has a hard time feeding at first; it takes patience and practice. You can get help from a nurse or even a lactation consultant (who can be helpful before birth). Know that nursing shouldn't hurt. If the latch-on hurts, break the suction by placing your pinkie finger between your baby's gums and your breast and repeat the process. You should nurse about 8-12 times during the first 24 hours of the baby's birth. You don't have to stick to a strict schedule, but should nurse whenever your baby shows signs of hunger, from increased mouthing and activity to looking for your nipple. You should nurse at least every four hours, even gently waking your baby to feed her if necessary. Make sure to get comfortable. Feedings can take up to 40 minutes, so pick a cozy spot that can give you back support when you're nursing. Eat a healthy and well-balanced diet. Stay hydrated and be prepared to feel more hunger than normal and follow it. Limit your use of alcohol or caffeine because it will enter your breast milk."

While some studies show that breastfeeding may be healthier for your baby, you also have to consider your health, convenience, and a variety of other factors before making this decision. Formula feeding can make it easier to know how much you've fed your baby, to limit the amount of feedings, and to not have to restrict your diet. If you do choose to formula feed your baby, here are some things you need to know: [2] X Research source Make sure to follow the directions on the label of the formula when you prepare it. Sterilize new bottles. Feed your baby every two or three hours, or whenever they seem hungry. Discard any formula left out of the fridge for over an hour or any left unfinished by the baby. Store the formula in the fridge for no longer than 24 hours. You can carefully warm it because many babies prefer it that way, but it's not necessary. Hold your baby at a 45-degree angle to help them take in less air. Cradle them in a semi-upright position, offering plenty of head support. Tilt the bottle so the nipple and neck are filled with formula. Never prop it, which can cause the baby to choke."

Whatever method you use -- and you should decide before you bring home your baby -- you should be prepared to change your baby's diaper around 10 times a day. Here what you have to do: Get your supplies ready. You'll need a clean diaper, fasteners (if you use cloth diapers), diaper ointment (for rashes), a container of warm water, a clean washcloth, and some cotton balls or diaper wipes. Remove your baby's dirty diaper. If it's wet, place your baby on his back, remove the diaper, and use the water and washcloth to wipe your baby's genital area. Wipe girls from front to back to avoid UTIs. If you see a rash, place some ointment on it. Open the new diaper and slide it under your baby, gently lifting your baby's legs and feet. Move the front of the diaper up between your baby's legs, over the belly. Then, bring the adhesive strips around and snugly fasten them so the diaper is nice and secure. To avoid diaper rash, change your baby's diaper as soon as you notice that it's soiled. [3] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

      "title": "Bathe your newborn.",
      "content": "Bathe your newborn. Parenting specialist Jami Yaeger recommends \"giving your infant a sponge bath rather than a full bath if their umbilical cord is still attached.\" Once the umbilical cord falls off, you can start bathing your baby regularly, around two to three times a week. To do this the right way, you should gather your supplies, such as towels, soap, a clean diaper, etc, in advance, so that your baby isn't fussing around. Fill the tub or baby tub with about three inches of warm water before you begin the bath. Here's what you should do next: See if you can get help. You may feel a little scared or uncertain when you bathe your baby for the first time. If so, see if you can get your partner or a family member involved. That way, one person can hold the baby in the water while the other person bathes the baby. Undress your baby carefully. Then, slip your baby into the tub feet first, while using one of your hands to support the baby's neck and hands. Continue to pour warm cupfuls of water into the bath so your baby doesn't get cold. Use mild soap and use it sparingly so you don't get it into your baby's eyes. Wash your baby with your hand or with a washcloth, making sure to gently wash your baby from top to bottom and from front to back. Clean your baby's body, genitals, scalp, hair, and any dried mucus that has been collected on your baby's face. Rinse your baby with cupfuls of warm water. Wipe your baby clean with a washcloth. Lift the baby out of the tub, continuing to use one hand to support her neck and head. Be careful -- babies are slippery when wet. Wrap your baby in a hooded towel and pat your baby dry. After that, put a diaper and dress on your baby and kiss him so he has positive associations with being bathed."

You may be intimidated by how tiny and fragile your newborn seems, but with a few basic techniques, you should feel more confident about handling your baby in no time. Here are some things you should do: Wash or sanitize your hands before you handle your baby. Newborn babies are susceptible to infection because their immune systems aren't quite so strong yet. Make sure that your hands -- and the hands of anyone else who handles the baby -- are clean before you make contact. Support your baby's head and neck. To hold your baby, cradle his head whenever you carry him and support it when you're holding the baby upright or putting him down. Babies can't hold up their heads yet, so don't ever let a baby's head flop around. Avoid shaking your baby, whether you're playing or angry. This can cause bleeding in the brain, which can lead to death. Don't try to wake up your baby by shaking it, either -- instead, tickle its feet or give it another gentle touch. Learn to swaddle your baby. This is a great way to keep your baby feeling secure before he reaches the two-month mark."

      "content": "Hold your newborn. You have to make sure to give your baby as much head and neck support as possible when you hold it. You should let the baby's head rest inside your inner elbow, with the length of his body resting on your forearm. His outer hip and upper legs should rest with your hand, with its inside arm resting over his chest and abdomen. Hold the baby snugly and give your baby all of your attention. [4] X Research source You can also hold the baby by pacing his tummy on your upper chest while using the same side hand to hold his body while using the opposite hand to support the baby's head from the back. If your baby has older siblings or cousins or is around people unfamiliar with holding babies, carefully instruct them on how to hold the baby and make sure they are sitting down with a knowing adult nearby to keep the baby safe."

Since your baby spends so much of their time on their back, it's important to also give your baby time to stay on their tummy so that they develop both mentally and physically and strengthen their arms, head, and neck. Some doctors say babies should get 15-20 minutes of tummy time a day, while others say that you should just place your baby on his tummy for 5 minutes during different parts of the day as he develops. You can start with tummy time as soon as a week after the baby is born, once the umbilical cord falls off. To make tummy time fun, get level with your baby. Make eye contact, tickle your baby, and play around. Tummy time is hard work, and some babies will be resistant to it. Don't be surprised -- or give up -- if this happens."

Like any other wound, it ends up healing, scabbing, and going away.\" It will change in color from a yellowish green to brown and black as it dries and falls off on its own. Yaeger also suggests \"keeping an eye out for signs of infection. It's natural to see a bit of dried blood or a little bit of crust near the stump; however, you should see a doctor immediately if the stump produces a smelly discharge or yellowish pus, continues to bleed, or is swollen and red.\" Here are some more tips on how you can care for your baby's umbilical cord: [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep them clean. Clean them with plain water and dry them with a clean and absorbent cloth. Make sure to wash your hands before you handle them. Stick to giving your baby sponge baths until they fall off.

Try feeding them. If that doesn't work, try adding a layer of clothing if it's cold out or removing a layer if it's hot. Sometimes, your baby just wants to be held or is experiencing too much stimulation. As you get to know your newborn, you'll become better at finding what's wrong. [8] X Research source Your baby also may just need to be burped. Rocking them gently and singing or humming a lullaby to them will help. Give them a pacifier if that doesn't work.

Try taking them for a walk to the park once a day, talking to them, putting pictures in the room where they spend most of their time, listening to music, or taking them in the car. Remember that your baby is just a baby and is not ready for rough play; do not roughhouse or shake your baby and be as gentle as possible instead. In the beginning, the most important thing you can do is to bond with your baby. This means you should stroke your baby, cradle your baby, give the baby some skin-to-skin contact, or even consider giving your baby an infant massage. [9] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. Babies love vocal sounds, and it's never too early to start talking, babbling, singing, or cooing with your baby. Play some music for the baby while you're bonding, or play with toys that make noise, such as rattles or mobiles. Some babies are more sensitive to touch and light than others, so if your baby doesn't seem to be responding well to your attempts at bonding, then you can take it easier with the noise and lights until your baby gets used to it."

Many first newborn visits occur just 1-3 days after you and your baby are discharged from the hospital. After that, each doctor's program will vary slightly, but you should generally take your newborn to the doctor at least two weeks to a month after birth, after the second month, and then every other month or so.

You'll need to be prepared to take your baby on car rides before the baby is born since you'll need a way to get the baby home from the hospital.

[12] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. Though you may not need to spend a lot of time in the car with your newborn, some mothers find that taking the baby for a ride can help put him or her to sleep. You should also get an infant seat for your baby. These seats are there to help your young baby sit up, not to help your baby be secured in a car. In this kind of seat, the base should have nonskid surfacing and should be wider than the seat, and it should have a secure locking mechanism, along with washable fabric. Never place your baby in the seat on an elevated surface that the baby can fall from. As for child safety seats, make sure the seat meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 and that it fits your child. Infants and toddlers should sit in a rear-facing seat until they are at least 2 years old."
