      "title": "Why did the chicken cross the road? Because The Knickerbocker said so.",
      "content": "Why did the chicken cross the road? Because The Knickerbocker said so. The O.G. “Why did the chicken cross the road?” joke first appeared in 1847 in The Knickerbocker , a New York-based magazine. But before you think, “Wow, people really had no sense of humor back then,” we have to say, in The Knickerbocker ’s defense, that it was presented as a sort of “anti-joke”: a joke with a punchline intended to be, well, supremely lame. (And therefore…actually sort of funny, somehow? We’ll let you be the judge.) To quote The Knickerbocker : “There are ‘quips and quillets’ which seem actual conundrums, but yet are none. Of such is this: ‘Why does a chicken cross the street?’... ‘Because it wants to get on the other side!’” [2] X Research source The joke became one of the first national jokes thanks to its popular use in minstrel shows—a type of American theater that originated in the 19th century. They typically involved mostly white actors wearing blackface with the intent of portraying racial stereotypes of African Americans. (Basically, the origins of the chicken joke are as disappointing as the joke itself.)"

      "content": "Anti-humor relies on the lack of an expected punchline for its humor. Anti-jokes (like the original “Why did the chicken cross the road?”) rely on you expecting a funny punchline, so when the teller subverts that expectation by offering a punchline that actually makes sense or is anti-climactic (like “to get to the other side”), it’s startling—so startling, you might actually chuckle at the absurdity of it all. So, paradoxically, anti-jokes are funny…kind of…we guess? [3] X Research source Some anti-jokes make use of established joke tropes—like “walking into a bar”—to signal to the listener that a funny answer is coming, only to turn the joke on its head with an anti-climactic punchline."
