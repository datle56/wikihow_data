      "content": "Set up an open area with furniture, pillows, mats, and/or paper sheets. If you’re playing the Floor Is Lava game indoors, usually, the furniture is what players stand on to avoid the ‘lava’ (the floor). However, if you don’t want your players standing on and jumping over furniture, create a play area by placing pillows, couch cushions, or sheets of paper on the floor. [1] X Research source Make sure there are more safe spaces from the lava than there are players so people can move around during the game without running into each other. If you’re going to play outdoors , use sheets of newspaper or foam mats to stand in for the furniture used in the indoor version of the game."

      "content": "Explain to players that the floor is lava and they can’t touch it. Lay out the ground rules so everyone knows how to play. The main rule is that once the game begins, the floor is lava! Players who are still on the floor after the first five or ten seconds are “killed” by the lava and have to wait for the next round or game. [2] X Research source The rest of the gameplay depends on whether you’re playing an elimination-style game or an objective-based game. In an elimination-style game, players regularly switch places as safe spaces to stand on are slowly eliminated until one person remains—they win. In an objective-style game, players or teams must follow a specific path to escape the lava area and reach a destination. It may be timed or simply about finishing the course."

      "content": "In an elimination-style game, have players switch spaces when the music stops. Treat it like musical chairs and play music while players stand still on their safe spot. Stop the music and give everyone five to ten seconds to find a new safe place without touching the “lava” (the floor). Eliminate safe spots as the game progresses to make it harder. Keep going until only one player remains. Decide ahead of time if two players can stand on the same spot—or if that will make it sink into the lava!"

Or, have them make a DIY path by placing sheets of newspaper on the ground, jumping to them, and picking up the old ones to continue the path. You can even split players into teams to see who completes the course the fastest while surviving the lava. [4] X Research source"

If you’re playing with a classroom, a youth group, a scout troop, or another group in an educational context, ask players to reflect in pairs after the game.

Once the area is clear, set the board game ’s 25 colored foam lava “stones” around the room. Players jump onto these stones during the game. [6] X Research source Place the same colored stones far apart from each other. That way, players can easily jump to different colored stones—since the color of the stone they’re on matters during gameplay. Some of the stone tiles have question mark symbols on them (“?”).

If there are only two tiles left of different colors, keep spinning the spinner until it lands on one of the colors. The player standing on that color tile is the winner. Alternatively, have both players do challenge cards until one falls into the lava and the other wins.

[14] X Research source Another option is to go to an indoor play gym that allows room rentals.

Then, the “it” randomly points to a corner with their eyes closed and the people standing there are out. The last player standing wins."

They try to cross the pool while the shark tries to tag them and make them into sharks. The last surviving minnow wins—and they’re the shark in the next round."
