      "content": "Select the appropriate setting. There are several aperture and filter options that can be used for specific goals in an eye examination. The most common setting used is the Medium light source, because most exams are done in a darkened room when the patient has not been treated with mydriatic (dilating) eye drops. Ophthalmoscopes may differ in which settings are available, but some possibilities are: [3] X Research source Small light – for when the pupil is very constricted, like in a bright room Large light – for highly dilated pupils, like when treated with mydriatic drops Half light – when part of the cornea is obscured, like with a cataract, to direct light into the clear part of the eye Red free light – to better visualize the blood vessels and any problems with the vessels Slit – to check for irregularities in contour Blue light – to use after fluorescein staining to check for abrasions Grid – to measure distances"

      "content": "Focus the instrument using the focusing wheel. Generally, you should focus your ophthalmoscope to the “0” setting, which is the baseline. Be aware that focusing towards the positive numbers – sometimes marked on the instrument in green – focuses on things closer to you, and focusing towards the negative numbers – sometimes in red – focuses on things farther from you. [4] X Research source For the PanOptic ophthalmoscope, focus using the focusing wheel on a point about 10-15 feet away from you."

[5] X Research source Tell them to remove their glasses or contacts if they’re wearing any. Explain what an ophthalmoscope is and warn the patient about the brightness of the light emitted. If you will be dilating the pupil with mydriatic drops, explain the procedure and effects, including that they should have someone drive them home after. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source You don’t have to go into much detail about the eye exam. Say something like, “I’m going to use this instrument to look into the back of your eye. It will be a bright light, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable.”"

      "content": "Apply mydriatic drops, if necessary. Dilating the pupils provides easier and more thorough visualization of the eye structures, and is used often in optometrists’ offices. Have the patient tilt their head back. Gently pull out their lower lid, and drop the appropriate number of drops into the eye. Have your patient close their eye for about 2 minutes, and press on the corner of their eye where it meets the nose. Do this in both eyes. [8] X Research source Tropicamide 0.5% is most commonly used, applying 1-2 drops about 15-20 minutes before your exam. Other agents used are Cyclopentolate 1%, Atropine 1% solution, Homatropine 2%, and Phenylephrine 2.5% or 10% solution. All of these drops are contraindicated in patients with a head injury that is being monitored. [9] X Research source Review a list of your patient’s medications to ensure they have no interactions with the eye drops. Darker eyes may be less sensitive to drops and require more than lighter-hued eyes.

Wedge the ophthalmoscope against your right cheek with your right hand – when you move, your head, hand, and scope should move as one. Place the heel of your left hand firmly on the patient’s forehead and spread your fingers out, providing stability. Position your left thumb gently over their right eye and lift the right eyelid open. [12] X Research source Use your right hand and right eye to look at your patient’s right eye, and vice versa. When using a PanOptic, steady the patient’s head as usual and approach them from 6 inches away at a 15-20° angle. Do not worry about getting too close to the patient during this exam. You must be as close as possible to perform a detailed examination."

Shine the light into the patient’s right eye at about 15° from the center of the eye, and watch for the pupil to shrink. Then check to see if there is a red reflex. [14] X Research source The red reflex is the reddish glint of light in the eye’s pupil caused by reflection of light off the retina, like what you see in a cat's eye in the dark. Absence of a red reflex can mean there is a problem with the eye. As you look through the scope for the red reflex, you may need to adjust focus a bit depending on your own eyesight."

Stop moving forward when your forehead comes into contact with your left thumb. Following the red reflex should direct you to being able to visualize the retina. [15] X Research source You may need to focus your scope to bring features of the eye into focus. Use your forefinger to turn the lens dial, as needed."

The macula is responsible for central, focused vision, so visual acuity tests often indicate healthy or dysfunctional macula.
