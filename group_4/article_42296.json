      "title": "In general, you can alter a dress 1 to 2 sizes.",
      "content": "In general, you can alter a dress 1 to 2 sizes. It’s usually easier to make a dress smaller than it is to make one larger, but both can be done. If you need your dress tailored more than a few sizes, it’s probably best to bring it to a professional. [1] X Research source Dresses made out of cotton and linen are very easy to tailor, while chiffon, organza, and jersey fabrics can be harder to work with. Vintage clothes usually have a larger fit. So, if you're working with a vintage dress, focus your changes on making it smaller, especially on the shoulders."

      "title": "Pin the dress so it fits your body.",
      "content": "Pin the dress so it fits your body. Put your dress on and hold it tightly against your body (as tight as you want it to fit at the end of your tailoring). Use sewing pins to hold the fabric in place, going from the arm hole down to the bottom hem on each side of the dress. When you’re done, carefully take the dress off without disturbing the pins.

      "title": "Flip the dress inside out, then mark the inside.",
      "content": "Flip the dress inside out, then mark the inside. Turn the dress inside out so you can see the seams. Grab a marker and draw a straight line down both sides of the dress following the sewing pins. When you’ve drawn your line, you can take the pins out. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Sew a straight stitch down both side seams of the dress.",
      "content": "Sew a straight stitch down both side seams of the dress. Take your dress over to your sewing machine and load it with thread that matches your dress color. Use a straight stitch to sew down the lines you made on the inside of your dress. When you’re done, flip your dress right side out and try on your new snug garment! If the side seams are too bulky, use scissors to cut off the excess fabric from the inside of the dress. [4] X Research source Some dresses, like formal ones, should be opened at the seams in order to take them in with a nice finish."

      "content": "Pin your dress to see how much you need to take in. Put your dress on and pinch the waist on both sides to see how much you want to take in. Use safety pins to hold the fabric in place while you carefully take the dress off. [5] X Research source If you only want to take the dress in temporarily, you can pin it and just make some small stitches by hand."

      "content": "Draw a triangle shape on the inside of the waist. Turn your dress inside out and draw a triangular shape on both sides of the waist with the point facing downwards.

Grab a piece of fabric that matches the color of your dress, then cut out a triangular section that lines up with the opening in the seams. Add about 1 in (2.5 cm) around the entire triangle for a seam allowance as you cut. [9] X Research source"

Slide a safety pin into the fabric, bunching it up so it stays gathered. Close the safety pin and turn the dress right side out for an instantly form-fitting dress. [11] X Research source If the waist of your dress is too big, you can use the same bunching method on either side of your waist."
