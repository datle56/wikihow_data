    {
      "title": "Put your checker in the center column if you're first.",
      "content": "Put your checker in the center column if you're first. Your Connect 4 board has 7 columns, which means there's one exactly in the center. Because a checker in the center column allows you to make a Connect 4 in all possible directions, this is the best possible first move. [1] X Research source When you're playing a little kid or someone who's never played before, be nice and let them make the first move. You'll probably still win, but this gives them a bit of an edge."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play your checker on top of your opponent's if you're second.",
      "content": "Play your checker on top of your opponent's if you're second. The first player definitely has an advantage in Connect 4, but that doesn't mean you automatically lose if you're second. By putting your checker on top of your opponent's checker in the same column, you can guarantee at least a draw. This strategy works best if your opponent drops their first checker in the center column. If they put it somewhere else, take the center column to gain the upper hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on controlling the center column.",
      "content": "Focus on controlling the center column. Any horizontal or diagonal series of 4 checkers must include a checker in the center column. Put as many of your checkers as possible in the center column and you have a much greater chance of winning. [2] X Research source For example, if you put your first checker in the center column and your opponent puts their first checker on top of yours, put your second checker in the center column as well. If you're the second player and you can't control the center column, gain control of one of the columns on either side of it and you'll guarantee at least a draw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Play offensively rather than defensively whenever you can.",
      "content": "Play offensively rather than defensively whenever you can. Focus on making connections by placing your checkers close together in the center of the board. Block your opponent when you have to, but try not to get too caught up in defense. [3] X Research source As the second player, it's going to be tough for you to build much of an offense. But you still have a chance if the first player misses that key first move or makes some other mistake. If you're having trouble building up much of an offense, you could also try distracting your opponent or making comments to try to get in their head and get them flustered so they make a mistake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Anticipate your opponent's reaction to any potential move.",
      "content": "Anticipate your opponent's reaction to any potential move. When you're contemplating where to put your checker, look at your opponent's checkers. If you put your checker where you're thinking, what will they do? How will that affect your options for your next move? [4] X Research source Because Connect 4 requires this sort of thinking, it helps build your strategy skills for more complicated games, such as chess . This is one of the things that makes this a great game to play with little kids. If you're older and want to help them, talk them through their moves or ask them questions, such as, \"What do you think I'm going to do if you put your checker there?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out your opponent's options after every move they make.",
      "content": "Figure out your opponent's options after every move they make. Why did your opponent put their checker where they did? Were they blocking you or working on an offensive strategy? How does their move potentially help them? Asking these questions helps you get into your opponent's mind and understand their strategy. [5] X Research source For example, you might place your checker in the center column as the first move. Then, your opponent drops their checker directly on top of yours. This means they're trying to get as many checkers in the center column as possible. It also helps to put yourself in your opponent's position. If their checkers were yours, what would your strategy be? What would you do to win the game?"

      "title": "Force your opponent to respond to 3-checker threats to take momentum.",
      "content": "Force your opponent to respond to 3-checker threats to take momentum. Any Connect 4 strategy requires multiple moves to build. Try to get 3 checkers in a row anywhere—even if they're not building up to anything else. They'll have to block you immediately, which will pull them out of offense mode. Then you have the opportunity to strike. [6] X Research source For example, you might drop a checker next to 2 you've already got to put 3 in a row horizontally. If it's cut off on one side, it's easy for your opponent to block you—but having to do that takes them away from their offensive strategy for at least one move."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block your opponent's checkers when they have 2 in a row.",
      "content": "Block your opponent's checkers when they have 2 in a row. Putting one of your checkers next to your opponent's series of 2 means now they can only make a series of 4 in one direction. If you cut them off, they can't get 3 in a row and potentially trap you. [7] X Research source For example, if your opponent has 2 checkers lined up on the bottom row, go ahead and drop a checker on either end to close off at least one of their opportunities to build a threat. Then, if they put a third checker on the other side, you can easily block it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to get 3 checkers in a row with open spaces on either end.",
      "content": "Try to get 3 checkers in a row with open spaces on either end. This is pretty hard to do if you're playing against a good player. But if you can pull it off, you've won the game! Controlling the center column is really important for building these kinds of opportunities. [8] X Research source For example, if you drop a checker down one of the end columns, you're cutting off any opportunity to use this strategy. This is the main reason the end columns are the worst places to drop your checkers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Force your opponent to put a checker under a game-winning space.",
      "content": "Force your opponent to put a checker under a game-winning space. As your game progresses, be on the lookout for a spot where both you and your opponent have a 3-checker line ending up at the same space. Whoever puts a checker in that space wins the game, which means you don't want to put a checker directly under it. But if you build up another threat that uses the space directly under the game-winning space, your opponent has no choice but to block you. [9] X Research source For example, you might build up a diagonal 3 that would use the space under the game-winning space to give you 4 in a row. Diagonals are great because they're really versatile and not as easy to see as horizontals or verticals."

    {
      "title": "Create a \"7\" with your checkers for an unbeatable Connect 4 strategy.",
      "content": "Create a \"7\" with your checkers for an unbeatable Connect 4 strategy. This is a strategy that you have to play out over multiple moves—while also watching your opponent's moves and blocking them where you need to. It's not at all easy to get this in place, but once you do, you've essentially won. [10] X Research source So, for example, you might have 3 checkers going up in a diagonal, and then at the top of the diagonal, you have 3 checkers horizontally. That gives you a diagonal and horizontal threat. With a 7 anywhere on the board (and turned in any direction), it's only a matter of time before your opponent is trapped in a situation where you have two game-winning spaces and they can only block one of them."
