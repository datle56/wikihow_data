      "content": "Heartbreak or unrequited love On a deeper level, the 🥀 emoji can symbolize a relationship that didn’t work out, a sad breakup, or an unrequited love that never came to be (what a poetic emoji!). [3] X Research source This is especially likely if you see this emoji from a girl or guy you knew was seeing someone. If you want to post something about your breakup or lost love without giving away too many details, add the 🥀 emoji to show your general feelings. “Not everything is meant to last 🥀” “I should have told him sooner, but now it’s too late 🥀”"

      "content": "Death and loss, decay, endings, or the passing of time Flowers live and die, just like all other plants and creatures. Use the 🥀 emoji to represent the cycle of life or the end of an era, whether you’re posting about the death of a loved one, the changing of the seasons, or the closing of a chapter in your life. Of course, it can also represent literal dead plants you see in your garden, too. [5] X Research source “RIP Grandpa 🥀😢 You’ll be with us forever! ❤️” “Winter is coming 🥀🥶 I need to move somewhere warmer…” “Saw a dying rose bush today 🥀 Someone needs to water that thing soon!”"

      "title": "TikTokers replaced the broken heart 💔 emoji with the 🥀emoji.",
      "content": "TikTokers replaced the broken heart 💔 emoji with the 🥀emoji. In February 2025, creator @ybgtway posted this video including the words “💔 lowkey starting to become too mainstream. I might just start using 🥀.” The video (and others like it) jokingly pointed out that the 💔 emoji was overused and seemed too corny or performative. Soon after, other creators got in on the joke and started posting their own similar videos, with some lightheartedly pointing blame at certain groups or fandoms for overusing the 💔 emoji. [6] X Research source For example: Creator @zane2low posted a similar video saying “💔 has gone mainstream and Dandy's World players have been using it,” poking fun at people who play the Roblox game Dandy’s World . A few days later, @dariusthegoat5 shared a video saying “Attention everyone! 💔 has officially become mainstream… We will now be using 🥀🥀.” TikTok users also point to old clips of the late rapper XXXTentacion, saying that fans use emojis like 💔 and 🥀 too often, making the emojis seem performative or mainstream."

      "content": "Emojis going “mainstream” became a meme template on TikTok. As “news” of the switch from 💔 to 🥀 spread online, TikTokers began adding more emoji options to use in case the latest one became too cringe or overused. For example, creator @p4st3l_p0sh posted a video saying “We are now moving to 🥀 / And if that fails we move to 🪫 / And worst case scenario 🍂,” listing the low battery 🪫 and fallen leaves 🍂 emojis as backups to the 🥀 emoji in case it goes out of fashion.

      "content": "Wilted flowers symbolize time passing, the fading of beauty, and sadness. Spiritually, a wilting or dying flower represents impermanence—nobody stays young and beautiful forever and nobody is immune from the forward march of time. In art and literature, wilting flowers can also represent feelings of nostalgia or melancholy, hinting at a past that was more joyous or energetic. [8] X Research source Wilting flowers can also be a spiritual reminder to be more present and show gratitude for what you have now."
