      "content": "Refine the beef tallow if you’re making it yourself. To make your own beef tallow , cut beef fat into 1 in (2.5 cm) pieces and pass it through a meat grinder or food processor . Render (or melt) the fat over low heat in a slow cooker or over a double boiler , then strain it through a cheesecloth and refrigerate it overnight. After it sets up, scrape any impurities off the bottom. Repeat as needed until the tallow is solid white (or close to white), with no flecks when the tallow solid and no cloudiness when it’s rendered. This process will remove any water and impurities from the tallow, which will help it last longer in storage. If you don’t want to render the beef tallow yourself, professional soap maker Kia Paylor says you can “buy it pre-rendered.”"

      "title": "Pour the tallow into an airtight glass jar.",
      "content": "Pour the tallow into an airtight glass jar. If the tallow is solid, melt it over low heat in a slow cooker or double boiler . Then, carefully pour it into an airtight container like a mason jar —use a funnel if you need to. Seal it with a fresh lid and ring to prevent contamination. [1] X Research source Sealing the tallow in an airtight container will help prevent oxidation, significantly extending the tallow’s shelf life. You can also vacuum seal the mason jar to secure the seal and improve the shelf life even more. If you buy pre-rendered beef tallow , it should already be in an airtight jar. If it isn’t, scoop it out of its container and melt it as described above, then pour it into an airtight container. Label the jar with the month and date so you’ll know when to replace it."

      "title": "Keep the tallow in a cool, dark place at room temperature.",
      "content": "Keep the tallow in a cool, dark place at room temperature. The tallow will be easiest to scoop out of the jar when it’s at room temperature, so a lot of people prefer to store it that way. Tallow is shelf-stable, so it will keep for a long time, but to keep it from spoiling, store it out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources like your stove or a furnace. [2] X Research source How long does beef tallow last at room temperature? With proper storage and handling, beef tallow can last up to a year at room temperature."

      "title": "Place the jar of tallow in the fridge to extend its shelf life.",
      "content": "Place the jar of tallow in the fridge to extend its shelf life. Putting tallow in the fridge will cause it to harden, but it will also help it last longer. This is a good option if you’ve already opened a jar of tallow and want to keep the remainder. To keep the tallow from picking up any smells from other food in the freezer, place a container of baking soda near the jar of tallow to absorb odors. [3] X Research source How long does beef tallow last in the fridge? When stored properly, beef tallow will stay good for up to 18 months in the fridge."

      "title": "Freeze the tallow in blocks or cubes to store it long-term.",
      "content": "Freeze the tallow in blocks or cubes to store it long-term. Freezing the tallow will give it the longest shelf life, but it can be a little hard to work with if it’s in a jar. Instead, pour the rendered tallow into a deep baking pan lined with parchment paper so it sets up in a block, or pour it into an ice cube tray, then pop the cubes into a freezer bag. [4] X Research source Hold your knife under warm running water to make it easier to slice tallow that’s frozen into a block. To thaw a whole portion of beef tallow, put it in the fridge overnight. Don’t thaw it at room temperature or in the microwave—this could allow bacteria to grow that could spoil the tallow. [5] X Research source If the texture of the tallow changes after freezing it, try gently warming it doubler boiler before you use it. How long does beef tallow last in the freezer? When frozen, beef tallow can last for up to 2 years."

      "content": "Scoop or cut the tallow with clean utensils to avoid contamination. Don’t use the same spoon you’re cooking with to scoop tallow out of the jar. You could introduce bacteria into the container that will cause the beef tallow to spoil and turn rancid. And if you’re slicing frozen beef tallow, always use a clean knife—the chance of bacteria growing in the freezer is fairly low, but it’s better to err on the safe side here. If you’re using beef tallow as a moisturizer, use a clean spoon or spatula to dip it out of the container—don’t use your fingers to scoop it out or it could become contaminated."

      "title": "Light, heat, moisture, and air can all impact beef tallow’s shelf life.",
      "content": "Light, heat, moisture, and air can all impact beef tallow’s shelf life. Light and heat will break down the fat particles in the tallow, which will cause it to spoil. Leaving the tallow exposed to air will cause it to oxidize, and introducing moisture can allow bacteria to grow. [6] X Research source Here’s what to know to keep your beef tallow fresh: Temperature: Keep the tallow below 72 °F (22 °C) and away from heat sources like an oven, furnace, or heating vent. [7] X Research source Light: Store the tallow out of direct sunlight to keep the oil from breaking down. Oxidation: Each time you use the tallow, re-seal the airtight container to prevent oxidation. Moisture: If you’re making your own tallow, refine it until there’s no cloudy water left in the fat when it’s rendered. Also, take care not to introduce moisture into the container when you’re storing the tallow. Bacteria: Use clean utensils to scoop or cut the tallow to prevent contamination. How well it was prepared: Rushing the process could mean that bits of meat or moisture are left behind in the tallow, which could cause it to spoil faster."

      "content": "Watch for changes in the tallow’s scent, appearance, or texture. Beef tallow should have a mild, slightly beefy scent, a creamy white or off-white color, and a smooth texture at room temperature. If you notice a sour or soapy smell, discoloration, visible mold, or changes to the texture, the tallow has probably spoiled. [8] X Research source If the beef tallow goes rancid, throw it out. It could make you sick if you use it for cooking, and if you use spoiled tallow as a moisturizer, the bacterial growth could potentially lead to a skin infection. [9] X Research source"

Beef tallow french fries are a popular option—you can also use it to sear steaks, saute vegetables, or create savory pastries. [10] X Research source Beef tallow has been trending in beauty circles as a viral all-natural moisturizer—it may provide relief for some people with sensitive or dry skin. [11] X Research source Paylor says, “Tallow can replace palm oil in soap recipes, helping the soap harden and last longer. It gives soap a firmer texture. Mix it with olive oil for moisture and coconut oil for lather.” Beef tallow can also be used in homemade candles. [12] X Research source You can also use beef tallow to season cast iron, condition wood cutting boards or furniture, lubricate metal, condition leather, or as a deep conditioner for hair.
