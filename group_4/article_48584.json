If you want to camouflage the whipstitch, use thread in a coordinating color. If you want the whipstitch to stand out, use thread of a contrasting color. Embroidery thread works well for this stitch, but any thick thread can be used. To tie the knot, try moistening your forefinger. Wrap the thread around your forefinger once. Then use your thumb to push the thread off your finger, twisting it in the process. Finally, pull the end of the thread to tighten the knot. [2] X Research source"

The sides of the fabric which you intend to be the backend should face out so as to be visible during the process. The thread you use here will be more visible. Pin or baste the layers together to hold them in place."

While looking at the two layers of fabric from the side, draw the needle up through the bottom of the top layer, leaving the bottom layer untouched. [3] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. Start your stitch about 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) from the end. [4] X Research source Also note that each stitch you make should be 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) away from your sewn edge, as well. By only piercing through the top layer, you will draw the knot between the two layers, thereby hiding it from sight."

[5] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. Draw it straight through both layers of fabric, making sure that it comes out in nearly the same position as your first half-stitch. This is your first full stitch since it connects both layers together. When you complete this step, the thread should be wrapped around the edges of both layers in an even stitch, forming a loop around the outside of the fabric. [6] X Expert Source Margo West Professional Tailor Expert Interview. 7 December 2020. Make sure that the stitch is secure, but not so tight that it causes the fabric to bunch up."

This second stitch will essentially cover the first stitch. Pull the thread tight. When done, you should only be able to see what appears to be one stitch, but the thread should come out from fabric in a blank spot next to the stitch. Each stitch should be approximately 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) from one another and from the edge of the fabric, so that each stich is parallel."

Poke it up into both layers of fabric, beginning just beneath the spot at which the thread is coming up. Angle the needle so that it comes out through the top another 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) away from the previous stitch. The stitch itself should not appear angular, however. It should run straight up and down over the edge, parallel to the first stitch."

Open up the pieces of fabric like two leaves of a book. Wrap the needle through your last stitch, creating a loose loop in the process. Thread the fabric back around, twisting it around the original loop. Then pull tight. This knot should also be hidden in between the two layers of fabric.

If not, tie a new strand of yarn to the bottom stitch of one edge. The yarn you use for this stitch should be three to four times longer than your finished edge. [8] X Research source Use the same color yarn as one or both pieces of crochet work you intend to join. Unlike the whipstitch used in sewing, the whipstitch used in crocheting is meant to be far less visible, so you will usually want to hide the stitch further by using one of the colors already in the pattern."

Pull at least 3 to 4 inches (3.75 to 10 cm) of yarn through the eye of the needle. You will need this long starting portion to ensure that the needle remains threaded throughout the process. You will also need to monitor this non-working length of the yarn as you make your whipstitch. If it starts to get short, tug a little more yarn through the eye of the needle to prevent it from falling out. Should the yarn fall out during the process, simply re-thread it."
