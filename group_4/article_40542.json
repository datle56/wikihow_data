      "content": "Secret notes are collectible messages found around Stardew Valley. There are 27 notes in total, though originally, there were 25 (with more added in updates to the game). While the notes are numbered, you can find them randomly in any order. Some notes are puzzles or treasure maps with solutions, while others have hints and information about characters around town! [1] X Research source Although certain secret notes (like the treasure maps) come with rare or unique rewards, there's no overall reward or achievement for collecting all of them. However, many players view completing the collection as an achievement in itself. If you want your Collections tab to be totally complete, finding all 27 notes is part of that!"

      "content": "Get the Magnifying Glass from the Shadow Guy to unlock secret notes. Notes can’t be found (or read) until you have a Magnifying Glass. To get it, go to the Bus Stop between 6 AM and 4 PM in the Winter to trigger a cutscene. You’ll see a Shadow Guy, who will run away from you and hide. Then, you’ll get the “A Winter Mystery” quest; follow the Shadow Guy’s footsteps to complete it. [2] X Research source Chase the Shadow Guy into town and interact with one of the bushes next to the playground, left of the Community Center. The Shadow Guy will emerge, apologize, and give you the Magnifying Glass. From there, you’ll be able to start finding secret notes! When you find a secret note, select it and right-click on it in your inventory. This will enable a secret notes tab where you can reread secret notes you've already found. To access the secret notes tab, open the Player menu and navigate to Collections. The secret notes tab is at the bottom of the Collections menu."

      "content": "Do activities that have a chance of spawning secret notes. There are no specific places to find a secret note in the game; rather, you must find them randomly while completing tasks that can potentially yield them. Some activities have a greater chance of spawning notes than others; they include: [3] X Research source Breaking large stumps, logs, meteorites, or boulders (5% chance of spawning notes) Breaking stones (0.75% chance of spawning notes) Chopping down trees (0.5% chance of spawning notes per axe hit) Cutting weeds (0.9% chance of spawning notes) Digging up artifact spots (11% chance of spawning notes, only if you don’t get a winter forage item or artifact) Fishing (8% chance of spawning notes) Harvesting giant crops (100% chance of spawning notes) Killing monsters (3.3% chance of spawning notes) Each percentage represents the odds that the game will attempt to spawn a note. If the check succeeds, the game will make another check to see if a note actually spawns. The odds of spawning a note is a linear function of the number of notes found, with an 80% chance of spawning if you haven’t found any of them down to a 12% chance if you’ve found all but one."

He likes crab cakes and pomegranates. Shane is messy and anti-social. But I think his gruff exterior is a defense mechanism, insulating his softness from the world.

Mr. Qi will appear and reward you with an “Iridium Snake Milk,” which will give you a permanent +25 Health increase. If you get to the 100th floor using 10 or fewer staircases, Mr. Qi will congratulate you.

For treasures, check the cans by the blacksmith and museum.” It’s likely written by Linus. Use this note to loot items from different garbage cans around town; you only have to interact with the garbage can you want to loot. The note also mentions searching on “lucky” days. See the fortune teller in town to find out when it’s a high-luck day!

Solution : Go to the house and start directly in front of the door; then, follow the path indicated by the arrows, going in each direction until you can’t move further before going to the next. This will lead you to a Solid Gold Lewis statue hidden behind Mayor Lewis’ house. [13] X Research source For example, start the arrow path by running left as far as possible. Then, run up until you hit another obstacle, and so on. The path leads around the house and through town. Additional Secret : If you place the statue in Pelican Town (somewhere a villager won’t walk through it), it’ll be replaced by a Rotten Plant the next day. You’ll also get 750 coins and a note in the mail reading: “In the future, I'd appreciate it very much if you refrained from placing my PRIVATE belongings in town for all to see! I'm very displeased! Take this money and never speak of my 'project' to anyone.” If you take this route, the statue will appear in either Lewis’ bedroom (90% chance) or Marnie’s bedroom (10% chance)."

Like the previous note, you’ll need to follow one arrow in the direction shown as far as you can go before going in the direction indicated by the next arrow. You can also just go to the truck directly (instead of following the arrow path)."

Jasper’s book, reading: “...the creatures, known by some as \"Forest Spirits\" or \"Junimos\", are said to appear in abandoned buildings after they've \"gone to seed\". As a general rule... when humans leave, and nature begins to reclaim her territory, the Junimos will undoubtedly appear. Folk wisdom holds that the Junimos display some kind of resonant affinity with gemstones that are placed inside their little huts… Also, it's said that raisins are their favorite food, but they are too shy to take them directly from the hand. Of course, all these claims come from dubious, unverified sources... As far as I know, even the mere existence of these creatures has never been proven!” Solution : This note is a hint that if you place a foraged gem, mineral, or geode mineral into a Junimo Hut, it’ll change the color of the Junimos that harvest your crops to match the mineral."

The Junimos will eat a bag of raisins weekly, and you can place multiple bags in a Hut to be eaten over time. Make raisins by placing 5 grapes in a Dehydrator. It’ll take 29 in-game hours for them to process! This note is the first to be added to the game, along with update 1.6."

I hope things are going well! I'm honored that you're continuing the family tradition of farming, and through that noble endeavor, bringing greater life and abundance to all of Stardew Valley... a place very dear to my heart. Keep up the good work! —Grandpa”. There’s also a P.S., which reads: “...I've hidden a very special secret for you somewhere in the valley.
