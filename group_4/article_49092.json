      "title": "Freeze the metal Slush Puppie canister for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Freeze the metal Slush Puppie canister for 1 hour. Take all of the parts out and arrange them in front of you. The big, metal canister is used to hold all of the ingredients inside the machine, but it has to be frozen in advance to keep them at the right temperature. Although the wait is a little long, using a warm canister will turn your slushie into a soup like melted ice cream. [1] X Research source The canister is included with the machine. Avoid trying to use a separate canister, since it likely won’t fit and could damage the machine. Give the canister plenty of time to chill before attempting to use it. If you’re planning on making slushies, freeze it in advance. You could keep it there long-term until you’re ready to use the machine."

      "title": "Set up the machine by attaching the mixing canister to the motorized base.",
      "content": "Set up the machine by attaching the mixing canister to the motorized base. Start with the base, which is the big, square-shaped box with a small tray in the front. Set the plastic container on top of it, aligning the container’s spout with the tray on the bottom of the base. Once the canister is well-chilled, place it inside the container. Then, fit the plastic mixing ring inside the canister. [2] X Research source The mixing ring has several tabs along its top. Push the tabs down over the canister to secure it. The other parts included are small ones, such as the container’s lid and the caps that fit over it. If you’re setting the machine up for the first time, you can put all of these parts in place to see where they go, but you will have to remove them again later."

      "title": "Press the lid down on top of the machine until you hear it click.",
      "content": "Press the lid down on top of the machine until you hear it click. The lid has a small latch on the back that helps hold it in place once all the ingredients are swirling around inside the container. Rotate the lid so the front, the part with the big Slush Puppie sticker, is above the nozzle and tray. Then, lower it onto the canister with a light but firm amount of pressure. Fit any missing caps into the holes on the lid. [3] X Research source The lid has 2 caps. The big, round cap is the ice inlet valve. The smaller cap fits on the opposite side of the lid and is used to add syrup to the machine."

      "title": "Plug in the machine and press the power button.",
      "content": "Plug in the machine and press the power button. Before using the machine, set it on a level, stable surface, such as a table or countertop. Find a nearby outlet you can plug the machine into. Then, turn it on by using the control button located on the right side of the base. Make sure the mixer inside of the metal canister is able to spin freely. [4] X Research source The power button has a “mix” and “dispense” option, which are both labeled. Flip it to the left to set it to “mix” in order to test the machine."

      "title": "Mix 165 mL (5.6 fl oz) of syrup in 835 mL (28.2 fl oz) of water.",
      "content": "Mix 165 mL (5.6 fl oz) of syrup in 835 mL (28.2 fl oz) of water. The manufacturer sells a syrup that is used to color and flavor Slush Puppies. It recommends mixing 1 part syrup and 5 parts water. However, consider this a basic guideline that can and sometimes has to be adjusted. Mix the syrup in a large cup or tall glass, then add more syrup or water if you wish to alter the flavor. [5] X Research source You could also try making your own flavoring, such as by mixing 1 cup (201 g) of sugar in 4 cups (950 mL) of water. Add food coloring and a flavor extract afterward. To buy more syrup, shop online. You can get it from the manufacturer or other retailers."

      "title": "Fill the metal canister halfway with fresh ice cubes.",
      "content": "Fill the metal canister halfway with fresh ice cubes. The machine has a pair of inlet caps, a big one for ice and salt and a small one for syrup. Remove the bigger one and set it aside. Then, drop ice cubes in one by one to fill the canister. The amount you will need depends on the size of the ice, so have plenty of ice cubes ready. [6] X Research source Drop the ice cubes in while the machine is running. It’s perfectly safe and necessary for getting the Slush Puppie mix to the right consistency."

      "title": "Use the salt inlet cap to measure out 2 capfuls of salt.",
      "content": "Use the salt inlet cap to measure out 2 capfuls of salt. The manufacturer measures the amount of salt used according to the round inlet cap you removed when putting ice into the machine. Flip the cap so the open end is face up, then fill it to the brim with table salt. Pour each capful through the inlet hole and into the canister. [7] X Research source Although you may feel like you're using way too much salt, it doesn’t end up in the finished Slush Puppie. It is used to prevent the mix from freezing. It gets separated out later. If you don’t wish to use the cap as a measuring tool, you could try doing it on your own. Start with about 34.12 g, or 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml), of salt, then make adjustments as needed to bring the slush to the right consistency."

      "title": "Pour 40 mL (1.4 fl oz) of cold water into the machine.",
      "content": "Pour 40 mL (1.4 fl oz) of cold water into the machine. Fill a measuring cup with the correct amount of water, then add it to the mixture through the opening on the lid. Pour it in gradually to avoid spills. Afterward, let the machine stir everything together while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. [8] X Research source Keep an eye on the consistency of the Slush Puppie mix. It won’t be done yet, but it will start forming into a semi-solid as the machine chips the ice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add more ice to fill the rest of the canister.",
      "content": "Add more ice to fill the rest of the canister. This time, add enough ice to fill the canister up all the way to the top. If you look at the plastic part around the container, you will be able to see a line marked “3.” The line is right above the lip of the canister. Make sure the ice doesn’t go above this line. You might feel like adding the ice all in one go instead of pouring salt in first. However, avoid doing this. It could affect the machine or throw off the consistency of the Slush Puppie."

    {
      "title": "Pour another 3 caps of salt into the machine.",
      "content": "Pour another 3 caps of salt into the machine. Top the ice with more table salt to prevent the slush from freezing. Use the inlet cap to measure out the salt, then pour it through the opening. While you’re getting the remaining ingredients, keep an eye on the mixture to ensure it doesn’t freeze. [9] X Research source If you’re measuring salt on your own, add about 51.18 g, or 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml). Use more if the slush starts to solidify or you notice the mixer having trouble moving through it."

      "title": "Measure another 40 mL (1.4 fl oz) of cold water for the mix.",
      "content": "Measure another 40 mL (1.4 fl oz) of cold water for the mix. Add cold water to a mixing cup, then pour it into the machine. This is the last amount of water, ice, or salt you need to add, so check the slush’s consistency. Make sure it’s somewhat liquid but not too runny. Refit the inlet cap on the lid when you’re done. [10] X Research source Add more water, ice, or salt now to in order to bring the mix to the proper consistency. You can also add a little bit later if it is needed to incorporate the syrup."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour syrup through the syrup inlet valve on the lid.",
      "content": "Pour syrup through the syrup inlet valve on the lid. This valve is smaller than the ice inlet and is located on the right side of the lid. It’s a small opening in the lid. Use it to add all of the syrup you made earlier. Pour the syrup in gradually so the mixer is better able to incorporate it into the water. [11] X Research source The valve is identifiable because “Beverages high in sugar content only” is printed on the lid. The valve is right next to the words. If your Slush Puppie is too runny, add more ice to help it freeze. Add more syrup to the mixture to prevent it from becoming too solid."

    {
      "title": "Let the machine run for 15 to 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the machine run for 15 to 20 minutes. During this time, the machine will swirl the slush and syrup together. Stay near it and check it about every 2 to 3 minutes to see if it’s still working as intended. Make sure that the mixer is still turning and that the canister is filled with ice and salt. [12] X Research source The machine isn’t meant to operate for more than 40 minutes at a time. In addition to liquefying your frozen treat, the mixer could sustain permanent damage."

      "title": "Reverse the mixture’s direction with the power switch if the machine jams.",
      "content": "Reverse the mixture’s direction with the power switch if the machine jams. You may have noticed that the power switch has different settings. Flipping it to the right, to the “dispense” setting, stops the mixer from moving. Wait a few seconds, then flip the switch back to “mix.” If it still doesn’t work, repeat flipping between the dispense and mix settings until it does. [13] X Research source You could also shut off the machine for a couple of seconds and wait for the ice around the mixing blades to melt. Reactivate the mixer afterward and let it run again if it is able to spin freely."

    {
      "title": "Refill the canister with more ingredients as the water level drops.",
      "content": "Refill the canister with more ingredients as the water level drops. This will happen during the 15 or 20 minutes of waiting time. Start with ice, adding 1 or 2 cubes at a time to fill the canister back up to the brim. When you’re done, add another 2 or 3 capfuls of salt, followed by another 40 mL (1.4 fl oz) of cold water in afterward. Add more ingredients until the 15 waiting period is up. [14] X Research source To avoid any problems with the machine, keep the ice level about 3 cm (1.2 in) below the top of the metal canister. You can wait until the end to add the salt and water. Unless you need more to change the slush’s consistency, you only have to add salt and water once."

      "title": "Watch for peaks to form once the mixture reaches the correct consistency.",
      "content": "Watch for peaks to form once the mixture reaches the correct consistency. If you love Slush Puppies, you may have an idea of what the mixture is supposed to look like. One of the best ways to monitor the consistency is by looking at the shape it takes inside the plastic mixing container. The slush will splash up in waves toward the lid. Look for the slush to rise up in several spots around the fill line. [15] X Research source Check the slush’s actual consistency as well. It’s supposed to consist of a lot of small ice chips. The ice chips will all have the same color because of the syrup you added."

      "title": "Turn the dispenser handle clockwise to pour a Slush Puppie.",
      "content": "Turn the dispenser handle clockwise to pour a Slush Puppie. Flip the power button to “dispense” first. Then, place a cup underneath the spout on the front of the machine. Turn the handle to let out a flow of your delicious, frozen treat. [16] X Research source You can leave the machine running until you finish the last of the slush. Afterward, be sure to clean out the mixing components thoroughly with soap and water."
