      "content": "Invest in a whistle. A simple whistle is often the easiest way to chase off troublemakers. Pepper spray, which will incapacitate an attacker, is also an option if it is legal in your area, but make sure you check that it definitely is legal first before you bring one with you. The last thing you want to happen when out is to be searched by a police officer then arrested for possessing an offensive weapon. [5] X Research source Pepper spray needs a little practice to use correctly. Get comfortable using your thumb to push the button so you can hold the canister securely in the palm of your hand with the other four fingers. Learn how to unlock the safety switch quickly. Practice a few times with your canister to learn how far away you can stand and still reach your target. Some sprays can reach up to ten feet."

If you are going out alone, you can use an app such as Map My Friends to find friends nearby to meet up with. Or check your university message board to find others looking to go out. [6] X Research source Many cities and universities provide free shuttles around town to popular restaurants and clubs. Using this option provides a safe way to get to and from your destination.

You don’t want to be distracted by chatting on your phone when walking, but it can sometimes make you feel safer to talk to someone when you are alone so they know where you are. Just make sure the conversation allows you to keep track of those around you."

Park in well-lit areas, as well. If it is still light when you park, visualize what the area will look like in the dark when you return. Look for overhead lights and park there.
