The only differences are that the old Facebook Notes editing screen was larger and had formatting options, and that Notes appeared in a separate section of your profile. Although the formatting options won't be available when creating a standard Facebook post, you can compose your thoughts in advance using a text editor on your computer, phone, or tablet (such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for macOS) and paste the contents into your post."

When you create a Page, your friends (and anyone who comes across your Page) can \"Like\" it, which causes your Page's posts to appear in their feeds. Posting from your Page is like posting from your personal account, but instead of just having one small box to compose your post, you have access to a whole set of publishing and drafting tools, including the ability to schedule posts in advance. You can also use Facebook's built-in Insights features to see how many people view your posts."
