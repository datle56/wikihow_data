      "content": "Develop a growth mindset. As you embark on your self-improvement journey, you’ll be trying new things, building new habits, and stepping out of your comfort zone. When you do these things, you’re bound to stumble a few times, and that’s completely normal—growth isn’t linear. [3] X Research source In order to keep a productive, upbeat attitude throughout this process, it’s important to cultivate a growth mindset , rather than a fixed mindset. [4] X Research source If you have a fixed mindset, you believe that you were born with a certain set of skills and abilities that you can’t change. This mindset can be limiting because it leaves you very little room for growth or improvement. If you have a growth mindset, you believe that your skills and abilities are always evolving, and that you have the potential to change and improve. A growth mindset allows you to see mistakes and setbacks as opportunities to learn and grow, which makes it a much more productive attitude if you’re embarking on a self-improvement journey.

In fact, positive thinking has been linked to lower levels of stress and depression, lower levels of physical pain, better cardiovascular health, and increased lifespan. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source With benefits like these, the importance of a positive mindset is clear! Here are some tips for developing one: Dr. Mesrobian recommends reframing negative thoughts. Reframing involves shifting your perspective to focus on the positive in any given situation, rather than dwelling on the negative. For example, if you’ve made a mistake at work, your first instinct might be to think, “I’m so stupid! I completely messed everything up, and now my boss is going to think I’m incompetent.” To reframe this negative thought, tell yourself, “Mistakes are normal, and this one misstep doesn’t determine my value as an employee. It’s also an opportunity to learn and be better next time.” [7] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source"

      "title": "Practice self-compassion.",
      "content": "Practice self-compassion. Dr. Mesrobian recommends showing yourself compassion when you’re feeling down, rather than trying to force yourself to snap out of it. Self-compassion essentially means treating yourself the way you’d treat someone you love, and giving yourself grace in tough moments. It can improve your mental health, help you build emotional resilience, and even make you more likely to be compassionate to others, which makes it a great thing to try if you want to work on yourself. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source When you notice that you’re being super critical of yourself, pause and recite some positive affirmations , instead. For example, you could say “I’m worthy and capable,” “I’m deserving of kindness and love,” or “I’m doing the best I can, and that’s enough.” It may feel silly at first, but positive affirmations are seriously powerful. In studies, self-affirmation was shown to boost academic grade-point averages for underperforming students in just one semester, which suggests that it has a tangible effect. [9] X Research source Since self-compassion makes you more tolerant toward others, it can also improve your relationships.
