      "title": "A silent sneak attack is pretty unfair.",
      "content": "A silent sneak attack is pretty unfair. Some people aren’t into surprises or tickling, so hitting them with a double whammy will probably upset them. Remember: the only fair tickle fight is the one your opponent agrees to! [1] X Research source If you still want to do a sneak attack, at least yell “TICKLE FIGHT!” first. They can’t say you didn’t warn them! Keep in mind that just because they're laughing doesn’t mean they're having fun. Our brains tell us to respond to tickling with laughter, almost like a reflex. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a soft touch or a feather to tickle the bottom of their foot.",
      "content": "Use a soft touch or a feather to tickle the bottom of their foot. The bottom of the foot is so ticklish! Brush your fingers or a feather lightly on the soles of their bare feet to tickle them. [3] X Research source If they’re wearing socks, this probably won’t be as effective."
    },
    {
      "title": "You can tickle a little harder in the armpits.",
      "content": "You can tickle a little harder in the armpits. Armpits are super ticklish! Just stick your fingers in the other person's pits and wiggle them around a bit. Tickling can be really unpleasant for some people. If the other person doesn't look like they're having much fun, stop tickling them."
    },
    {
      "title": "The ribs and stomach area are super ticklish.",
      "content": "The ribs and stomach area are super ticklish. If their ribs are ticklish and you get a good shot at them, it's time to go in for the win! Put your hands on their stomach, dig your fingers into their ribs gently, and wiggle your fingers around. Don't sit on them or hold them down to get at their ribs. It's not a fair tickle fight if they can't defend themselves! Plus, they might get upset with you."

    {
      "title": "Grab the area right above their knee cap and give it a firm squeeze.",
      "content": "Grab the area right above their knee cap and give it a firm squeeze. This is a great way to immobilize them! Use your middle finger and thumb to latch onto the area right above the knee and squeeze it until they can’t take it anymore. The tops of the knees are so ticklish that they’ll either freeze in place or fall down in a fit of laughter. They could also make a run for it, though, so watch out for that! If the top of the knees don't work, try softly tickling their kneecaps. That should drive them into fits of laughter!"

      "title": "Widen your eyes, point, and say “What’s that over there!?”",
      "content": "Widen your eyes, point, and say “What’s that over there!?” A classic distraction trick can put you in a good position to win this tickle fight. Give it a try and if they fall for it, go in hard for their armpits and ribs. This will probably only work once, so make it count. Once you have the upper hand, they’ll probably give up and declare you the winner."

    {
      "title": "Your brain will think you’re tickling yourself, which doesn't work.",
      "content": "Your brain will think you’re tickling yourself, which doesn't work. Touching their hand makes your brain believe you have something to do with the tickling. Since it’s impossible to tickle ourselves (really, there's scientific proof), your brain won't perceive the movements as ticklish. To test this out, just place your hand on top of the other person's hand as they try to tickle you. [4] X Research source You’ll have to be quick enough to catch their hand, though!"
    },
    {
      "title": "A tickle fight isn’t fun if the other person is upset.",
      "content": "A tickle fight isn’t fun if the other person is upset. If the person is helpless and defenseless, tickling can become unpleasant pretty fast. If they repeatedly ask you to stop or can’t catch their breath, quit tickling them. Never sit on people to tickle them or restrain them in any way. Tickle fights should be fun for both people! If the other person looks unhappy, call a tickle truce."
