      "title": "Lust comes from brain chemistry, and it's a natural instinct.",
      "content": "Lust comes from brain chemistry, and it's a natural instinct. Lust, also known as limerance, is an overwhelming feeling of sexual desire for someone else. Being close to someone you’re attracted to (or even thinking about them!) creates a flood of feel-good chemicals in your brain, like dopamine and norepinephrine. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with you if you’re feeling lust—this is just how your brain has evolved to function. If you’re feeling guilty over your feelings of lust, it’s important to make peace with these feelings. Remember that lust doesn’t have to control your behavior, but it is totally normal to experience."

      "content": "When you find yourself fantasizing, it’s time to return to reality.

I really feel so attracted to you, and it’s started to become distracting for me. I’m wondering if we can work out a way to guide our relationship in the direction of love, not lust.” Everyone is different, and your girlfriend might react to this news by feeling flattered or by feeling a bit worried, especially if she doesn’t feel the same about this issue.
