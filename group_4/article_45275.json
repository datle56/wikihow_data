      "title": "Create uniform sections of hair using a rattail comb or your fingers.",
      "content": "Create uniform sections of hair using a rattail comb or your fingers. You can make any size twists you’d like. For small, average-sized twists, grab a section of hair about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) thick along your hairline. Secure the rest of your hair out of the way using hair clips or elastic ties. Dampen your hair before dividing it into sections. When starting the twist method, it’s easiest to work from back to front. If you prefer larger twists, grab a strand that is 2–4 in (5.1–10.2 cm) thick. Remember, larger twists require longer hair. Shorter hair may not be long enough to twist together in large sections. For best results, use a section of hair that is all about the same length. If the hair in each of your sections varies in length, your twists may not stay in place."

      "title": "Comb a dab of coconut oil or hair gel through each section of hair.",
      "content": "Comb a dab of coconut oil or hair gel through each section of hair. The particular products you use depend on your hair type and desired hold. In general, scoop up a dab of coconut oil, and rub it in between your hands. Comb the oil through your hair from root to tip using your fingers. Then, do the same with a dab of styling gel or cream. [1] X Research source This smooths your hair and helps it stay in the twist shape. If you hair dries quickly, try adding the gel section by section rather than applying it all at once. Don't let the gel harden before you've had the opportunity to twist your hair."

      "title": "Separate the hair into 2 equal sections.",
      "content": "Separate the hair into 2 equal sections. To do the two-strand twist, create 2 evenly-sized sections using your fingers or a rattail comb. The sections should be roughly the same size, but it’s okay if they aren’t exact. [2] X Research source To keep the sections separated, hold the ends of your hair in your hands."

      "title": "Twist 1 of the sections of hair around the other.",
      "content": "Twist 1 of the sections of hair around the other. Hold 1 section of hair in each of your hands, and bring 1 hand over the other to start your twist. Continue this hand-over-hand movement to twist the section of hair around the other strand. Wrap the hair with even tension until you reach the end of your hair. As you do this, be sure to move your hands in the same direction to create a uniform twist. Twist the sections of hair together tightly so they do not unravel when you let go."

      "title": "Apply a bit of product to the ends so the twist stays in place.",
      "content": "Apply a bit of product to the ends so the twist stays in place. Once you get to the end of your hair, hold the strands in 1 hand, scoop a bit of hair gel with the other, and rub the product onto the end of your hair. Curly hair often stays in place on its own, although you can use small hair ties to secure the ends if you’d like. [3] X Research source You only need a small dab of product to secure your ends. Experiment with shea butter, twisting creams, and hair gel to see what works the best."

      "content": "Continue twisting all of your hair in small, uniform sections. If you want an all over twisted style, move on to another section of hair after you secure your first twist. Start your next one immediately next to the first, and continue creating twists from the front of your head to the back. [4] X Research source Depending on how much hair you have and how long it is, this process can take quite some time. Take breaks when you need to, You can watch a movie or listen to music as you do this."

Rub the product in your hands, and apply it from your roots to your ends. [6] X Research source Using styling product before you twist your hair helps the coils stay in position for several days. It also helps you define your twists, which in turn helps if and when you decide to unravel the twists."

Then, position the 3 sections side-by-side. [7] X Research source This is the same basic steps you’d take if you were braiding your hair, but instead of moving 2 of the 3 strands, you’ll only adjust 1 of them."

Apply a small dab of hair gel or coconut oil to the very end for a gentle hold. If you have curly hair, the twist should stay in place. For a more secure hold, wrap a small elastic hair tie around the end of the strand. [10] X Research source This way, the twists do not come undone as you style your hair."

Continue doing this working from front to back until all of your hair is in twists.

      "content": "Rock your twists for 1-2 weeks. On average, your twists will stay in place for about a week or so. By using products and hair ties, you can keep your twists intact for up to 2 weeks. This is a great, short-term preventative style. After 1-2 weeks, undo your hair and try something new. [12] X Research source For instance, wear your hair in two-strand twists for a few weeks, then try out the three-strand twist next. You can make your next twists a bit thinner or thicker if you’d like."

This way, you can extend the total time of your twist hairstyle. [13] X Research source As the hairs loosen, the twists may appear bigger. This is perfectly normal, and if you don’t like this look you can try twisting the hair tighter next time."

If you want to wash your hair but don’t want your twists to come out, rub a dime-size amount of shampoo in your hands, and apply it directly to your scalp. Avoid getting much of the product directly on your twists. Massage your scalp with your fingers, and rinse out the shampoo completely. You can apply conditioner the same way to moisturize your scalp if you’d like. [15] X Research source Do this if your hair is very oily or if your scalp starts to itch."

      "content": "Unravel each section to create a twist-out look. Sleep with your hair in a two-strand twist overnight, and gently unravel each twist the next morning. Shake your head from side to side to loosen the coils. Use a little coconut oil if your hair is dry, but pat it gently over your hair to keep it in a puffy shape. This is a cute, casual alternative to your twisted look. With this look, your hair is still curly and coiled, but the twists look relaxed and loose rather than tightly wrapped. If you did your twists when your hair was damp, you need to allow your hair to dry completely before unraveling your twists. You can also leave your hair in two-strand twists for 2-3 days for tight, kinky coils."
