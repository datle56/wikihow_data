All you have to do is french braid your hair in two sections, parting your hair the way you normally would. Sleep on your braids, and carefully unravel them when you wake up. [2] X Research source You can braid your hair while it’s damp as long as you make sure it’s completely dry before unraveling. Spray your waves with a bit of hairspray and scrunch your hair upwards to help the waves stay in place. For a more subtle wave, try a single french braid. This will give you looser curls."

Now, this is usually a big no-no in the hairstyling world, but an exception can be made if you use the right brush and have a straight or wavy hair type. Invest in a brush made specifically for wet hair—these are usually called “wet brushes.” Try this method if you have type 1 or 2 hair that’s medium or fine. [13] X Research source Avoid this method if you have thick or densely curly hair as it could result in damage and frizzier hair. Using smoothing products in your hair can tame frizz and lock in moisture to give you smooth, shiny locks. You can also give your hair a nice blowout by washing your hair and blow-drying your roots with a vent brush so they're 60% dry. From there, pin up your hair in 3 sections (top, middle, and bottom). Drop out the bottom section, roll up your hair with a large brush, and use the concentrator nozzle on your blow dryer to dry the section. Then, continue with the other 2 sections."
