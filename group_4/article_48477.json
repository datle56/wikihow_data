      "content": "Pick out a skin care set or some soothing bath salts to help with relaxation. Self care is especially important during pregnancy, so pick something soothing and high quality. If you want to get bath salts or a bath bomb, get something containing epsom salt that’s either all-natural, or specifically designated for pregnancy. Epsom salt, or magnesium sulfate, is believed to help relieve some pregnancy aches and pains. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Get the baby gender neutral clothing, like a jumpsuit, so that they’ll wear it no matter what. It is a better idea to get the parents something at a gender reveal party, since the baby shower has yet to happen, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get the baby something! A jumpsuit is always a great and safe choice. Orange, yellow, white, brown, and green are all great gender neutral colors to choose from. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Wooden toys like a rattle are effortless, practical, and trendy gifts. Baby's won’t care if their toys are gendered, but their parents might. Get a simple wooden toy; they look nice, and the color is definitely gender neutral! Wooden rattles make great baby toys because they are stimulating and safe. Babies like to put everything in their mouth, and well made wood is generally thought to be safer than plastic for this. A set of wooden building blocks is another terrific option."

      "content": "Get the soon-to-be parents something cute and matching like pajamas, or oversize t-shirts. These parents are about to be a power team, so get them something to prove it. If you want, you could throw in an extra matching item for the baby for extra cuteness levels. Look for something that will be worn around the house, since they likely won’t be going out in public wearing matching outfits very often. Matching wine glasses or coffee mugs can make for a similarly fantastic and easy gift."

      "content": "If the party is held outdoors or at a house, bring a food item. These celebrations are usually just a good reason to hang out with friends and eat good food. If you’re a good cook, bring a dish you prepared. If you don’t trust your cooking, or if you just don’t have the time to make something, then pick up some hors d'oeuvres at the supermarket. Bring snacks and finger food. The host will likely have something planned as a main course, so it’s best to bring snacks! Bring something you know the hosts enjoy. If you don’t know their tastes, then bring something that’s easy on the palette and you think everyone will enjoy."

      "content": "The soon-to-be parents can never have too many gift cards. Consider getting them a gift card to Amazon, or to a local shop. If you can’t decide on what to get them, a gift card will let them decide for themselves! It can feel a little awkward to gift straight up cash, so instead pick a specific store for them to shop at. Support local businesses by buying a gift card for a store in your hometown. This makes for a great gift, since it helps local businesses and the new parents at the same time. An Amazon gift card is a good option because it lets the new parents pick out pretty much anything they want."

      "title": "A food delivery subscription is a great idea for busy parents.",
      "content": "A food delivery subscription is a great idea for busy parents. There is a lot to do during and after pregnancy, so not having to worry about cooking food can reduce a lot of that stress. Make sure to get something that can be redeemed/saved for the final trimester, or for after the baby has been born, since those are the most difficult times. Get a giftcard to a food ordering and delivery service, like Uber Eats or Grubhub. These can be redeemed at any time, so they are a good option. Support local restaurants directly by getting a gift card to one nearby that delivers. Get a subscription to a pre-prepped meal kit delivery service. These are great because there are so many healthy options to choose from."

      "title": "Gender reveal parties can be messy, so offer to help clean up.",
      "content": "Gender reveal parties can be messy, so offer to help clean up. Whether its a smoke bomb, confetti, silly string, or glitter, something is probably going to explode and get all over the place. It’s part of the fun, but a pain to clean up. Tell the hosts that you are going to help them clean up when you greet them, and even if they tell you not to worry about it, they’ll appreciate the gesture. If the party is happening somewhere in nature, like a public park, consider bringing your own trash bags for clean-up. The hosts have a lot to plan and may have forgotten, and you don’t want to litter confetti and glitter everywhere."

      "title": "Gendered clothing, or alcohol for the mom, can be awkward gifts to give.",
      "content": "Gendered clothing, or alcohol for the mom, can be awkward gifts to give. Don’t worry, there will be a baby shower and plenty of time to buy gender-specific baby clothes. You should also avoid gifting the mom alcohol. Usually something like a bottle of champagne is a great and easy gift, but remember that the mom is sober for the next half year or more, so dangling a delicious bottle of wine in front of her may feel like torture."
