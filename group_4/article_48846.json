If she feels like you aren’t actually listening to her, she might raise her voice to “make you” listen because she feels like you aren’t hearing her. [1] X Research source For instance, maybe you forgot what time you were supposed to pick up the kids tomorrow, and your wife yells at you for forgetting. She might be frustrated that she’s told you the same thing a few times now. It’s okay to get frustrated, but in healthy relationships, couples don’t lose their cool and yell at each other."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source If your household income isn’t enough to cover everything that you need, your wife might be feeling panicked. She could be expressing those feelings by yelling at you, even if it’s misdirected. This is especially likely if you’re the breadwinner of the family. If your wife doesn’t work, she may be feeling helpless or like she can’t contribute financially."

Maybe you’ve been prioritizing friends or your hobbies instead of your wife, and she’s upset. If she’s been noticing this for a while, she may be letting out a burst of anger by yelling, even though it’s not the best way to communicate her feelings."

If you know that your wife has a lot on her plate, she might be yelling at you because she’s worried about other responsibilities. [3] X Research source This misdirected anger isn’t fair, but it may be why she’s been yelling more. She could be worried about her job, the kids, or even her social life."

If so, your wife could have learned that yelling means she’s telling you something passionately. It’s possible that yelling is her way of communicating with you, and she doesn’t really know any other way. [6] X Research source This doesn’t mean that your wife’s yelling is okay, though. Yelling is a habit that can be unlearned."

When your wife starts to yell, calmly request that she lower her voice or change her tone to enforce your boundaries and ask for respect.

Remember to emphasize that you’re not walking away, just taking a break for now. “I can tell you’re upset. Why don’t we take 5 minutes to ourselves, and then we can talk about it?” “I need a minute to gather my thoughts, so I’m going to go into the other room. I’ll be back in 10 minutes.”"

[10] X Research source “So what you’re saying is: you’re upset because I didn’t do the dishes, even though I said I would.

That was my fault.” Only apologize if you actually think you’ve done something wrong. If you apologize just to keep the peace, it probably won’t sound genuine."

[12] X Research source Try not to ask your wife, “What can I do?” or, “How can I help?” This won’t help ease her mental load.
