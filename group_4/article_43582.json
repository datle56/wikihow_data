      "content": "Inform your doctor if you’ve ever had the BCG vaccine. The bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine gives your body immunity from a TB infection. Because the vaccine introduces the TB bacteria into your body, it can result in a false positive on your skin test. Inform your doctor if you’ve had this vaccine so they can be wary of a false positive. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you have had the vaccine, your doctor will probably opt for a blood test instead, because this isn't susceptible to a false positive from the vaccine."

      "title": "Receive a PPD injection on your forearm.",
      "content": "Receive a PPD injection on your forearm. The most common test for TB is an injection of fluid called tuberculin just under the skin in your forearm. If this fluid reacts with your body and produces a swollen bump, it indicates a positive test. [2] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Because the skin on your forearm is thin, you will feel a pinch when the fluid is injected. Try deep breathing and other relaxation techniques to overcome a fear of needles if shots make you nervous."

      "content": "Avoid disturbing the test spot. After you get your injection, leave the spot alone until the doctor examines it again. Any kind of disturbance can impact the test results. Do not cover the area with a bandage or any lotion. Also, do not scratch the area. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If the injection itches or causes discomfort, you can hold an ice cube against the area to numb it."

      "title": "Look for swelling at the injection site.",
      "content": "Look for swelling at the injection site. Immediately after the injection, there will be some swelling. If you have never had TB bacteria in your body, this swelling should subside within a few hours. However, if the swelling remains or grows larger, it could indicate a positive test. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Generally a swollen bump at least 5 mm in diameter indicates a positive test."

      "content": "Return to the doctor 48 to 72 hours later for an assessment. It’s extremely important that you keep your appointment with your doctor 2 or 3 days after the test because only a trained professional can accurately interpret the results. If there is no indication of an infection, your doctor will declare the test negative. If there is swelling, your doctor will do more tests to see if this indicates a TB infection. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The TST skin test is known for false positives, so it is not a definitive test for whether someone has a TB infection. If your test comes back positive, your doctor will ask follow-up questions to determine if this is a false positive. He will also order more tests to confirm the results."

That means if you have a positive skin test once, you might always have a positive skin test, even after you complete your treatment. Get a written report from your doctor indicating that you’ve completed the necessary treatments and do not have an active TB infection.

This measures how strongly your blood reacts to the TB bacteria in a laboratory setting to see if you’ve been infected. Start by scheduling an appointment for your doctor to draw your blood. They will then send the blood to a lab for the necessary tests.

It doesn’t say whether you have an active or latent infection. To determine that, your doctor will order more tests and depending on those results, start you on treatment.

The test measures if there is any TB bacteria in your sputum, the mucus you produce when coughing. You’ll have to use a testing kit and collect samples for a 3-5 day period and bring them to your doctor for testing. Follow all instructions the doctor gives you to ensure you collect the samples correctly.

This test is not as accurate, but will give an indication on whether or not you should start treatment for a TB infection before the throat culture comes back. [13] X Research source If your rapid test comes back positive, your doctor probably won’t wait for the throat culture test to come back before starting your treatment.

If TB bacteria is present in that culture, it’s a clear indication of a TB infection. This takes time, however, and the average time for these results is about 4 weeks. If your rapid test already came back positive, your doctor will probably have already started your treatment before the throat culture results come back. [14] X Research source"

Both an x-ray and a CT scan will show inflammation if you have a TB infection. The doctor will use this information to effectively treat you. [15] X Research source It’s up to your doctor to decide which test he will give you. Both will work, but a CT scan usually shows clearer images. Your doctor may order both tests to be comprehensive."
