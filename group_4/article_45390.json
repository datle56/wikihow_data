      "content": "See if the catheter’s in your urethra and not your vagina (women). The urethra and vaginal canal are next to each other, so it is possible to insert a catheter into the vaginal canal instead of the urethra. If you’re female, look to see where you inserted the catheter using a handheld mirror. If the catheter is in your vagina, you’ll need to remove it and start over with a new catheter. [1] X Research source Do not reinsert the same catheter that was in your vagina as this will spread bacteria from your vagina to your urethra and this could lead to an infection."

This is the correct amount of the catheter that should still be visible if you have inserted it properly into your penis. If there’s more or less than this amount visible, adjust the catheter by inserting it in further or pulling it out by 1–2 cm (0.39–0.79 in) and see if any urine drains out. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait for 2 to 3 minutes after inserting the catheter for the gel to dissolve. Any lubricating gel you use to make inserting the catheter easier can block the drainage holes in the catheter. However, catheter lubricating gel is water-based, so it will dissolve once urine begins to flow. Try checking the catheter again in 3 minutes if you have just inserted it. [3] X Research source If there’s still no urine, try another option to get the urine flowing."

      "content": "Cough to start the flow of urine. If no urine has emptied into the drainage bag within 3 to 5 minutes after inserting it, try coughing a few times. This will often start the flow of urine. Check to see if any urine flows into the bag when you do this. [4] X Research source You don’t need to cough hard. Just cough a few times as if you’re clearing your throat. If there’s still not any urine in the bag, keep looking for other possible causes."

      "title": "Check for kinks in the catheter or drainage bag tubing.",
      "content": "Check for kinks in the catheter or drainage bag tubing. If the drainage bag tubing or catheter is twisted, kinked, or being pressed against your body with too much pressure, such as under clothing or a leg strap, then the urine will not flow freely. Trace the tubing from where it exists your urethra to where it ends or meets up with the drainage bag and undo any kinks that you find. Take the tubing out from under any clothing or straps that may be pressing on it as well. [5] X Research source If you usually use a leg strap to keep your catheter secured, check it regularly to ensure that the tubing is not blocked. If the urine is still not flowing after checking the tubing, try another option."

      "content": "Raise and then lower the drainage bag below the level of your bladder. Lift the drainage bag up above the level of the bladder and hold it there for 20 to 30 seconds. Then, lower the drainage bag below the level of the bladder again. This simple re-positioning technique may help to get urine flowing into the bag again. Check the bag in 3-5 minutes to see if there is any urine draining into the bag. Try to keep the bag in the same position at all times. If you need to move or change positions, make sure to place the bag below the level of your bladder. If this doesn’t unblock the catheter, try the next option."

Then, remove the collection bag from the end of the catheter and see if any urine drains out. It’s possible for the bag to create a vacuum and prevent the urine from flowing. If this does not work, call your doctor’s office to be seen right away or visit the emergency department of your nearest hospital for assistance. If you cannot feel your bladder or if your bladder is full and you’re uncomfortable, go to the emergency department of your nearest hospital instead of calling your doctor."

      "content": "Get the catheter flushed by a doctor or nurse if your urine is cloudy. If you notice that your urine looks cloudy or has debris in it, this may be what’s blocking your catheter. Having the catheter flushed with normal saline by a trained doctor or nurse can help to clean out the tubing so the catheter will work better. You may also need to be checked for bladder stones if the catheter frequently gets blocked. Make sure to tell your doctor about any other symptoms you’ve been having, such as abdominal cramps or pain."

      "content": "Ask about an all-silicone catheter if the tubing is blocked by debris. If your urine is often cloudy or has debris in it, this may be causing blockages in the tubing. For example, if you use a catheter that has tubing made from vinyl or red rubber latex, your doctor may recommend a catheter made from a more flexible material, such as an all-silicone catheter. This may help to reduce the chances of your catheter becoming blocked."

Your doctor will likely recommend replacing an indwelling catheter once every 4 to 6 weeks to prevent blockages. However, as long as it’s well cared for and you’re not having problems, you may be able to leave it in place for as long as 3 months before getting it changed. You can have your catheter changed at your doctor’s office or you can replace your catheter yourself if you have been taught how. [7] X Research source If you have a suprapubic catheter, it is recommended to get it changed every 6 to 8 weeks.

This can create a vacuum, which will prevent urine from draining into the bag. To prevent this, always leave about 5–10 mL (0.17–0.34 fl oz) of urine in the drainage bag when you empty it. Make sure to note this if you are keeping track of your fluid intake and output."

If it’s 2/3 full or close to that level, empty it. Waiting until the bag is completely full can affect the flow of urine. The catheter will be more effective if you empty it when it is 2/3 full and do not allow it to fill up any more than this."

Aim to drink water and other fluids throughout the day to keep yourself hydrated. Check the urine in the drainage bag to determine if it is a pale yellow. If it’s darker than pale yellow, then drink more fluids.

Constipation is a common reason why some people’s catheters become blocked, so eating more fiber may help to prevent a blockage."
