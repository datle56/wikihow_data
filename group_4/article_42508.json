      "title": "Purchase your tongkat ali from a trusted manufacturer.",
      "content": "Purchase your tongkat ali from a trusted manufacturer. It’s important to research your sources thoroughly before you take this supplement. Some preparations of tongkat ali have been found to contain dangerous amounts of mercury, while other supplements claiming to contain tongkat ali have been shown to actually be spiked with prescription erectile dysfunction drugs like Viagra and Levitra. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you already purchase supplements from a store or online shop, ask them if they carry tongkat ali. To find a reliable supplement provider, ask your family and friends for recommendations, reach out on social media, and read customer reviews online."

      "title": "Look for a 100:1-strength extract.",
      "content": "Look for a 100:1-strength extract. This means that 100 kg of the root was used to obtain 1 kg of extract. Manufacturers of tongkat ali extract can use very different concentrations in their preparation of this supplement, ranging from 20:1 to 200:1. However, a ratio 100:1 is considered standard. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you do opt to take a stronger concentration, lower your dose accordingly. For instance, if you choose a 200:1 concentration, you would take half the dose recommended for 100:1 concentrations. If you take a lower dose, you can increase your dosage as well, but you may not get the full effect of the supplement."

      "title": "Look for a supplement that was extracted with water rather than ethanol.",
      "content": "Look for a supplement that was extracted with water rather than ethanol. Ethanol extract of tongkat ali has been shown to be toxic at high doses, but extracts made with hot water have been shown to be safe in high doses as well as for long-term use. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You should be able to find the extraction method listed on the packaging or on the manufacturer's website."

      "title": "Taste the extract to make sure it tastes bitter.",
      "content": "Taste the extract to make sure it tastes bitter. Tongkat ali extract contains quassinoids, which are extremely bitter. If your extract doesn’t taste bitter, it may not be made of true tongkat ali, or it may not be a sufficient strength to produce an effect. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Quassinoids are among the bitterest compounds which are found in nature, so the bitter taste in your tongkat ali supplement should be immediately obvious.

      "title": "Take no more than 200-300mg of tongkat ali per day.",
      "content": "Take no more than 200-300mg of tongkat ali per day. Tongkat ali supplements typically come in 100-200mg capsules. Since there is little research supporting the optimal dose of tongkat ali, you should stick to a dosage which is considered safe yet effective. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can take 200-300mg of tongkat ali in one dose, or you can split it into 2 doses throughout the day if you prefer."

      "title": "Take tongkat ali capsules between meals.",
      "content": "Take tongkat ali capsules between meals. Although there is little evidence to indicate the best time of day to take tongkat ali, herbal supplements should usually be taken between meals. This is because fiber from foods can slow the absorption of the supplement into your body. [7] X Research source You will probably want a glass of water to help you swallow the capsule, since it's bitter. Avoid taking herbal supplements with juice, as the acidity can affect the way the extract is absorbed into your body. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a mature plant that is flowering or bearing fruit. If live in Southeast Asia and you want to harvest your own tongkat ali plant, you need to find one which is mature. Tongkat ali plants usually bear fruit when they are 2-3 years old, and you should harvest the plant when it is no more than 4 years old. [9] X Research source When a Tongkat ali plant is ready to harvest, it may have small red or pink flowers, or it may have fruit which starts out green and darkens to red."

      "content": "Pull up the whole tongkat ali plant to access the root. You may have to dig a hole in order to get the whole root without it breaking, since tongkat ali roots usually grow straight down into the ground. [10] X Research source If you want to make your own extract but you don’t live in an area where tongkat ali grows naturally, you can order whole roots online."

      "title": "Wash the roots thoroughly.",
      "content": "Wash the roots thoroughly. Even if you order your plants online, it’s a good idea to wash the root in cool water before you use it, just as with any other vegetable or herb you intend to consume. Eating unwashed fruits and vegetables can cause severe diarrhea and other illnesses, especially if you are visiting from another country. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Dry your tongkat ali roots by placing them in a 100–120 °F (38–49 °C) oven. Traditionally, tongkat ali roots are dried in the sun for several days. However, you can get the same effect by drying the roots in an oven set to 100–120 °F (38–49 °C) for about 72 hours. [12] X Research source To dry your tongkat ali in the sun, lay it flat in a warm, dry place that receives at least 5-6 hours of full sun a day. It may take 3-5 days for the root to dry, or a week or more if you live in a place with high humidity."

      "content": "Slice the tongkat ali root thinly then boil it. Once the root is thoroughly dried, slice it into rounds as thinly as possible. Place several slices into 2–3 cups (470–710 mL) of water, then boil the mixture for about 20 minutes. [13] X Research source Although you can slice your tongkat ali before the drying process, it's easier to cut evenly once it has been dried."
