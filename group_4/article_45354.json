[21] X Research source Steer clear of really harsh cleaners, like rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide—these are tough on your cells, and will do more harm to your piercing than good."

Nostril piercings can be traced back to Biblical times in the Middle East, where husbands would gift their future spouse a golden nose ring (also known as a “shanf”). [26] X Research source Septum piercings can be linked to a variety of different tribes, with some groups placing deep cultural significance on the piercing (like symbolizing a person’s transition from boyhood to manhood). It wasn’t until the mid-to-late 20th century that nose piercings (nostril piercings in particular) became more commonplace in Western society and culture. [27] X Research source"

In the decades that followed (like the 70s and 80s), nose piercings became more synonymous with themes of rebellion and punk-rock culture. Nowadays, however, nose piercings are a popular and decorative trend that can be seen all over the place. [28] X Research source"
