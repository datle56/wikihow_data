      "title": "Tinder’s algorithm matches your profile with other similar profiles.",
      "content": "Tinder’s algorithm matches your profile with other similar profiles. There are a few different things that Tinder takes into account when showing your profile to others: your photos, your bio, and how many people have swiped right on you. The better your profile is and the more right swipes you’ve gotten, the higher your profile goes in the algorithm (which means more people see it). [1] X Research source Tinder also keeps track of who you’re swiping right on and will show you similar profiles. For instance, if you only swipe right on people with hiking pics in their profile, you’re likely to get more outdoorsy folks to match with. Tinder does not track your religion, your ethnicity, or your social status. Your profile will never be boosted or throttled based on those factors."

      "content": "Tinder hasn’t revealed its exact algorithm, but it’s not using Elo anymore. If you’ve been a Tinder-user for a while, you may have heard of an “Elo score,” which is an algorithm that some dating apps use to rank profiles. However, Tinder has said that while they used to use Elo, they are not relying on it anymore. [2] X Research source Some dating apps use the Gale-Shapley algorithm, which pairs users who are similar to each other. It’s unclear exactly what kind of algorithm Tinder uses now, since corporate keeps that info under wraps. However, we know enough that we can tell you how to boost your profile while using Tinder with the tips below."

      "content": "Fill out your profile with pics and a bio. Tinder rewards users who have fun, engaging profiles with good photos and bios. If you haven’t already, be sure to pick out your best photos, and write a funny, creative bio to get more matches . [3] X Research source Need more help filling out your profile?

Make sure that your profile is complete and accurately represents who you are and what you are looking for in a potential partner."

      "content": "Use Tinder often. Yes, it’s true: Tinder rewards its users who swipe on the app often. It’s easy to forget about Tinder and come back to it after a week, but unfortunately, that’s going to throttle your profile. Try to keep up a consistent schedule and use Tinder on a regular basis to hack the algorithm ."

    {
      "title": "Use new features as they’re released on Tinder.",
      "content": "Use new features as they’re released on Tinder. Features like adding your relationship goals or including your pronouns are rolled out on the app fairly often. [4] X Research source If you open up Tinder one day and notice a feature you’ve never seen before, try it out! The algorithm will reward you because it wants its users to test new features."

    {
      "title": "Swipe left sometimes.",
      "content": "Swipe left sometimes. While swiping right on everyone might seem like a good strategy, it can actually backfire in a big way. Swiping right on everyone tells the algorithm that you’re not picky, so they’re going to show your profile to low-quality profiles (like people with no photos or blank bios). Since these low-quality profiles are likely bots, this severely decreases your chances of getting any matches. On the flip side, when you’re picky about who you’re swiping right on, it tells the algorithm that you care about who you’re matching with, boosting your profile and showing you to higher-quality people."

    {
      "title": "Super Like profiles.",
      "content": "Super Like profiles. Super Liking a profile is like giving yourself a temporary boost: it forces Tinder to ignore the algorithm and push your profile to the top of that person’s queue. Use your 1 free Super Like that you get per day, and consider paying for more if you find success that way. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Upgrade to Tinder Platinum, Tinder Gold, or Tinder Plus. Tinder will bump your profile if you’re a paying customer. If you have the money and don’t mind spending a little extra, consider upgrading your profile to see if it makes a difference. If not, you can always cancel and go back to regular Tinder at any time. Here are your upgrade options: [6] X Research source Tinder Plus: unlimited likes and rewinds, plus hides ads. Tinder Gold: unlimited likes and rewinds, hiding ads, 5 Super Likes per day, and 1 Boost per month. Tinder Platinum: unlimited likes and rewinds, hiding ads, 5 Super Likes per day, 1 Boost per month, prioritized likes, and the ability to message someone without matching with them."

      "title": "Delete and remake your account with a new phone number.",
      "content": "Delete and remake your account with a new phone number. While deleting and remaking your account too often can result in a shadowban (meaning Tinder won’t show your profile to many people at all), you can do it once without any repercussions. If you think that your algorithm is messed up, delete your entire profile, then remake it using a different phone number or Facebook account. Since Tinder uses your number or FB account to track who you are, it will think you’re a different person and start your algorithm over from scratch. [7] X Research source Like we mentioned above, be cautious about deleting and remaking your account too many times. If Tinder notices that your profile with the same name and similar photos keeps popping up, it might think you’re a bot (and then throttle your profile)."

      "content": "Pick photos that show off your personality. Selfies are great, but what do they say about you? When you’re looking through your best pics, try to find ones where you’re doing a fun hobby or hanging with friends. The more your photos let your personality shine, the more matches you’re likely to get. [8] X Research source Try taking a quick pic when you’re on a hike or out walking your dog. These tell potential matches a little bit about you before you even start chatting. Choose a high-quality profile picture that is clearly showing your face."

Take a few minutes to write a bio that’s both humorous and engaging to make a great Tinder profile . Let it highlight your interests and personality.

Cons: Can only make pasta.” “Last time I was somebody’s type, I was donating blood.” “Looking for someone to watch horror movies with.”"

Matches won’t be able to see your Instagram handle or your Spotify name, just the pics and songs on your profile."
