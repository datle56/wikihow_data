The front spool pin is in the top center of the machine near the front, which is the part of the machine where the thread guides are visible. Push the spool of thread down onto the spool pin until you hear or feel it click into place. [1] X Research source There should be a spring-like piece that will keep the spool from flying off while you sew."

There should be a loop on the tension disc. Insert the end of the thread through this loop and pull it through. [2] X Research source"

Next, pull the end of the thread towards the front of the sewing machine so that it is directly over the grooved area to your right (when sitting in front of the machine). Bring the thread down into this groove until you reach the bottom of it. [3] X Research source There may be arrows on the front of your machine that indicate the direction in which to move the thread."

Once you reach the bottom of the first guide, reverse the direction of the thread by bringing it around the bottom of the guide and back up to the top. When you reach the top of the machine, bring the thread over the loop at the top of this guide. [4] X Research source At this point, the thread should be forming a narrow U-shape on the front part of your machine."

Bring the thread all the way down to the bottom of the guide and insert it through the guides located just above the sewing machine needle. [5] X Research source These 2 guides will help to ensure that the thread does not get caught on the needle or any of the other moving parts on your machine."

Pull several inches of thread through after you thread the needle to ensure that it will not come undone when you start the machine. [6] X Research source If the end of the thread is frayed or fuzzy, cut it to get a fresh edge. This will make it easier to thread the needle.
