      "content": "Refrain from using topical corticosteroids. The prolonged use of topical corticosteroid creams is the most common cause of perioral dermatitis. Cutting out topical medications or cosmetics, or “zero-therapy,” may help treat mild dermatitis. If you’re taking corticosteroids for a separate condition, ask your doctor to prescribe you an alternative treatment for your condition. [1] X Research source If you’re unable to completely stop using corticosteroids right away, try phasing them out over time. Apply your cream less and less frequently over a couple of weeks until you no longer need it."

      "title": "Consider using natural remedies to treat your symptoms.",
      "content": "Consider using natural remedies to treat your symptoms. For example, some studies suggest that rubbing coconut oil on your rash as a skin moisturizer can help reduce inflammation, fight bacteria, and promote skin healing. Meanwhile, applying aloe vera to the affected area can also be used to treat and prevent redness in some instances of dermatitis. [8] X Research source To use these remedies, use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of the oil to your dermatitis by gently rubbing it in a circular motion onto the area. Not all natural remedies for perioral dermatitis have been thoroughly researched, so you should not rely on these as the principal treatment for your dermatitis."
