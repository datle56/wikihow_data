Take notes about how much active walking you did in a day, as well as how much of your walking was incidental. Keep close record of the habits that are most comfortable for you so that you can adapt to the changes in your daily routine.

If you are in the habit of driving to your local grocery store or driving your kids to school, changing these habits can make a big impact on your step count.

      "content": "Walk in place while doing stationary tasks. If you sit while talking on the phone or watching television, you are missing out on a lot of opportunities to increase your step count. Walking in place or pacing back and forth while you do an otherwise stationary task will increase your step count without you realizing that you are exercising. Consider purchasing a treadmill desk to increase your steps while you work. These walking desks cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 USD."

By going for a small walk after each meal you will begin to create new, healthy habits. Before you know it, walking after you eat will become second nature.
