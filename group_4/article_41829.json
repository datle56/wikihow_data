      "title": "Focus on the first and last sentences in each paragraph.",
      "content": "Focus on the first and last sentences in each paragraph. The first sentence should introduce you to the subject of the paragraph. The last sentence should wrap up the idea and serve as a transition to the next paragraph. By focusing on these parts, you’ll be able to quickly grasp the author’s main point. [1] X Research source After you have determined that the paragraph is necessary to read, go back and scan the body of it. Look for keywords and phrases that relate to the main point. Another option is to go back through all of the paragraphs after you finish reading and read only the first and last sentences of the paragraphs."
