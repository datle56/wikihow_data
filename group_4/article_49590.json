      "title": "A null hypothesis states that there's no relationship between 2 variables.",
      "content": "A null hypothesis states that there's no relationship between 2 variables. When you're doing research, you start by asking a question about the relationship between those 2 variables. Your hypothesis (also called an alternative hypothesis ) is your prediction about the relationship between the 2 variables you're studying. In contrast, the null hypothesis predicts there's no relationship at all. If you're studying statistics , you'll use a mathematical format that reflects the method of data analysis you're using. Research hypothesis: States in plain language that there's no relationship between the 2 variables or there's no difference between the 2 groups being studied. Statistical hypothesis: States the predicted outcome of statistical analysis through a mathematical equation related to the statistical method you're using."

      "content": "Null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses are mutually exclusive. This means that if one of your hypotheses is true, the other must be false. Be careful here, though, because this isn't the same as saying they're opposites. It's possible that they could both be false. [3] X Research source For example, your alternative hypothesis could state a positive correlation between 2 variables while your null hypothesis states there's no relationship. If there's a negative correlation, then both hypotheses are false."

      "content": "Proving the null hypothesis false is a precursor to proving the alternative. If your null hypothesis states that the 2 variables have no relationship, and you prove it false, you can say this demonstrates that the 2 variables do have some relationship. But at the same time, this doesn't necessarily mean that the relationship between the 2 variables is the one you proposed in your alternative hypothesis. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You need additional data or evidence to show that your alternative hypothesis is correct—proving the null hypothesis false is just the first step. In smaller studies, sometimes it's enough to show that there's some relationship and your hypothesis could be correct—you can leave the additional proof as an open question for other researchers to tackle."

Group proportions: Compare the proportion of the variable in your sample with the proportion of the variable in the general population.
