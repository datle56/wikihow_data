      "content": "The green dot shows when someone was recently active on Snapchat. This green dot can stay up to 24 hours after someone has been active, so it isn't an entirely accurate indicator of someone's online activity. In some cases, you may see a measure of time next to the green dot (ex: 5 hours, 23 minutes). There are other ways to tell if someone's online on Snapchat, such as checking Snap Scores, Stories , and Snap Map."
