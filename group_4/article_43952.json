      "content": "Measure and cut a length of kitchen twine. Lay it next to your meat so you can measure before you cut. This will ensure that you have cut the proper length of twine to entirely wrap your meat (or package). If the meat isn't rolled your meat, measure a length 5 times as long as the meat. [1] X Research source If you’ve rolled your meat, measure enough twine to wrap it around twice. [2] X Research source To roll the meat, first, fold in any edges that are not even. The meat should roughly look like a rectangle. Start at one end of the meat, and roll it up tightly, keeping in mind that uniform rolls will cook more evenly. If thinner edges are hanging out, they will cook faster than the roll itself. [3] X Research source Take care to keep stuffing intact as you roll it up."

[10] X Research source To roll the meat, trim or fold in any edges that are not even. Try to get it in a rectangle. Roll the end of the meet up tightly. You want a uniform roll so that it cooks evenly. Thicker rolled meat will cook slower than thin edges that are hanging out. [11] X Research source Watch for stuffing that might fall out as you roll."
