      "title": "Assess how serious the wound is.",
      "content": "Assess how serious the wound is. If your dog has injured its paw severely, it's best to get it veterinary treatment right away. Look at the paw and see if it is bleeding uncontrollably, if there is an open wound, or if there are any problems with your dog's movement of the paw. If you see any of these things, then you should take it to a vet's office right away. If your dog only has minor bleeding or a small injury, then you can treat it with a wrap. If the bottom of the paw is skinned, your dog may have a ripped or torn pad. You can wrap this at home in most cases. Take a picture of the wound before you wrap it. If the injury worsens or becomes infected, you can show the picture to the vet. This will help them understand the severity of the problem."

    {
      "title": "Clean",
      "content": "Clean any wounds. Before wrapping up your dog's paw, you need to make sure any injuries are clean. Wash out the wound with cold water and baby soap to get rid of any debris. Then disinfect the wound with a veterinary disinfectant or anti-bacterial soap so that it can heal without becoming infected. [1] X Research source Be sure to thoroughly clean a torn pad . An injury on the bottom of your dog's paw is likely to be pretty dirty, so it will need some extra care to get really clean. Avoid putting harsh chemicals on your dog's paw. Baby soap will clean the wound without harming your dog."

    {
      "title": "Dry the area.",
      "content": "Dry the area. After cleaning the dog's wound you want to make sure that the area is as dry as possible. Use a towel and remove as much moisture as possible. This will ensure that the wrap doesn't become wet when it is applied, which can be uncomfortable and cold for the dog. Making sure the area is dry before wrapping it up will minimize the chance of bacteria growing inside the wrap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the dog still.",
      "content": "Hold the dog still. When wrapping a dog's paw you need to have a good hold on your dog. Most dogs will not like having their paw handled, especially if it is injured. Have your dog lay down and hold it still while you are wrapping its paw. Ask someone to help you hold your dog if it is large and hard to handle or very resistant to you touching its paw."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a sterile pad on any wounds.",
      "content": "Place a sterile pad on any wounds. When wrapping up a paw you need to protect any open wounds. Place a gauze pad over the wound so that any blood or discharge will be absorbed. The pad also adds additional padding that can protect the wound. [2] X Research source The gauze pad should be sterile because it is coming in direct contact with an open wound. If your dog does not have a surface wound, then the sterile pad is not necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a cotton wrap.",
      "content": "Apply a cotton wrap. Hold the gauze pad in place, if you have applied it, and begin wrapping the cotton wrap around the whole paw. Start at the top of the paw, move the wrapping down towards the bottom of the paw, and then back up above the ankle. This layer provides padding, which protects the injury. You only need to wrap the cotton once or twice around the wound. If you wrap it any more, you might restrict your dog's movement. When wrapping a dog's paw, you need to cover the area above the paw to allow the wrapping to stay in place. You should wrap the leg to above the ankle joint."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the area in gauze.",
      "content": "Wrap the area in gauze. You need to place gauze over the cotton layer. Use a roll of gauze bandaging. With this layer, you can apply a bit of tension but you don't want to pull it very tight. This will keep the cotton in place and provide some compression to the bandage. A gauze layer that is wrapped too tight can cut off the circulation in a dog's paw. Make sure that the gauze is snug but not so tight the cotton underneath it is totally compressed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a layer of elastic covering.",
      "content": "Apply a layer of elastic covering. There is a special product that is used on the outside layer of a wrap that is an elastic gauze. It is self-adhering and holds the layers of bandaging in place. Seal the elastic by running a pen or your fingers along the edges. This will make it harder for your dog to remove. As with the gauze layer, you don't want to pull the elastic covering too tight or you could cut off circulation in the dog's paw. Only wrap the elastic covering tight enough to pull the wrinkles out of the wrap. This will ensure that the wrap is securely on the dog's paw. Because it can wrap so smoothly, this elastic wrap also minimizes the dog's ability to open up the wrap."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the dog from biting at the wrap.",
      "content": "Keep the dog from biting at the wrap. Once the bandage is on the dog's paw, you need to make sure your dog leaves it alone. Keep an eye on your dog and make sure it is not chewing on it. If the dog cannot leave its bandages alone, you may need to put a cone on the dog. By putting a cone on the dog you minimize the animal's ability to physically get its mouth near its bandages. To keep the dog from chewing the bandages, try mixing cayenne powder, paprika, and petroleum jelly. Rub this mixture along the outside of the bandage. Your dog won't like the taste, and it will keep it from chewing the bandage."

      "title": "Change the wrap daily.",
      "content": "Change the wrap daily. A wrap should be changed daily in order to keep the area under it clean and healthy. Take off the old wrap by cutting it vertically with a pair of scissors. Then apply the wrap again, with the same method you used previously. [3] X Research source Talk to your veterinarian about how often they want the wrap changed, in addition to how long they want the wrap to be applied. Changing the wrap daily allows you to adjust the tightness of the wrap. This can be helpful if the injured area has any increase or decrease in swelling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the injured area.",
      "content": "Inspect the injured area. While you are changing your dog's wrap, you should look closely at the injured area. Make sure that any surface injuries are healing and are not infected. Signs of infection include redness, discharge, and swelling. Also assess whether your dog can move its paw and it there are any signs of continued pain when you are handling the injured area."
