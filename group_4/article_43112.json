      "content": "Mold and discoloration If you see white or fuzzy spots where the yellow corn should be, this is likely a sign of mold growth. You should toss the whole cob and look through the other cobs for signs of contamination. [1] X Research source However, it’s important to note that not all mold is created equally, as huitlacoche is a type of corn mold that is edible and considered a delicacy in Mexico. Huitlacoche is a black, edible fungus that grows on corn. It’s often used in quesadillas, tamales, and soups. [2] X Research source To be safe, however, it’s best to toss out corn that appears to have any type of mold on it."

      "title": "Slimy appearance and texture",
      "content": "Slimy appearance and texture Corn kernels should be plump and firm. If they’re mushy, shriveled, or slimy, the corn is probably no longer good to eat. While it may not make you sick, it likely has little flavor and an off-putting texture, so don’t feel bad about tossing it! A slimy film is most common with pre-packaged corn on the cob. If the packaged corn looks slimy, it’s likely gone bad."

      "title": "Dry husk leaves or silk",
      "content": "Dry husk leaves or silk Although a dry husk doesn’t always mean that the corn inside is no longer safe to eat, it’s a sign of age as well as wear and tear. Appearance often dictates taste, so a dull or dry husk might mean that the corn has lost both flavor and moisture. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The husk should be green and vibrant. Brown and brittle husks could mean the corn is past its prime. Corn silk should be, well—silky, and soft to the touch."

      "title": "Off-putting smell",
      "content": "Off-putting smell A rancid, sour, or moldy smell is a dead giveaway that your corn is no longer safe to eat. Fresh corn should smell sweet, earthy, grassy, and sometimes fruity, depending on the kind of corn. If the smell coming from your crisper drawer is unpleasant, it’s time to toss it.

      "content": "Unpleasant taste Tasting potentially bad corn should be your final course of action. If you must take a nibble to decide whether it’s good or not, a rancid, sour, or bitter flavor are signs that your answer is no. Toss it out and never look back!"

      "content": "Yes, corn on the cob goes bad. Typically, fresh corn will stay good to eat for up to 1 week in the crisper drawer of your fridge. However, it’s recommended that you eat your corn the same day you buy it as the flavor and quality is likely to degrade the longer you wait. Signs that corn has gone bad include mushy and/or slimy kernels, mold growth, and an unpleasant smell."

      "content": "Fresh corn keeps fresh for up to 7 days in the fridge. Generally speaking, corn on the cob comes with a 5-day expiration label. This isn’t to say that corn is inedible after this window of time closes, but it is likely to degrade in flavor, texture, and overall quality. Ideally, corn should be eaten the same day you bring it home, but it will keep in the crisper drawer for 5-7 days max if it’s unshucked and parceled neatly in its husk. [5] X Research source Unshucked corn has a slightly shorter shelf—or fridge—life at around 2-3 days."

      "content": "Frozen corn can last up to 12 months. Raw frozen corn, whether it’s on the cob or shucked into kernel form, can keep for up to one year in the freezer, although flavor peaks at around the 6-month mark. Cooked and stored frozen corn will typically last 6-10 months. You may want to consider blanching the corn prior to freezing it, as this will help preserve the texture. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Store unshucked corn in its husk for up to 7 days. The corn husk acts as a baby blanket for fresh corn, naturally sealing in flavor and moisture. Store the corn in its husk in the crisper drawer of your fridge for up to 7 days. While it should stay fresh for about a week, check in on your corn daily to watch for any signs of spoilage. Mold tends to appear first at the tip, so always inspect carefully before consuming."

You can store the corn cobs in a Ziplock bag and place the bag in your crisper drawer for up to 3 days. Shucked corn does have a shorter shelf life of about 2-3 days, so try to eat it as quickly as possible!"

      "content": "Freeze corn cobs or shucked corn for up to 6 months. Choose between freezing your corn on the cob whole or shucking the corn and freezing the kernels. Either way, place the corn in an airtight plastic freezer bag and squeeze as much air out of the bag as you can. This will help maintain freshness. Date the bags and pop them in the freezer for up to 1 year, but try to use them no later than 6 months in for optimal corn flavor. [7] X Research source Before freezing the corn, you can blanch it to help it retain its signature chewy texture. Alternatively, you can choose to blanch or boil it later on, right before you’re ready to eat it."

      "content": "Go for fresh corn that hasn’t had the husk removed. Preferably, corn should remain in its husk as this helps to seal in freshness. Pre-packaged corn in plastic containers don’t retain their moisture for long and you don’t have the luxury of feeling the corn to determine if it’s good to eat. Go for the bright green husked corn with the vibrant yellow kernels! [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick heavier cobs of corn. At the store, pick up a corn cob and note how heavy it is in relation to the size of the cob. Juicy, delicious corn will have more sweetness and moisture, often weighing more than you’d expect just by looking at it. Older, drying corn will feel lighter than it looks to be. Use your discernment! [9] X Research source"

Although peeling back the corn husk at the store is frowned upon since it often leaves a mess behind, you can peel it back slightly to reveal the cob if you’re still unsure about your selection. If the kernels are yellow and firm, the corn is ripe for the picking, so to speak! [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Regular mold on corn is not safe to eat. Inedible corn molds are likely to have a slimy appearance with a rancid smell. If you see this type of mold on your store-bought corn, then you should throw it out. While there are some types of fungi that are safe to eat on corn (like huitlacoche), it’s unlikely that you’d find such a fungus on your store-bought corn. If you’re not sure whether the mold on your corn is safe or not to eat, it’s best to err on the side of caution and throw it out, as you don’t want to risk food poisoning."

While finding a squishy caterpillar in your corn cob may make your stomach turn, it actually doesn’t have to be a death sentence for your corn!

      "content": "What if the kernels in my corn are oddly sized or missing? This could indicate a pest infestation or spoilage. A few missing kernels is acceptable, since kernels are individually pollinated and some may have slipped by the wayside, but if you notice large chunks of missing or irregular kernels, earworms or blights may have affected this particular harvest. If this is the case, it’s best to throw it away. [12] X Research source"
