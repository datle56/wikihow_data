Be honest with yourself about whether you’re capable of holding onto this secret.

I genuinely believe in our relationship, and I wouldn’t have cheated if I was thinking straight.” If he says, “How can I ever trust you?” respond, “I don’t expect you to trust me. I know that if we can rebuild trust, it will take a lot of work on my end to show you that I’m committed to you.” If you suspect your boyfriend might get too angry or violent, prepare an escape option.
