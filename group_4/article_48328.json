  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "You don’t have to give him the time of day if you don’t want to.",
      "content": "You don’t have to give him the time of day if you don’t want to. If your relationship ended poorly or he cheated on you, it might be best to not respond. If he keeps reaching out, you may even want to block his number. [1] X Research source This is also true if he texts you at odd hours in the morning. If he only texts you late at night or while he’s drunk, he’s probably not being legit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let him down gently.",
      "content": "Let him down gently. If you’ve moved on (or you’re trying to move on), let him know in no uncertain terms. It’s a kind yet firm way to let him down and tell him that he needs to let you go. [2] X Research source Don’t be surprised if he doesn’t respond to a text like this. He might feel hurt and need to take some time for himself. If he responds and gets angry, it might be best to block his number. It's always good to keep your answers as concise and simple as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remind him that he needs to worry about someone else now.",
      "content": "Remind him that he needs to worry about someone else now. While it can feel flattering to get an “I miss you” from an ex, if he’s dating someone new, it’s not fair to that person to stay in contact. Let your ex know that you two can’t chat while he’s with someone else. [3] X Research source Your ex’s new boo probably has no idea you two are still in contact. It’s not nice of your ex to blindside them like that."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell him that you’re unavailable.",
      "content": "Tell him that you’re unavailable. Texting your ex when you have a new partner is risky, and you might just want to ignore his texts altogether. However, if your ex didn’t know that you were seeing someone, you can tell him so he (hopefully) stops reaching out. [4] X Research source If you and your new partner are serious, you might even want to let them know that your ex texted you. That way, there won’t be any trust issues about it down the line. Even if you aren’t in a relationship, you can use this excuse just to get your ex to stop reaching out."
    },
    {
      "title": "People often look back at all the good in a relationship.",
      "content": "People often look back at all the good in a relationship. However, you can remind your ex about why you two broke up in the first place. If he asks what you mean, follow up with all the bad parts of your relationship and why you two wouldn’t work out as a couple again. [5] X Research source For instance, you could say, “Remember how opposite our interests are? You would end up hanging out with your friends and I’d be with mine. We barely spent any time together.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "If you got dumped, have him explain why.",
      "content": "If you got dumped, have him explain why. This is a good response to use if you’re missing closure within the relationship. If he reaches back out without an explanation, make him talk about what he did and why he did it. If he really wants to get back together with you, he’ll be able to talk through it all without hesitation. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "This one will really take him aback.",
      "content": "This one will really take him aback. If you find the fact that he misses you super funny or you can’t believe he would try that line on you after everything he’s done, simply reply with a laughing emoji or an “lmfao.” This is a fairly scathing way to reply, and he should get the hint. If he’s smart, he won’t reply again. [7] X Research source This is a perfect response to use if he’s trying to contact you late at night or while he’s drunk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Completely move on from the “I miss you.”",
      "content": "Completely move on from the “I miss you.” If you were having a conversation before, just keep it going like nothing happened. If you got a message out of the blue, you could say something like: [8] X Research source “Speaking of missing, have you seen my blue sweater? I can’t find it anywhere.” “Yeah, I really miss your dog. How’s she doing?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell him that you’ve already moved on from him.",
      "content": "Tell him that you’ve already moved on from him. This curt reply should stop him in his tracks and make him reevaluate. If he keeps reaching out, feel free to block his number or tell him to stop contacting you. [9] X Research source Don’t let your ex reaching out throw off any of your progress. If you were doing well moving on, keep doing you!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Only choose this one if you’d like to get back together.",
      "content": "Only choose this one if you’d like to get back together. Before you reply, think long and hard about why the relationship ended and what it might look like in the future. If you think you and your ex have a real shot again, then give him the reply that he probably wants to hear. [10] X Research source If you’re getting a late night or drunk text, now’s not the time to discuss your relationship. If your ex reaches out in the middle of the day and wants to talk, though, you can be open to a discussion with him. Instead of immediately asking for the relationship back, look for an opportunity to go on a date first. Reader Poll: We asked 447 wikiHow readers of readers who are considering getting back together with their ex, and 53% said that their biggest fear is repeating the same mistakes and just ending up hurt again . [Take Poll] Getting back together with an ex can be amazing—but it’s important to make sure that things are different, so that they end differently too."
