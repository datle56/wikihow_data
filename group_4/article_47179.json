      "content": "Waiting for true love is better than settling. Once you settle, you’ll constantly wonder if there’s someone else out there who makes you feel the way you want to feel—happy, secure, confident, limitless. And chances are, the relationship you settled for won’t last very long, anyway. [1] X Research source Settling also isn’t fair to your partner, who deserves to find someone who can love them the way they should be loved (just like you deserve that, too)."

      "content": "Waiting for the right person lets you practice love in the meantime. You won’t magically become an ideal partner when you enter a relationship, but you can work on yourself while you wait. That way, when the right person comes along, you’ll know more about your own needs and how to care for someone else’s. For example, you might read more books, talk to and make more friends, or just spend time alone to make yourself a more well-rounded person while you look for love. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Make a new best friend by asking acquaintances about themselves or hang out with your existing friends or family to strengthen your current relationships.

      "content": "Get to know more about yourself with new experiences. Find yourself before someone else finds you—that way, you’ll know who you are and what you bring to the table rather than playing catch-up when the right person shows up in your life. Find your passion by asking yourself what you value and find meaningful, Try loads of different things (hobbies, careers, philosophies) to see what sticks. For example, if you love art, you might practice painting or writing. Who knows? The love of your life might just be looking for a budding artist."

Go back to school? Move to a new town? Getting some life experience under your belt boosts your confidence and makes life feel more worth living, even without romance. The truth is that love won’t “complete” you—it’s just another ingredient to life that can make the rest shine a little brighter."

      "content": "Nourish your body with exercise and a healthy diet. No, you definitely don’t need an hourglass figure to find true love, but taking good care of yourself shows others that you care for yourself. Dating coach and matchmaker Alessandra Conti encourages us to try “feeling like you're looking like the best version of yourself through physical activity and…physical self-care.” Get some light exercise and fresh air for 30 minutes a day like walking or jogging. You’ll feel better, and your body will thank you. Eat healthier by getting balanced meals with fruits, veggies, and proteins. Avoid skipping meals or falling back on fast food multiple times a week."

Dating coach John Keegan says that “you have to really look at your core values, and whoever you date, no matter what else…[should] match your values.” Make a list of all the qualities you want in a partner. Are they funny? Patient? Smart? How do they make you feel? You might not find someone who checks every box, but if they make you truly happy, that's what really counts."

      "content": "Reconsider what your ideal partner is like. We all have dreams of a knight in shining armor. But your perfect partner might look nothing like how you imagine them while still being everything you want and need. [4] X Research source Ask yourself: Are you holding your romantic options to unfair standards? For example, the “average guy” doesn’t have a 6-pack or maybe even a full head of hair. That doesn’t make him a less loving partner. Plenty of partners that might appear attractive aren’t a good match for you; you might be sabotaging yourself with your own standards."

      "content": "Read what others have said about waiting for love. Sometimes, just knowing that other people have shared your longing is enough to soothe your aching heart and find the determination to keep waiting. “If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.”—Oscar Wilde “You don't find love, it finds you. It's got a little bit to do with destiny, fate, and what's written in the stars.”―Anaïs Nin [7] X Research source “I’ve learned that waiting is the most difficult bit, and I want to get used to the feeling, knowing that you’re with me, even when you’re not by my side.”―Paulo Coelho [8] X Research source “Hope for love, pray for love, wish for love, dream for love…but don’t put your life on hold waiting for love.”―Mandy Hale “Maybe that's what love was, finding the person who brings out the best in you and eliminates the worst.”―Diana Holquist “Don't let the fear of being alone or the fear of not finding someone make you settle for less than what you deserve.”―Carrie Hope Fletcher [9] X Research source “Love is a journey and a destination―long and excruciating on the way, unexpected and ecstatic if found.”―Stewart Stafford “Some of us were made to believe that you need a man, or a woman, to be happy. I say you need to know yourself and love yourself to find that elusive emotion that we call happiness.”―Hagir Elsheikh “To walk the path of intentionally and consciously finding love, you need to start with the main question: Where do I want to go?”―Crista Beck “In the journey of finding love I focus on loving myself first.”―Angel Moreira “I'm not everyone's cup of tea...But I'm someone's.”―Dan Pearce “When it comes to love and relationships, most of us fail our way to success.”―Kevin Darné [10] X Research source “As love leads the way, the steps will be made easy.”―David Scott [11] X Research source “Marrying the wrong person only denies you both a chance at your soul mate.”―Alessandra Torre [12] X Research source"
