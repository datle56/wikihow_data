Most people who have type 1 diabetes will experience an acute episode as their body loses the ability to make insulin. This means their symptoms will start suddenly and all at once. However, people with type 2 diabetes usually have symptoms that slowly develop as their condition starts and then worsens.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which your body’s own immune system attacks the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. After these cells are gone, your body cannot make insulin, which is necessary to manage your blood sugar. This means your body can’t regulate its blood sugar. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes either too little or no insulin. Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease."

      "content": "Recognize type 2 diabetes means your body can’t properly use insulin. Your body can become resistant to insulin over time. This means your body must produce more and more insulin to regulate your blood sugar. In some cases, this can overwork your pancreas, causing it to stop making enough insulin. [4] X Research source If you have type 2 diabetes, your body is either resistant to the insulin your body makes, meaning it can’t use it properly, or your body no longer makes enough insulin.
