      "title": "Scorpio can be vengeful.",
      "content": "Scorpio can be vengeful. A fixed water sign, Scorpio feels things deeply and in extremes. There is no halfway for Scorpio; it’s all or nothing, love or hate. While this means Scorpios make extraordinary friends and partners when you’re on their good side, they’re fierce foes if you don’t treat them right. Perceptive, calculating and capable of holding grudges for eons, Scorpio will sting you with the harshness of a scorpion if you wrong them. [1] X Research source Scorpio’s “stings” are often slow and quiet. When a Scorpio lashes out, they use strategies that take a long time to hurt like spreading rumors to hurt your social status or sending so many mixed signals, it’s hard to make heads or tails of your own feelings, let alone theirs. [2] X Research source Appropriate for a fixed water sign, when Scorpio is in dangerous territory, they tend to ice people out. They remain eerily calm even when they’re hurt."

      "title": "Aries tends to angrily erupt.",
      "content": "Aries tends to angrily erupt. A cardinal fire sign who’s ruled by Mars, Aries is appropriately aggressive. This aggression is often channeled healthily, making Aries a courageous thrill-seeker with a delightful love of competition. However, the youngest of the zodiac can be prone to explosive outbursts. When Aries is in a bad mood, conversations with them can feel like holding a match near a stick of dynamite. [3] X Research source Aries’ outbursts are quick and painful. When they’re angry, they’ll likely scream and say disproportionately hurtful things, then apologize after their fiery temper has calmed down."

      "title": "When they're angry, Capricorn takes no prisoners.",
      "content": "When they're angry, Capricorn takes no prisoners. Ruling the house of status and career, Capricorn is the most ambitious sign of the entire zodiac. This means they’re hard workers and rarely take things personally, which can be refreshing. But this can also be a weakness. They’re not afraid to hurt people in order to achieve their goals. Capricorn is great at taking responsibility so their goals are often fair and just, but if you’re in their way, you could end up as collateral damage. [4] X Research source “I don’t care,” “figure it out,” or “deal with it” are common mantras you’ll hear from a Capricorn, especially if they have a deadline coming up."

      "title": "Cancer can use emotions to manipulate.",
      "content": "Cancer can use emotions to manipulate. A cardinal water sign, Cancer is kind, sensitive, and has extraordinary instincts when it comes to taking care of people’s needs. However, if a Cancer feels ignored, they can weaponize these traits and become smothering or controlling. Cancer is a beacon of light when there is balance in their life; just be sure to keep your distance if there isn’t. [5] X Research source Cancer’s most common manipulation tool is guilt. They’ll often use their love as a bargaining chip with comments like “If you really loved me, you’d…” or “I guess you just don’t love me.” [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Aquarius plays mind games.",
      "content": "Aquarius plays mind games. A fixed air sign, Aquarius loves intellectual pursuits. They’re playful, self-deprecating, and have great senses of humor . However, sometimes their morbid curiosity gets the best of them and they’ll use their strengths to toy with people, triggering them just to see what will happen. Aquarius is the humanitarian of the zodiac, so they’re capable of deep compassion, but their contrarian ways can be hurtful if they get out of control. [7] X Research source Direct communication is the best way to shut Aquarius mind games down. Be clear that their behavior is hurtful or unnecessary and, since their airiness likes to keep them from confrontation, they’ll likely back down."

      "title": "It can be tricky trusting Gemini.",
      "content": "It can be tricky trusting Gemini. Airy and mutable, Gemini make excellent communicators and great friends. However, their dynamic, ever-changing personality and tendency to talk about anything and everything cause them to spill secrets fairly often. Unless you're very clear what you’re saying is confidential, it’s dangerous telling Gemini sensitive information. [8] X Research source When in doubt, just avoid telling Gemini secrets. Since they love juicy gossip and have that airy sense of detachment, they’re not likely to take you doing so personally. It’ll save you a lot of stress."

      "title": "Libra knows your weaknesses.",
      "content": "Libra knows your weaknesses. Ruling the 7th house of partnerships, Libra is great at reading people. Often peaceful and diplomatic, Libra is often a soothing force. However, their natural intelligence and way with words make them capable of cutting people down in ways that hit right at their core. Libras are kind and good-natured so they rarely lash out, but if they do, they know exactly what buttons of yours to push. [9] X Research source The best way to handle a Libra lashing out is to apologize and try to find compromise. Symbolized by the scale, Libra looks for balance. If you can recenter your relationship, you’ll be able to minimize emotional damage."

      "title": "Falling for a Sagittarius is risky.",
      "content": "Falling for a Sagittarius is risky. Ruled by Jupiter, the planet of expansion, Sagittarius is a kind, optimistic, larger-than-life personality. This makes them easy to love. However, Sagittarius is deeply mutable and rules the house of travel, which means they’re always on the move and unafraid to leave people behind. It’s appropriate Sagittarius is a fire sign, because getting close to (and especially dating ) a Sag can feel like playing with an open flame. [10] X Research source As a fire sign, Sagittarius is driven by passion and inspiration. Communicate to them how much they’ve inspired you and how much they mean to you. They’ll be much more likely to find a way to make your distance work."

      "title": "When Taurus gets angry, they might get physical.",
      "content": "When Taurus gets angry, they might get physical. Symbolized by the bull, Taurus has an explosive temper and, because they’re ruled by Venus which focuses heavily on their bodies, fights with them can get rough and physical. However, Taurus is better at taking a joke than almost any other sign. They’re extremely patient and don’t get provoked easily. It’s extremely rare Taurus lashes out and, if they do, it’s usually to protect themselves or their loved ones. [11] X Research source The best way to help (and mitigate the risk of) a Taurus when they’re angry is to give them something to hit. They need to express themselves physically so a wall or a punching bag can help them channel their rage in a harmless way."

      "title": "Leo’s pride puts them in unnecessary battles.",
      "content": "Leo’s pride puts them in unnecessary battles. A fixed fire sign, Leo is energetic, and feisty. Like the lion that represents them, they’re extremely proud people and sometimes their egos will force them to keep fighting , even long after they’ve lost. However, Leos are mostly self-contained. While they have a flair for the dramatic, their behavior is often just that: a lot of spectacle but no true malice. Also like the Lion, Leos are warm and playful. They rarely hold grudges. [12] X Research source Leos love to make a scene so fights with them will often happen in public. If you’re embarrassed by having people watch you fight, steer clear of ever insulting a Leo."

      "title": "Pisces can be dangerous to themselves.",
      "content": "Pisces can be dangerous to themselves. A mutable water sign, Pisces picks up emotional energies more than anyone. Their unending well of empathy, combined with their intuition (they rule the house of the unknown) make them wise friends and loving partners. However, their acute sensitivity to everyone’s thoughts and feelings makes them highly vulnerable to toxic vibes and attitudes. They often deal with this negative energy by wearing themselves so thin they become sick or overindulging in dangerous habits. [13] X Research source Check in regularly on your Pisces friends. It’s not uncommon that, in their quest for making the world a better place, they’ll forget to eat or sleep. Moderation is the best lesson a Pisces can learn. While they don’t need to avoid indulgences like drinking altogether, Pisces struggle to pace themselves and their mutability can make them easily swayed to go too hard to fast."

      "title": "Virgo’s ambition can be their biggest hazard.",
      "content": "Virgo’s ambition can be their biggest hazard. A mutable Earth sign, Virgo has a pulsing desire to better themselves and those around them. However, this often gives them impossibly high expectations that can never truly be met. This leads to resentment and, in particularly bad cases, even rage. But Virgo is, by nature, kind and well-meaning. As long as you treat them right and remind them to set reasonable goals, having a Virgo in your life is a blessing. [14] X Research source Patience is key to quelling Virgo’s anger and resentment. Validate their feelings while reminding them to be kind to themselves and others and they’ll usually calm down pretty quickly."
