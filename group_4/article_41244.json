Practice active listening skills by getting rid of distractions and making eye contact with the person you’re chatting with.

To avoid oversharing, ask questions about the other person’s occupation, living situation, and hobbies. That way, they can share more about themselves, and you can both learn a thing or two about each other.

If you don’t want to talk about something (relationship problems, past trauma, grief, etc.), casually change the subject by giving them a compliment or pointing out something about your environment.

When you find yourself veering toward those subjects, use the methods above to avoid them. That way, you can stop yourself from oversharing from the get-go.

When you’re upset, you might find that you post things you normally wouldn’t on your social media accounts. To avoid oversharing on social media , log out of your accounts any time you’re feeling overwhelmed or distraught. That way, you won’t be tempted to tell people things online that you don’t actually want to share. [6] X Research source"
