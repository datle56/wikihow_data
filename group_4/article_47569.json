    {
      "title": "Brush out your hair.",
      "content": "Brush out your hair. To create a neat ponytail, your hair should be as smooth as possible. Run your favorite brush or comb through your hair to remove any tangles or knots. [1] X Research source Ponytails work well with all hair types. However, if your hair is curly or wavy, you can straighten your hair before creating the ponytail for a sleeker look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather all of your hair where you’d like to position the ponytail.",
      "content": "Gather all of your hair where you’d like to position the ponytail. You can use your brush or fingers to pull all of your hair back and hold it in a single hand. Collect the hair where you want the finished pony to be -- the middle back of your head, just beneath the crown, is a traditional spot, but you can go higher at the actual crown or lower at the nape of your neck if you prefer. [2] X Research source While ponytails are usually positioned at the back of your head, you can also create one that’s off to the side just behind your ear if you prefer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the ponytail with an elastic.",
      "content": "Secure the ponytail with an elastic. Holding your hair in hand, use your free hand to wrap an elastic around your hair right against your head. Wrap the elastic as many times as necessary to hold the pony in place, and once the pony is secure, pull on the tail just behind the elastic to tighten it. [3] X Research source You don’t necessarily have to use a hair elastic to secure the ponytail. A hair clip or ribbon can work well too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hide the elastic with a strand of hair for a sophisticated look.",
      "content": "Hide the elastic with a strand of hair for a sophisticated look. A basic ponytail can look neat and polished, but you can dress up the style a bit by hiding the elastic with a strand of hair. Use your fingers to lift a piece of hair from the side of the tail behind the elastic. Wrap the hair around the base of the pony so the elastic is concealed, and secure the hair in place with a bobby pin. [4] X Research source Try to wrap the hair around the elastic so the end of the strand is on the underside of the ponytail to ensure the bobby pin isn’t visible. For an even fancier look, create a thin braid from the strand of hair that you lift from the ponytail before wrapping it around the base."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the ponytail through above the elastic to create twirls.",
      "content": "Pull the ponytail through above the elastic to create twirls. Loosen your ponytail a bit by sliding the elastic toward the end a bit to create a gap between the elastic and your head. Pull the tail of the pony over the elastic and through the gap until the entire tail is lying flat again and there are pretty twirls on either side of the ponytail’s base."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull your hair back into a medium-high ponytail.",
      "content": "Pull your hair back into a medium-high ponytail. Brush through your hair to smooth it, and gather it into a traditional ponytail beneath the crown of your head. Secure it with an elastic so it rests just below the crown of your head. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the hair around the ponytail base to create a bun.",
      "content": "Twist the hair around the ponytail base to create a bun. Grab the end of the ponytail with your hand, and carefully wrap it around the base of the pony to form the bun. Keep it fairly tight as you wrap, so the hair will stay in place. [6] X Research source If you have fine or thin hair, you may want to use a sock or hair donut to shape the bun. It can help bulk up the bun."
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure the bun with bobby pins.",
      "content": "Secure the bun with bobby pins. Once you’ve wrapped the ponytail around the base, use bobby pins to keep the bun in place. Use at least 4 pins to secure the bun on all sides. [7] X Research source If you have particularly thick or coarse hair, you’ll likely need more than 4 bobby pins to keep the bun in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply hairspray.",
      "content": "Apply hairspray. To ensure that the bun stays in place all day, spray your entire head with a light coat of hairspray. Use a flexible-hold formula to avoid winding up with stiff, sticky hair. [8] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tease",
      "content": "Tease the top section of your hair. Gather the top layer of your hair that falls over the crown of your head. Hold the hair straight up, and use a teasing comb to brush down against the hair about halfway to the roots to add volume. When you’re done, flip the hair forward over your forehead to keep it out of the way. If your hair is particularly thick, you may want to divide the top layer into 2 or 3 sections for teasing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Gather your hair at the base of your neck.",
      "content": "Gather your hair at the base of your neck. Use your fingers to lightly brush through the rest of your hair. Collect all of it at the nape of your neck as if you were making a low ponytail. Once you’ve gathered the hair, comb through it with your fingers once more to ensure that it’s as smooth as possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Twist the hair into a tight roll.",
      "content": "Twist the hair into a tight roll. Starting at the base of your neck, begin twisting the hair from the roots toward the ends. Keep it very tight, and continue until you’re approximately three-quarters of the way down the hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the hair up against your head and pin it into place.",
      "content": "Bring the hair up against your head and pin it into place. Holding the hair carefully to keep the twist in place, pull the hair up so it rests against your head. Continue twisting the hair as you go, so it’s rolled all the way to the end, and push bobby pins into both sides along the twist to hold it in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck any errant hair into the twist.",
      "content": "Tuck any errant hair into the twist. Pull any loose hairs at the end of the twist into a tiny bun, tucking any stray pieces beneath the twist. Stick a few more bobby pins through the ends and down into the twist."

    {
      "title": "Pull the teased section back and smooth it into the twist.",
      "content": "Pull the teased section back and smooth it into the twist. Use your fingers to carefully bring the hair back toward the twist and lay it over the twist. Work the pieces into the twist so they’re fully incorporated, and pin them in place. If the teased section seems a little too messy, you may want to use a brush or comb to smooth it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spray your hair with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray your hair with hairspray. To keep your hair in place all night, apply a light layer of hairspray over your French twist. A flexible- or medium- hold formula is the best option because it won’t make your hair stiff."
