UNO House Rules plays almost the exact same way as a standard game of UNO, but there are chances to make each game unique with custom rules. Whenever someone plays an Add-a-Rule number card for the first time, they get to make up their a rule that happens whenever that number is played again. [1] X Research source There can be up to 5 custom house rules at a time during the game. Players also have the chance to change the house rules for specific numbers when they play a Game Changer card."

If you’re playing a 2-player game, you get to go again right away. Reverse: The direction of play switches. If players were taking turns clockwise around the table, switch to going counter-clockwise and vice-versa. Wild: You can play a Wild on top of any card. Choose the next color that players have to play. You can choose a new color or the same color. Wild Draw 4: The next player draws 4 cards and loses their turn. Alternatively, a player can challenge you if they think you have a card in your hand that matches the top of the discard pile. If you don’t have a matching card, the player who challenged you draws 6 cards and loses their turn. If you have any matching cards, you draw 4 cards and the next player takes their turn as normal. Wild Game Changer: Make a new house rule for one of the number cards. If no one has made a house rule yet, you don’t get to make a new rule. Then, choose the color that players need to play next."
