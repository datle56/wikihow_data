Remove approx. 3 inches (7.6 cm) of insulation from the outside of the four lines located within the power cord. Once for inner lines are visible remove approx. 1in. of insulation from the red, white and black lines, revealing copper wire. Be aware that the power lines are referred to as: L1, L2, L3 respectively however there is no specific order to the power lines, meaning these tittles can be used interchangeably."
