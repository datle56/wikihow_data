      "content": "Turn your hand into the shape of a gun. Make a fist with your hand. Release your index finger so that it points straight out. Release your thumb so it points straight upward. This is the basic structure of the one-handed gun."

      "content": "Loop a rubber band under your little finger. Release your little finger from your fist so that it points straight out. With the opposite hand, grab the rubber band and slide it over your little finger at the first knuckle crease toward the top of the finger. Close your finger back into your fist."

      "title": "Pull the rubber band onto your index finger.",
      "content": "Pull the rubber band onto your index finger. Stretch the loose end of the rubber band past your thumb and let it rest on the tip of your index finger. Place it right in the middle of your fingertip so it doesn't slip off."

      "content": "Fire the gun. Keep your index finger pointing straight forward and your thumb pointing straight upward. Open your little finger from your fist to allow the rubber band to slip off and fly in the direction you’re pointing at.

      "content": "Hold the rubber band between your index and thumb fingers. Loop one end of the rubber band around your index finger. Loop the other end of the rubber band around your thumb on the same hand. Position your hand so that your thumb and index fingers are pointing straight up. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Insert your other index finger into the rubber band.",
      "content": "Insert your other index finger into the rubber band. Point your other index finger straight up, and insert it into the gap in the rubber band from underneath. Press your index finger into the side of the rubber band, at about the midpoint. If you’re using your right index finger, press it into the right side of the rubber band, and vice versa if you’re using your left index finger. The rubber band should look like a triangle between your two index fingers and thumb."

      "title": "Release your original index finger.",
      "content": "Release your original index finger. Allow the rubber band to slip off of the index finger where you originally placed it. It should now be between your thumb on one hand and index finger on the opposite hand. The rubber band will be more taut on the side where you inserted your second index finger. This makes the rubber band more aerodynamic when shot. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Aim your gun. Point your index finger with the rubber band around it at your target to aim. Don't allow your finger to bend as this will cause the rubber band to slip down. The rubber band should rest no lower than the midpoint of the top part of your index finger before the first knuckle."
