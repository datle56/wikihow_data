      "content": "Decide on the topic and paper. Your letter to the editor can be a response to a number of things. Most likely, it will be a response to a specific article, but your letter could also be a response to an event or issue in your community. It's best to respond to a particular article that was published by the newspaper. Then, your letter will be more likely to be chosen for publication, and always be ready for rejection. If you are responding to a community event or issue, your local newspaper is likely to be the most appropriate venue for your letter to the editor."

Before you start writing your own letter, you should read through other letters to the editor of the paper you've chosen to get inspiration. Each paper's letters will differ slightly in form, style, tone, and even in length. Read these letters to get a better idea of how to phrase your letters and to see what appeals to the editors of that paper. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Check out the guidelines of the paper you've chosen. Most papers will have guidelines for the types of letters they will publish. [2] X Research source Most papers have rules regarding the letter's length. They also typically ask that you include your name and contact information for verification. There may be additional guidelines. A number of papers won't allow political endorsement and limit how often individuals can submit. Make sure to read these guidelines before you send off your work. If you can't find the guidelines for submitting letters, call the publication to ask."

Some reasons might include: [3] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source You are angry about an issue and you want the readers to know about it. You want to publicly congratulate or support something or someone in your community. You want to correct information in an article. You want to suggest an idea to others. You want to influence public opinion or persuade others to take action. You want to influence policymakers or elected officials. You want to publicize a certain organization's work in connection with a current news issue."

      "title": "Write your letter within two to three days of the article.",
      "content": "Write your letter within two to three days of the article. Make sure your letter is timely by sending in your letter shortly after the article in question was published. This will improve your chances of getting published, since the issue will still be fresh in the editor's mind (and the readers' minds). [4] X Research source If you're responding to an article in a weekly newspaper, send in your letter in time for it to be published in the next issue. See the newspaper's guidelines for the publication deadline."

This will include not only your address, but also your email address, and daytime phone number. If your letter is chosen, the editors will use this information to get in touch with you. If the newspaper has an online submission system, it will likely have a space for you to include this information."

      "content": "State if you want your letter published anonymously. It's usually a good idea to attach your name to your letter, and some newspapers won't publish letters anonymously anyway. But sometimes, there may be a circumstance where you want to state your opinion but you don't want people to know who you are. Add a note to the editor that your letter needs to be published anonymously. Unless you've written about a provocative issue, it's unlikely that your letter will be published if you've also requested anonymity. You will still need to provide your name and contact information, so that the newspaper can verify your letter. The newspaper won't publish your information if you've asked it not to."

      "content": "State your position. After you've stated the argument you're responding to, you should clearly state the position you're taking on the issue and why you feel a certain way. If your authority relates to the issue in some way, then state your occupation as well. Take this time to show why the issue is relevant and important, but remember to be brief. For example: \"While the article states that college students no longer take pleasure in reading, everything I've seen in my classroom is evidence to the contrary. The article is not only inaccurate, but provides a very cursory explanation of the many reasons why students may be challenged by reading fiction in a college setting. Students aren't getting \"bored\" with fiction because the novel is no longer relevant; rather, their enthusiasm is waning because of professors who are losing interest in their own subject matter.\""

If you want your letter to be chosen, then you need to show that you've put some thought and research into formulating your letter. Though you don't have a lot of space, just providing a few key facts can make a big difference. Here are some great ways to provide evidence: Use recent events in your state or community as evidence. Use statistics, data, or survey results. Tell a personal story that tells a larger point. Use current events in politics for support."

      "title": "Use a personal example.",

      "content": "Say what should be done. Once you've provided evidence for your point of view, end the letter by saying what can be done to address the issue. Perhaps just raising awareness of the issue in the community is enough, but there may be other things that people can do to address the issue and get involved. Point the readers to actions they can take to be more involved in the issue in their local communities. Direct the readers to a website or organization that can further their goals. Give the readers a way to find more information on the subject. Instruct the readers directly.

Remember that you're competing against many other letter writers, sometimes numbering in the thousands for a national paper. If you have a stray comma or a grammatical hiccup, you risk looking less professional than your competition. Read your letter aloud to make sure that the flow of punctuation is natural.
