      "title": "Cancer loves Taurus’ open, no-nonsense communication.",
      "content": "Cancer loves Taurus’ open, no-nonsense communication. Since Cancer is a water sign, their boundless well of empathy makes them hyper-aware of people’s feelings. In an effort not to hurt anyone, they’ll often bottle their frustrations up, which can cause stress and resentment. Taurus, on the other hand, is an Earth sign. They’re realistic and not all that concerned with what others think of them. This blunt honesty fascinates and impresses Cancer. [1] X Research source Both signs can help each other communicate more effectively. Cancer can teach Taurus to use “I feel” statements and be more gentle, while Taurus can teach Cancer to be more clear and stop walking on eggshells around people."

      "title": "Taurus is strong and pragmatic.",
      "content": "Taurus is strong and pragmatic. As a fixed Earth sign, Taurus is extremely strong-willed and it takes a lot to phase them. A cardinal water sign, Cancer is much more sensitive.

Taurus can help Cancer learn when it’s appropriate to compartmentalize their feelings, while Cancer can teach Taurus to express their emotions instead of burying them."
