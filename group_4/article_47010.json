      "title": "Move your table to a well-ventilated work area.",
      "content": "Move your table to a well-ventilated work area. Varathane gives off fumes that can be dangerous if they build up. Choose a work area with good airflow to prevent this. You may want to lay out a drop cloth beneath the table to catch sawdust and Varathane drips. If you have to work in a smaller room, make sure you open some windows. In rooms with less than ideal airflow, use a fan. A clean work area is preferred, as this will prevent dust from spreading to the Varathane as it dries."

    {
      "title": "Sand",
      "content": "Sand surfaces where you’ll apply Varathane. Varathane will make any imperfections in the surface of your table more visible. [1] X Research source Sand the surface of your table thoroughly so it is smooth and uniform. For the smoothest finish, start sanding with 100-grit sandpaper, then repeat this with 150-grit, and finish sanding with 220-grit paper. Depending on the condition of your table, you may only need to lightly sand with a high grit rating sandpaper. Some tables may already have a finish. This may negatively interact with the Varathane. In these cases, sand away all finish before applying Varathane."

      "title": "Remove any sawdust from the table.",
      "content": "Remove any sawdust from the table. If there is a good amount of sawdust, break out a vacuum with a brush attachment. Any remaining traces of sawdust can be wiped away with a lint-free cloth dampened with mineral spirits. Lastly, wipe the table with a fresh, dry, lint-free cloth. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose between water- and oil-based Varathanes.",
      "content": "Choose between water- and oil-based Varathanes. Oil-based Varathane will be more heat resistant and durable. However, oil-bases usually have an amber tint that may hide the natural beauty of your wood. Water-based Varathane is better for showcasing wood’s natural beauty, but is less resilient.

    {
      "title": "Stir the Varathane to mix it.",
      "content": "Stir the Varathane to mix it. Shaking Varathane may cause air bubbles to form. Air bubbles can create a bumpy finish. Use a paint stirrer to mix the Varathane instead. If the Varathane seems especially thick, add a splash of mineral spirits to it as you mix. [4] X Research source If you tend to be sensitive to strong fumes, wear a respirator when working with Varathane. Fumes may persist for some time after the final coat dries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush the Varathane onto the table.",
      "content": "Brush the Varathane onto the table. Dip your brush into the Varathane. Wipe the excess off on the inside lip of the can, then use long, overlapping strokes to apply a thin layer to the table. Be extra careful around crevices and cracks. There should be no drips, unevenness, or pooling. [5] X Research source Clean your brush while you wait for this coat of Varathane to dry so you can use it for the next coat too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test the coat for dryness.",
      "content": "Test the coat for dryness. Oil-based Varathane will take 24 hours to dry; water-based ones only take 4 to 6 hours. After this time has passed, test its dryness by gently sanding an out of sight portion with 220-grit sandpaper. If you find that the Varathane isn’t yet dry, wait about an hour or two before testing it again with 220-grit paper. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sand the coat lightly with 220-grit sandpaper when dry.",
      "content": "Sand the coat lightly with 220-grit sandpaper when dry. Now that the coat is dry, you can lightly sand its entire surface. If this is your first time working with Varathane, there may be some uneven spots. Aim for a smooth, uniform finish. If you notice significant bumps in the dried coat, use a razor blade to shave these off. Be careful not to scratch the wood while doing this. By lightly sanding each coat of Varathane, you’ll also remove any particles that got stuck in it while drying. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Apply a second coat in the same fashion as the first.",
      "content": "Apply a second coat in the same fashion as the first. Wipe down the surface with a dry, lint-free cloth. Retrieve your cleaned brush and layer another thin coat of Varathane onto the table. Allow it to dry and lightly sand it with a 400-grit sandpaper. Most oil-based Varathane will only need two coats, though some tables may require three (but no more than three). Water-bases may need up to a dozen coats. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Polish the dried surface with an automotive polishing compound.",
      "content": "Polish the dried surface with an automotive polishing compound. There may be some fine scratches or clouding in the Varathane from the 400-grit sandpaper. Buff these away with a light application of automotive polish using a clean cotton cloth. Use a circular motion when buffing. Follow the label directions on your polish for best results. Generally, you should dampen your cotton cloth before using it to apply the polish."
