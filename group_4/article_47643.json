      "title": "Pair a patterned skirt with a plain t-shirt or top.",
      "content": "Pair a patterned skirt with a plain t-shirt or top. Some pleated skirts come in a single neutral color, but many come in bright colors with intricate patterns. If the skirt you chose is bright in nature, pair it with a plain t-shirt or other top for a casual or formal look that makes your skirt the focus of the outfit. [7] X Research source For example, say you're wearing a pleated skirt with a purple paisley design. Pair this with a light purple t-shirt for a fun, casual look. If you want something more formal, use a button-down purple blouse."

      "content": "Pick a more casual top for a night out. Pleated skirts can be matched with plain t-shirts, tank tops, or other sleeveless tops for a night out. This can change the skirt from formal attire to informal attire. [11] X Research source Also, think about a metallic skirt for a night out to give your look a bold style. Make sure to account for the skirt's colors and patterns. Do not pair a skirt with a dramatic polka-dot pattern with a patterned top, as this can be overwhelming. Instead, pick a solid-colored top."

      "content": "Wear a cardigan. If you're feeling a little chilly, or just want an extra layer of color, wear a cardigan with your pleated skirt.

      "content": "Cinch your waist with a belt. Pleated skirts are great to highlight your figure. If you want to highlight your figure further, go for a belt that can be worn around your waist.
