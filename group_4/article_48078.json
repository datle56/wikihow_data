If you see a green dot on somebody's name, their Active Status is enabled, which means they've allowed other users to see when they're active on Facebook. [2] X Research source While the green dot often means the person is currently browsing their news feed or using Messenger, it doesn't always mean they are active now . The green dot also appears when a user briefly checks Facebook or Messenger, even if they don't stay online. If you see a green dot on Messenger, the user may be active on Facebook using their computer or the mobile app, but not on Messenger. For example, if you send the person a message in Messenger , they may not see it right away if they were simply browsing their News Feed on the Facebook app instead of using the Messenger app. A green dot may also appear if Facebook displayed a notification on the user's phone and they closed it quickly.
