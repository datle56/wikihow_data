      "content": "Greet whoever you are writing to. If you know you are writing to, then that is great. Use the proper title such as Ms., Mrs., or Mr. Dear Mrs. and then their name. If you do not know, do some research to see if you can find who it should be directly written to. [1] X Research source Call the company or location to inquire about who would be best to ask. If you call the main line and tell them what you need, they could be able to direct you in the right way. If you cannot find a name, then opt for To Whom it May Concern as your default."

      "content": "Ask for what you need. The first paragraph should explicitly tell what it is that you are requesting Give as many details as necessary so that the person or company you are asking for knows exactly what you need so they can properly decide whether or not they can fulfill your request. [2] X Research source Try not to omit any details. You do not want to spring something on them at the last moment and they decide to not go through with your request. You also do not want to make it more difficult at the last minute. This could lead them to deny you for any requests in the future. Keep it simple. Do not ask for more than you need. You are requesting a favor, and it would be considered rude to ask for the world when you do not actually need it. Keep your request as simple as you possibly can."

      "title": "Tell why you need and what it will be used for.",
      "content": "Tell why you need and what it will be used for. The second paragraph should focus on what the information or assistance is going to be used for. For instance, if you are asking for a paystub for proof of income in the first paragraph, use this one to state that it is to prove consistent work history for a rental application. This is important so that whoever you are asking knows what their information or request is going to be used for and this could impact their decision. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Thank them for reviewing the request. Being polite and gracious could positively affect their decision if they know you appreciate their help. This could keep your reputation favorable for possible future requests. [4] X Research source If you are planning on following up, let them know.

      "title": "Mail the letter and wait for your response.",
      "content": "Mail the letter and wait for your response. Now, is when you wait. If you stated you will be following up, do so. If it has been over a week of time, give them a call or direct email to remind them of your request or have them go find your letter in a pile of mail they have not yet reviewed. Be considerate of their decision either way. You do not want to burn any bridges in case you need to ask for another request in the future. Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope to make it easier for any documents to be sent to you if need be."

      "content": "Find the company you want to work for. Search job postings to see if anyone is hiring your skill set, but sometimes it can be difficult finding jobs that are out and actively recruiting. There are times when it is best to inquire directly with a desired company as to whether they have any room for your unique set of skills. Figure out which one you are writing the letter for. Do research on the company so you can know exactly what it is they do, stand for, and could be looking for in a new employee. This will also help you to tailor your letter to highlight skills that they value. Look up employee reviews of the business. You can get a good sense of the work culture and see if it is a good fit for you. If you are laid-back, it might not be a good idea if you see that the company has a strict way of dealing with deadlines. Be wary if you only see good reviews without any of constructive criticism. That could be false advertising initiated by the company themselves."

If you do not have a description, work off of the research you have about the company and what you think would suit their needs. Include how you would fit in at the company. If you know the job culture, it would be good to say some things about yourself that shows that you would easily assimilate with the company. Focus on what you can do for them. Do not say what the company will personally bring you. That will sound like you are just using the company as a stepping stone. Even if this is the case, you should not let this be known.
