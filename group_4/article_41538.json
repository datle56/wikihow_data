      "content": "Cut a piece of cardboard into a rectangle. Roughly 12 inches (30 cm) by 6 inches should be fine. Make sure this is a heavier piece of cardboard, like from a packing box. If the cardboard is too light it will buckle when you wrap the lights around them."

    {
      "title": "Cut a notch in one side of the cardboard.",
      "content": "Cut a notch in one side of the cardboard. This should be big enough to tuck one end of the lights into. It doesn't matter if the notch is on the length or width side- this method will work either way."
    },

      "title": "Wrap the lights around the rectangle.",
      "content": "Wrap the lights around the rectangle. Do this neatly, working from one side to the other as needed. This will make unwrapping them much easier next year."

      "title": "Cut another notch wherever the other end of the lights is when you're done.",
      "content": "Cut another notch wherever the other end of the lights is when you're done. Tuck the end into this notch just like you did with the first one."

      "title": "Wrap tissue paper around the lights.",
      "content": "Wrap tissue paper around the lights. To protect the lights, wrap a layer or two of tissue paper around the cardboard. This will help protect them while they're in storage."

      "title": "Get an empty can of Pringles.",
      "content": "Get an empty can of Pringles. Make sure you rinse out the inside of the tube- this isn't to protect your lights, but if there are crumbs left inside it could attract bugs to your storage area. As an alternative, you could also use the cardboard tube from a paper towel roll for this method. The steps will be the same, except you won't be placing a lid on the cardboard tube."

    {
      "title": "Cut a slit in the top of the can.",
      "content": "Cut a slit in the top of the can. Using a pair of heavy scissors, cut a vertical slit on the top of the can. The slit should be about an inch long."

    {
      "title": "Slip one end of the lights into the slit.",
      "content": "Slip one end of the lights into the slit. You can widen the slit with further cutting if the wire from the lights won't fit."

      "title": "Wrap the lights around the can.",
      "content": "Wrap the lights around the can. Work your way down to the bottom of the can, then go back up to the top. Tuck the end of the lights into the same slit at the top of the can. This should leave you with the lights wrapped around the can with both ends resting in the slit on top."

      "content": "Place the lid on the Pringles can. This will prevent the ends from slipping out of the slit and unraveling your lights during storage."

      "content": "Store the hanger. You can either place the lights in a box, or, since this is a hanger, you can hang it conveniently out of the way until next Christmas. If storing with other items, make sure to wrap the hanger in tissue paper for protection."
