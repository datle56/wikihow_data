Pulled muscles are actually rips in muscle fibers, and further exertion could cause the tear to grow larger and lead to a serious injury. [1] X Research source Let the amount of pain you feel be your guide. If a pulled muscle occurs while you're running or playing a sport, and you have to stop and catch your breath due to the severe pain, the best thing to do is sit the rest of the game out. Take a few days to recover from the pulled muscle before resuming the activity that caused it."

      "title": "Warm up.",
      "content": "Warm up. Pulled muscles happen when your muscles get overstrained, which can often occur as a result of exerting yourself before you've properly warmed up. Take the time to stretch and get your muscles warmed up before you participate in a physical activity. If you enjoy running, take a light jog before doing sprints or faster running. If you play a team sport, you can jog, play catch, or do light calisthenics before diving into the game. Use a foam roller to stretch out the muscles in your legs, back, and shoulders. This can help you warm up your body better."

      "title": "Stay hydrated",
      "content": "Stay hydrated by drinking at least 8-11 glasses of water daily. Dehydration increases your risk of straining your muscles.

      "title": "Know when to stop.",
      "content": "Know when to stop.

Remember that putting more strain on a pulled muscle will only make things worse. If you cause a deeper tear, you may have to sit out for an entire season instead of just one game."
