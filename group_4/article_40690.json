Once your hair is smoothed and combed through, comb all your hair backwards and away from your forehead.

      "content": "Separate a chunk of hair into 3 sections. Reach to the crown of your head. Pull out a large chunk of hair. Separate this chunk into 3 sections of roughly even size. Hold the strands in place between your 2 hands. [2] X Expert Source Ndeye Anta Niang Professional Hair Stylist & Master Braider Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. The larger the chunks are, the larger the braid will be. One strand should fall entirely in the right hand, another should fall entirely in the left hand, and the strand between them should be held by both your right and left hand. To start the look, find a space away from mirrors. Mirrors seem like they would be helpful to the process, as they allow you to see what you're doing. However, mirrors can actually provide more confusion. You will be watching mirror images of your hands, which can cause you to reach for the wrong strands of hair. It's easier to braid your hair without relying on a mirror for guidance."
