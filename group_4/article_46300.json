      "content": "Get 0.2% retinol cream to start at a low concentration. Retinol is pretty powerful, but higher concentrations can dry out your skin if you’re not used to it. Choose a retinol cream with the lowest concentration the first time you add it to your skincare routine so you’re less likely to cause unwanted irritation. As your skin gets used to using retinol, you can try a higher concentration instead. [1] X Research source Retinol creams are also available at prescription strength, but only use them if your dermatologist recommends them since they can cause more irritation."

      "title": "Apply retinol at night.",
      "content": "Apply retinol at night. Sunlight makes vitamin A in retinol less effective, so applying it before you go to bed helps you get the full effects of the cream. Since you don’t have to wash the retinol off after you put it on, you can let it absorb into your skin overnight while you’re sleeping.

      "content": "Wash your face and wait 30 minutes for your skin to dry. Use a gentle facial soap and warm water to get rid of any dirt and oil so you have a clean face. Pat your face dry with a towel, and then let your skin completely air-dry.

After that, start working the retinol cream into your skin. Keep the cream away from te corners of your eyes and the corners of your mouth since it could build up and cause more irritation there.

      "content": "Follow up with a moisturizer after about 20 minutes. As soon as the retinol absorbs into your skin, take a fingertip-sized amount of moisturizer and rub it into your skin. Since vitamin A makes your skin feel dry, moisturizer will help keep it protected and hydrated while the retinol works its magic.

      "content": "Use retinol every 2 or 3 days when you first add it to your routine. As the retinol absorbs into your skin, it helps promote collagen growth and cell turnover, so it can cause a little bit of peeling. Give yourself a few days to see how your skin reacts to the retinol, and wait until you don’t have any redness or irritation before you use it again.

      "content": "Work up to daily use over the next few weeks. As your skin gets used to retinol, you won’t notice as much irritation or flaking on your skin. Rather than waiting every few days, try using retinol every other day and check how your skin reacts. If there are still no signs of irritation, you’re safe to use retinol every night. [8] X Research source It may take a few weeks or months for noticeable results from retinol. Just stay persistent and continue using it if it’s not causing any irritation. As long as you keep using retinol correctly, you can control acne and minimize your pores. [9] X Expert Source Kaveri Karhade, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 11 January 2021.

      "content": "Protect your skin from the sun during the day. Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to ultraviolet rays from the sun, so you’ll get sunburn a lot faster when you’re outside. Since you don’t want to damage your skin as new cells turn over, stay in the shade, apply SPF 30 sunscreen , wear long clothes, or put on a big, wide-brimmed hat to prevent sunburn. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you have sensitive skin, use a sunscreen that has titanium dioxide or zinc oxide for even more protection.

      "content": "Cut back on using retinol if you have red or irritated skin. It’s completely normal for retinol to make your skin red and flake for the first couple of days as new skin cells come in. However, too much retinol can dry out your skin and make it feel raw to the touch. If you started using retinol more frequently, then reduce how often you use it during the week until your skin heals. If you’re still getting irritation, then you may need to use a lower concentration. [11] X Research source If you’re already using the lowest-concentration retinol you can find and you’re still getting irritation, stop using it as part of your skincare routine and contact a doctor or dermatologist to find alternative solutions."

Stay away from using alpha or beta hydroxy acids, as well as salicylic and glycolic acids, as part of your skincare routine if you’re using retinol. Since retinol is already pretty powerful, exfoliating products like vitamin C, benzoyl peroxide, and scrubs will only make your skin more red or irritated before it has a chance to heal.
