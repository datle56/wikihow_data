Misting your bamboo regularly can keep it from getting soggy or drying out. [1] X Research source Distilled water and rainwater are the best choices to water and mist your bamboo. Bamboo is sensitive to the salts and chemicals in tap water. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Feel the soil for moisture. Every 3-4 days, stick your finger into the bamboo soil until it touches your first knuckle. Wiggle your finger around to see if the soil feels dry or moist. Mist or water your bamboo’s soil if it feels dry. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add water to the bamboo planter weekly. Every 7-10 days, pour a small amount of water into your bamboo potter. Let the water drain into the soil for a minute and then check the moisture again with your finger. Add more water until your plant feels sufficiently moist. [4] X Research source Bamboo is sensitive to water levels and doesn’t like to be soggy. Pour out any excess water from the planter if you add too much. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Ensure your plant drainage is working properly. Remove any blockages that keep the water from draining easily through the planter. See if there are holes in mulch, stones, or other coverage you’ve put on top of bamboo plants in the ground. For outdoor bamboo, add extra drainage material to any holes or sparsely-covered parts. [6] X Research source Add stones, pebbles, etc. to keep stems upright and ensure drainage."

      "content": "Tailor water amounts to location and season. Water your bamboo 3-5 times per week in the summer or if you live in a hot climate. [7] X Research source In the winter or in cold climates, reduce how often you water your plants to every 7-10 days. Ensure that the soil is moist in any season or climate by feeling it with your finger. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Retain moisture with mulch.",
      "content": "Retain moisture with mulch. Spread a 2- to 3-in (5- to 7-cm) layer of mulch over the bamboo soil. Having a layer of mulch can help your bamboo retain moisture throughout the year and promote proper drainage. [9] X Research source"

Water the entire plant every 7-10 days to ensure the roots stay submerged. [10] X Research source Add water more often in summer or if you live in a hot climate. You can use tap, distilled, or rain water in your bamboo planter. If you use tap water, let it sit overnight to allow chlorine, which can harm your bamboo, to evaporate. [11] X Research source"

Clean the planter and drainage props with clean, filtered, or bottled mineral water. Add them and your bamboo back to the planter and refill it with freshly collected rainwater, filtered water, or distilled water. [12] X Research source"
