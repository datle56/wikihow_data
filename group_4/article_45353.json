      "title": "A crew neck, or round neck, sits below the bottom of the neck.",
      "content": "A crew neck, or round neck, sits below the bottom of the neck. The simple shape is a staple of casual tops like T-shirts and tanks. [1] X Research source A crew neck draws the eyes to your face and shoulders, making it ideal for those with slender shoulders, a long neck, or a large bust. [2] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have a pear body shape, wear a top with a crew neck to add width to the upper half of your torso. A classic crew neck shirt with long sleeves is perfect for layering under overalls, says Hewlett."

      "title": "A scoop neck is rounded like a crew, but sits lower.",
      "content": "A scoop neck is rounded like a crew, but sits lower. Its deep ‘scoop’ shape lengthens the neck, while accentuating the collarbone and décolletage (the area just above the bust). [3] X Research source A scoop neckline frequently appears on semi-formal dresses. The best part? It’s universally flattering. [4] X Research source Who is it best for? Scoop neck tops or dresses are especially flattering for those with small busts, shorter necks, or angular face shapes. [5] X Research source If you have a box body shape, a scoop neck can help to add a sense of curves to your silhouette while lengthening your neck. Look for cinched or belted tops or dresses to help define your waist."

      "title": "The boat neckline is a wide oval that sits below the collarbone.",
      "content": "The boat neckline is a wide oval that sits below the collarbone. It’s also known as the bateau neckline, but its boat moniker comes from its history as sailors’ go-to style in the early and mid-20th century. [6] X Research source A classic silhouette, the boat neck accentuates the shoulders and neck, creating balance for those with narrow shoulders or wider hips. [7] X Research source Who is it best for? Boat neck tops and dresses are ideal for those with narrow shoulders, long necks, and oval or round faces. [8] X Research source If you have a pear body shape, a boat neck can add the illusion of width to your upper body. High versions of the boat neck are also known as the Sabrina neckline, because Audrey Hepburn popularized the silhouette in the 1954 film of that name. In wedding gowns, they’re similar to a portrait neckline."

      "title": "A V-neck has two lines that drop down into a V-shape.",
      "content": "A V-neck has two lines that drop down into a V-shape. The depth of the V depends on the garment—shirts typically have high V-necks, while a dress might have a deeper V. [9] X Research source The classic V-neck is another neckline that flatters every body type, though it’s especially well-suited for those with heart and petite body shapes. [10] X Research source Who is it best for? Anyone! If you have a smaller bust, a modest V-neck is fine. Go for a deep V if you have a larger bust—it will help balance out your upper and lower torso. Because V-necks lengthen the neck, if you have a longer neck, layer a tank or camisole underneath to offset the effect. “A white V-neck t-shirt with a cute blazer and jeans can look like a very intentional outfit,” says Julch Pair these pieces for an easy polished look."

      "title": "A plunging neckline is a very deep V-neck.",
      "content": "A plunging neckline is a very deep V-neck. The dramatic neckline is a common choice for wedding dresses, but it’s also featured in evening wear and dressy blouses. It offers a sexy silhouette that exposes more of the décolletage and bust. A plunging neckline is ideal for those with larger busts or shorter torsos, as it frames the chest while elongating the body. [11] X Research source Who is it best for? Those who want to elongate their upper body and show off their bust. Regardless of your bust size, you’ll likely need fashion tape to help keep a plunging neckline in place. [12] X Research source Plunging necklines can dip from below the bust to as low as the belly button. For wedding dresses, look for a plunging neckline with a sheer or nude mesh insert to offer extra support, if desired."

      "title": "Halter necklines wrap around the back of the neck, forming a narrow V-shape.",
      "content": "Halter necklines wrap around the back of the neck, forming a narrow V-shape. They come in many varieties, from summery Y2K tops with thin straps that tie behind the neck to thick straps that twist in front of the neck. This neckline accentuates the shoulders while drawing the eye upward—perfect for those with medium to full busts and wide shoulders. [13] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have an hourglass body shape, a halter neckline is especially flattering as it highlights your shoulders without throwing your overall silhouette off balance. It also suits rectangular body types. [14] X Research source Halter necklines are a great way to show skin without revealing more of your bust and décolletage than you’re comfortable with."

    {
      "title": "A jewel neck is a high, rounded neckline.",
      "content": "A jewel neck is a high, rounded neckline. It typically lands at the base of the throat, making it ideal for modestly showing off necklaces (hence the name). First ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy to Michelle Obama have worn dresses with jewel necklines. Go for this style if you’d like a classy, elegant look. [15] X Research source Who is it best for? A jewel neck’s high placement draws attention to the face and gives the illusion of width to the shoulders. If you have a pear body shape, opt for this neckline to help balance out your upper body."

    {
      "title": "A collar neck features a rounded collar detail.",
      "content": "A collar neck features a rounded collar detail. Featured in many blouses and jackets, this neckline makes you look more put-together and polished. Plus, if your collar has buttons, you can control how much skin you want to show. Leave more buttons undone for a sexier casual look—or close it completely for a more formal presentation. [16] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have a heart body shape or a pear body shape, collars can even out your silhouette by widening or lengthening your torso’s upper half. Those with small busts and rectangle body shapes look great in statement collars—such as the Peter Pan collar. [17] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "A sweetheart neckline is heart-shaped and strapless.",
      "content": "A sweetheart neckline is heart-shaped and strapless. Specifically, it resembles the top half of a heart for a romantic, feminine look. On wedding dresses, it’s also known as the princess neckline. Because it’s strapless, a sweetheart neckline tends to sit low on the bust, though more modest options are available. [18] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have a shorter neck, a sweetheart neckline will help elongate your upper body because of its low placement. [19] X Research source The sweetheart neck isn’t just for dresses. Look for bustier and princess-style tops to help you rock the look in daily life."

      "title": "A square neck drops into a square above the bust.",
      "content": "A square neck drops into a square above the bust. This is a classic, romantic silhouette featuring a straight horizontal line over the bust and two straight straps or sleeves perpendicular to it. If you’d like to highlight your bust (and a necklace), choose a square neckline bodysuit or dress. [20] X Research source Who is it best for? This neckline fuses modesty and sensuality by covering your shoulders while drawing attention to your collarbones. It’s especially flattering on an hourglass figure. [21] X Research source"

      "title": "In a surplice neck, fabric crosses over itself to form a V-shape.",
      "content": "In a surplice neck, fabric crosses over itself to form a V-shape. It’s a common silhouette on wrap dresses. However, a traditional surplice neckline is sewn in at the waistline and not adjustable as it is in a wrap dress or top. While it resembles a V-neck, this neckline is unique in the way it features two overlaid pieces of fabric. [22] X Research source Who is it best for? Wrap tops are especially flattering on apple body types, helping to define the waist and create the illusion of wider hips. [23] X Research source Looking to define your waistline? Choose a surplice dress with a cinched waist."

      "title": "A split neck features a small gap in its center.",
      "content": "A split neck features a small gap in its center. It’s typically a split crew neck, though splits can appear in boat or scoop necklines as well. Unlike a V-neck, a split neck leaves only a small, narrow divot in the neckline to help open it up and show more of the neck. Some split necks have button closures to fasten or turn them into a keyhole. [24] X Research source Who is it best for? Like a crew neck, a split neck silhouette will flatter you most if you have a small to medium bust and a long neck."

      "title": "A mock neck is a short collar at the base of the neck.",
      "content": "A mock neck is a short collar at the base of the neck. Unlike a turtleneck, it doesn’t cover the whole neck—nor is it folded over. The casual mock neck is most often found on cold-weather clothing like sweaters and long-sleeved shirts. This neckline was especially trendy in the 1960s. [25] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have a shorter neck, opt for a mock neck over a turtleneck for the same illusion without the severe height. [26] X Research source If you have a smaller bust, a high neckline is a particularly flattering option. [27] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "A cowl neckline is loose and draped to create round, U-shaped folds.",
      "content": "A cowl neckline is loose and draped to create round, U-shaped folds. Lower cowl necks on dresses, jumpsuits, or camisoles offer a chance to show off your décolletage. The look is typically draped above the bustline to draw attention to your face. [28] X Research source If you have a short or sturdy torso, opt for an open neckline like the cowl neck to draw the eyes upward. Who is it best for? Those with triangle shapes and a narrow upper body. In the wintertime, look for sweaters with high cowl necks to create the illusion of a scarf. The classic look adds dimension and volume to the upper half of your body—without shortening your neck like a bulky turtleneck would."

    {
      "title": "A turtleneck is a high, straight collar that hits below the chin.",
      "content": "A turtleneck is a high, straight collar that hits below the chin. It’s typically worn folded down around the neck. Like a jewel neck, it offers a modest backdrop for showcasing your favorite neck candy. It’s also a popular choice in the winter because it lends itself to layering when the temperatures drop. [29] X Research source Who is it best for? Turtlenecks are especially flattering if you have a long face shape or neck, helping to balance the top of your silhouette. [30] X Research source"

      "title": "A one-shoulder neckline has a diagonal shape for an asymmetrical silhouette.",
      "content": "A one-shoulder neckline has a diagonal shape for an asymmetrical silhouette. As the name suggests, this look only covers one shoulder, either with a single sleeve or strap. The dramatic silhouette can elevate simple looks, whether you pair a one-shoulder blouse with your favorite miniskirt or rock a one-shoulder dress to a party. It evokes the togas and robes worn by ancient goddesses. [31] X Research source Who is it best for? A one-shoulder garment draws the eye upward to your face while showing slightly more skin than a typical neckline. If you have wide shoulders, consider rocking a flattering one-shoulder look that will emphasize your upper body."

    {
      "title": "An off-the-shoulder neckline hangs straight below the shoulders.",
      "content": "An off-the-shoulder neckline hangs straight below the shoulders. It’s also known as the Bardot neckline because it was popularized by actress and model Brigitte Bardot in the 20th century. By exposing the shoulders, you create the illusion of a narrower waist, making it ideal for pear and box body types. [32] X Research source Who is it best for? The flirty look is extra flattering if you have narrow shoulders or a fuller midsection, as it lengthens and draws attention to your shoulders. [33] X Research source If you’re worried about your top rising up, Hewlett has a hack. First, attach two safety pins to each end of a hair elastic. Pin them on the top’s inside seams underneath the armpit. Repeat on the other side. Your armpits will be above the hair ties, keeping the top from rising when you move your arms."

      "title": "A strapless neckline cuts across the top of the bust, either straight or curved.",
      "content": "A strapless neckline cuts across the top of the bust, either straight or curved. Because it has a low cut, it highlights your upper body, especially the collarbone and neck. On wedding or formal dresses, it might be curved into a sweetheart neckline or left straight for a classic look. If you have a long neck, a strapless neckline can accentuate your figure. [34] X Research source Who is it best for? Strapless necklines can flatter many body types—just make sure you have the right strapless bra , fashion tape, or fit to support your bust.

      "title": "Tie necks are usually high and rounded, with a chic bow detail.",
      "content": "Tie necks are usually high and rounded, with a chic bow detail. Also known as bow tie necks or pussycat bow necklines, these silhouettes add dimension and volume to a regular high collar. Choose to tie a bow at the base or side of your neck. [36] X Research source Who is it best for? Tie-neck tops are especially flattering for rectangle body shapes when the top or dress is sleeveless, as the bow draws the eye to the neck and face. Some tie-neck tops combine the tie element with a V-neck for a more revealing take on this sophisticated silhouette—opt for these if you want a dressy look that doesn’t feel too formal.

      "title": "An apron neckline narrows inward to the neck like a triangle.",
      "content": "An apron neckline narrows inward to the neck like a triangle. Inspired by the old-fashioned aprons of 20th-century housewives, the neckline is similar to a halter. However, it’s unique because the neckline itself only extends the width of the neck before sloping down to the sides of the bust. Thin straps come up from each side of the neckline, circling around the back of the neck. [38] X Research source Who is it best for? An apron neckline flatters every body type. Go for a dress or top with this design if you want to show off your collarbone and shoulders."

      "title": "A Queen Anne neckline features a high back and low front like a trapezoid.",
      "content": "A Queen Anne neckline features a high back and low front like a trapezoid. The back has a high collar that loops around to the front with narrowing straps, resembling the cut of a bolero top. [39] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have broad shoulders, this regal neckline can help to slim them while accentuating your bust. If you’re a bride having a vintage-themed wedding, consider a Queen Anne neckline for your gown to create a classic look—like the one Kate Middleton wore on her big day. [40] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "An asymmetrical neckline features two different sides for an irregular shape.",
      "content": "An asymmetrical neckline features two different sides for an irregular shape. While it could simply be a one-shoulder neckline, this style encompasses any silhouette that doesn’t parallel itself. For example, some tops have an off-the-shoulder sleeve on one side and a cap sleeve on the other. Other tops create asymmetry with cut-out details that add interesting geometric lines—these tend to be higher, so the peekaboo can land over the collarbone or bust. [41] X Research source Who is it best for? Because asymmetrical necklines come in different varieties, this cut flatters every body type. One-shoulder varieties are perfect for showing off your shoulders and collarbone."

    {
      "title": "A keyhole neckline is rounded with a cutout below the collarbone.",
      "content": "A keyhole neckline is rounded with a cutout below the collarbone. The cutout is buttoned or sewn at the top, creating a shape that resembles a keyhole. This neckline lets you show skin in a sophisticated manner. Paired with a high neckline, it exudes elegance. Plus, it can help to balance out the lines of your favorite dangly statement earrings! [42] X Research source Who is it best for? Any body type. Keyhole necklines come in different sizes for different levels of modesty. [43] X Research source A small keyhole might be too tight on a larger bust, while a large keyhole may hang too loosely if you have a smaller bust. Balance is key."
    },
    {
      "title": "Scalloped necklines have a repeating, curved pattern.",
      "content": "Scalloped necklines have a repeating, curved pattern. They’re so named for their resemblance to a row of scallop shells. More a design than a specific neckline, the scalloped look most often appears on scoop neck and V-neck tops or dresses. [44] X Research source Who is it best for? If you have a box body shape, choose this neckline to disrupt the lines of your silhouette and appealingly frame your bust."
    },
    {
      "title": "A U-shaped neckline dips above the bust like a U.",
      "content": "A U-shaped neckline dips above the bust like a U. Narrower and often higher than a scoop neck, this cut is a popular choice for tank tops and t-shirts. While it can reveal cleavage, it doesn’t have to—many U-shaped tops simply lengthen the neck without fully displaying your bust. They’re also a great choice when you want to show off a mid-length necklace. [45] X Research source Who is it best for? Treat the U-shaped neckline like you would a scoop neck. If you have a shorter neck, wear a tank top with a U-shaped neckline to draw the eye downward and balance your torso. It can also create the illusion of a fuller chest. [46] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "A high, sheer illusion neckline creates the appearance of a strapless look.",
      "content": "A high, sheer illusion neckline creates the appearance of a strapless look. However, it features a transparent or nude-colored mesh fabric that typically extends over the neck (rounded at the collar) for extra support and coverage. This neckline isn’t found in tops, but is popular in wedding dresses and other formal gowns. Some illusion necklines have beading or other detailing on the mesh section. [47] X Research source Who is it best for? Like a sweetheart neckline, an illusion neck elongates your upper body. If you have a shorter neck, consider a dress with an illusion neckline—especially if you’re worried about your medium to large bust supporting a strapless neckline."

    {
      "title": "A convertible neckline features rearrangeable straps to create different shapes.",
      "content": "A convertible neckline features rearrangeable straps to create different shapes. Rather than being one consistent shape, it’s adjustable to two or more neckline types. For example, a dress may have a ruffled, off-the-shoulder neckline that can also be pushed over the shoulders to wear as a boat neck. Who is it best for? Anyone, as you can modify it to flatter your body type! These necklines are popular on bridesmaid dresses, allowing members of the wedding party to customize the neckline to suit their shape."
