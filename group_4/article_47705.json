      "content": "Cut colored paper into eight 14 by 1 in (35.6 by 2.5 cm) strips. Use a ruler to make the strips nice and straight. They can be all 1 color, or they can be 2 different colors. For example, you could have 4 pink strips and 4 blue strips. This will be enough to make a small, 4 in (10 cm) square basket. You can cut more strips to make a larger basket. [1] X Research source If you are making a larger basket, cut 2 extra strips for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) that you would like to add. Construction paper will work the best, but you can also use thin plastic sheets, cardstock, felt, or thin cardboard. These methods won't work well for reed or willow because you need to prepare those materials differently."

      "content": "Arrange 4 strips side-by-side vertically. If you used 2 different colors, arrange them in an alternating pattern. For example: pink-blue-pink-blue. Make sure that the strips are almost touching. You will be adjusting the strips later on to eliminate any gaps. [2] X Research source You want just a sliver of space between the vertical strips because this will make weaving the horizontal strips through them easier. If you are making a larger basket, then add more vertical strips. For example, if you want a 5 in (13 cm) basket, then use 5 vertical strips total."

      "title": "Weave a fifth strip horizontally across the 4 vertical strips.",
      "content": "Weave a fifth strip horizontally across the 4 vertical strips. Take 1 of your remaining 4 strips, then weave it over and under across the 4 vertical strips. Try to position it as close to the center of the vertical strips as possible. [3] X Research source Make sure that the horizontal strip is centered, too; you want an equal amount of paper sticking out to the first and last vertical strip."

      "title": "Repeat the process with the remaining 3 strips.",
      "content": "Repeat the process with the remaining 3 strips. If you used 2 colors for your strips, be sure to alternate them here as well. For example, if you used blue in your previous row, continue with a pink-blue-pink pattern. [4] X Research source If you are making a larger basket, then continue to add horizontal strips. For example, if you're making a 5 in (13 cm) basket, then add a fifth horizontal strip."

      "title": "Adjust the strips so that everything is centered and even.",
      "content": "Adjust the strips so that everything is centered and even. Slide the vertical strips closer together so that they are all touching. Next, slide the horizontal strips so that they are halfway down the vertical strips; make sure that they are touching as well. You will end up with a grid in the middle of your woven strips. There should be an equal amount of paper on each side of the grid."

      "title": "Glue down the corners on the grid.",
      "content": "Glue down the corners on the grid. Starting at the top-left corner, lift the paper to expose the strip beneath it. Put a dab of glue on the bottom strip, then press the upper strip back down. Work your way around the grid until you are back where you started. [5] X Research source You just need to do the corners for right now. Don't worry about the top, bottom, and side edges. A glue stick will work just fine for paper, but if you are working with plastic or felt, hot glue will be the way to go."

Repeat this step for the remaining 3 sides of the grid. You'll end up with a sort of box shape. [6] X Research source Some of the strips may peel away from the bottom edge of your \"box.\" Glue these down so that the edge is seamless."

For example, if you used pink and blue previously, you could use purple here. [7] X Research source If you used more than 8 strips to make your base, count how many strips are on each edge, then add 2 inches (5.1 cm). This is how long your new strips should be in inches. If your paper is not long enough, tape or glue 2 strips together to make a longer strip. If you are making a bigger basket, then make 1 additional strip for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of height."

These 4 segments will make the 4 sides of your basket. The 2 in (5.1 cm) segment will allow you to connect the strip into a square. [8] X Research source If you used more strips to make your basket, it will be larger. Count how many strips are on 1 side. This is how far apart your marks will be. If you are working with a longer strip for a larger basket, you still want 4 equal-sized segments and one 2 in (5.1 cm) segment."

Take the 2 ends of your strip, and overlap them until they form a square shape. Secure the square with tape or glue. [9] X Research source The end of your strip should nestle into the fold that comes just before the 2 in (5.1 cm) segment. This square will create the first row on all 4 sides of your basket."

If you choose to use liquid glue, secure the paper with a paper clip until it dries. Use hot glue for felt or plastic. Your basket has vertical strips and horizontal strips. The vertical strips come from the base and sides of the basket. The horizontal strips come from the squares you made."

      "content": "Use the basket with care. Most baskets are pretty delicate to begin with, but homemade baskets are even more fragile. Unless your basket is made from plastic or foam, you should avoid getting it wet. Also, don't carry anything too heavy inside your basket. A paper basket is great for kids' Easter baskets with plastic eggs. You can store heavier items in you basket, but you don't be able to carry your basket around; otherwise, it may break."
