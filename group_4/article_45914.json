Experience counts when using skinfold calipers because the accuracy of the test depends on precision of measurement. “Competent” examiners have executed 50 – 100 tests in controlled research settings. [3] X Research source Experienced examiners are more likely to take measurements at the same point over time, which will give you the most accurate results for tracking your progress."

      "content": "Learn how calipers work. Body fat calipers do not measure body fat percentage directly. They are used to administer the “pinch test,” which takes measurements of skinfolds from three to ten points on the body. [4] X Research source That information is then plugged into a formula to compute your body fat percentage. The accuracy of skinfold calipers for measuring body fat percentage depends on both the experience of the person using the calipers and the formula used to compute the results."

      "content": "Select a sensible formula. There are over 100 equations used to calculate body fat percentage from a pinch test. Each is specific to groups of people according to characteristics such as age, gender, race, and fitness level, which affect where bodies tend to store adipose fat. Plugging in the same data to several different equations can return results that vary by several percentage points. [5] X Research source Common equations include Jackson & Pollock, Parrillo, and Navy Tape. To choose a formula that makes sense for you, work with a fitness professional and use it as a benchmark of your progress. Or, forgo the formula completely and just keep track of the skinfold measurements. [6] X Research source Many body fat calculators are available online, making it easy to calculate the results of a pinch test with a few or several measurements. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Track your progress. At the start of a fitness regimen to reduce your body fat percentage, it is useful to get a baseline measurement. Keep this information in a log (personal training journals and fitness apps are good options) along with your exercise routine (e.g., mileage walked, weightlifting sets) over time. Recommended ranges for a healthy percentage of body fat differ according to gender, age, and fitness level. Women with more than 32% of body fat and men with more than 26% of body fat are considered obese. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you’re trying to lose body fat, taking weekly measurements can help you adjust your fitness routine to improve your results. If you want to maintain your current body fat composition, monthly measurements may be more useful. Get a set of skinfold calipers. There are many types of calipers available on the consumer market. Ideally, an experienced examiner is administering the pinch test for you and has good-quality calipers. If you are administering the test yourself, you can purchase calipers at many different price points (from a few dollars to a couple hundred) and from many different retailers. You may want to invest in high-quality calipers, which will be more expensive. Cheap calipers may not exert the appropriate amount of constant pressure necessary to provide adequate tension control and reliable results. Some highly recommended calipers include Harpenden Skinfold Calipers, Lafayette Skinfold Calipers, Lange Calipers, Slim Guide Skinfold Calipers, and Accu-Measure Body Fat Calipers.

      "content": "Choose a test. Pinch tests measure skinfolds at three, four, seven, and even ten points on the body. Taking measurements from more points does not ensure accuracy of the body fat percentage calculation. That depends on the precision used when taking the measurements and the formula used to calculate body fat."

      "content": "Identify the points at which you'll take measurements. The key is to be consistent with the exact locations as well as pinch-type (vertical vs. horizontal). In general, the right side of the body on a standing subject is used when obtaining measurements. Common areas to measure skinfolds include: [10] X Research source Triceps — Have the subject bend the elbow to 90 degrees and mark the point midway between the top of the shoulder and elbow. [11] X Research source Then, measure a vertical fold (with the calipers at a 90 degree angle) at that midway point with the arm hanging naturally at the subject's side. Biceps — With the arm extended naturally at the subject’s side, take a vertical fold at the front of the arm, halfway between the shoulder and the crook of the elbow. [12] X Research source Subscapular — Measurements of the subscapular area should be taken as a diagonal fold (calipers held at a 45 degree angle) across the back, just below the shoulder blade. [13] X Research source Thigh — Take a vertical fold on the standing leg, midway between the kneecap and the crease where the thigh meets the hip. Iliac crest — Have the subject hold their right arm across the body. Use a horizontal pinch to take this measurement right above the hip bone on the side of the body. [14] X Research source Abdominal — A measurement in the abdominal area should be a vertical fold one inch to right of navel. Calf — With the foot resting on a chair or platform at approximately 90 degrees, take the measurement as a vertical fold on the inside of the calf at the point with the largest circumference. [15] X Research source Chest — Measure the pectoral region by taking a diagonal fold midway between the nipple and upper part of the pectoral muscle at the armpit. [16] X Research source Axilla — The axilla area is on the side of the upper chest. A measurement here should be taken as a vertical fold directly under the center of the armpit and perpendicular to the nipple. Supraspinale — A measurement of the supraspinale area should be a diagonal fold at the intersection of a vertical line between the spinal (front part of iliac crest, the protrusion of the hip bone) and front part of the armpit) and a horizontal line at the top of the iliac crest. [17] X Research source This region is also called the suprailiac, in some measurement systems."

It is important that you do not exclude any \"pinchable\" skin nor include any underlying muscle."

Place the jaw ends over the skinfold while continuing to pinch the skinfold with your left hand. Using your right thumb, press down where indicated on the caliper until you feel a slight click. This sound represents the correct measurement as the caliper jaws automatically stop at the width of your skinfold. Repeat this step three times for each landmark to ensure reliability. If the measurements differ (they should only differ by 1 – 2 mm [19] X Research source ), obtain and record the average of the three measurements. Be sure to measure the center of the skinfold between your fingers."
