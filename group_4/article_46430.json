      "content": "Make sure your PC meets the requirements. The developer of Waifu2x recommends that Windows users use a version called Waifu2x-Caffe for best results. [1] X Research source The program will run on most modern PCs, although it will perform better if you have a speedy processor and/or video card (also called a GPU). You'll need: A 64-bit Windows 10, 8.1, 8, or 7. At least 1GB of available RAM when you're ready to process the image. For the fastest possible processing, you'll want to have an NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 3.0 or higher. Check your GPU's computing capability at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus . If you don't have an NVIDIA GPU, you can process images with your CPU. If your NVIDIA GPU supports CUDA, install the CUDA Toolkit update from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads , and then the cuDNN installation package from https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn . This ensures that Waifu2x takes full advantage of your GPU's processing power during the conversion, as processing with your CPU can be kind of slow. Unless you speak Japanese, you'll want to use Google Chrome or any other web browser that has a built-in translation tool."

This updates the default output path, which will be a new file in the same folder with a similar name."

There are four options: Denoise and magnify is best used if you're working with a small low-quality image (like an icon or avatar) and want to make it larger and clearer. A combination of upscaling and noise removal may still degrade the image quality, although the results still blow away the competition. Magnify only will work if the image's quality is high enough that you don't need to reduce noise. This simply upscales the image without removing artifacts. Denoise only is good for when you just want to clarify an image without adjusting its size. Magnify & Auto Denoise magnifies the image and runs an automatic denoiser based on the file type. For example, with this option, PNG files will not be de-noised and JPG files will. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a denoise level.",
      "content": "Select a denoise level. The levels at the center of the screen go from 0 to 5, with 5 being the most amount of denoising. You may have to play around with this setting depending on your image—start with Level 1 and work your way up if necessary. The higher the level, the more you risk blurriness or an oil painting effect. If you're not denoising the image, you can leave Level 0 selected."

    {
      "title": "Select the magnification rate.",
      "content": "Select the magnification rate. The default \"Set rate\" is 2.0 , which means the resolution will be doubled. You can adjust that as needed. To get a more precise scaling value, you can use simple math. Let's say you have a monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio and 1920x1080 resolution: In most cases, the image you are working with will not be as wide as 16:9. Therefore, to calculate the scaling factor, you'd divide 1920 by the image's width. For example, an image of 1500x1000 would have a scaling factor of 1920/1500 = 1.28. You could enter 1.28 as the magnification rate. In the case where the image is wider than 16:9, you'd divide 1080 by the image's height. For example, an image of 1000x500 would have a scaling factor of 1080/500 = 2.16 . Waifu2x always rounds down when it calculates the final image resolution. If your numbers are not round like in the examples, always round up in the third or fourth decimal place."
