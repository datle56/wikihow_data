      "content": "Sit on a chair at a desk. Make sure you sit on a comfortable chair at a desk that is a few inches above your thighs. Your feet should be flat on the floor when you sit straight on the chair. Keep your back straight and your shoulders relaxed. [1] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source You should not write at a desk that is too low or too high for you. Make sure you do not have to crouch or strain yourself to sit comfortably at the desk."

      "title": "Use an ink pen that has a felt tip.",
      "content": "Use an ink pen that has a felt tip. You can also use a gel pen that releases a nice, fluid line of ink. Dark ink, such as blue or black, will make it easier for you to see the ink on the page. You can also use pencil to write in cursive, especially if you want the option of erasing your letters and starting again. Get a B pencil with a triangular barrel, as it will be softer on the paper and easier to write with."

      "content": "Write on lined paper so your letters are the same size and shape. Look for lined paper that a dotted line in the middle of each line. You can find lined paper made for cursive writing at your local school supply store or online. [2] X Research source If you’d prefer plain paper so you have more room to try the flowing, loose movements of cursive, you can use it. However, it may be more difficult for you to make your letters uniform without lines on the paper."

      "title": "Place the paper at an angle.",
      "content": "Place the paper at an angle. If you are right-handed, make sure the top right and bottom left corners of your paper line up straight with your nose. Use your left arm to hold the paper still. If you are left-handed, the top left and bottom right corners should line up with your nose, with your right arm keeping the paper secure. [3] X Research source Angling the paper will make it easier for you to slant your letters as you write. In cursive, your letters should slant up and to the right by 35 degrees."

      "title": "Use your non-writing hand to move the paper up as you write.",
      "content": "Use your non-writing hand to move the paper up as you write. This will ensure your writing is even and controlled. Guide the paper with your hand so you are always writing at an angle."

      "content": "Grip the pen or pencil lightly at a 45 degree angle. The pen or pencil should rest on your middle finger and be held in place by your thumb and index finger. Maintain a loose, relaxed grip. Do not grip so tightly on the pen or pencil that your fingernails turn white or your fingers become stiff. [4] X Research source"
