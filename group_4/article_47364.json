A wash about once or twice a year is enough to keep your comforter clean. [17] X Research source If you don’t use a flat sheet under your comforter, wash it about 3 to 4 times per year. Wash your comforter whenever it gets stained. If you’re storing your comforter, wash and dry it before putting it away. House cleaning professional Kadi Dulude recommends spraying your comforter with vinegar and putting it in the dryer every few months to help “kill the dust mites and freshen [it] up.”"
