      "content": "Call emergency services as soon as possible. Airbag burns are usually second-degree in severity, which require medical attention. The face, neck, and hands are often affected, and a doctor should examine burns of any nature that affect these areas. There's also a chance the burn could be chemical in nature, which requires a medical professional.

      "title": "Remove clothing or jewelry near the burn immediately.",
      "content": "Remove clothing or jewelry near the burn immediately. Burns quickly swell, and jewelry or clothing can restrict blood flow and become difficult to remove from swollen areas. If clothing is melted or stuck to the burn, cut around it and leave the stuck patch in place. Don’t attempt to remove the stuck clothing on your own, and wait for emergency services to address it.

      "content": "Run lukewarm or cool water over the burn for at least 20 minutes. Begin irrigation, or flushing the burn, as soon as possible. Run as much water as possible over the burn, and use lukewarm or cool water instead of cold water or ice. Since chemical agents might be present, the burn needs to be continuously flushed with large amounts of water to wash away toxic, corrosive substances. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For burned eyes, hold the eyelids open and flush the eyes continuously for at least 15-20 minutes. If possible, do this in the shower so it's easier for you. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Water is more likely to be available, but if you can access large quantities of saline solution or Ringer’s lactate solution, use either instead. The burn should be flushed continuously, even during transport to a hospital."

      "title": "Perform a litmus test to determine pH.",
      "content": "Perform a litmus test to determine pH. Airbags can cause alkaline chemical burns, so a doctor or emergency responder should administer a litmus test when the burn victim arrives at the hospital. If pH is higher than 7, the burn is chemical in nature and the burn must be flushed to lower the pH. [7] X Research source A litmus test measures acidity (pH below 7) or alkalinity (pH above 7). A pH of 7 is neutral. If the burned area is pH neutral, it’s not necessary to flush it for several hours. Proceed to apply ointment and dress the wound."

      "content": "Continue irrigation until pH normalizes, if necessary. Flush an alkaline chemical burn with saline solution or water to bring the burned skin’s pH back to 7. It could take 2 to 12 hours to normalize pH. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

They’ll likely recommend you keep the dressing in place for 24 hours, then change it 1 to 2 times daily. [10] X Research source Nearly all airbag burns are relatively minor, and only need to be flushed and dressed. Skin grafts and other treatments for severe burns probably won’t be necessary.

Specific instructions depend on the burn’s severity, so follow your doctor’s recommendations. [12] X Research source Ask, “How long should I keep the dressing on before changing it? Should I wait 24 to 48 hours before bathing? How many times per day should I change the dressing?”"
