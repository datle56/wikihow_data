      "content": "Sexual frustration can be painful—literally. If you have a penis and testicles, you may have experienced the pain of “blue balls,” an aching sensation in your genitals caused by unrelieved sexual arousal. People with vaginas aren’t immune to this kind of discomfort, either! The increased blood flow to your genitals when you get turned on can cause swelling and pain in the vulva and clitoris, called “blue vulva.” [5] X Research source Fortunately, these conditions aren’t serious, and they’re only temporary. You can get relief by: Masturbating or using a sex toy to reach orgasm Having sex with a partner Resting and waiting for your arousal to naturally pass Distracting yourself with an activity not related to sex Using a cold compress on your genitals or taking a cold shower"

[7] X Research source Not to worry, though! If one position is painful for you, experiment with others until you find one that works. For instance, you might feel more comfortable doing missionary (face-to-face sex), having sex in a spooning position, or straddling your partner. Remember, penetrative sex isn’t the only kind of sex! If you can’t find a comfortable position, have fun experimenting with other kinds of sex, like oral sex, frottage (dry humping), using toys, or mutual masturbation. [8] X Research source"
