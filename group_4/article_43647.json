      "content": "“Thank you for reaching out” is a polite and positive sentiment of gratitude. This phrase expresses a thankful appreciation after someone contacts or cordially reaches out to someone else. [1] X Research source It’s most widely seen at the beginning of an email reply within a professional setting but can also be used in response to condolences. The phrase has a slightly formal tone, which is why it works so well in business settings, but it can be toned down in more personal contexts. For example: [2] X Research source Formal: “Thank you for reaching out to me about this opportunity. I appreciate the information and will take it under consideration.” Informal: “Thanks for reaching out to me with such sympathy and kindness. I couldn’t ask for a better neighbor!” Ultimately, use your best judgment in professional contexts. Unless you're talking about a contract or something deadly serious, it's okay to stand out a bit. An exclamation point works fine here as long as you don't overdo it."
