      "title": "Assemble the dish.",
      "content": "Assemble the dish. Inside the setup kit that came with your Starlink purchase is your dish, mounting base, and a cable. Insert the dish mast into the mounting base. Make sure the 75ft satellite cable is inserted into the dish, then connect it to the base. You should hear a click as things come together."

      "title": "Place the dish.",
      "content": "Place the dish. Use the Starlink app with your smartphone's camera to find an area where your dish has an uninterrupted view of the sky. With a ground-based mount like the one that came with the setup kit, simply place the mount on the ground. Other mounts entail using screws to secure the dish to a wall or other area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Connect the cable from the dish to your router.",
      "content": "Connect the cable from the dish to your router. The Wi-Fi router that came with your purchase should be placed inside your home, so you'll need to run the cable from the outside to inside. The Starlink website offers kits and accessories for running cable through standard walls and others for masonry and concrete walls. If the included 75ft cable is not long enough, you can buy a longer one from the Starlink site."

    {
      "title": "Plug your router into power.",
      "content": "Plug your router into power. Use the included power cable to connect the router to power. The one cable will also supply power to your dish as long as it's connected to the router. A white LED shines at the bottom of your router to indicate it has power. At this point, your Starlink dish will rotate upwards as it begins searching for a connection. This process can take up to 15 minutes."

      "title": "Set up your network within the Starlink app.",
      "content": "Set up your network within the Starlink app. On your smartphone, tap Open WiFi Settings and tap the Starlink network. Enter a Wi-Fi name and password that you want to use. [1] X Research source Setting up doesn't require the area you're in to have data or any internet connection. Once you purchase Starlink and set up the dish, it will connect to your account automatically, so you can immediately use the internet from your satellite."

    {
      "title": "Install Starlink with a clear view of the sky.",
      "content": "Install Starlink with a clear view of the sky. Obstructions like trees or tall buildings will interrupt your satellite signals and make your internet slower. Trees around your house will make your internet slower if you're using the ground-based mount that came with your Starlink purchase. Get your dish higher than the treeline by purchasing a different mount from the Starlink website. With the Starlink app, tap Check for obstructions to use your phone's camera in order to see if the current area that you have in mind for the dish will work."

    {
      "title": "Place your router in a high, unobstructed area with good ventilation.",
      "content": "Place your router in a high, unobstructed area with good ventilation. You want the signal from your router to reach your entire house, and since the signal falls down in a cone, the best place to put the router is somewhere high, like the top of a bookshelf. [2] X Research source For optimal functioning, make sure your router isn't covered and has some room around the vents so it can expel heat. A router that doesn't have ventilation room will overheat and cause your internet to be slow ."
