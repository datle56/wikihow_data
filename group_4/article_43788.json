      "content": "Work with a favorite category in a new way. You might feel in a rut if you draw the same sorts of things over and over again. If you like drawing in a particular category, like nature scenes or fantasy scenes, you can still work with this, just work with it from a new perspective. For instance, if you like doing figure drawing, you might draw someone: [2] X Research source You know well in a place you’ve never seen them. Like you normally would except make one of their hands be unusually large. Reimagined as an unlikely superhero. As you imagine them to look fifty years from now."

      "content": "Set limits or parameters for your drawings. Sometimes, it’s the wide openness of the question “What should I draw?” that makes it so hard. If you force yourself to think “inside the box,” you might actually break through to create something interesting. Give yourself a couple of rules and start drawing according to them. [3] X Research source For instance, you might draw the same thing 20 times, making one small change each time. Likewise, you might tell yourself to draw the first 10 things that start with the letter “M” that pop into your head, no matter what they are."

      "content": "Look at your surroundings for inspiration. [5] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022. There are so many things around you. Look at people walking by on the street to just basic furniture in your home. Looking around will eventually make you come up with one or two ideas on what to draw. It's easy if the object or person is close to you, because then you have an exact copy of the real thing when you are drawing. If you have a device with you, you can take a picture of it and have it right next to you to make it less difficult. Go outside with your phone and take close up shots of leaves, flowers, branches and any textures that you find interesting. Using your photos as reference, draw the way the lines intersect with each other. [6] X Expert Source Kathy Leader Artist Expert Interview. 13 February 2022."

Draw lines, simple shapes, scribbles, cartoon characters, stick people, or anything else that comes out. The physical act of moving your hands to create can reenergize you. Doodling allows you to think and create in a non-judgmental, almost subconscious way. Draw slowly and meditatively and you may come up with an interesting abstract composition!

Set a timer for one minute and try to draw the entirety of a figure or object. You will have work quickly, forcing you to capture just the essence of your subject. Do several of these drawings in a five or ten minute period. You can even use online images as subjects for gesture drawings. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Copy the masters. If you’re stuck and don’t know what to draw, you can always copy what someone else has already done! Trying to recreate the work of a previous artist not only solves the problem of what to draw, it can also be a great opportunity to learn. Consider copying the work of the Old Masters like Raphael or Rembrandt, as well as new ones like Frieda Kahlo or Francis Bacon. Many museums allow you to sketch on site. Grab your sketchpad and a pencil, and draw a work that inspires you."

      "content": "Consult a book on drawing. Reading a book about drawing might seem like the path to boredom rather than creativity, but if you’re stuck, one of these can be a lifeline. Even if you’re an experienced artist, looking at the fundamentals and trying basic drawing exercises can be refreshing and lead to great ideas. Some classic books on drawing include: Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain (Betty Edwards), Drawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner (Claire Watson Garcia) Elements of Drawing (John Ruskin) The Practice and Science of Drawing (Harold Speed), Human Anatomy for Artists: The Elements of Form (Eliot Goldfinger) What to Draw and How to Draw It (E.G.

Clearing your mind can make you feel creatively refreshed. You can also look to these as sources of input to get drawing ideas. For instance: [11] X Research source While walking around your neighborhood, look for a seemingly banal object or scene that might make a great subject for a drawing. Think about what images are suggested by the music you are listening to, and draw them."
