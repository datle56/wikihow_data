      "content": "Take a sympathetic and gentle tone when you break the news. Your friends and family have likely been looking forward to smothering the baby in kisses, so they may be disappointed. Remember that while you have had time to mull your decision over, if they are hearing about it for the first time, they may struggle to contain their disappointment or frustration. If you want to persuade them to follow your rule, try to be as understanding as possible. No-kiss rules are becoming more and more common as research increasingly shows newborns are vulnerable to germs spread through mouth contact, but older generations may not be accustomed to them. [1] X Research source “I have some difficult news, Mom. We won’t be letting anyone kiss the baby outside of our immediate family.” “I know you’re upset at this, Uncle Alan, and that makes sense—I know you were looking forward to snuggling the baby.” “I understand you’re disappointed, Aunt Elizabeth. It was a tough decision, but I think it’s the right thing to do.”"

      "content": "Some people are more likely to respect the rule if it comes from a doctor. As a parent, you know what's best for your child. Unfortunately, some people are more receptive to the advice of a medical professional. Trying to convince stubborn family members to listen to you can be overwhelming and unnecessarily stressful, but invoking the word of your doctor can make it easier for your family to acclimate to the new rule—which makes it easier on you. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even if your doctor didn’t explicitly enforce a no-kiss rule, it is worth it to your mental health to fib so that you can defuse the situation quickly. “I know it’s unexpected, but it’s what my doctor advised.” “The doctor really thinks this is the best way to keep the baby safe.” “It’s disappointing, but my doctor is the expert, so I trust her advice.”"

      "content": "Your family may be more understanding if you explain the dangers. Explain to them that babies’ immune systems are still developing in the early months, and that in the meantime, non-immediate family members should avoid kissing the baby. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source People may be more receptive to your rule if they can understand your reasoning. While non-immediate family members’ kisses can be dangerous to the baby, a mother’s immune system offers the baby protection, meaning Mama can kiss and breastfeed her baby and it not only won’t harm the baby, it will protect them. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source “I know, I didn’t realize how vulnerable babies were at this age until I did the research! I’m glad I learned!” \"I know this is surprising and disappointing news. If you would like to talk about it more, I would be happy to explain my reasoning in more detail.\" “After the first few months, the baby will need to work on strengthening his immune system—that’s when he’ll really be needing your kisses!"

It’ll come soon enough!” “It’s just for a little while. The time will fly by like that.”"

      "content": "Remind everyone the baby’s health is more important than their feelings. This news may be disappointing to some of your friends or family members, and it may cause them to prioritize their own hurt feelings over the wellbeing of the baby. Remind them you aren’t making the rule for no reason, and that they should prioritize the health of the baby over their own feelings. It’s also worthwhile to remind yourself why you are taking this stand: it may be uncomfortable standing up to your loved ones, but keeping feathers unruffled is less important than ensuring your baby grows up happy and healthy. [6] X Research source “I know you’re hurt, Dad, but don’t lose track of what’s really important: the baby’s health.” “I hope we can put hurt feelings aside and prioritize the baby’s development.” “I know it’s a blow, but aren’t the baby’s health and wellbeing more important than being able to kiss her?”"

[7] X Research source Encouraging people to look on the bright side will remind them a no-kiss rule isn’t the end of the world, and that there’s still lots to be excited about. In fact, while kissing may pose a risk to the baby’s health, newborns greatly benefit from frequent cuddles. Present Grandma’s cuddles as integral to the baby’s development, and she may be receptive to the no-kiss rule. [8] X Research source"

Ease their anxieties by assuring them it’s not personal, and that you don’t feel comfortable with anyone kissing your baby (just for a little while!). Remember that many infections or viruses that are merely uncomfortable to adults, such as cold sores, are painful or dangerous for infants. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source “It’s not a reflection on you, Aunt Margaret. The baby is just too vulnerable right now.” “Even someone who doesn't feel sick could be carrying germs. I just would rather not take any chances.” “I’m not letting anyone kiss the baby right now. But in a few months, she’ll be more than happy to be smooched.”"

I hope you will come and see the baby even if you can't kiss her.\" “I’m really counting on you being there for the baby, even if kisses aren’t allowed.” “Take all the time you need to process the news.

If she responds negatively or ignores you, telling her she cannot see the baby until she respects your wishes may emphasize the seriousness of your rule. [11] X Research source If you struggle to be confrontational, it may help to write down what you want to say before you sit down with your friends and family to discuss your rule. You might even explain your rule in a text or email to avoid direct confrontation (and to allow the recipient time and space to collect their thoughts before replying). “I know you are disappointed, Aunt Mary, but please respect my wishes.” “I hate to hurt you, Gramps, but I am my baby’s mother, and I have the final word.” “I don’t feel comfortable with you near my baby until you can respect my rule, Aunt Becky.”"

If you can express your boundaries to your friends and family before the baby is born, it will give them time to adjust to your expectations before the baby is in the picture.

If you wait until after the baby is already born, it may be a bit harder to bring everyone around to the idea that the baby isn’t to be kissed."
