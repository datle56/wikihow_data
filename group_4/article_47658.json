      "title": "Try a long skirt.",
      "content": "Try a long skirt. Winter is a great time for wearing longer skirts. They provide more warmth than shorter skirts, and they can still be fashionable. You can even go for an ankle-length skirt. [1] X Research source Pick out a skirt that extends somewhere between your mid-calf and the top of your foot, a few inches above your ankle. Longer skirts will keep you warmer, but a skirt thatâ€™s too long will drag on the ground, getting wet and muddy."

      "title": "Choose skirts made with warm fabric.",
      "content": "Choose skirts made with warm fabric. Shorter skirts are not going to provide much warmth. However, if you choose a fabric like wool, you are going to get a bit more warmth out of them. Denim, suede, and velvet can also offer more warmth. After that, you'll just need to pair them with something warm, such as leggings and a sweater."

      "title": "Choose a knee-length skirt for flexibility.",
      "content": "Choose a knee-length skirt for flexibility. A knee-length skirt offers a bit of warmth (though not as much as a full-length skirt). In addition, you can wear it in a variety of situations.Knee-length skirts can be made to look professional, trendy, or flirty, depending on how you accessorize them. For instance, a pencil skirt paired with a button-up shirt and suit jacket can look professional, while a pencil skirt paired with a fancy top can serve for an evening out."

      "title": "Subvert expectations with a mini skirt.",
      "content": "Subvert expectations with a mini skirt. Use a mini-skirt to create a chic look. Mini-skirts in winter seem to defy common sense. As a result, wearing one gives your style an edgy twist. Matching the skirt with suitable leg coverings will keep you both warm and fashionable. For instance, try a mini-skirt with patterned leggings and an oversized sweater."

    {
      "title": "Double up on skirts.",
      "content": "Double up on skirts. This advice may sound a little odd. However, layering skirts can provide you with extra warmth and look fashionable at the same time. Try a longer flowing skirt under a slightly shorter (less flowing) skirt, for instance, and it can be like having a petticoat on. [2] X Research source Try a button-up dress with out any ruffles, and throw it over a ruffled skirt. Just button a few buttons at the top of the dress."

    {
      "title": "Don a pair of knee-high boots.",
      "content": "Don a pair of knee-high boots. If your look demands a shorter skirt, knee-high boots may be just what you need to stay warm. Try a pair in leather to amp up the fashion level. You could also try suede for a softer look. [3] X Research source If you want something a bit more daring, try a pair of thigh-high boots."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put on ankle-high shoes.",
      "content": "Put on ankle-high shoes. Ankle-high boots are an obvious choice for winter. They can be fun, fashionable, and warm. You don't have to stick to boots, though. For a little whimsy, try a pair of ankle-high sneakers. It's warm, plus you'll get great traction. [4] X Research source Almost any length skirt will look great with ankle-high boots. Try a pencil skirt, for instance, or even a full-length skirt."

    {
      "title": "Wear leggings or stockings.",
      "content": "Wear leggings or stockings. Leggings and stockings add warmth, and they can make a fashion statement at the same time. Most are made of cotton, polyester blends, or spandex. They come in a variety of colors, so choose one that works well with your skirt. Black, brown, and other muted neutrals are safe options for most skirts, but you may consider choosing a bolder color or pattern to give your outfit a bit of pizzazz. [5] X Research source For instance, try a pair of tartan leggings under a red mini skirt for a bold look. For something more neutral, throw a pair of tan stockings on under a full-length skirt."

    {
      "title": "Throw on a pair of slim pants.",
      "content": "Throw on a pair of slim pants. While this look isn't for everyone, a pair of pants underneath your skirt can add warmth and be fashion-forward at the same time. Try a slim pair of pants in a neutral color. Some fashionistas even advise a skirt over a pair of wide-legged jeans. [6] X Research source Try a pair of skinny jeans underneath a red calf-length skirt."

    {
      "title": "Throw a sweater on top.",
      "content": "Throw a sweater on top. A chic sweater on top can be just the right note to make an outfit. Plus, it has the added bonus of keeping you warm. You can also layer a long-sleeved shirt under a sweater vest for a different look. [7] X Research source You can even pair an oversized sweater with a short skirt."

    {
      "title": "Make your jacket part of the outfit.",
      "content": "Make your jacket part of the outfit. You need your jacket when you're out and about, but don't worry, you can just incorporate it. For instance, a long jacket belted over a long skirt can be quite chic. [8] X Research source For a short skirt, you can go short or long with your jacket, depending on the look you want."

      "title": "Don't forget the warm accessories.",
      "content": "Don't forget the warm accessories. Add a chic scarf for extra warmth and a splash of color. Also, don't forget gloves. A sleek pair of leather or suede gloves goes with most looks. Add a knit cap on top, and you've got a recipe for winter warmth with sleek style. [9] X Research source For instance, you could pair a tight-fitting sweater with suede gloves, a big chunky scarf, and a matching knit hat."
