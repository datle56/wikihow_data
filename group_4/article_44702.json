[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the virus that creates warts, and it invades your body in the superficial layer of your skin, thus causing a thickened growth that resembles a callous. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It is more likely to occur in skin that has been broken open or is wet, but can occur in healthy dry skin as well. Warts may take up to six months to appear on the sole of the foot after exposure to the virus, so it can be difficult to trace back to the precipitating event. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use salicylic acid, at home or with the help of a healthcare provider if you would like additional guidance. [6] X Research source Prior to treatment with salicylic acid, use a pumice stone to remove the outer layer of your wart(s), so that the dead skin cells (the callous part) are removed. [7] X Expert Source Catherine Cheung, DPM Board Certified Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2019. You will know when you are done because the skin underneath the callous part is much more sensitive and it will hurt to continue scraping any further. Soak the affected foot (or feet, if you have warts on both sides) in warm water for 10–20 minutes prior to treatment. [8] X Research source This softens the skin and enhances the effectiveness of treatment. Make sure your foot is completely dry after soaking to that the salicylic acid patch you will apply stays on as well as possible. Apply salicylic acid patch to the affected area of your foot. [9] X Research source The best time to do this treatment is just before bedtime each night. Leave it on overnight, and remove it in the morning. Continue this treatment every night until the wart(s) is/are gone, and one to two weeks longer after they have disappeared to ensure that the HPV virus has been totally eradicated. Note that for people with \"neuropathy\" (medical conditions that relate to damage to their nerves), it is not advisable to use salicylic acid. This is because the decreased sensation for people with these conditions may result in the salicylic acid causing damage to their skin without them being able to notice it."

      "content": "Try duct tape — another effective remedy that can be used at home. It is not fully understood why duct tape works as a treatment for plantar warts, but a number of scientific studies have shown that it has good success in a great number of people, so it is definitely worth a try. [10] X Research source The silver duct tape available at most home improvement stores is better than the clear type, for the reason that it tends to stick better to the soles of the feet. Place it on the sole of your feet (a piece large enough to fully cover any and all warts), and leave it on for six days. If it falls off before then, replace it with a new piece of duct tape sooner rather than later as the goal is to keep the warts covered for a full six days. Then remove it for one day to let the area breathe. After removing it, soak your foot for 10–20 minutes in warm water to soften the skin, and use a nail file or pumice stone to scrape away dead skin on the surface. [11] X Research source Note that people who do find success with the duct tape strategy tend to show improvement by the two week mark, and often complete resolution by the four week mark of using this treatment. If you do not find this is the case for you, it is best to move on and try other options. Be aware that if you have any of the following medical conditions — diabetes, poor circulation to your extremities (hands and feet, called \"peripheral artery disease\" by doctors), nerve problems (called \"neuropathy\"), or any chronic skin conditions — it is not advisable to use duct tape as a treatment, as it may irritate your skin as a result of having these conditions."

      "content": "Ask your doctor to try cryotherapy (also called liquid nitrogen). This is where a very cold liquid is applied to the skin that destroys plantar warts by freezing them. [15] X Research source Most often you will have to return to see your family doctor several times to receive multiple liquid nitrogen treatments, before the wart (or warts) completely goes away. Your doctor can provide a schedule of how frequently she would like to see you. After the wart disappears, it is most often recommended to use salicylic acid as a follow-up to treatment for one to two weeks to ensure that the wart does not return. Due to some pain that accompanies treatment with liquid nitrogen, it is not recommended for young children. However, older children and adults tend to have no problem with it. Know that there is the possibility with this treatment (for people with darker skin) to have some depigmentation (lightening of the skin) in the area of treatment. If this is a cosmetic concern for you, speak to your doctor who may recommend alternative modes of treatment for your wart(s). If you notice any depigmentation that bothers you after the first liquid nitrogen treatment, you may choose not to continue. The damage from a single treatment will likely be very minimal (if at all), but it could be permanent so it is best to opt out if this bothers you."

If your doctor deems that this procedure is what you need, he or she will first inject some local anesthetic (freezing agent) into your skin in the area around the warts. [16] X Research source This freezing ensures that the procedure can be done without causing you undue pain. After the freezing is complete, the doctor will use a small scalpel to excise, or remove, the wart(s) from your skin. [17] X Research source Your doctor will likely recommend follow-up treatment of some sort to give the maximum chance that the wart(s) will not return."

Your doctor may also consider an injection into the wart itself. [19] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is a procedure done by your doctor for cases that are unsuccessful with other modes of treatment. Finally, your doctor may try laser treatments (or phototherapy). This is another option available to patients whose warts persist despite trying other simpler treatments."
