      "content": "Understand how Offline Mode works. Offline Mode removes Firefox's connection to the internet, instead fetching all information from the browser cache. While online, Firefox will automatically save websites you browse as cached web content. These cached versions of the sites can be accessed when offline, but additional browsing beyond the saved content is not possible (i.e. you can navigate to any site you previously visited, but any links on that site that are not already cached will return an error. Likewise, even if connectivity is restored, Offline Mode must be disabled to resume browsing non-cached sites). [2] X Expert Source Stan Kats Cybersecurity Expert Expert Interview. 16 July 2021. The storage size of the cache is limited. As a user browses, older content is removed from the cache and replaced with the most recent. By default, Firefox stores a cache of 350MB. This is a solid amount of web content, but if you want more (or less), you can edit the cache size by going to “☰ > Options > Advanced > Network” and selecting “Override automatic cache management”. This will allow you manually set the cache size."
