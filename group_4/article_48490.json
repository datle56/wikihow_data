However, if a boy starts puberty late, they may continue growing past 18, possibly into their early 20s.

Late bloomers may take longer to catch up to their peers, while those who start puberty sooner may reach their adult height early."

During this early phase of puberty, boys begin to experience multiple physical changes, including the start of their growth spurt. They typically grow up to 2.5 in (5 cm) per year, but this growth rate often increases as they get slightly older and puberty ramps up.

They may grow anywhere from 2.75 to 3 in (7 to 7.5 cm) or more per year! [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that these are general trends for wide age groups; when and how fast a boy grows depends on a variety of factors like at what age he began puberty, hormone levels, and genetics. For example, a boy is more likely to be a late bloomer if his father is one."

For the most part, a boy’s height is determined by the height of his parents; tall parents are more likely to have tall children, while shorter parents are more likely to have shorter children. However, there are other factors that can inhibit or negatively impact a boy’s growth, like: [6] X Research source Chronic illness Hormonal disorders like thyroid disease and growth hormone deficiency Genetic disorders linked to reduced height like Down syndrome or Turner syndrome Some medications like corticosteroids (if used for a long period at high doses) Being underweight, malnourished, or having an eating disorder like anorexia nervosa If you’re concerned about malnutrition, ask your doctor or a nutritionist about NuBest dietary supplements.

While this isn’t an exact science, you can get a decent estimation of a boy’s adult height this way. [9] X Research source For example, if his mother is 63 inches (160 cm) tall and his father is 69 inches (175 cm) tall, you can expect him to grow to about 68.5 inches (174 cm) tall (the average of 63 and 69 is 66, plus 2.5 gives you 68.5). You can use this same formula to estimate a girl’s adult height. Instead of adding 2.5 inches to the average, subtract it (a girl with these same parents would be about 63.5 inches (161 cm) tall)."

Simply find the point on the graph where his age and height intersect, then follow the nearest percentile line to predict his height by age 20. For example, if a boy is 3 years old and about 37 inches (94 cm) tall, he’d fall on the 50th percentile line (he’ll be taller than 50% of men and shorter than 50% of men). If you follow that line to the end of the graph, you’ll see he’ll be about 70 inches (178 cm) tall at age 20."

While genetics is the driving factor behind how much your son will grow, proper diet and activity will help him grow healthily and to his fullest potential. Here are some helpful tips to make sure he’s nourished and rested: [10] X Research source Encourage him to stick to a regular bedtime routine and get 8–10 hours of sleep per night (no phones or screens before bed!). [11] X Research source Keep the house stocked with healthy snack options, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. Eat balanced meals together as a family when possible. Encourage your son not to skip meals and to eat healthy portion sizes. Encourage him to get about 30 minutes of physical activity per day. Simple things like going for a walk or playing catch in the backyard count! Make sure he gets plenty of calcium, iron, and whole grains in his diet.

[14] X Research source Keep an eye on the media he consumes, too.

Allow your son to solve age-appropriate problems and look for creative solutions largely on his own to build confidence in his personal skills (with your supervision when safety is concerned). Teach him how to set boundaries and assert himself politely to cultivate his sense of self and advocate for his needs; this can be especially helpful if he’s experiencing teasing at school for his height. [15] X Research source Also encourage your son to take out any frustrations in healthy ways. Going for walks or exercising, listening to music, chatting with a friend, or expressing yourself creatively are all productive and effective ways to relieve stress and feel better about yourself."

If your son is a healthy child within the normal weight range for his age and both parents are of average height, he should be growing about 2 inches per year after age 2 and before puberty, when this growth rate accelerates. If his growth rate is smaller or has leveled out, there may be an underlying condition inhibiting his growth. [17] X Trustworthy Source Seattle Children's Hospital Health information provided by Seattle Children's hospital. Go to source Often, the causes for short stature are harmless and may correct themselves in time. These include things like delayed puberty or having short parents and family members. However, there may be a chronic illness, genetic condition, or nutritional deficiency impacting your child’s growth rate. If you’re worried about their height, schedule an appointment to discuss your concerns. A PCP (primary care physician) may recommend you to an endocrinologist if your child’s height is consistently in a very low percentile to test for conditions like growth hormone deficiency, thyroid disease, celiac disease, blood disorders, or kidney disease."
