Starting a healthier diet is a great overarching goal; however, to make your goal more realistic and doable, you'll need to be more specific about what you want out of a \"healthy diet.\" [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It might be helpful to first think about your current diet. What's unhealthy about it? Do you need to eat more green vegetables? Do you need to drink more water? Should you snack less? Write up a list of the things you want to change, add or stop about your current diet. Use these ideas to form multiple small goals to help you reach a healthier diet. The best way to reach any goal is to start with one or two very small changes. Trying to overhaul your entire diet in a few days probably won't work well. Choose something small to work on each week. You'll be much more successful long-term. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

This will serve as a method to track and evaluate your progress. Write all your goals in your food journal. You can review them as needed or change them as you continue to make changes to your diet. Also track all of your foods and beverages in your food journal. This will help you physically see what's missing from your diet or what you're eating too much of. Make sure to write out each breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack (even a few nibbles) and drinks you consume throughout the day. The more accurate you are, the better resource this will be. Each week in your food journal, write down the change you want to work on. For example, \"This week, I will drink eight glasses of water each day.\" At the end of the week, go back over your journal to see if you've completed this goal. There are many apps available to download on your smartphone that can help you track calories, exercise, and even how much water you drink."

Meal plans can help you stay organized and on track throughout the week. You'll know exactly what you're going to have and on what day. This way you can go to the grocery store with a specific list, only buying what you plan to use in your meals for the week. You can also plan ahead of time for busy days — for instance, if you know you'll be very busy and work late on Thursday, make something on Wednesday that you can easily reheat and have for leftovers on Thursday. Also write up the corresponding grocery list to your meal plans. This will help you get in and out of the grocery store and ensure you have all the necessary ingredients at home to make all of your meals. Don't skip meals. If you currently skip meals, make sure to schedule a meal or a healthy snack for yourself at least every four hours. Skipping meals is more likely to lead to binge eating later, which contributes to weight gain."

      "content": "Meal prep in your free time. If you're busy and have little time to make a meal from scratch, meal prep will be the key to following your new healthier diet. Meal prep helps you get a lot of the work of cooking from scratch or cooking at home out of the way during free time. When it's time for dinner on a busy weeknight, you should have most or even all of the cooking already done. Plan a day or two during the week when you have some free time to do your meal prep. Review your meal plan and grocery list and try to find ways to get some cooking done. Meal prep is flexible. You can cook full dinners in advance so you just have to reheat the night you want to eat it, or you can just do washing or chopping of vegetables or marinating meat so you can quickly cook the night of. Also consider purchasing foods that require less prep work to begin with. For example, you can purchase pre-washed and cut bagged lettuce instead of a whole head of lettuce, frozen vegetables that are heat and serve, or pre-grilled lean protein like grilled chicken strips. Meal prepping can be a time to catch up with people. Ask your partner or children to help you prep while you talk about what has been going on in your lives.
