      "content": "A widow’s peak is a V-shaped point at the center of someone’s hairline. A widow’s peak specifically refers to a small triangle of hair that descends below someone’s hairline, but it’s often used to describe any V- or U-shaped hairline. A true widow’s peak is present since birth. [1] X Research source A reversed widow’s peak is when the V cuts up into the hair instead of down on the forehead."

      "content": "The term widow’s peak may refer to a headdress widows once wore. Before “peak” ever meant mountain, it just meant “point.” In the early 16th century the hoods that widows wore started being referred to as “peaks”, and by the late 17th century “widow’s peak” had become a descriptive phrase, separate from its origins.

Other conditions include: [4] X Research source Aarskog-Scott syndrome, a genetic disorder that can cause a widow’s peak, along with far apart eyes, a long philtrum (space between the nose and lips), cleft lips, webbed fingers, and short stature. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Opitz-Frias syndrome, a rare genetic condition that affects the entire midline of the body. This can pull someone’s hair down into a widow’s peak, as well as cause abnormalities in their throat, heart, and urinary tract.

      "title": "V-shaped hairlines can be caused by aging and hair loss.",
      "content": "V-shaped hairlines can be caused by aging and hair loss. Even if you notice your hairline starting to recede, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going bald. Hairlines “mature” as people age and can often end up 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than where they started. When your hairline moves back, it can sometimes leave that little v-shaped chunk behind—a widow’s peak. [8] X Research source To determine if your hairline is receding , pay attention to where and how fast you’re losing hair. If it’s happening quickly, unevenly, or concentrated at the temples, that could mean you have a receding hairline. This is especially true if the top and back of your head is losing hair, too."

If you love your widow’s peak and want the world to love it too, grab some gel and slick your hair back , keeping it all off your forehead. [9] X Research source If you have long hair, put it in a high ponytail or bun. For the most dramatic widow’s peak possible, buzz your head to have your hairline front and center 24/7. If you’re especially fair haired, a buzz cut could actually hide your widow’s peak."

      "content": "Experiment with interesting parts. The widow’s peak creates a natural center to your hairline, which can be even further emphasized with a middle part. If you’re looking for more disorder, though, make a zig zag part by angling the end of a rat tail comb back from your widow’s peak, then combing down the sides of the hair. Make the zigzag go further back by reinserting the brush and switching the direction of your angle."

Characters like Scar from Disney’s Lion King and the Joker (of Batman fame) are examples of how Bela Lugosi’s hairline now visually symbolizes evil. This being said, there is nothing particularly evil about a widow’s peak."
