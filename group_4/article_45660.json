      "content": "Shuffle and deal 7 cards to each player. Set the leftover stack of cards facedown in the middle of the playing area—they’ll be known as the draw pile. Flip over the first card in this stack and place it face-up next to the draw pile. This is where all the played cards go. [1] X Research source The first flipped card is simply a placeholder, even if it happens to be an action card."

      "content": "Put down regular or special wild cards on your turn. Unlike regular UNO, you don’t have to worry about matching numbers or colors on your turn. The mission of UNO All Wild! is to annoy and outsmart your opponents by playing a wide variety of action cards that skip the next player, force them to draw cards, or reverse the direction of play."

      "title": "Draw a card if you’d rather not play one of the cards in your hand.",
      "content": "Draw a card if you’d rather not play one of the cards in your hand. Grab a single card from the draw pile. Play it immediately after (if you like what you drew), or put it in your hand and forfeit the rest of your turn. Example: If Player 1 has no action cards and Player 2 only has one card left in their hand, Player 1 might choose to draw a card in the hopes that it’ll be an action card. If they do pull an action card (like a Skip), Player 1 can prevent Player 2 from winning."

      "title": "Wild",
      "content": "Wild This card is played normally without any special actions (like a numbered card in a traditional UNO game). Like all UNO Wild cards, it features a black backdrop with a multicolored red, blue, yellow, and green oval on the front. [3] X Research source A Wild card is the standard, multi-colored card that makes up the bulk of your UNO All Wild! Deck. As a fun callback to the original UNO, declare a color change when you put your card down. Just keep in mind that this won’t actually change the gameplay at all—after all, everyone is playing with Wild cards!"

If your game was going in a counterclockwise direction, a Reverse card would make it go clockwise; if your game was going clockwise, the Reverse card would make it counterclockwise. This card has a symbol of two arrows pointing in opposite directions (like a traditional UNO Reverse card)."

      "content": "Wild Targeted Draw Two This card lets a player choose an opponent to draw 2 cards. The chosen target has to pick up the cards but doesn’t lose their turn in the process. Afterwards, gameplay continues as it normally would. Example: Player 1 plays a Targeted Draw Two and uses it on Player 3. Player 3 draws the required cards, and then gameplay continues with Player 2. This card features the symbol of a rifle scope (a circle with 4 small lines peeking out) and a “+2” in the very center."

      "title": "Wild Forced Swap",
      "content": "Wild Forced Swap This card allows the player to swap their entire hand with the opponent of their choice. The gameplay continues as normal after the exchange is made. If you swap with a player who has just 1 card, remember to say UNO immediately after the exchange (before another player does); otherwise, pick up the UNO penalty of 2 cards. Example: Player 2 plays a Forced Swap and uses it on Player 4. After exchanging hands, gameplay continues with Player 3."

Assign points based on each type of leftover card: regular Wild cards are valued at 20 points, while any type of action card is worth 50 points. Count up the total between the leftover cards and add it to the winner’s score—the official official UNO All Wild! rules specify to play until 500 points. [4] X Research source While you can definitely stop at 500 points, there’s no saying you can go higher! Play as many rounds as you and your fellow players would like. Note: Scoring in UNO is completely optional."
