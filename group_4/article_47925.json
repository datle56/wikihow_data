When you toggle on the Hide Alerts option, you'll still receive the messages, but you won't be alerted with a sound, push notification, or banner. [1] X Research source When a conversation has Hide Alerts on, you can still see the red indicator on the Messages app icon and the blue circle next to the conversation; this tells you that you have unread messages. The user won't be notified that you have their conversation muted. Hide Alerts can really come in handy for busy group chats when you don't want to be notified of every new message."
