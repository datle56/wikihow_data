When you hear a homophobic slur or statement, make sure you respond to them in a rational and respectful manner. When you hear something negative such as “gays go against God’s plan” or “all gays are pedophiles,” adopt some of the following techniques to successfully deal with this speech: Be matter-of-fact. Once you include emotion into your voice, it can be easy for others to not take you seriously. Speak with facts and with a level head so that your message is more likely to be heard. Explain why what was said is hateful. Sometimes, people speak without realizing that their words have meaning. Explain why what a person said was hateful and perhaps she will understand the error of her ways. Say that there is nothing wrong with being gay or a lesbian. This positive attitude can show that you have support for others."
