The best, safest, and most reliable VPN services are not free, but many have free trials and/or very affordable subscription prices. Some popular options are NordVPN , Private Internet Access , and ExpressVPN . If your parents, company, school, or other authority has restricted your ability to install software on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you won't be able to install a VPN.

While there is no official Tor browser for iPhones or iPads, the developers of Tor recommend using Onion Browser https://onionbrowser.com , a free Tor-based browser you can install from the App Store.
