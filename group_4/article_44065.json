Marilyn Monroe once said, “If you can make a girl laugh, you can make her do anything.” [1] X Research source Why not follow the advice of one of the most sought after icons of all time? You want a Tinder bio that makes your potential soulmate chuckle—just be sure you're still setting an appropriate and respectful tone. After all, this stranger on the other side of the screen could be the LOYL (Love of Your Life)! [2] X Research source Examples: “I may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m definitely somebody’s spiked coffee on a Monday morning. Could that be you?” “‘She made amazing blueberry pancakes and gave excellent back scratches. 10/10, would recommend.’– My ex.” “My perfect date? We go to a thrift store and pick out vintage outfits for each other. Then, we go into another shop acting disoriented and confused. We frantically go up to the cashier and ask, ‘What year is it?!’ You in?”"

      "content": "Ask thoughtful, engaging questions. Getting your matches to engage you in conversation is half the battle—and half the fun! In your bio, ask the kinds of questions you really want to know the answers to, with a quirky and flirty edge. They don’t have to be overly complicated, but you don’t want them to be “yes” or “no” questions. The best questions are open-ended ones that merit thoughtful, creative responses. Examples: “What’s your favorite restaurant appetizer? I’m a huge fan of mozzarella sticks!” “What top three songs would play in the soundtrack of your life?” “What fictional character do you most identify with?” “What niche subject would you be able to give a Ted Talk on?” “What’s the best piece of advice anyone’s ever given you?”"

      "content": "Avoid negativity at all costs. Although there’s definitely a place and time for virtual teasing and banter, don’t lead with negativity. Don’t mention negative past experiences on the app, don’t disparage people of your preferred gender, and don’t speak like a person who’s been scorned before. No matter how tragic your dating history might be, remember that you only need lightning to strike once. Examples. Don’t: “If you’re like every other girl on here just looking for a sugar daddy, swipe left.” Do: “Looking forward to binge watching Netflix with one person forever.” Don’t: “If you have kids, keep swiping, I’m not interested in being anyone’s stepmom.” Do: “I love pets, so feel free to tell me all about your furry cuddle buddy!”"

      "content": "Try to stand out among the rest. This is not the time to be shy about sharing your quirks—with good measure, of course. While you do want as many matches as possible, you don’t want to cast such a wide net that you match with just anyone. Be honest and specific about your interests and see what compatible cuties swipe right. Examples: “I love reading fantasy novels, like the Game of Thrones series. Just looking for my little Khaleesi to snuggle up with me on the couch.” “Baking bread is one of my favorite things, so I hope you’re not afraid of carbs!” “Sky diving, bungee jumping, spelunking—I’ve done it all! Looking for a partner in crime!”"

      "content": "Be confident, not cocky. There's a difference between being self-assured and self-absorbed. Potential matches will be attracted to people who seem put-together, successful, and know exactly what they want. It's fine to briefly mention what you do for work, what country you hope to visit next, or specific qualities you seek in a significant other. However, this is not the time for you to brag about how much money you make, all the times you’ve bene on a private jet, or your beach house in Mallorca. These may attract the wrong crowd—or no crowd at all! You should share information that helps a potential match get to know you better, not self-aggrandizing information that just paints you in a pretentious light."

This may go without saying, but please try to keep all your sexual innuendos to yourself during this fragile courting phase. It’s not a good look, and it’s certainly not becoming of anyone who wants a serious relationship. Making inappropriate comments too early on could set off alarm bells for matches. causing them to unmatch you. Asking if you can go over their place or inviting them over to your place on a first date is a no-go, and will probably make your match think that you only want a hook-up."

      "content": "Try not to mention your past romantic failures. Sure, everyone has a past, but your future flame doesn't need to hear anything about your former ones. Avoid saying anything along the lines of, “This is the fifth time I delete and download this app, so here’s hoping fifth time’s the charm!” Or, \"My ex cheated on me with 10 people, so the bar is on the floor!\" This attitude could easily deter a potential match from swiping right—and then they’re gone forever! It's okay to ask and answer questions like, \"How long was your last relationship?\" And, \"When did your last relationship end?\" But it's in everyone's best interest that you keep it short and sweet."

      "title": "Be honest about what you’re looking for.",
      "content": "Be honest about what you’re looking for. “Dating” is a pretty broad term, so you’ll want to specify your intentions. Are you just looking for some casual fun? Say so! Perhaps, instead, you’re looking for a short-term relationship with no real plans for serious commitment; say that, too. Or maybe you’re looking for marriage, children, a white picket fence—the whole shebang! Whatever you’re looking for, your matches will appreciate you being up front about it. Examples: “I travel often for work, so I’m just looking for something fun and casual with a likeminded person while I’m in town.” “I’m not against a long-term relationship with the right person, but I’d like to forge a strong friendship and connection before deciding to take things to the next level.” “In the words of Carrie Bradshaw, I’m looking for ‘can’t live without you’ kind of love and commitment, and I won’t settle for anything less!”"

      "content": "Pick good photos. Humans are visual creatures, so be very selective about the photos your post. Make sure your first photo is your best one, clearly showing your face. Then, have at least one that clearly shows your face and body, one of you in the middle of a hobby or activity, and one group picture to prove you have friends. Try to show your range of interests in your photos— they shouldn't all be fishing, gym, or bikini photos!"

      "content": "Select your best photo as your main profile pic. First impressions are very important, so make sure the first photo people see is the best one possible. It should be you alone—no group pics, as they may lead your potential match to scratch their head, wondering which one you are. Your face should be clearly visible, but at a reasonable distance from the camera. Additionally, it wouldn’t kill you to smile. Show off those pearly whites! If you don’t have any photos that meet all of the aforementioned criteria, get a friend to take a few pictures of you at your next social gathering. Dress well, groom yourself, and try to find natural lighting."

      "content": "Limit your selfies. Although one selfie is totally fine to include, a profile flooded with selfies can lead your matches to think one of two things: either you’re obsessed with yourself, or you don’t have that many friends, since they’re not in the picture with you or taking it for you. Both of these are red flags, so don’t go selfie-crazy, even if you have some absolute stunners. Instead, focus on uploading photos that illustrate your interests, hobbies, and social preferences."

[3] X Research source One “sexy” photo will give your matches an idea of your body type—we don’t want to catfish anyone—but more than one might send the wrong idea, especially if you’re trying to find a serious, long-term partner.

      "content": "Two Truths and a Lie Icebreaker games have a place in all sorts of professional and social settings, so why not Tinder? Two truths and a lie is a classic icebreaker game and the perfect way to share fun, unexpected facts about yourself with your Tinder matches. It also gives you the opportunity to grant them a glimpse into your personality with the “lie.” Examples: “I’ve met a former president. I have 12 tattoos. I named my dog after a Renaissance painter.” “I’ve been to every continent. I’m adopted. I was born on February 29th.” “English is not my native language. I fix up classic cars in my spare time. My favorite director is Christopher Nolan.”"

      "title": "Never Have I Ever",
      "content": "Never Have I Ever Although this is designed to be a drinking game, you can still use it to meet your match. The key is to say something that you’ve truly never done that you’re interested in learning about the other person. Examples: “Never have I ever ridden a horse.” “Never have I ever broken a bone.” “Never have I ever traveled abroad.” \"Never have I ever been engaged.\" \"Never have I ever sang karaoke.\""

      "content": "\"I was today years old when I learned that…\" Showcase your silly side by sharing something that you recently learned, that perhaps you should have known for a long time. Try to strike the perfect balance between funny and self-depricating. Examples: “I was today years old when I learned that turtles are not amphibians… they’re reptiles!” “I was today years old when I learned that we share about 50% of DNA… with bananas!” “I was today years old when I learned that Cleopatra was born closer to the moon landing than the building of the pyramids.” [4] X Research source"

      "content": "\"If you were on a deserted island…\" This classic school game requests that you and your potential matches really consider the things that are most important to you. There’s different versions of this with their own respective parameters, but sticking to books, movies, and food are good bets. Examples: “If I was on a deserted island, the three books I’d want with me are The Iliad by Homer, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and The Giver by Lois Lowry. “If I was on a deserted island, the three films I’d want to watch on repeat are Titanic , The Notebook , and Matilda .” “If I was on a deserted island, the three foods I’d want to eat forever would be tacos, pepperoni pizza, and chocolate cake.”"

      "content": "Lead with an engaging conversation opening, such as a question or joke. Starting a conversation is the most important part. You can have the best profile ever and that will mean virtually nothing if you can’t figure out how to spark up conversation. Leading with questions, humor, and sincerity are all good ways to hook the other person and get the conversation rolling. Playing an icebreaker game is another way to see someone's true colors fairly quickly. Avoid cliches and small talk. Your profile is not the place for pick-up lines—it’s for you to set genuine intentions for the kind of relationship you’re looking for. Don’t open up a conversation with questions like, “Hey, what are you up to?” Or, “How are you today?” This lets the other person know that you either didn’t bother to learn anything about them from their profile, or that you simply didn’t care to put in the effort. Both are bad."

Do not immediately suggest meeting up. Your first message should be an engaging question, not an instant invitation. Instead, get to know each other and keep the conversation going for about a week so. Then, broach the subject of meeting in real life. [5] X Research source After exchanging several messages and learning about them, you can suggest a more informed first date spot. You can offer to take them to a restaurant that features their favorite cuisine, out to drinks, or you can even meet up for a casual coffee."

      "content": "Keep chatting after you've locked in your date. Once you've asked for their phone number and the conversation has transitioned to real life, make sure you check in ahead of your date. Just because you've secured a real life rendezvous doesn't mean you can stop putting in effort. Confirm the date on the morning of, let them know how excited you are to meet, and make all the proper accommodations. You could offer to pick them up, send a ride-share car for them, or meet in a central location. Being thoughtful in planning the date is all part of making the best first impression possible. This first date can and likely will determine the rest of your relationship, so make sure you put your best foot forward."
