      "content": "Grab an object on your way down. If you can manage to grab a large object, such as a plank or a piece of rafter, you'll greatly increase your chances of survival. The object will absorb some of the impact when you land, taking a little stress off of your bones."

      "content": "Try to break your fall into parts. If you're falling next to a building, or off a cliff in the wilderness, do your best to break your fall into segments by hitting a ledge, a lower cliff, a tree, or another object. This breaks up the momentum of your fall and divides it into several shorter falls, which gives you a much better chance of surviving."

      "title": "Relax your body.",
      "content": "Relax your body. If your knees and elbows are locked and your muscles are rigid, the impact of the fall will do more harm to your vital organs. Don't hold yourself stiff. Do your best to relax your body so that when you hit the ground your body is more easily able to take the impact. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source One way to remain (relatively) calm is to focus on performing the steps that lead to greater survival rates. Stay aware of your body, moving your arms and legs to make sure they aren't locked."

      "title": "Bend your knees.",
      "content": "Bend your knees. Possibly nothing is more important to surviving a fall (or simpler to do) than bending your knees. Research has shown that having one's knees bent at impact can reduce the magnitude of impact forces 36-fold. However, do not bend them too far - only keep a slight bend so they are not locked.

      "title": "Land feet-first.",
      "content": "Land feet-first. No matter what height you fall from, you should always try to land on your feet. Landing feet-first concentrates the impact force on a small area, allowing your feet and legs to absorb the worst of the blow. If you are in any other position, try to right yourself before you hit the ground. [3] X Research source Fortunately, attaining the feet-first position seems to be an instinctive reaction. Keep your feet and legs tightly together so that both your feet hit the ground at the same time. Land on the balls of your feet. Point your toes slightly down before impact so that you will land on the balls of your feet. This will allow your lower body to more effectively absorb the impact."

    {
      "title": "Try to fall to the side.",
      "content": "Try to fall to the side. Once you land on your feet, you will fall either to the side, front or back. Try to avoid falling on your back. Falling to the side is statistically best. If you can't manage that, try to fall forward instead, breaking your fall with your arms."

      "title": "Protect your head for when you bounce.",
      "content": "Protect your head for when you bounce. When you fall from a great height onto land, you will usually bounce. Some people who survive the initial impact (often with a feet-first landing) suffer a fatal injury on their second impact. You will most likely be unconscious when you bounce. Cover your head with your arms by placing your arms on the sides of your head with your elbows facing forward (and projecting in front of your face), and your fingers laced behind your head or neck. This covers a large portion of your head. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Get medical help immediately. With all the adrenaline flowing in response to your flight, you may not even feel injured upon landing. Even if you are not visibly injured, you may have sustained fractures or internal injuries that must be treated immediately. No matter how you're feeling, get to a hospital as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Slow your fall using the arch position.",
      "content": "Slow your fall using the arch position. Unless you're falling from an airplane, you won't have enough time to try this step. Maximize your surface area by spreading yourself out using this skydiving technique. [5] X Research source Position yourself so that the front of your body faces the ground. Arch your back and pelvis and tilt your head back like you're trying to touch the back of your head to the back of your legs Extend your arms and bend your elbows at a 90 degree angle so that your lower arms and hands point forward (parallel to, and on the sides of, your head) with your palms facing down; spread your legs to shoulder width. Bend your knees slightly. Do not lock your legs and keep your leg muscles relaxed and fall into the motion to absorb most impact."

      "title": "Find the best landing spot.",
      "content": "Find the best landing spot. For very high falls, the surface on which you land is the greatest influence on your chance of survival. Search for steep slopes that gradually grow gentler, since you will not lose all of your momentum at once when you hit the ground. Observe the terrain below you as you fall. [6] X Research source Hard, inflexible surfaces such as concrete are the worst on which to fall. Very uneven or jagged surfaces, which present less surface area to distribute the force of impact, are also undesirable. The best possible surfaces on which to fall are those that will compress or give way when you fall on them, snow , soft ground (such as a newly tilled field or in a marsh), and trees or thick vegetation (although these present a high risk of impalement). Water is only safe to fall into up to around 150 feet (45.7 m); past this height it will be little better than falling on cement as it cannot be compressed. Falling in water also presents the high risk of drowning (since you will most likely be knocked unconscious). Water is much safer to fall into if it is frothy and bubbly."

      "title": "Steer yourself to the landing spot.",
      "content": "Steer yourself to the landing spot. If you're falling from an airplane, you will usually have about 1-3 minutes before impact. You will also have the ability to travel horizontally a good distance (up to a couple of miles or three kilometers). [7] X Research source From the arch position described above, you can direct your flight forward by pulling your arms slightly back at the shoulders (so that they are not extended forward as much) and straightening (extending) your legs. You can move backward by extending your arms and bending your knees as though you are trying to touch the back of your head with your heels. Right turns may be accomplished while staying in the arch position by twisting your upper body slightly to the right (dipping your right shoulder), and left turns are performed by dipping the left shoulder."

      "title": "Use the correct landing technique.",
      "content": "Use the correct landing technique. Remember to relax your body, keep your knees bent, and fall feet first. Fall forward, rather than backward, and protect your head with your arms in case you bounce. [8] X Research source If you are in an arch position, get your body vertical well before you hit the ground so that you don't get caught in some other position at impact (as a guide, keep in mind that at 1,000 feet, depending on your velocity, you have about 6-10 seconds before impact)."
