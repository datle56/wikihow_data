After those, the numbers come in combinations, so you can form more numbers by combining the names of the ones you already know. The words for the first 15 numbers in Spanish are uno (1), dos (2), tres (3), cuatro (4), cinco (5), seis (6), siete (7), ocho (8), nueve (9), diez (10), once (11), doce (12), trece (13), catorce (14), and quince (15)."

Recognize the pattern that most of these are more or less a combination of the word for the first digit and the suffix -enta . For example, cuarenta is a combination of cuatro (4) and the suffix -enta , with the \"t\" removed as well. To write numbers through 99, all you need are the tens and the second digit, separated by the word y . For example, 34 would be \"treinta y cuatro,\" which literally means \"30 and 4.\""

This is the case regardless of how many groupings there are. For example, if you wanted to write the number \"999,999\" in Spanish you would write the words as \"novecientos noventa y nueve mil novecientos noventa y nueve.\" The literal translation of this into English is \"nine hundred ninety and nine thousand, nine hundred ninety and nine.\""

If you fail to recognize this, you could make a significant error when writing numbers in Spanish.

The numerals uno and veintiuno also are shortened to un and veintiún if they are immediately before another number, a noun, or an adjective. For example, if you were talking about one dog, you would write \"un perro.\" When you're using the feminine forms of these numbers, however, they are not shortened.

One of the biggest differences between written numbers in Spanish and written numbers in English is the use of decimal points and commas. [5] X Research source When you write numbers in Spanish, separate thousands with a decimal point – not with a comma as you would in English. For example, you would write \"126,342\" as \"126.342\" in Spanish. Decimals, on the other hand, are written using a comma. For example, if you wanted to write pi in Spanish, you would write \"3,14159265359.\""

Unless you're referring to exactly one thing, the noun also must be pluralized. [6] X Research source For example, if you were referring to 20 houses, in Spanish you would write \"veintiuna casas.\" Keep in mind that in Spanish, anything that isn't exactly one must be pluralized. For example, on an invoice or spreadsheet, you would pluralize the noun even if the quantity listed was \"1,00\" (expressed in English as 1.00)."

[11] X Research source All but the first seven multiples are created by adding the suffix -plo to the root of the cardinal number word. Be careful of accent marks, which indicate which syllable should be stressed.

To do this with the first seven multiples, you'll have to use that seldom-used -plo form.

Which you use depends on where you are in the world – in Spain they typically are feminine, while in Latin America they typically are masculine. For example, if you wanted to write \"one tenth\" in Spanish you might write \"décimo\" in Guatemala, but in Spain you would probably want to write \"décima\" to ensure you were understood.
