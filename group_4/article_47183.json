      "content": "Adopt good habits. It can be hard to get out of bed if you don’t sleep correctly. Before making drastic changes, you should take on board a few simple rules. Some things to keep in mind for a good night’s sleep include: [1] X Research source Avoid caffeine and alcohol at least a few hours before going to sleep. Both are proven to have detrimental effects on sleep. Avoid greasy, spicy, or fatty food in the evening. These foods can cause an upset stomach, which may interfere with your sleep. Don’t read from a phone or a tablet before sleeping. Research shows that their lights and radiations can wreak your sleep and cause headaches."

      "title": "Engage in quiet and relaxing activities before sleeping.",
      "content": "Engage in quiet and relaxing activities before sleeping. It's important to prepare for the night. Reading a book or doing a puzzle is far more likely to prepare you for sleeping than playing violent computer games. Your body will produce the sleep hormone and make you tired more quickly. [2] X Research source Don't work or study just before going to bed. Any activity involving the stress of planning is likely to keep you awake. TV is also a source of excitement and should be avoided just before sleeping. Try to read a book or chat with your partner. You could also listen to relaxing or classical music. You can also try mental exercises before sleeping. Thinking about cities beginning with a certain letter will exhaust you quickly! Focus on positive thoughts and memories. Breath deeply to get your body relaxed."

      "content": "Get into a rhythm. If your rhythm is set properly, you may be able to regularly wake up refreshed without an alarm. Make an effort to get to bed and to get up at about the same time every day. If you work changing shifts or otherwise have to adjust your schedule, your rhythm will be thrown off for a while, but you can reset it over a few days. [3] X Research source You should sleep at least eight hours a day. Some need less sleep than others but make sure to find what’s right for you. Don’t change entirely your sleeping schedule in a day. Try to change your sleeping pattern over a long period of time. For example, go to sleep fifteen minutes earlier every day."

      "content": "Improve your sleeping environment. The quality of your bed or the layout of your bedroom might be the reason for which you can’t wake up in the morning. If you had a bad night, your body might just need to catch up on sleep. Check the following points: [4] X Research source You should sleep on a good mattress. Look for one that gives good back support and doesn’t store germs and bacteria. Think about the temperature of the room. You shouldn’t sleep in a warm room. Reduce external noises by closing windows, turning off the TV, or using a device that generates ‘white noises’. Protect against mosquitoes and other external nuisances. You can either buy a net or use anti-mosquito perfumes. Consider getting a larger bed or sleeping in separated beds if your spouse or partner wakes you up with his or her tossing and turning. Better yet, get a mattress that absorbs motion and will not be felt by your partner. Darken the room. Bright lights will keep you awake."

      "title": "Get the right alarm clock",
      "content": "Get the right alarm clock . Some people need a very loud, harsh alarm, some can’t wake up to the radio, and some find that gradual waking works best. There are even many varieties of alarms to stick near you that will vibrate to awaken you, including a vibrating pillow, wrist band, and devices that clip on to your pillow or that go between your mattress. [5] X Research source Consider what types of features you want the alarm clock to have, such as sounds, brightness, etc. Experiment and decide what’s best for you. Ask your friends and try to borrow a device before spending too much. Don’t forget your neighbors. Some alarm clocks are really loud and might not be suited for a flat. Discuss the alarm with your partner (if you have one). You don’t want to pick something that he or she hates. Make sure the alarm clock is set before going to sleep. Set it in advance for the whole week if possible."

      "content": "Position the alarm clock far from the bed. It is quite common for heavy sleepers to turn the alarm off in their sleep. If you need to get out of bed to turn it off, you will already increase your chances of staying awake. You can also set multiple alarm clocks in the room. Set them five to ten minutes apart to be sure to be unable to take them off in one round. Set your alarm earlier than necessary. For example, say you want to get up at 7:00 a.m., so you set your alarm about 10-15 minutes earlier, like 6:45 a.m."

      "content": "Get someone to help you. If your spouse or partner, or just a roommate, doesn’t have trouble waking up on time, ask him or her to help you wake up and to make sure you stay awake. You could also ask a friend to call you in the morning and talk to you for a minute or so until you become fully awake. Wake up calls to your home or cell phone are now available by subscription or for one-time calls. Pick someone reliable. You don’t want to miss your job interview because your roommate found it funny to let you sleep until noon. Give him precise instructions and write the time at which he should wake you up on a post-it."
