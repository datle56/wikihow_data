      "content": "Take time each day to give thanks to God . You can show gratitude to God no matter what your day brings. Start your day with a prayer of appreciation and thanks and end it in the same way—thankful for all your blessings. By thinking about the difficulties you experience and the good things you have, you can praise God through Bible verses, praying , and positive thoughts that say “thank you.” [17] X Research source Start your day with thanks . You can do this first thing in the morning by saying a well-rounded prayer to God or a prayer of Thanksgiving to the Lord. If you want to be prepared, simply write out your prayer the night before so you have it by your side when you wake up. Meditate on gratitude when you worship . Sing the Lord’s praises when you’re at church, in the car, walking the dog, or cooking dinner. Your thankfulness will radiate out and bring many blessings back to you even when you’re not praying to God . Give thanks as you read scripture . Take time to read Bible verses carefully and thoughtfully. Think about what God has in mind for you and how each story or fable can teach you about gratitude and giving back. Thank God for both the blessings and challenges . When you pray as a Christian , you show gratitude for good and bad experiences. This helps take the focus away from your own issues and places it back onto God, where it belongs. Continue to thank God for every blessing he has given you and you can enjoy a spiritually fulfilled life."
