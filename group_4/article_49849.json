      "title": "Define the scope of your analysis.",
      "content": "Define the scope of your analysis. You might examine the industry as a whole or an industry segment which targets a particular subset of the general market. For example, you could be investigating the petrochemical industry as a whole, or a narrower niche, like US petroleum refineries. In either case, you’ll need to identify the companies that offer services or products similar to those which your company offers. [1] X Research source You might also need to conduct some cross-industry research. For example, a game developer may need to compile statistics on the console gaming market, PC gaming market, and handheld gaming market."

      "title": "Research your industry with independent government agencies.",
      "content": "Research your industry with independent government agencies. Government databases contain huge volumes of statistical information on various economic sectors. Some of the best government sources in the United States for industry statistics include the Market and Industry Analysis Statistics published by the United States Census, the Department of the Treasury, FedStats.gov, EconomicIndicators.gov, and the Food and Drug Administration. All publish useful reports and statistics. [2] X Research source For other countries, consult federal databases and agencies within your nation, or conduct an internet search with keywords like “government statistics [name of your industry]” to locate relevant information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compile independent research.",
      "content": "Compile independent research. At least two independent research reports with data on your market should be consulted. Contact private data-collection agencies or industry interest groups for a published report or market analysis relevant to your research. [3] X Research source You can also consult experts within your own company. Just bear in mind that their views may be biased or unreliable."

    {
      "title": "Look at trade association data.",
      "content": "Look at trade association data. There may be more than one trade association for your industry. For instance, if you’re in the computer industry, you might consult or request recent industry-wide reports from the Computer & Communications Industry Association, the Association for Interactive Marketing, or the Information Systems Security Association. Whatever your industry, consult trade groups and industry publications to identify info which can provide background info on your industry analysis. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Demonstrate there is an ample market for your business proposal.",
      "content": "Demonstrate there is an ample market for your business proposal. To do this, you’ll need to know the relevant market size. The relevant market size is the company’s potential sales if it were to capture the entirety of its market niche. For instance, if you’re selling electric cars, your relevant market size is not all automobile drivers, or all people in the world who travel distances which make driving desirable, but rather the total of all electric car sales in a given year. [6] X Research source Be sure to carefully analyze any underlying assumptions that your market analysis relies upon. This is particular important for a new product or a product that is undergoing rapid acceptance. Relevant market sizes should be calculated in both dollar amount and unit amount. In the foregoing example, the relevant market size might be $200 million per year, or 30,000 electric cars."

      "content": "Think about barriers to entry or expansion. [8] X Research source Barriers might be in the form of market competition, but it could also manifest as a lack of money or talent, or as restrictive regulations and patents. If you’re going into or expanding a microchip production line, for instance, you’re going to need several million dollars in equipment and machinery. On top of that, you’ll need computer engineers and programmers to produce and design the chips. Other firms will be competing not only for your customers, but for your employees as well. All of these are things to consider when addressing barriers to entry."

If your report will be presented independently, you have more freedom to devote lots of space to raw data and detailed descriptions."
