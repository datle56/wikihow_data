      "content": "This is an effortlessly cool style that works for any hair texture. To style the look, blow dry your hair slightly upwards to add volume. Blow drying works better than towel drying because rubbing your head in a towel generates a lot of frizz. If you’ve got thin, straight Asian hair, add a texturizing powder, like Level 3 Styling Powder . Got thick Asian hair? Add a fingernail-sized amount of matte pomade, like Suavecito Pomade Firme . Rub in the product from the front to the back, until you’ve got the just rolled-out-of-bed look you want. [2] X Research source Styling Tip: Messy styles tend to look better when they’re shorter. Make sure to get your cut cleaned up every 4-6 weeks. Best face shapes: All face shapes"
