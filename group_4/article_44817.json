      "content": "Seek emergency medical help if you have pulmonary edema symptoms. Although pulmonary edema is treatable and you can make a full recovery with the right treatment, it's still a medical emergency. Get medical help right away and don't try to treat it by yourself. The main symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and an irregular heartbeat. Visit the emergency room or call your local emergency number like 911 for the right help. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The most common emergency treatment for edema is oxygen delivered with a face mask. Doctors may also use medications like morphine to relieve shortness of breath. Doctors may keep you in the hospital for a few days so they can observe you and make sure you're healthy enough to go home."

In most cases, you'll only need to use it if you have trouble breathing, but your doctor may want you to use it all the time until you're healthy again. Follow their instructions to administer the oxygen correctly.

Your doctor will tell you the correct settings and flow to use on the oxygen tank. Don't change these settings, or you won't get the right amount of oxygen. Oxygen is flammable, so never smoke when you have tanks in your home. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Flush fluid out of your system with diuretics. Diuretics or \"water pills\" are medications that make you urinate more frequently and drain fluids out of your body. This can help clear fluid in your lungs. They're usually in pill form, so take them exactly as your doctor directs you to and complete the entire course of the medication. [5] X Research source If you're prone to edema, your doctor may keep you on this medication to prevent future problems. If you received treatment in the hospital, the doctor may have already given you diuretics in IV form."

      "content": "Lower your blood pressure with prescription medications. In some cases, high blood pressure can cause pulmonary edema. If you have high blood pressure, then your doctor will probably prescribe blood pressure medications to get it under control. By lowering your blood pressure, you can avoid pulmonary edema in the future. [6] X Research source The most common blood pressure medications are ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. The specific type that your doctor uses depends on your condition. Edema could also come from low blood pressure, so your doctor may also try different medications to raise your blood pressure."

If your doctor approves, you can try taking a CoQ10 supplement for yourself and see if it works. [7] X Research source A common dosage is 2 mg per day, but follow the dosing instructions on the product you use. CoQ10 can interact with blood-thinning medication, especially warfarin, so don’t take it if you’re on these medications."

This could interfere with your heart's rhythm and cause another round of edema, so replace lost magnesium with a supplement. [8] X Research source In general, you need 300-420 mg per day, so stay within this range unless your doctor tells you to take a different amount.

Massages also relieve stress, which is good for your overall health. Try having an occasional massage to see if this helps you. [10] X Research source Inform your massage therapist if you’ve had pulmonary edema so they can adjust their approach accordingly. Check with your doctor before having a back massage.

If your edema was caused by heart disease or an infection, then you probably can’t do much to avoid the cause. Still, avoiding irritants and other things that could make you choke is a good idea, since you might have trouble breathing until you completely heal.
