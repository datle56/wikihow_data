      "content": "Wash your hoodie every 6-7 wears. Before washing your hoodie, determine if a wash is needed. It’s recommended that you wash hoodies after about six or seven wears because as outerwear they don’t dirty as quickly. Washing less frequently prevents added wear and tear. As long as your hoodie doesn’t smell, it’s okay to go a bit between washes. To be extra safe, wash your hoodie every week. Regularly washing it will make sure your hoodie doesn't get any set in stains—like from sweat or dirt—that are hard to clean. If you exercise in your hoodie, then you will likely need to wash it more. If you’re questioning whether or not it’s dirty, it’s better to go ahead and wash it. You don’t want worries about a dirty hoodie overshadowing your day. Consider what you’re wearing under your hoodie. The more layers you wear, the less sweat your hoodie encounters."
