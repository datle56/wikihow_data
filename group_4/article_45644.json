Note that most carriers provide this service for free (either immediately after you purchase or after a few days of actively using the network), so paying for this doesn't always make sense. Giving money and your phone data to a third-party service breaches your security and makes you more vulnerable to malicious actors. Third-party services offer to unlock your cell phone from a cellular carrier as well as unlock a phone when you've forgotten the password without factory resetting. With newer versions of Android, you cannot unlock your phone if you forgot the password without resetting it to factory settings. Don't believe third-party services that claim otherwise."

If you have multiple security measures set up in advance, you can use any of them to unlock your Android to avoid getting locked out of your phone. For example, if you have Face ID set up but there isn't enough light for your camera to read your face, you can also enter your PIN or swipe a pattern instead. Having multiple security measures in place will help you get back into your locked Android should you not be able to unlock it. [4] X Research source"
