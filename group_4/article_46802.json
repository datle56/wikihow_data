      "content": "Split the pod if you want to use the seeds. If you are planning to use the vanilla bean in a batter for a cake or for a batch of cookies, you will need to open the vanilla bean pod and remove the seeds. You will then add the seeds to the batter to infuse it with a natural vanilla flavor. To split the pod, lay the vanilla bean pod on top of a clean, dry cutting board. Turn the hooked end of the vanilla bean to the top of the board. Hold the top of the vanilla bean with your non-dominant hand and a sharp paring knife with your dominant hand. Split the pod with a long, vertical stroke through the middle of the bean. Cut only into the center of the pod, not through it completely. You want access to the tiny, dense seeds in the middle. Go slowly. If the knife slips in your hand against the bean, realign your knife with your previous cut and continue cutting the bean."

      "title": "Scrape out the seeds.",
      "content": "Scrape out the seeds. Peel the two sides of the vanilla bean outward with the side of the blade. Don’t use the sharp end, since you don’t want to cut the vanilla bean further. [2] X Research source Use the side of the knife or a small spoon to dig out the seeds. Dig the seeds out of the pod by running the spoon or the knife down the inside of one side of the pod. You should open the vanilla bean right before you plan to use them in cooking or baking. Keep in mind one vanilla bean is equal to three teaspoons vanilla extract. If you only need half that amount, you would only cut halfway down the bean, exposing only half of the seeds. A table of conversions for vanilla bean can be found online."

      "title": "Add the seeds to a baking recipe.",
      "content": "Add the seeds to a baking recipe. If you have a recipe for a cake, cookies, or a pie that require vanilla extract, you can use the vanilla seeds instead. Add the vanilla when you cream the butter in the recipe as this will ensure the seeds are well incorporated into the batter. You can also ensure the seeds are evenly distributed in your batter by taking a small amount of the batter and using a spoon or your hands to smush the seeds into the batter. Then, fold the batter with the seeds into the rest of the batter. A list of cakes, cookies, and pies that use vanilla bean can be found online. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a vanilla infused sugar.",
      "content": "Create a vanilla infused sugar. You can also rub the vanilla seeds into white sugar, infusing the sugar with vanilla. Rubbing the vanilla into the sugar will release the aroma of the vanilla and infuse the sugar with a natural vanilla taste. The sugar can then be used when sugar is required in a recipe. [4] X Research source Use the vanilla infused sugar in cookies like vanilla bean sables or vanilla shortbread."

      "title": "Make your own vanilla extract for baking.",
      "content": "Make your own vanilla extract for baking. Rather than spend a lot of money on vanilla extract at the store, make your own by saving the split vanilla pods and using them to make vanilla extract at home. This is a time based process, so if you know you are going to need vanilla extract for baking you make the extract at least one to two months ahead of time. [5] X Research source Place 8 to 12 split vanilla pods lengthwise in a clean, glass container—make sure to use quality vanilla pods, as that will make a difference. Add a pint of high quality non-flavored vodka, rum, or bourbon to the container and seal the container. Let the container sit in a cool, dark place for six months, shaking it every month to move around the flavors in the container. The richness of the extract will depend on how long you let the pods soak in the alcohol. Once you start using the vanilla extract, you can just top it off with more alcohol to keep it full, replacing or adding more when necessary, to create a more intense flavor. Use Grade B vanilla beans to make vanilla extract. You can use Grade A beans as well but they will be more expensive. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Add a vanilla pod to a quart of milk. If you would like to use a vanilla bean in baking recipes that contain milk, you can add the vanilla pod to a quart of milk and heat up the milk in a saucepan over medium high heat. You can also use the vanilla pod in puddings, custards, and other milk based recipes. Another option is to throw the vanilla bean seeds and the split vanilla bean pods into the pot of milk for an extra kick of vanilla. You may want to try the milk after a few minutes of boiling to ensure the vanilla flavor is present in the milk but not overpowering."

The vanilla bean will give off a natural flavor and infuse the sugar so you have vanilla flavored sugar. You can then use the sugar in your morning coffee or in baked goods. [7] X Research source"

You can use vanilla seeds or vanilla pods, laying them in your coffee beans overnight or for several weeks. Over time, the coffee beans will become infused with the vanilla."

To prevent the vanilla bean from becoming brittle, you should wrap the bean in tin foil and seal it in a zip-lock bag. You can then store it in a cool, dark spot in your kitchen. [8] X Research source Do not store vanilla bean in your refrigerator or your freezer, as these spots are too cold for the bean and can in fact dry it out. Instead, look for a spot in a low cupboard to store the bean. Vanilla beans that are stored properly will last for several weeks. [9] X Research source"

If your vanilla bean starts to dry out or appear brittle, you can revive it by immersing it in a pot of boiling water for several minutes.
