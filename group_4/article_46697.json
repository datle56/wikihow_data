      "content": "Pour 1 inch of paint into the well of a paint tray and roll the nap through it. Naps are a paint roller’s cover or sleeve, each one has a different thickness of fabric for various surfaces. Roll the nap 5 or 6 times using the ridges on the paint tray to distribute the paint evenly. [3] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 26 February 2021 You can also use a 5-gallon bucket fashioned with a roller screen. Fill the bucket with 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of paint before rolling the nap. If you’re painting large areas, attach a 48-inch extension pole into the handle of the roller frame. This will save you time from scaling up and down a step ladder."

      "title": "Work in a narrow V-shape at the center of your painting area.",
      "content": "Work in a narrow V-shape at the center of your painting area. Apply very light pressure, allowing the roller and the paint to do most of the work. For the best coverage, work in 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) wide sections or divide other smaller areas into thirds. Then, work within a single section with 1 load of paint before moving on to the next section with a new load of paint. You can also roll using a W or N shape. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Spread the paint by sweeping the roller up and down.",
      "content": "Spread the paint by sweeping the roller up and down. Use continuous motions that move up and down like a vertical zigzag to blend the areas you cut with the paintbrush. Continue this motion until the applied paint is evenly spread using gentle pressure. Forceful motions or too much pressure can put streaks in the paint or create paint buildup on the nap. [5] X Research source If the paint roller begins to stick to the wall and won’t spread the paint, do not add pressure. This means the roller needs to be loaded with more paint."

    {
      "title": "Connect the separate paint sections with overlapping strokes.",
      "content": "Connect the separate paint sections with overlapping strokes. Use the same up-and-down zigzag motions you used to spread the paint. Overlap the previous paint stroke by 30 to 40% for smoother coverage as you fill in the gaps. Continue moving one section at a time until the entire wall is painted. [6] X Research source You do not have to clean or get a fresh roller cover after the wall is finished. If you’re doing a second coat, the paint residue on the roller will help blend the wet paint on the wall without oversaturating it. [7] X Research source Use a horizontal stroke to smooth the paint near the ceiling and floor."

      "title": "Roll the nap through the paint in the tray several more times to load it.",
      "content": "Roll the nap through the paint in the tray several more times to load it. Be sure to touch the paint's surface in the tray rather than fully submerging it. Do short strokes and slowly move the roller around until it's fully covered. [8] X Research source If you wind up with excess paint, roll up the tray, using the ridges to press out any excess."

      "title": "Paint onto wet paint to avoid creating streaks.",
      "content": "Paint onto wet paint to avoid creating streaks. Instead of waiting for paint to dry, keep a “wet edge” by working on top of wet paint to avoid lap marks. When spreading paint, work a short distance from the section you previously worked on. This will also help maximize the paint you use, so you don’t have to continuously apply more paint onto the nap.

      "title": "Apply a second coat of paint once the first coat has dried if needed.",
      "content": "Apply a second coat of paint once the first coat has dried if needed. Examine the painted area during the day and see if the color pigment is even. Most light paint colors will require 2 coats to adequately cover a wall. Some darker paints may require 3 coats. For oil-based paints, you can apply a second coat after it has dried for 24 hours. Latex paint dries quickly, so you should be able to apply a second coat after 4 hours of drying. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Soak the roller in warm water and 1 tablespoon of dish soap. To clean a painter roller, rinse the roller nap with warm water. Put on gloves to wash off excess paint. Allow the nap to sit in the cleaning solution for a few minutes before running it under fresh water again. Pat dry the roller when all the paint is removed. You can also purchase a roller scraper and run it across the nap lengthways. Then, rinse the nap with water. [11] X Expert Source Jeff Baldwin Residential Painter Expert Interview. 26 February 2021 Use a putty knife if you don’t have a roller scraper. If your paint job takes multiple days, leave the roller submerged in the paint, wrap it in cling wrap, or a large zip-lock."
