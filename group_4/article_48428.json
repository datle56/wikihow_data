      "content": "Let her know you care. No matter what you text your sick girlfriend, your basic intent is probably the same: to show you care for her , and to let her know she’s not alone. [1] X Research source A sweet and simple “thinking of you” text is the quickest way to lift her spirits and reassure her you’re there for her. “I miss you.” “Things aren’t the same without you around!” “I love you.”"

      "content": "Check in on her. Asking your girlfriend how she’s feeling will let her know you are interested in her condition. It will help her feel seen and cared for. If possible, be specific: “Is your sore throat giving you trouble again today?” This will show her you’re paying close attention to her progress. “Do you have an appetite today?” “Have you tried your new medicine?” \"How did your appointment go this morning?\""

      "title": "Joking around can bring some much-needed levity.",
      "content": "Joking around can bring some much-needed levity. If your girlfriend’s sickness is not serious, making light of her condition can help her find perspective. Teasing her about getting well soon is also an opportunity to show her you miss her and value the time you spend together—it may even be an opportunity to flirt a little. Keep in mind that while your girlfriend may be receptive to a light tone if she only has a cold, if she is severely ill, levity or flirtation may come across as dismissive of her condition. “It’s so boring without you around!” “Tell your germs to scram so I can kiss you!” \"I'm getting sick too—sick of not having you around!\""

      "content": "Give her suggestions to keep herself entertained. Being sick can be pretty boring, especially if you’re stuck at home alone. Recommend TV shows, movies, video games, or books she might enjoy—better yet, read something together and discuss it over the phone, watch something together remotely, or play virtual games together. “Last time I was sick, I binged this entire series.” “This is the perfect book to read when you need a little escape.” “I’ve been meaning to try this game out—want to play?”"

She’ll want to hear what’s happening with you, your mutual friends, and everything else from her day-to-day life, and she’ll appreciate knowing she is missed. “I tried that new restaurant today for lunch. We should go when you're better!” “We really missed you at Todd’s birthday party.” \"Check out the books I got at the library book sale! I picked out a few for you!\""

She may feel like a burden asking for your help, so avoid telling her to reach out if she needs help: offer to assist her in specific ways, and be casual about it. [10] X Research source “Just wait until you try my homemade soup!” “What are you hungry for? I’ll order delivery.” “I’m running errands nearby: can I pick up your prescriptions for you?” “How about I take your dog on a walk? I need the exercise!”"
