      "content": "Infuse a tincture. Cut a whole fresh or dried ginseng root into smaller pieces. Add the pieces to a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Fill the jar to the top with liquor, such as rum, gin, vodka, or grain alcohol. Leave it in a cool place for 15 to 30 days. When using a tincture, you should only use about 5 to 15 drops at a time.

One cup of alcohol to one root of ginseng will last indefinitely if stored in a cool, dark place. You can use between 90 proof and 190 proof alcohol."
