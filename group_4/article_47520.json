      "content": "Choose elevator shoes or shoe lifts for an invisible boost of height. If you want to look taller without the obvious addition of heels, elevator shoes are the choice for you. They look like regular dress shoes, but contain an extra insert inside, either attached to the shoe or removable, that can add anywhere from 1-6 in (2.5-15.2 cm) of height. [1] X Research source You can buy the inserts, known as shoe lifts, separately. Place them in any dress shoe or lace-up boot for a few extra inches of height. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Go with low-heeled boots for a subtle, trendy look. Another low-key way to boost your height, low-heeled men’s boots are clomping their way back into fashion. You can buy them in leather or suede varieties for a retro or classy feel. [3] X Research source Don't be afraid to take a look at women's boots too! Some of them look more masculine while others look more feminine. If you choose women's boots, be aware that they might be more narrow than you're used to. Consider a pair that's labeled \"wide.\" It'll be more comfortable."

      "content": "Wear low heels or wedges to feel fashionable but comfortable. If the high heeled look is what you’re after, start out with lower or thicker heels. Look for heels that are an inch-high or smaller, with a thick heel or even a platform sole. These platforms are known as wedges, which refers to the solid block, or “wedge,” that runs from heel to toe and supports the foot while adding height. A low-heeled boot can also be a great way to ease into wearing higher heels, for your own physical comfort as well as subtlety. If this is your first time wearing heels, choose lower heels or wedges for your first pair. The next set of heels can be the height you want, such as sky-high stilettos."

      "content": "Go with stilettos if you’re feeling confident and experienced. Stilettos have the classic thin, high, tapered heels. They’re gorgeous, but notoriously difficult to walk in! If you’ve walked in lower heels before and feel up to the challenge, buy a pair and try them out. Don't give up if you can’t manage the height. Keep practicing, and you’ll be rocking them in no time."

      "content": "Figure out your size in women’s shoes. If you think you’d feel a bit uncomfortable having store employees size you up for women’s shoes, or simply want to save time in the store or online, knowing your size in women’s shoe’s can streamline the whole process. [4] X Expert Source Katie Quinn Personal Wardrobe Stylist Expert Interview. 14 April 2020. In the US, women’s shoes are about 1.5-2 sizes smaller than men’s. For example, if you wear a size 10, you’ll wear either an 11.5 or 12 in women’s shoes, including heels."

      "content": "Go to a department store if you have smaller feet. Most department stores don’t carry women’s shoes, including heels, in sizes larger than a US 10. If your feet are smaller than about an 8 in US men’s, browse the shoe department of your local department store. With the large selections of heels at department stores, you’re bound to find something you’ll like. If you feel comfortable, ask a store employee to help size you and recommend shoes. Try them on in the store for size and comfort."

      "content": "Try on your heels in the store if you feel comfortable. It’s OK to feel a little uncomfortable or awkward on your first trip to buy heels. If you’d rather not try your heels on in the store, you can simply estimate your size and ask an employee to bring you a pair without trying them on. You can give them a test run at home and return them later if they don’t fit. Say they’re for a family member or friend if you want to avoid questions. There’s nothing wrong with taking pride in your heels, since you already know you’ll look great in them! On the flip side, there’s also nothing wrong with keeping it to yourself if that makes you more comfortable."

      "content": "Order from an online or specialty store if you have larger feet. If you want a larger selection or more size options, or you simply want to avoid a trip to the store, head to an online vendor. You’ll find options for larger-sized women’s shoes as well as shops that sell heels made specifically for men, wider and longer than the typical women’s heel. Some stores even offer a custom-made service if you know exactly what heel you want but haven’t found it in stores."

      "content": "Test your heels’ stability with the “rocking technique.” In the store or right after you receive your heels at home, stand them on a table with the heels facing you. Give the heels a couple good taps. If they rock side to side, they’re not stable and will be difficult to walk in, so consider returning them for a new pair. [5] X Research source If the second pair rocks as well, there might be something wrong with the design itself. In this case, you might have to choose a different style of shoe."

      "content": "Try on your heels to test the fit. Make sure that your toes aren’t pressed too tightly in the toe box, which could be uncomfortable and cause blisters. The toe area shouldn’t be too loose, either, or you’ll walk right out of the shoe. Closed-heel or closed-toe shoes should have some wiggle room in the heel counter (the back of the shoe where your heel slips in), but not so much that your foot slides out while walking. [6] X Research source For an open-heel or slingback shoe, ensure that your heel touches the back of the shoe without creating a gap or hanging off of it. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Sit down and slip on your heels. Take off your socks and strap your shoes onto your bare feet, or wear nylon stockings or pantyhose to help with a smoother fit. Some shoes will have a small strap with a buckle while others will simply be slip-on, so make sure to look at your shoes carefully before pulling them on."

Set the ball of your foot down first so that it touches the ground just before your heel. Let your hips relax and move naturally.

Keep an eye out for a few common mistakes of walking in heels, such as letting your ankles wobble from side to side or keeping your knees stiff, which will cause you to lean forward and have bad posture. You might also see that you’re leaning back too far as you walk, which means that you’re keeping your thighs too tense. [12] X Research source Remember to stand straight with your shoulders back and stay relaxed through your hips and knees. Alternatively, film yourself walking, then watch the recording.

Walk around in a park where you feel safe and comfortable. Remember to stand up straight with your shoulders back; assuming a strong posture will help you feel confident and poised. Walk with a friend and chat as you go to keep yourself relaxed. They can give you tips, help calm you down if you feel nervous, and catch you if you stumble."

Keep an eye out for any bumps, cracks or grates in the sidewalk. If you’re still feeling shy or nervous, remember that most people won’t even look at you long enough to notice your shoes. Act normally and walk confidently; by now you’ll be a pro at walking in heels! If you get harassed by someone, ignore it and keep walking. If they see that their words don’t stop you from rocking your heels, they’ll probably give up. If they keep pursuing you, duck into a crowded store or turn a corner. If all else fails, call the police. No matter what happens or what anyone says, don’t let bullies or a bad experience ruin your confidence."
