      "content": "Verify that you have sufficient data. In order to get a unique solution for each variable in a linear system using a matrix, you need to have as many equations as the number of variables that you are trying to solve. For example, with variables x, y and z, you would need three equations. If you have four variables, you need four equations. If you have fewer equations than the number of variables, you will be able to learn some limiting information about the variables (such as x = 3y and y = 2z), but you cannot get a precise solution. For this article, we will be working toward getting a unique solution only."

      "title": "Write your equations in standard form.",
      "content": "Write your equations in standard form. Before you can transfer information from the equations into matrix form, first write each equation in standard form. The standard form for a linear equation is Ax+By+Cz=D, where the capital letters are the coefficients (numbers), and the last number - in this example, D - is on the right side of the equals sign. [2] X Research source If you have more variables, you will just continue the line as long as necessary. For example, if you are trying to solve a system with six variables, your standard form would look like Au+Bv+Cw+Dx+Ey+Fz =G. For this article, we will focus on systems with only three variables. Solving a larger system is exactly the same, but just takes more time and more steps. Note that in standard form, the operations between the terms is always addition. If your equation has subtraction instead of addition, you will need to work with this later my making your coefficient negative. If it helps you remember, you can rewrite the equation and make the operation addition and the coefficient negative. For example, you can rewrite the equation 3x-2y+4z=1 as 3x+(-2y)+4z=1."

      "content": "Transfer the numbers from the system of equations into a matrix. A matrix is a group of numbers, arranged in a block-looking format, that we will work with to solve the system. [3] X Research source It actually carries the same data as the equations themselves, but in a simpler format. To create the matrix from your equations in standard form, just copy the coefficients and result of each equation into a single row, and stack those rows one on top of each other. For example, suppose you have a system that consists of the three equations 3x+y-z=9, 2x-2y+z=-3, and x+y+z=7. The top row of your matrix will contain the numbers 3,1,-1,9, since these are the coefficients and solution of the first equation. Note that any variable that has no coefficient showing is assumed to have a coefficient of 1. The second row of the matrix will be 2,-2,1,-3, and the third row will be 1,1,1,7. Be sure to align the x-coefficients in the first column, the y-coefficients in the second, the z-coefficients in the third, and the solution terms in the fourth. When you finish working with the matrix, these columns will be important in writing your solution."

The brackets do not factor into the solution in any way, but they do illustrate that you are working with matrices. A matrix can consist of any number of rows and columns. As we work through this article, we will use brackets around terms in a row to help join them. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use common symbolism. In working with matrices, it is common convention to refer to the rows by the abbreviation R and the columns with the abbreviation C. You can use numbers together with these letters to indicate a specific row or column. For example, to indicate Row 1 of a matrix, you can write R1. Row 2 would be R2. [5] X Research source You can indicate any specific position in a matrix by using a combination of R and C. For example, to pinpoint the term in the second row, third column, you could call it R2C3."

Right now, you have a matrix that looks like this: 3 1 -1 9 2 -2 1 -3 1 1 1 7 You will be working with some basic operations to create the “solution matrix.” The solution matrix will look like this: [6] X Research source 1 0 0 x 0 1 0 y 0 0 1 z Notice that the matrix consists of 1’s in a diagonal line with 0’s in all other spaces, except the fourth column. The numbers in the fourth column will be your solution for the variables x, y and z."

    {
      "title": "Use scalar multiplication.",
      "content": "Use scalar multiplication. The first tool at your disposal for solving a system using a matrix is scalar multiplication. This is simply a term that means you will be multiplying the items in a row of the matrix by a constant number (not a variable). When you use scalar multiplication, you must remember to multiply every term of the entire row by whatever number you select. If you forget and only multiply the first term, you will ruin the entire solution. You are not required, however, to multiply the entire matrix at the same time. You are only working on one row at a time with scalar multiplication. [7] X Research source It is common to use fractions in scalar multiplication, because you often want to create that diagonal row of 1s. Get used to working with fractions. It will also be easier, for most steps in solving the matrix, to be able to write your fractions in improper form, and then convert them back to mixed numbers for the final solution. Therefore, the number 1 2/3 is easier to work with if you write it as 5/3. For example, the first row (R1) of our sample problem begins with the terms [3,1,-1,9]. The solution matrix should contain a 1 in the first position of the first row. In order to “change” our 3 into a 1, we can multiply the entire row by 1/3. Doing this will create the new R1 of [1,1/3,-1/3,3]. Be careful to keep any negative signs where they belong."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use row-addition or row-subtraction.",
      "content": "Use row-addition or row-subtraction. The second tool you can use is to add or subtract any two rows of the matrix. In order to create the 0 terms in your solution matrix, you will need to add or subtract numbers that get you to 0. For example, if R1 of a matrix is [1,4,3,2] and R2 is [1,3,5,8], you can subtract the first row from the second row and create the new row of [0,-1,2,6], because 1-1=0 (first column), 3-4=-1 (second column), 5-3=2 (third column), and 8-2=6 (fourth column). When you perform a row-addition or row-subtraction, rewrite your new result in place of the row you started with. In this case, we would take out row 2 and insert the new row [0,-1,2,6]. [8] X Research source You can use some shorthand and indicate this operation as R2-R1=[0,-1,2,6]. Recognize that adding and subtracting are merely opposite forms of the same operation. You can either think of adding two numbers or subtracting the opposite. For example, if you begin with the simple equation 3-3=0, you could consider this instead as an addition problem of 3+(-3)=0. The result is the same. This seems basic, but it is sometimes easier to think of a problem in one form or the other. Just keep track of your negative signs."

      "title": "Combine row-addition and scalar multiplication in a single step.",
      "content": "Combine row-addition and scalar multiplication in a single step. You cannot expect the terms always to match so you can use simple addition or subtraction to create 0s in your matrix. More often, you will need to add (or subtract) a multiple of another row. To do this, you perform the scalar multiplication first, then add that result to the target row that you are trying to change. [9] X Research source Suppose you have a Row 1 of [1,1,2,6] and a Row 2 of [2,3,1,1]. You want to create a 0 term in the first column of R2. That is, you want to change the 2 into a 0. To do this, you need to subtract a 2. You can get a 2 by first multiplying Row 1 by the scalar multiplication 2, and then subtract the first row from the second row. In shorthand, you can think of this as R2-2*R1. First multiply R1 by 2 to get [2,2,4,12]. Then subtract this from R2 to get [(2-2),(3-2),(1-4),(1-12)]. Simplify this and your new R2 will be [0,1,-3,-11]."

As you work with the matrix, you will be changing a single row at a time, either through scalar multiplication, row-addition or row-subtraction, or a combination step. When you change the one row, make sure to copy the other rows of your matrix in their original form. [10] X Research source A common mistake occurs when conducting a combined multiplication and addition step in one move. Suppose, for example, you need to subtract double R1 from R2. When you multiply R1 by 2 to do this step, remember that you are not changing R1 in the matrix. You are only doing the multiplication to change R2. Copy R1 first in its original form, then make the change to R2."

Copy R2 and R2, unchanged, as R2=[2,-2,1,-3] and R3=[1,1,1,7]. Notice that multiplication and division are merely inverse functions of each other.

You can do this by subtracting twice the value of R1, since R1 begins with a 1. In shorthand, the operation is R2-2*R1. Remember, you are not changing R1, but just working with it. So first, copy R1 as R1=[1,1/3,-1/3,3]. Then, when you double each term of R1, you will get 2*R1=[2,2/3,-2/3,6]. Finally, subtract this result from the original R2 to get your new R2. Working through term by term, this subtraction is (2-2), (-2-2/3), (1-(-2/3)), (-3-6). These simplify to give the new R2=[0,-8/3,5/3,-9]. Notice that first term is 0, which was your objective. Copy down the unaffected row 3 as R3=[1,1,1,7]. Be very careful with subtracting negative numbers, to make sure you keep the signs correct. For now, leave the fractions in their improper forms.

However, if you double all the values of R1 and subtract them, you will affect the 0 in the first column of R3, which you do not want to do. This would be taking a step backward in your solution. So you need to work with some combination of R2. If you subtract 2/3 of R2, you will create a 0 in the second column, without affecting the first column. In shorthand notation, this is R3- 2/3*R2. The individual terms become (0-0), (2/3-2/3), (4/3-(-5/3*2/3)), (4-27/8*2/3). Simplifying gives the result R3=[0,0,42/24,42/24]."
