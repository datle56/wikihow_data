Roleplaying , dirty talk, whatever. While it isn’t a super sexual emoji on its own, it can be used to punctuate a sexy message and add an extra little wackiness to it. For example: “I can’t wait to be all over you tonight 👻” “You must be so cold; you’ve been naked in my daydreams the past week 👻”"

While a 👅 might be a forward, explicit reference to making out or going down on your partner, the 👻 can be used as a more spirited, playful spin on the message. You might say: “I can’t wait to take get down to whatever is under your underwear tonight 👻” “You know what I want to do tonight? Kiss your face 👻”"

      "content": "A 👻 can be used to symbolize Snapchat. Snapchat’s logo is a ghost, so you can use the 👻 to stand in for the social media app. If you’re talking to someone and the convo is hot and heavy, they might be trying to suggest that you two send nudes or suggestive flicks over Snapchat, which is a popular move since the photos disappear after a period of time (although they can still screenshot them, so keep that in mind). [2] X Research source For example, someone might say: “If you’re worried about sending cute selfies, we can always use 👻” “Do you have 👻? We should chat on there 😈 😏”"

When using the 👻 this way, it implies that you aren’t all that torn up about it. The ghost is just too funny looking to suggest that you’re genuinely sad. [3] X Research source You could say: “Remember that goof I was talking to on Tinder? He went straight 👻 on me.” “I really liked Danny at first, but he was kind of boring looking back at it. He 👻 me, so at least I don’t need to worry about him anymore.”"
