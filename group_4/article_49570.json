  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Write the word “MONTAGE” on a single line to note where it begins.",
      "content": "Write the word “MONTAGE” on a single line to note where it begins. Before your montage begins, start a new line with the word “MONTAGE” in all caps. This way, someone skimming through your script will know what to expect in the next few scenes. [1] X Research source You can choose to make the montage heading bold or underlined if you want it to stand out more in your script."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put each new part of your montage as a separate action line.",
      "content": "Put each new part of your montage as a separate action line. Leave a double-space in between your montage heading and the action lines. Write a single line of action about what’s happening in the montage. Continue writing all the scenes, leaving a line break between each event that takes place. [2] X Research source For example, you may write your montage like: Sam mixes the cake ingredients in a bowl. He slides the cake pan into the oven. Sam’s foot taps on the tiles. He looks through the oven window to check his bake. Include a dash in front of each action line if you want to add emphasis for when the scene changes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Type “END OF MONTAGE” when all the scenes are complete.",
      "content": "Type “END OF MONTAGE” when all the scenes are complete. Leave a line break between the last event in your montage and the closing heading. Make sure to type it in all caps and follow the same formatting you used for when you started the montage. This helps readers know when the screenplay returns to normal. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Put “MONTAGE - VARIOUS” on a single line to start.",
      "content": "Put “MONTAGE - VARIOUS” on a single line to start. Make sure you put your heading on a new line so it stands out in your screenplay. Put a dash and the word “VARIOUS” after the first heading so a reader knows that the montage takes place in different locations. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a scene heading for each new location if multiple things happen there.",
      "content": "Make a scene heading for each new location if multiple things happen there. If your scene has people talking or many important events taking place, write each event in the montage as a new scene. Start with INT. or EXT. before writing the location and time of day in the scene heading. Then write the action and dialogue that happens in the scene. Keep writing each scene this way until you’ve written all of the events. [5] X Research source For example, your montage may look like: INT. PET STORE - DAY John sets a huge bag of dog food on the counter. He swipes his credit card. CASHIER The card didn’t work. John sighs and pulls out a few bills. EXT. SIDEWALK - MINUTES LATER John walks to his car with the dog food over his shoulder. It slips out of his grip and breaks on the ground. JOHN Are you kidding me? INT. JOHN’S CAR - MINUTES LATER John angrily drives. Dog food spills out onto the back seat as he makes a turn. Make sure to only use 3-4 scenes in this type of montage since it takes up a lot of room on the page."

      "title": "Use a bulleted list with simple scene descriptions if only simple actions take place.",
      "content": "Use a bulleted list with simple scene descriptions if only simple actions take place. If a single action happens in each location, you can easily use a bulleted list to keep your montage concise on the page. Put a dash before writing a simple scene description, then put another dash before writing your action. Leave a line break between each event. For example, your montage may look like: - Toolshed - Jack and Jill each pick up a pail. - Hill - Jack and Jill stand at the bottom of the hill, looking towards the top. - Well - Jack leans into the well to pull the rope. - Inside the well - A bucket overflows with water as it gets pulled up."

    {
      "title": "Write “END MONTAGE” after you’ve completed all the scenes.",
      "content": "Write “END MONTAGE” after you’ve completed all the scenes. After you’ve written all of the events or scenes, leave a line break between your last event and the “END MONTAGE” heading. This way, a reader will know that scenes will continue as normal. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Create a training montage to show a character getting better at something.",
      "content": "Create a training montage to show a character getting better at something. Many training montages are done in action or sports movies to show the main character improving their skills. At the beginning of the montage, they might get tired or can’t complete a certain exercise, but by the end, their hard work should pay off so they can succeed. [7] X Research source Examples of good training montages can be found in the screenplays for Rocky and Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back . You may also use a training montage that isn’t action-oriented, such as learning to bake or sew."

    {
      "title": "Write scenes of a relationship to show people falling in love.",
      "content": "Write scenes of a relationship to show people falling in love. Use scenes in your montage to show various dates from the start of a relationship up to the present time. The two people may not like each other’s company at first, but short scenes in your montage can show how they grow to appreciate and like one another. Use your montage to show cute things happening between both of them. [8] X Research source For example, in the film Annie Hall , there’s a montage of a couple going on a road trip. Over the course of the montage, the viewer catches glimpses of their relationship developing."

    {
      "title": "Use montages to compare and contrast different characters.",
      "content": "Use montages to compare and contrast different characters. Characters can react to the same circumstances in different ways. Use your montage to show how each character handles their routine, such as getting ready in the morning or getting to work. Make sure the images in each character’s lives are similar to the other’s but have them approach it in a different style. [9] X Research source An example of a compare and contrast montage can be found in The Nightmare Before Christmas to show how Halloweentown and Christmastown both prepare for Christmas differently."

      "title": "Show small details to help elicit a specific emotion.",
      "content": "Show small details to help elicit a specific emotion. Sometimes, montages simply portray emotion without moving the story forward. Think about images that you’d associate with a certain feeling, and use those clips together to create an emotion. [10] X Research source For example, if you want to convey a feeling of loneliness or depression, you may include shots in your montage of a sink filled with dishes, a torn photograph, or someone asleep in bed during the day."
