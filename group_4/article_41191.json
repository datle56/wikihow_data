      "content": "Think about how your emotional health relates to internet usage. Studies have shown that people with internet addictions often suffer from loneliness, anxiety, and depression. If you think you have an internet addiction, you won’t be able to get past it unless you make an honest effort to understand how the addictive behavior is tied to your emotional state. Symptoms of internet addiction may include: A preoccupation with the internet, even when you're not online. A sudden and drastic increase in your internet usage. Difficulty cutting back or stopping internet usage. Irritation, aggression, or restlessness caused by efforts to cut back on internet use. Unstable moods when not online, or internet use as a way to cope with stress. Internet use interfering with job duties or academic work. Difficulty maintaining healthy relationships when not online. Friends and family expressing concern for the amount of time you spend online."

Do you feel depressed, isolated, and anxious when you’re not on the internet?"

      "content": "Find a support group. Therapists and rehab centers can be incredibly expensive, and you might not be able to afford one. However, depending on what town you live in, you may be able to find a support group you can join for free. See if your town has a meeting of Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous (ITAA). [7] X Research source For many people, other mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or stress can lead to or exacerbate internet addiction.

      "content": "Use a news aggregator. News aggregators like Feedly and Digg Reader allow you to look at all of your favorite websites in one place, instead of clicking around through various windows. When you have multiple windows open, your attention gets scattered, and you get pulled into the immersive experience you’re having with your screen. Keep your screen simple and clean as a way to keep yourself focused and aware of what you’re doing and how you’re spending your time. Add only those websites to your aggregator that you absolutely need to keep tabs on. Don’t fill your mind with unnecessary information. Only have one program open unless you actually need to use multiple programs. Only have one tab open on your web browser at a time."

      "content": "Delete useless accounts. You may have accounts with websites that you never use, but which email you endlessly trying to remind you to use their service. You don’t need that temptation, so just delete all the accounts you don’t use and unsubscribe from their email listservs. You should also take a look at the accounts that you use too much. Are you spending valuable work time on Facebook or Instagram? Even if you love them and use them often, it may be in your best interest to delete those accounts, or at least deactivate them for a time until you get your internet usage under control. You may need some of these sites for work — for example, Myspace if you’re a musician — so don’t delete an account that you actually need. You might get a co-worker or friend to maintain that account until you can handle the responsibility."

[8] X Research source If your smartphone notifies you immediately every time someone emails you or likes something you've posted on social media, you’ll be forever fiddling around on the internet with your phone.

      "content": "Make a plan. Quitting any addiction cold-turkey has a low rate of success. Relapse rates are high for addicts with chemical addictions like nicotine or alcohol, as well as those with behavioral or procedural addictions like gambling, shopping, or internet addictions. [9] X Research source Instead of trying to quit cold turkey, make a plan to scale back your internet usage in a manageable way, so you don’t feel overwhelmed by the sudden loss of an important part of your life. Set manageable goals. If scaling back to one hour a day is your ultimate goal, maybe start with three hours a day. When you feel comfortable with one step down, reduce your daily allotment by half an hour. Keep scaling back your internet usage until you reach your goal."

      "content": "Set a timer. After you've made your plan, you need to stick to it, and you can’t do that unless you’re keeping careful track of how much time you’re spending on the internet. If you’re allowing yourself three hours a day at first, you might break that up into three sessions that are one hour each. If that’s the case, make sure to set a timer to let yourself know when your hour is up each time you sit down at your computer. Egg timers can be purchased very inexpensively at any grocery store in the kitchen tools sections. Most phones have a timer app on them."

If that’s the case, there are programs you can install that will limit your internet time for you. The program called Freedom will block you from the entire internet for up to eight hours at a time, whereas Anti-Social will block only social media sites like Facebook.
