With Virgo’s perfectionist ways and Libra’s ability to see all sides of a situation, they’re never caught off guard in their career or personal life. If you’ve got a problem, a Virgo Libra cusp has the solution. They’ve already thought through every detail that can go wrong and how to handle it. [3] X Research source This cusp’s analytical mind also makes them a great judge of character. While they’re not super confrontational, they’re always the first to warn their friends when someone doesn’t have their best interests at heart. This cusp’s good eye likely stems from the combination of earth and air elements. Virgo is an earth sign, who is practical and knows that hard work gets things done. As an air sign, Libra uses their intelligence to focus in on what’s important."

      "title": "High expectations",
      "content": "High expectations With their perfectionist ways, a Virgo Libra cusp can expect everyone to be as detail-oriented and hard-working as themselves. While that often means they help their friends and partner reach their dreams, they can also ask too much of them. They might accuse a partner of not straightening up when only a knick-knack is slightly out of place, or grow irritable when a friend shows up a few minutes late to lunch. Virgo’s restless, mutable nature often intensifies Libra’s take-charge attitude. As a cardinal sign, Libra jumps into action to get things done. Combined with Virgo’s need for change, they expect other’s to make as much effort as them. If you find yourself thinking that others aren’t measuring up to your standards, be more understanding of what they have going on. Don’t lower your standards, but recognize that not even you can always give 100%. Know when someone is trying their best and cut them a little slack."

If you feel yourself being swept up in superficial things, ground yourself by keeping in touch with your friends. They certainly admire your taste, but their love for you reaches beyond your exterior, which they’ll be sure to tell you!"

      "content": "Overthinker Because they’re so detail-oriented, little things often get in a Virgo Libra cusp’s way. Small flaws or kinks in their plan can unravel everything, and they won’t rest until the teeniest detail is ironed out and fixed. It might seem contradictory, but this can often make a Virgo Libra cusp pretty indecisive, too. When they’ve thought of everything, they often don’t know what decision to make. [4] X Research source When at school, your job, or planning a get together with friends, take time to relax and breathe. Remember that things can and will go wrong, but you’ve done everything you can to prepare for them. Plus, you’ve got the communication and analytical skills to make the best of any situation!"
