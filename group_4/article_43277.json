      "title": "Think about what happened.",
      "content": "Think about what happened. There are several things to consider when you're trying to figure out if your parents are abusive. The biggest factors are generally why your parent struck you and how much force they used. Was your parent trying to teach you not to do something dangerous, like running into the street without looking? This type of punishment is sometimes acceptable, as long as it does not get extreme or excessive. Hitting you to take out frustrations is considered abuse, and so is hitting you too hard and with great force. Were you hit because your parents thought this would stop a behavior they don't like? Do your parents ever hit you after they've been drinking alcohol or after hearing bad news? Have your parents ever used an object to hit you, like a belt, tree branch, coat hanger, electrical cord, etc? Do your parents ever lose control while they hit you? For example, does a simple spanking turn into slapping you in the face or punching you? Do they ever pin you down and hold you there?"

      "content": "Look for signs of physical injury. The laws on child abuse are very different, depending on where you live. In general, though, one of the biggest factors is often whether or not your parents' acts of violence caused any lasting physical damage to your body. Your parents may be abusing you if you have any of the following after your parents \"discipline\" you: Cuts or scratches Bruises Bite marks Burns Welts (swollen lumps and bumps on your body) Muscle sprains Broken/fractured bones"

      "content": "Think about whether your parents take care of you. Neglect is a form of child abuse. It can be very hard to tell whether your parents are neglecting you, especially if you've never lived with any other parents or caretakers. There is also the question of how much money your family has â€” your parents may be struggling to keep you clothed and fed, not because they are neglecting you, but because they have economic challenges. Ask yourself the following questions to start to figure out if your parents are neglecting you and your siblings: [3] X Research source Are your parents always well-dressed and well-fed, but unwilling to get you clothes that fit properly or to make sure you have food? Do your clothes and shoes fit you okay? Are they clean and warm or cool enough for the weather? Do your parents keep you clean by having you take regular baths/showers? Do they make sure you brush your teeth and comb your hair? Do your parents keep you and your siblings fed? Or do you often go without eating enough food? When you get sick, do your parents take you to a doctor and give you medicine? Are disabled children (you or a sibling) having their needs met? Are basic needs like food or water dependent on meeting a certain standard? If your parents leave the house, and no siblings are old enough to babysit, do they have someone older come and watch you? Or are you left alone and allowed to play in unsafe places/situations? How long are children left alone?"

When this happens, it is usually because the first child is reenacting abuse that was forced on them. Most children do not have an understanding of sex, so generally, if another child forces you or a sibling to engage in some type of sexual behavior, it's usually a sign that the child was abused by someone.

Your parent might yell at you to stop you from doing something dangerous or bad, but this one-time incident doesn't necessarily mean you are being verbally abused. But if you experience repeated name-calling, shaming, or threats, then this is considered verbal abuse or verbal assault. Your parents yelling at you or scolding you does not count as verbal assault. That type of discipline is usually appropriate and has a purpose, as long as it doesn't get out of hand. If your parents are constantly screaming or saying mean things to you, even when you haven't done anything wrong, they are emotionally abusing you. If your parents talk down to you, shame you, or make fun of you on a regular basis, they are emotionally abusing you. If your parents are ignorant of your self-identity (LGBT) or talk down on you for it, that can be considered emotional abuse. Any verbal threats made towards you, your siblings, or other family members are also acts of abuse."

Tell the adult exactly what happened, and explain any circumstances surrounding the incident. Did anything lead up to it? The adult you talk to should be able to figure out whether your parents are abusing you. If the adult thinks that your parents are abusing you, she should then contact the police. If the adult tells you it's abuse but doesn't call the authorities, you should do so yourself. A school counselor should know who to contact and how to make sure you are safe.
