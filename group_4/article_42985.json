      "content": "Hands and numbers An analog clock is circular with two or three hands and the numbers 1 through 12 around the edge. When first learning how to read a clock, it’s best to have one to reference. Here are things you’ll notice on the clock: [1] X Research source One hand that’s very thin and moves very fast. This is called the second hand . Every time it moves, a second has gone by. One long hand. This is called the minute hand . Every time it moves one tick, a minute has gone by. One very thick hand that’s shorter than the minute hand. This is called the hour hand . Every time it moves one tick, an hour has gone by. The numbers 1-12 are laid out in ascending order around the clock, meaning they get bigger in numerical value as they move around the circle. Each number represents an hour of the day.

      "content": "Time measurements and tick marks Seconds, minutes, and hours are all measures of time represented on the clock face. When reading an analog clock, here’s what you need to know: [3] X Research source Every 60 seconds counts as 1 minute. Sixty seconds, or 1 minute, is the time it takes the second hand to move from the number 12 all the way back to 12 again. Every time the second hand shifts, 1 second has gone by. Every 60 minutes counts as 1 hour. Sixty minutes, or 1 hour, is the time it takes the minute hand to move from the number 12 all the way back again to 12. The clock face is divided into 60 small tick marks representing 60 minutes. Every time the minute hand shifts, 1 minute has gone by. Every 24 hours counts as 1 day. Twenty-four hours, or 1 day, is the time it takes the hour hand to move from the number 12 all the way back again and then around one more time. Each number on the clock represents an hour, so 2 times around the clock makes 24 hours. Every time the hour hand shifts, 1 hour has gone by."

When reading this hand, always look at the large numbers on the clock. [5] X Research source When the hour hand is pointed between 2 numbers, the hour of the day is always the lower number. [6] X Research source So, if the hour hand is pointed between 5 and 6 on the clock, it's 5-something because 5 is the lower number."

These represent minutes, and where the minute hand is pointed tells us this. You can tell how many minutes there are by counting each little tick as one minute, starting from the number 12. [7] X Research source If the minute hand is between numbers, find the nearest number the hand has passed, multiply that number by 5 (because there are 5 ticks separating the numbers), and then add the number of ticks in between. [8] X Research source For example, if the minute hand is pointed right between the 2 and the 3, multiply 2 by 5, which gives us 10. Then, count out the number of ticks it takes to get from 2 to where the hand is pointing and add this number to 10."

      "content": "Watch the second hand to see how many seconds have gone by during the minute. Some analog clocks have a third hand that’s thinner than the rest. This is the second hand and determines the number of seconds within the minute. The second hand is constantly moving, and for every full rotation it takes around the clock, the minute hand moves one tick. Let’s say the second hand moves from the 12 to the 6. That means 30 seconds have gone by. If the second hand moves one rotation around the clock, 60 seconds or 1 minute has gone by."

      "title": "Count in multiples of 5 as a shortcut to find minutes.",
      "content": "Count in multiples of 5 as a shortcut to find minutes. When the minute hand is pointing at a big number on the clock, use multiples of 5 to tell how many minutes there are, as there are 5 ticks or lines between each number. For example, if the minute hand points directly at 3, multiply 3 by 5 to get 15. \"15\" is how many minutes have passed in the current hour. Still confused? Think of the clock like a pie and separate it into quarters. If the minute hand is on 6, half of an hour has gone by, meaning 30 minutes. If the minute hand is on 3, a quarter of the hour has gone by, meaning 15 minutes."

For instance, if the small, thick hand is pointed directly at the number 9, it's 9 o'clock or 9:00. [9] X Research source Pro tip: Watch as the hour hand moves slowly closer to a big number. The minute hand gets closer to the number 12. When the minute hand hits 12, the next hour starts."

This is because the hour changed, so the minute hand is starting over again.

Because the hour hand is between 11 and 12, we pick the lower number. This means it's 11-something o'clock. Next, we tell the minutes. The minute hand is past the 3, so multiply 3 by 5 to get 15. Then, count that the minute hand is 4 ticks from the 3, so add 4 to 15, which gives you 19. There are 19 minutes in the hour, and the hour is 11. That means the time is 11:19."

The small hand tells the hour, while the big hand tells the minutes. [14] X Research source Digital clocks are faster to read because they display the time numerically.

When reading a clock, there are a few words and phrases you should know: [15] X Research source “A quarter to”: This means the number of minutes is 45 and there are 15 minutes till the next hour. For example, if it’s 2:45, you could say it’s “a quarter to 3.” “A quarter past”: This means the number of minutes is 15 and there are 45 minutes till the next hour. For instance, if it’s 12:15, you might say it’s “a quarter past 12.” “Half past”: This means the number of minutes is 30 and there are 30 minutes left in the hour. For example, if it’s 1:30, you can say it’s “half past 1.”"

      "content": "How do you know if it’s AM or PM? If noon (or lunchtime) has not come yet, the time is AM. If it’s after noon (or after 12:00 PM), the time is PM. In other words, the first half of the day is AM, and the second half is PM. [16] X Research source This is usually easier to determine on digital clocks, as most display a PM or AM in the upper or lower right-hand corner. AM stands for “ante meridiem,” which is Latin for midday. PM stands for “post meridiem,” which means after midday."

This time system is used in the military and other operations that function around the clock. [17] X Research source After noon, military time continues chronologically. For instance, 1 PM is 1300 hours, 2 PM is 1400 hours, and 3 PM is 1500 hours. 12 AM or midnight is 0000 or zero hundred hours."
