In these situations, teaching sex education to children can be difficult for many reasons. For example, sex education might not be welcomed and you may run into roadblocks before you are allowed to teach it. Before teaching sex education, you may have to: Speak to local officials about implementing sex education in your area. This might mean speaking to schools, your community, or members of your government. Prepare resources and evidence that sex education is needed. Join an organization or group that advocates for the implementation of sex education for the community. Plan your own sex education curriculum. You may be able to teach sex education but there are little resources available to you that provide tested and reputable sex education programs that can be taught in your area. In these cases, you may need to do extensive research, talk to sexual health professionals, and collaborate with institutions to come up with an effective sex education program."

In North America, most curriculums advocate the need for comprehensive sexual health education, where multiple topics are discussed and taught extensively. Issues taught include contraception, gender, sexuality, abstinence, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, and much more. Comprehensive sex education is correlated with lower rates of teen pregnancies, and slightly lower rates of teens reporting having vaginal sex. [5] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Some other approaches include: [6] X Research source Family life education: This program places emphasis on preparing children for family life and reproduction. Population education: This program focuses on the sociological, environmental and economic consequences of population growth. Medical/disease education: This program emphasizes on avoiding disease and provides medical information about sexual health. Fear-based approach: This program emphasizes the risks of sexually transmitted infections, diseases, and HIV. Abstinence-based education: This programs focuses on abstinence from sex a way to avoid pregnancy and does not provide much coverage on how to use contraceptives, how to have safe sex, and how STIs/HIV work. Research shows that it is not effective at preventing sex or teen pregnancies, [7] X Trustworthy Source PLOS ONE Online peer-reviewed, open access scientific research journal Go to source and areas with abstinence-based education have higher teen birth rates.

These programs have been tested for effectiveness and will provide helpful advice, approaches, and strategies to aid you in teaching sex education. Reach out to other educators who have already implemented or taught sex education. Ask them what was effective, what didn't work, and how they approached sex education with their learners.

You can go online, to your local library, or bookstore to find information about sex, sexual health, and sexuality. There are also many organizations that provide courses and materials to help educators teach sex education. Sex education is more than just teaching about sexual behaviours. [9] X Research source This means you should also educate yourself on issues such as abstinence, body image, gender, sexuality, sexual development, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual health, and sexual pleasure. Use established, evaluated sex education sources and curriculums to aid in your research. There are many myths and misconceptions that surround sex education and sex in general. Knowing what the truth is and having accurate information about sex education can help you teach better and prevent you from relaying inaccurate or negative information to your learners. Educating yourself about sex can help increase your comfort level with talking about sex or certain topics related to it to others. People think sex and relationships are something they should be able to manage on their own. They should have all the knowledge and information about it. But in reality, they do not have any information or training in this matter or have no sex education. Few people may have a little reproduction education which is quite straightforward. But most people do not know the art of maintaining a quality love life with their beloved for years. Another thing in our society is that people do not get any positive training and education about sexuality. Instead, there is a lot of negative stuff.

There are many organizations within the LGBTQ+ community that can provide you with materials, resources, and even curriculums for you to follow. Advocate for safer policies regarding issues like homophobia or transphobia. Trans and LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to be harassed and abused verbally, physically and sexually. By educating or approaching the community with these issues, you help save lives of LGTBQ+ individuals and foster a more accepting environment. Partner with professionals that specialize in certain topics to ensure your curriculum covers everything accurately and effectively. For example, you may ask invite a member of the LGBTQ+ community to lead a lesson and talk about their experiences and share their knowledge about sexual health and well-being to your learners.

Young children may also start to hug, kiss, and touch each other. At this point, it is important to talk to children about the basic rules of privacy, such as: Your body is your own. Children should learn that their body belongs to them and no one can touch it without their permission. They should be taught how to say \"no\" to kissing, hugging, and other types of physical contact they don't want, whether it is appropriate or not. Good touch versus bad touch. Children should be taught how to recognize appropriate and inappropriate touching. A good way to teach this is to use The Underwear Rule. This means touching anywhere that is covered by underwear is inappropriate. They should also be taught to consult with a trusted adult or family member when bad touches happen. Good secrets and bad secrets.

Some examples of cooperative learning strategies include: Inquiry-based learning: This approach places students' questions, ideas, and observations in the centre of their learning experience. You will act as a \"provocateur\" or someone that introduces students to ideas or topics that is of interest to them or what matters to them. Students are guided to investigate and look for answers using critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and evidence-based reasoning. Problem-based learning: This approach begins by presenting a problem to students before they receive any knowledge about a topic. This method gives you more control of what topics or problems to focus on. After students are informed of the problem, they are encouraged to seek knowledge and solutions cooperatively together. For example, you could make up a hypothetical problem like \"Sally doesn't want to have sex with her boyfriend. How can she tell her boyfriend this?\" and then ask students to come up with a solution. Project-based learning: This approach has students working on a long term project that addresses and investigates complex questions, problems, or challenges in sex education. A popular project-based learning approach used in sex education is to simulate what having a baby is like. Students bring home a lifelike baby doll that cries, eats, poops, and pees, and are asked to care for it for an extended period of time. The project helps students realize that caring for a child can be difficult and teaches them responsibility.

      "content": "Validate students' concerns. Even if you don't answer a question or come across an opinion or question you can't respond to, you can validate the student's comment. Some helpful ways to respond to students' comments is to: Give affirmation: \"Thanks for asking\", \"That is a great question!\", or \"Please tell me more about what you'd like to know.\" Ask for clarification positively: \"Sounds like you have a real concern. Can you please tell me more about what's on your mind?\" or \"That sounds like an important question. Could you explain it to me a bit more?\" Address feelings: Some questions may be loaded with feelings such as embarrassment or disgust. Try prefacing your answer by saying, \"We are all embarrassed sometimes, but it's important to discuss it\". Normalize the question: \"Many people ask that question!\" or \"That's something a lot of people have wondered about\" but never use the word \"normal\". Normal is not a proper term to use as it has a heavy social meaning to it rather than a medical meaning. In one setting or culture, something \"normal\" might be \"abnormal\" in another."

At the same time, validate their questions or concerns to let them know you understand them and will be working hard to answer their question eventually. If a question makes you uncomfortable, let your students know. You might not be able to control your reaction or feelings toward a question and letting your students know how you feel about a question can help clarify why you can't answer a question. Try saying, \"I'm a bit uncomfortable with this question\" and follow up with validation."

      "content": "Determine if you will be answering questions about personal behaviour. Students might ask questions about their own personal behaviours that you may or may not want to discuss with the class. You might be asked questions like, \"Is it normal to...?\" or \"Did you... when you were growing up?\" These questions might be religious or culturally loaded and may question morals rather than the facts you are teaching. Deal with these questions by: Reinforcing the ground rules. If you choose not to answer personal behaviour questions, tell students, \"We won't be discussing personal behaviour questions during this class.\" Referring students to other resources. Other sexual health care professionals, parents, guardians, or religious organizations may be better equipped at answering questions about morals surrounding sexual health. Speak to them privately about their concern. A question about a personal behaviour might be better understood in context. You might find out a student's family is religious after they ask you if abortions are okay. You might then refer them to the appropriate person to speak to about such an issue."

      "content": "Diffuse questions asked to \"shock\" others. Some students may ask questions to shock others into a reaction. They might have a real concern but are too embarrassed to address it seriously, or they feel the need to divert attention away from the topic being discussed. Never assume these questions are silly or tell students that their question is silly. Instead, remind students of your ground rules and try to guide this question into a teachable topic. Reword any slang vocabulary to diffuse the question. A student might ask, \"Why do balls hurt when they're hit?\" You could respond by saying, \"First, the proper term for balls is testicles. Testicles are very sensitive and do hurt when they're hit\" and proceed to answer their question. Students may also criticize certain topics and say statements like, \"Guys only want sex from girls!\" You can respond by addressing the underlying concern in a question or statement. In this example, you can respond by saying, \"It seems like you are concerned about respect in relationships.\""

These policies might come from the community or they could come from larger bodies of governance. In some cases, a conservative community will have certain views on how sex should be talked about and taught. However, that does not necessarily mean that is how sex education should be taught. And instead, the education system may have differing views and policies on how to teach certain sexual health topics. Discuss with community leaders, educators, and organizations on what sex education looks like in a conservative community. They may have advice or provide you with guidelines on how to communicate with learners and their families, and even how to manage controversy and criticism about sex education. Remember, the goal of sex education is promote sexual health to learners. Do what is best for your learners, but practice judgement."

      "content": "Prepare to respond to people who oppose sex education. People who oppose to sex education are not limited to conservative communities. The first thing to do if you come across someone who opposes sex education is to listen to their point of view and their reasoning. Do not belittle them or antagonize them by telling them they are misinformed or lack knowledge. Instead, respond to their concerns calmly and be as helpful as you can. There are many reasons why someone might oppose to sex education: They lack knowledge about your program, and don't know how you will implement sex education . Give them information about your program, the lessons you will be teaching, and your goals while teaching. If a whole community is opposed to sex education because of this reason, bring written material about your program to community meetings, to community members, and discuss your program with them. They fear they sex education will distress or corrupt young people. Let them know that sex education advocates for responsible sexual health and does not always primarily focus on sexual activities or behaviours. They believe talking about sex leads to sexual activity. There are many reputable and authoritative studies that show sex education does not increase sexual experimentation. Instead, sex education only changes the way sex is performed, usually meaning people who have had sex education are more likely to use contraceptives and get tested for STIs. Explain that your intent is to lower the rates of teen pregnancy, and that you'll be using research-approved methods to do this. Sex education opposes their moral, religious, or cultural beliefs. Let them know that it is perfectly okay to opt out of sex education. Or let them know when certain topics will be discussed and allow the option to opt out of classes that go against a certain belief."
