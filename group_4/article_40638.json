      "title": "Determine your niche and create a mission statement.",
      "content": "Determine your niche and create a mission statement. Reflect on your reasons for starting the college. What is missing from the current educational institutions in your area (or even worldwide) that you feel you can add or improve upon? What do you have to offer in your educational philosophy, curricular focus and teaching methodologies? Examine existing colleges which are like the one you'd like to start. What do they offer now that you also want to offer? In what ways would you tailor your offerings to outsell those of existing colleges? Fee-paying students and their sponsors will be wanting to understand fully what sets your curriculum apart from others. Be careful if you're seeking to undercut other colleges. This may seem like a reasonable idea until you realize just how expensive it can be to provide education. Unless you're flush with funds, steer clear of stating this as a prime reason for starting a college."

      "content": "Set out solid reasons for your college. Your mission statement should include your reasons for starting the college, the educational approach and curriculum and your goals. [1] X Research source Pass your mission statement reasons around friends and family to gauge their thoughts and ideas. Ask them if you have made your mission clear enough for them. Ask them to tell you if it stands out as a college they'd like to go to, or send their children to. Use their feedback to ensure both clarity of mission and to put together your own verbal pitch to explain the college to people you want to get advice from and to promote the college to potential funders."

      "title": "Decide whether your college will have real premises or will be virtual only.",
      "content": "Decide whether your college will have real premises or will be virtual only. You can offer virtual courses from real premises as well if you wish to combine both options. Bear in mind the following: Real premises can be expensive to operate, especially when you're starting up. The premises need to be able to fit the amount of students you think will attend courses, and all safety, health, insurance and other regulatory issues must be fully covered off. The location is also important––students prefer safe areas that they can walk and cycle to and from, which can often mean finding a location in a more expensive area. Do lots of research before deciding on a suitable location. Virtual courses only is a good option when you're just starting up because the overheads are lower. That said, you will need good technical expertise (or a good IT team), excellent security and privacy protocols, plenty of server space and contacts for the students 24/7 to resolve access and similar problems. Design of courses will require knowledge of what works and what doesn't work and you won't have much leeway for error in an age where people expect technology to work properly and seamlessly from the outset.

If you will be setting up a non-profit college, look for foundations or individuals that would be interested in donating to support a college. Make presentations to encourage community support. Research grant options for starting your college. These will vary depending on your region and jurisdiction, so do a wide search to try to capture as many options as possible. Naturally, look for people who are likely to find your educational philosophy aligning with their own thinking about the purpose of education. [3] X Research source Check with local and state governmental representatives to see if there is an interest in supporting a new college due to economic and cultural benefits to the region. Look into options such as grants and loans if you will be operating as a for-profit institution."

      "content": "Develop your infrastructure. Designing your policies and procedures will be guided, in large part, by the regulations of your state and the department that oversees the formation of colleges and institutions of higher learning. This is why the earlier research step was so important. Your infrastructure includes operational, educational, curricular, business, legal, hiring, training, admissions and enrollment procedures. Determine your location. Will your college be virtual, have a physical location or both? Decide on the degrees and classes that will be offered. Some of this will have been determined by your state requirements. Develop a curriculum for your college based on the requirements of your state for granting degrees. Begin networking with and interviewing potential faculty and hiring key staff members. You will be able to hire faculty based on your enrollment, but you will need to have a pool of qualified teachers to draw from."

Accreditation is an essential step for colleges because it will set your institution apart from the so-called \"diploma mills\" that do not have appropriate educational programs in place and do not meet educational requirements for issuing diplomas or degrees. [7] X Research source You can apply for accreditation once you have students and have begun teaching your courses. Accreditation is a process in which your institution is reviewed by a peer review group to determine the quality of the program you offer. The U.S. Department of Education has a list of regionally and nationally recognized accrediting agencies for higher education online."
