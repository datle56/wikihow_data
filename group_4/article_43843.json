      "title": "Grip the ball like a claw.",
      "content": "Grip the ball like a claw. Your three middle fingers should be spread out over the top of the ball. Dig your thumb into the bottom left-hand side and grip your pinky on the right side. Hold as tightly as you possibly can. [1] X Research source If the ball has seams, position it so that you can use the seams to get a better grip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cradle the ball between your hand and wrist.",
      "content": "Cradle the ball between your hand and wrist. Spread all five fingers out over the top of the ball. Bend your wrist so that the ball is firmly wedged between your wrist and hand. This method works great if you have smaller hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grip the ball between three fingers.",
      "content": "Grip the ball between three fingers. Extend your pointer and middle fingers over the top of the ball and dig your thumb into the left side. Bend your ring and pinky fingers at the knuckle to support your grip on the ball. Hold the ball very firmly. [2] X Research source If using this method, you will hold your wrist at an angle while throwing the ball. Try all three gripping techniques several times to figure out which one is most comfortable for you."

    {
      "title": "Position your arm at a ninety-degree angle.",
      "content": "Position your arm at a ninety-degree angle. Raise your arm up high in this position—your elbow should always be above your shoulder to get the most power from your throw. A common mistake is to launch the ball forward like a shot put. Doing this prevents you from putting your whole body into the throw which makes it less forceful."
    },
    {
      "title": "Step or run into the throw.",
      "content": "Step or run into the throw. To maximize your power, you should always try to throw from a moving position, running if possible. If you are under pressure and can’t run before throwing, at least take a step forward to gain some speed. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Generate power with your entire body.",
      "content": "Generate power with your entire body. Don’t just swing your arm, use all of your strength to generate momentum. If you use your shoulder, leg, hips, and wrists, your throw will go further and land harder. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Position yourself as close to your target as possible.",
      "content": "Position yourself as close to your target as possible. If you are playing in a court, get right up to the line to make your throw. This will prevent the ball from slowing down and better allowing your opponent to catch it. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your opposite foot forward.",
      "content": "Place your opposite foot forward. Make sure the arm and leg that you are throwing with are in the back, and that your other side is positioned facing forward. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for your opponents' knees or below.",
      "content": "Aim for your opponents' knees or below. You want to make it difficult for your opponent to catch the ball, so don’t aim at their midsection near their hands. You also don’t want to aim so low, however, that you hit the ground. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Extend your arm fully.",
      "content": "Extend your arm fully. For your throw to be powerful and accurate, you must make sure the ball is released only when your arm is extended as far as possible. [8] X Research source This is called “following through” with your throw. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Release the ball.",
      "content": "Release the ball. If you have begun with your arm at a ninety-degree angle above your shoulder, fully extended your arm, and used your entire body with force while aiming at a target below the knees, you should be able to forcefully hit your opponent!"
