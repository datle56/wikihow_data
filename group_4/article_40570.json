Think of your favorite applications and websites, and research the programming languages their developers used to create them. Different languages are used to create different types of programs, so choose a language that is relevant to what you want to do. [1] X Research source Computer programming is a set of written instructions that the computer follows. These instructions can be written in several different \"languages\", or which are simply different ways of organizing the instructions and text. If you decide that a language does not suit your needs, you can always move on to a new language. [2] X Expert Source Stephen Cognetta, MBA Tech Interviewing Coach Expert Interview. 21 July 2020."

C and C++ are difficult languages to learn for a beginner, but not impossible. Learning them will give you an in-depth understanding of not only programming, but also of how a computer works. Starting with a C-based language will also be helpful as you start learning other languages, as most programming languages inherit concepts from C and C++. [3] X Research source"

These languages are very much in demand right now, so they are handy to know. Keep in mind that Java and JavaScript are completely different languages, despite the similarity in names.

If you want to work as a programmer, you will need to know more than one, so learn as many as you can. Your best bet will be to look at ads for the sort of jobs you want to get and look for the common languages that they ask for."

While most companies hiring a programmer will care more about your skills than the college you went to or your grades, it greatly helps to have a college degree in a field like Computer Science to point to. You will learn more efficiently than if you teach yourself, all while getting expert guidance from your teachers (and maybe your friends).

Whether you do an online degree with fees and an actual degree or certificate at the end like MIT's wonderful Coursera, or an online coding school or bootcamp like Code Academy, Fullstack Academy, or Flatiron School, you can learn a lot about programming from these structured courses."

At a coding bootcamp, you'll be expected to devote all of your time and energy to learning how to code for the duration of the program. The programs are pretty short (typically anywhere from 12 to 25 weeks long). Many coding bootcamps offer career assistance, which can be helpful if you want to dive into your career as a developer right away. If you're looking for a free and far more casual bootcamp experience, check out Free Code Camp."

Look up tutorials on the language you want to learn to find these. Many free online classes are available to learn to code from. The Khan Academy teaches computer coding, with easy tutorials and videos. Codecademy is another free site to learn from, with step-by-step tutorials. Sites like Learn Python , Ruby in Twenty Minutes , and Learn Java Online are great language-specific tutorials to help you on your journal."

It's a constant learning process, and you should always be learning new languages, new paradigms, and most importantly: programming new things! Being a successful programmer means learning to think like one. You'll need to look at challenges as learning opportunities, desire to improve your skills and be open to new ways of improving your programming process."
