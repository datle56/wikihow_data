      "content": "Unplug the oven for 5 minutes, plug it back in, and press “Clear/Off”. This can sometimes prompt the oven’s computer to reset and release the lock button. It’s fairly common for the lock function to get stuck if the self-cleaning cycle was interrupted for any reason, like a power outage. [1] X Research source If the outlet is hard to reach, you could also turn off the circuit breaker that powers your kitchen. Leave it off for 5 minutes before flipping it back on. This will also cut the power to your oven and hopefully reset the computer."

      "title": "Press the “Self-Clean” button, then “Clear/Off” after 60 seconds.",
      "content": "Press the “ Self-Clean ” button, then “Clear/Off” after 60 seconds. If turning the oven on and off didn’t reset the computer, try asking it to run a self-cleaning cycle and then promptly cancel it. This should hopefully engage the lock function (even though it is already engaged) and then release it after you press the “Clear/Off” button. Make sure to wait long enough after pressing “Self-Clean” for the process to start. You can usually hear your oven’s system start the cycle."

      "title": "Run a short self-clean cycle and let the oven cool off for several hours.",
      "content": "Run a short self-clean cycle and let the oven cool off for several hours. If starting and canceling the self-cleaning cycle didn’t work, try letting the oven run a self-cleaning cycle. Set the timer for 1-2 hours and then let it do its thing. Give it several hours after the cleaning cycle to cool down, which should prompt the internal temperature gauge to release the lock function. [2] X Research source The internal temperature needs to get back to around 200 °F (93 °C) or lower, and that may take anywhere from 30-90 minutes after the cleaning cycle is finished."

      "title": "Call a professional so you don’t damage the oven door.",
      "content": "Call a professional so you don’t damage the oven door. Find an appliance repair company in your area who can fix the brand and model of oven you have. Some companies may offer a free estimate, especially if you’re a new customer, so spend some time looking at companies, reviews, and rates to find a provider you’re comfortable with. [3] X Research source Doing a DIY repair or finding a way to force the door open can result in more expensive damage than if you were to just call a repair person to come to take a look at the oven. Even if you manage to get the oven door open on your own, you still don’t know the underlying cause that is making the lock function engage when it shouldn’t be."

      "title": "Check that the “Child Lock” button isn’t engaged.",
      "content": "Check that the “Child Lock” button isn’t engaged. This button often gets accidentally engaged during cleaning, and turning it off is simple! Hold down the button for 4-5 seconds to see if that clears the lock icon. If not, try holding down the “Clear/Off” button for 4-5 seconds. [4] X Research source Remember that every model of oven is slightly different, so if you know you need to hold down that lock button for longer, make sure to do that."

      "content": "Read the user manual to see if there is a way to reset the computer. Every brand of oven is slightly different, but many have a process that will reset the oven’s computer panel and trigger the oven door to unlock. It may be something like pressing the “Clock” button and the “Clear/Off” button at the same time for 10 seconds, or holding down on the “Child Lock” button for 30 seconds. The exact way to do this will depend on the brand of oven you have. For instance, the way to unlock a General Electric oven is different from unlocking a Bosch ."

      "title": "Let the oven cool down to room temperature if there is food inside of it.",
      "content": "Let the oven cool down to room temperature if there is food inside of it. Many newer ovens have a safety feature that will lock the oven if it registers a super high temperature, and sometimes the internal temperature of your oven gets to be higher than what it was set to. Turn off the oven and give it 30-90 minutes to cool down; then try opening the door or pressing the “Clear/Off” button to disengage the lock function. This can be super frustrating since your food is in the oven! But if you can’t get the door to unlock any other way, this is your only option. Make sure to turn the oven off so that it doesn’t maintain the same level of heat and burn your food."

      "content": "Turn the circuit breaker off for 5-10 minutes, then turn it back on. This is a simple way to cut the power to the oven and hopefully reset the computer. If this doesn’t work and you’ve tried several other methods to get the door unlocked, it may be time to call in a professional. [5] X Research source It’s best to avoid using alternate means to try and force the door open, like a bent hanger or wire. This can cause more damage and cost you more money to repair in the long run."

      "content": "Unplug the oven for 5 minutes and then plug it back in to reset the computer. Sometimes the oven door is opening and closing perfectly fine, but the lock button is showing on the computer panel, making it so that your oven can’t function normally. Before trying anything else, cut off the power to the oven to see if that will jog it to reset. [6] X Research source You could also try turning off the circuit breaker directly if the outlet to your oven is hard to reach."

      "title": "Open the door and locate the door jamb and locking mechanism.",
      "content": "Open the door and locate the door jamb and locking mechanism. There generally is a small metal latch or hook located on the exterior of the oven that hooks into a small opening on the interior of the oven door. It’s usually on the top of the oven (beneath the burner buttons), but it can sometimes be along the right- or left-hand side. [7] X Research source The oven door does need to be open for you to locate the door jamb and locking mechanism."

      "title": "Push the door jamb manually so the oven thinks the door is shut.",
      "content": "Push the door jamb manually so the oven thinks the door is shut. While the oven door is still open, use a pair of pliers to push the hook or latch in to signal to the oven’s computer that the door is shut. It’s now signaling that the oven is shut and locked, while neither is true. [8] X Research source You may be able to just push the latch in with your hand, but sometimes the opening is too slim."

      "content": "Press the “Self-Clean” button, wait 10 seconds, then press “Clear/Off.” Give the oven enough time to start prepping for the cleaning cycle—you can usually hear the computer whirring and the oven gearing up to start the process. Once that happens, while still holding the door latch in, press the “Clear/Off” button. This should hopefully reset the computer and remove the lock icon from the computer panel. The oven door must be kept open during this process, otherwise, it’s possible that it could get stuck in the locked position once the cleaning cycle is engaged."

      "title": "Call a repair person if the lock icon is still displayed.",
      "content": "Call a repair person if the lock icon is still displayed. If this doesn’t work, it could mean that there is something wrong with the actual computer inside the oven and it may need to be replaced. Unless you have experience working with those types of systems, it’s generally less expensive and frustrating to have a professional service company fix things for you. [9] X Research source When you call to set an appointment, check to make sure the company can work with the brand of oven you have."
