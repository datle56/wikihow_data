      "title": "Cut the rice crispy treats into individual squares.",
      "content": "Cut the rice crispy treats into individual squares. For quicker, easier access, go for smaller squares that you can just grab and eat. If you’re storing a lot of leftover rice crispy treats, cut them into larger slabs that will fit in your largest airtight container."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the leftovers in an airtight container or zip-lock baggie.",
      "content": "Put the leftovers in an airtight container or zip-lock baggie. Choose a container that will hold all of the leftovers without leaving too much extra space for air at the top. The less air space, the longer the treats will stay fresh! Stack the treats into the container or baggie in single layers. Press out any extra air from the baggie, then seal up the treats either with a lid or zip-lock. [1] X Research source Containers should be able to hold several layers, while baggies will probably only hold 1 or 2."

    {
      "title": "Place a sheet of wax paper between each layer to prevent sticking.",
      "content": "Place a sheet of wax paper between each layer to prevent sticking. The wax paper will act as a buffer and keep the rice crispy treats from bonding and sticking together. Measure out the size of your container or baggie, then cut the wax paper to fit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the treats at room temperature for up to 3 days.",
      "content": "Store the treats at room temperature for up to 3 days. Store the container on the counter, in a cupboard, or anywhere that will stay room temperature. [2] X Research source Room temperature can fall anywhere between 64 to 73 °F (18 to 23 °C). [3] X Research source After 3 days, you should throw away the old rice crispy treats and just whip up a new batch!"

    {
      "title": "Eat the treats as soon as possible for the best flavor and texture.",
      "content": "Eat the treats as soon as possible for the best flavor and texture. If you wait too long, the rice crispy treats will lose their soft, gooey consistency. Once they go stale, they’ll turn rock-hard. Make sure to eat these treats right away to enjoy them at their best! [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the rice crispy treats into even squares.",
      "content": "Cut the rice crispy treats into even squares. Use a knife to cut the pan of rice crispy treats before you store them. This will help each piece to freeze evenly and make it easier to pull out individual treats once they’re frozen. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the squares in an airtight container or freezer bag.",
      "content": "Place the squares in an airtight container or freezer bag. If you use a container, fill it up layer by layer with the treats, then seal the top. Freezer bags are a great alternative for when you can’t find the right size of container or don’t want to leave your containers in long-term storage. Simply fill a freezer bag with 1 or 2 layers of treats, press out any extra air, and seal it up tight. [6] X Research source If you’re using a container, look for one made of either plastic or glass pyrex to store your squares. Try to find the right size of container that won’t leave too much extra space at the top. Eliminating extra air will help keep the treats fresher for a longer amount of time."

      "content": "Lay a piece of wax paper between each layer of treats. This will help prevent the rice crispy treats from sticking and bonding. Measure your container or freezer bag, then cut the wax paper to about the same size. This will make stacking and sealing much easier. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a piece of tape to mark the date on the container.",
      "content": "Use a piece of tape to mark the date on the container. To help you keep track of the treats’ freshness, make sure to place a piece of tape on the top of the container and write down today’s date. These labels will help you easily determine whether or not the treats are edible when you find them in your freezer later."

      "title": "Place the container in the freezer and keep the treats for up to 6 weeks.",
      "content": "Place the container in the freezer and keep the treats for up to 6 weeks. Up until 6 weeks, you can keep enjoying these sweet treats. After 6 weeks, the treats will likely lose most of their moisture and turn rock-hard. If you see any containers with a date label from more than 6 weeks ago, just throw away the old rice crispy treats."

      "title": "Let the frozen treats thaw for 15 minutes before eating.",
      "content": "Let the frozen treats thaw for 15 minutes before eating. To eat a frozen rice crispy treat, take it out of the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before eating or serving. This thawing period will bring back some of the rice crispy treat’s original softness and gooeyness."
