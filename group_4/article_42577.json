      "content": "Use a multi-use or oral digital thermometer. Some digital thermometers are designed to be used either rectally, orally, or in the armpit, while others are designed to be used specifically in the mouth. Either type of thermometer will give an accurate reading. You can find digital thermometers in the drugstore. If you have an old glass thermometer, it's best to stop using it. Glass thermometers are considered unsafe now because they contain mercury, which is poisonous to the touch. If the thermometer breaks, you will have a hazardous situation."

The person's tongue should completely cover the tip of the thermometer. If you're taking your child's temperature, either hold the thermometer in place or instruct your child to do so. Try to move the thermometer as little as possible. If the person is upset, fidgeting, or vomiting, take their temperature under their arm instead."

If a baby has even a slight fever, contact your doctor. However, children and adults don't need to go to the doctor unless their temperature is over 101 °F (38 °C).
