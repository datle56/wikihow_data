      "content": "Disinfect pruning shears before you start trimming the plant. Lucky bamboo plants are hearty, but they can become infected if you don't clean the shears before trimming. Fortunately, it only takes a minute! Take your clean garden shears and dip a cloth in 70-100% alcohol like isopropyl alcohol. Wipe it across both sides of the blades and you're all set. [1] X Research source Don't have pruning shears? Regular scissors are totally fine as long as you disinfect them. To make it even easier to disinfect, keep a few packets of alcohol wipes near your garden supplies."

      "title": "Cut off leaves that have yellowed tips.",
      "content": "Cut off leaves that have yellowed tips. The ends of the leaves can turn yellow if the plant's not getting enough water or it's getting too much sunlight. Instead of yanking the leaves off, take disinfected shears or scissors and cut the leaves off where they meet the stalk. [2] X Research source It's really important to cut the entire leaf instead of just the yellow part. This is because partially trimming the leaf can introduce bacteria and make your plant sick. Don't forget to address the cause of the yellow leaves. Always keep 4 inches (10 cm) of fresh water in the container and put it in indirect light."

      "title": "Pull away dead leaves as the plant grows.",
      "content": "Pull away dead leaves as the plant grows. It's easy to panic if you notice dead, dry leaves on your plant, but don't worry! Dying leaves are normal because the old leaves die off as new growth comes in. If the plant is putting out healthy growth, the leaves simply dry up, so you can pull them down and off of the stalk. [3] X Research source Your plant will look better and put more energy towards growth once you trim the dead leaves."

      "title": "Cut straight across the top of your plant if you want to shorten the lucky bamboo.",
      "content": "Cut straight across the top of your plant if you want to shorten the lucky bamboo. Topping just means that you cut off the leaves and top of the stalk. It also encourages the bottom of the plant to put out new shoots and leaves, so topping is a good idea if you want the plant to fill out. To top your plant, take disinfected shears and cut straight across the top. [4] X Expert Source Ryan Glynn, CPA Plant Specialist & Interiorscaper Expert Interview. 4 November 2021. It's totally up to you how much you want to cut off. [5] X Research source Cutting the stalk stops it from growing, but it will send up shoots right below the cut you made. Want to give your lucky bamboo a slight trim? You don't have to cut off the top of the stalk. Just cut off the leaves from the top of the plant instead."

      "title": "Trim offshoots that look straggly.",
      "content": "Trim offshoots that look straggly. Lucky bamboo puts on leafy shoots from the main stalk as it grows. If your plant is looking too bushy for your liking or the offshoots are growing crookedly, clip off the shoot 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) from the main stalk. [6] X Research source Don't want the offshoots to grow back? No problem! Just cut the offshoot where it meets the main stalk."

      "title": "Throw away stalks that are brown or mushy.",
      "content": "Throw away stalks that are brown or mushy. Although lucky bamboo plants are easy to grow, they can start to rot if you forget to change their water. If this does happen, work fast! Take out any stalks that are brown, black, or squishy since you can't nurse them back to health and they could make other stalks sick. If the stalks aren't too bad yet and you think you can heal them, cut off yellow parts and stick the stalks into a separate container with fresh water."

      "title": "Cut a leafy offshoot from a stalk of lucky bamboo.",
      "content": "Cut a leafy offshoot from a stalk of lucky bamboo. It is very easy to propagate lucky bamboo. [7] X Expert Source Ryan Glynn, CPA Plant Specialist & Interiorscaper Expert Interview. 4 November 2021. Choose a healthy, green stalk of bamboo that has at least 2 nodes and a leafy offshoot that's at least 4 inches (10 cm) long. Then, take disinfected shears and cut the offshoot where it meets the stalk. [8] X Research source Nodes look like rings or joints around the bamboo stalks and offshoots usually grow near them."

    {
      "title": "Trim the bottom of the offshoot to give it a straight edge.",
      "content": "Trim the bottom of the offshoot to give it a straight edge. If your cutting has a lot of leaves near the base, pull off the leaves near the bottom 2 inches (5.1 cm) so you can see the new stalk. Then, use shears to cut straight across the bottom so the stem isn't at an angle. [9] X Research source Don't forget to do this step or you'll have trouble getting your new lucky bamboo to stay upright in its new container!"

      "title": "Put the cutting into a jar with distilled water and pebbles.",
      "content": "Put the cutting into a jar with distilled water and pebbles. Fill a clean jar or container with 4 inches (10 cm) of distilled water, then add a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of pebbles to the bottom. Stick the cutting straight down into the pebbles. [10] X Research source The pebbles anchor the cutting so it stays completely vertical and the roots grow evenly."

    {
      "title": "Change out the water every week.",
      "content": "Change out the water every week. Stick your cutting in a spot where it gets indirect light and leave it alone until you see roots grow out of the bottom. The only maintenance you need to do in the meantime is to switch out the water once a week. In about 2 months, you should see a few roots growing from the bottom of your lucky bamboo! [11] X Research source Feeling impatient? It's totally fine to remove the cutting if it's put out shoots after a month. The amount of time it takes for the cutting to grow roots is really variable, so your cutting may be ready a lot sooner than an older cutting."

      "title": "Transfer your cutting to a vase with water once you see roots.",
      "content": "Transfer your cutting to a vase with water once you see roots. Once you see a few roots from the bottom of the cutting, you're ready to display the lucky bamboo! Place your new lucky bamboo plant into a decorative vase or container that has pebbles in the bottom. Remember to pour 4 inches (10 cm) of distilled water into it before you stick the lucky bamboo down into the pebbles. [12] X Research source For a fuller display, put the new bamboo into a vase or container that has older, established lucky bamboo stalks. Don't forget to change the water! Replace the water once a week so it's always fresh for your plant."
