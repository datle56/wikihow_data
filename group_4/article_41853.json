      "title": "Focus on your weak spots.",
      "content": "Focus on your weak spots. Because you are studying at the last minute, you will not have time to go through all of your class material or your study notes. Instead, you should read over the class material and identify any topics you struggle with or have trouble recalling. You should then focus your studying on brushing up on your weak spots so you are better prepared heading into the test. You may take a practice exam and note questions that you did poorly on or scored low on. You may then focus your studying on these questions so you do not have any weak spots going into the exam. [1] X Research source For example, you may struggle to remember certain historical dates for your social studies exam. You may then focus your attention on remembering the dates and memorizing them so you can do well on these types of questions in your exam."

      "title": "Make a mind map",
      "content": "Make a mind map . You can also study quickly and efficiently by making a mind map, which is a study tool to help you remember the connections and links between certain concepts or terms. Mind maps are useful if you have already taken notes on the course material and are looking for ways to organize this material to remember it better and recall it during the test. You can draw out a mind map on a piece of paper or use mind map software on your computer to help you study. [2] X Research source For example, you may be trying to study for your biochemistry exam. You may then place a concept in biochemistry, such as “enzymes”, in the center of a piece of paper and use your course notes to draw information and terms that relate back to “enzymes”. You may circle these terms and draw lines so they connect back to the center circle around “enzymes.”"

      "title": "Use flashcards.",
      "content": "Use flashcards. You can also use a tried and true study tool, flashcards, to create an efficient, last minute study session. You may use colored flashcards to write down different terms or phrases to help you prepare for the exam. Flashcards have been shown to improve your memory recall and help improve your visual learning abilities. [3] X Research source For example, you may write down certain terms that will be on your test on the flashcards. Then, write the definitions for the terms on the back of the cards. You can then test yourself on the terms or ask a friend or sibling to test you on the terms to ensure you get the definitions right."

    {
      "title": "Try audio or visual aids.",
      "content": "Try audio or visual aids. You may also lean on audio or visual aids to help you study at the last minute, especially if you tend to learn better from visual or audio cues. Using audio or visual aids may also help you recall information more quickly and more effectively than reading information on the page. [4] X Research source You may listen to a recording of yourself reciting definitions and terms from your textbook or listen to an audio recording of the course materials and take notes on the audio to help you remember the information. You may also try watching videos that relate to a concept in your textbook to better understand the concept. You should search online for educational videos and use them to help you study at the last minute."

      "title": "Get a tutor.",
      "content": "Get a tutor. If you find you are struggling with specific topics or concepts in a class, you may consider getting a tutor to help you study. You may try to hire a professional tutor to help you with the gaps in your knowledge or ask a friend who is doing well in the class to help tutor you. You should try to reach out to others for help on topics you are struggling with, especially if you are trying to study at the last minute and are not sure how to begin."

      "title": "Exercise on your study breaks.",
      "content": "Exercise on your study breaks. Though you are studying last minute and may be trying to cram as much information in your brain as you can, you should still try to take short study breaks. During your study breaks, you should do some exercise to keep your energy levels up and to improve your concentration. Even doing 5-10 minutes of exercise during your study break can help you stay fit and mentally prepared for more studying in the future. [5] X Research source For example, you may do a quick jog around the block during your study break or go for a quick walk around campus. You may also do push ups or sit ups during your study break to stay motivated and alert."

      "title": "Drink water.",
      "content": "Drink water. You should try to only drink water while you are studying, as this will ensure you stay hydrated and healthy. If you do drink coffee, you should only drink a small amount during the day and make sure you are drinking enough water to compensate for the caffeine. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Have healthy snacks.",
      "content": "Have healthy snacks. You should also try to have healthy, energizing snacks while you study so you can stay focused and not become too wired or too lethargic. Go for healthy sources of sugar, like fruit, as well as healthy sources of protein, like nuts, to help you stay focused. [7] X Research source Avoid eating and drinking items high in processed sugar and fat, as these products will only make you more tired and distracted. Go for healthier options so your body has the energy it needs to stay focused and study."

      "title": "Block out any distractions.",
      "content": "Block out any distractions. To study effectively at the last minute, you should create a distraction free zone in your room or general area. This may mean keeping your door closed so everyone in your home knows you are trying to focus on studying and can leave you alone. You may also keep the doors and windows closed to block out any distracting noises around you. [8] X Research source If you are studying in a public place, like the library, you may use noise cancelling headphones to stay focused. You may also turn off your cellphone or put it on mute so it is not a distraction to you. You may also find it helpful to turn off your wi-fi connection to avoid going on social media and getting distracted. Doing this can help you focus and not get sucked into using your time on social media instead of on your study notes."

      "title": "Prepare last minute review notes.",
      "content": "Prepare last minute review notes. You should prepare some last minute review notes that focus on key concepts and terms that you struggle with. You may write these notes on flashcards and review them once at night before bed and once in the morning before the exam. Doing a scan of these last minute notes could help you remember them better for your exam. [9] X Research source Try to focus on terms and concepts that you struggle with remembering or have identified as your weak spots, as you do not want to try to cram all of the information on the exam into your last minute review."

    {
      "title": "Pack your bag.",
      "content": "Pack your bag. You should do some preparations the night before the exam so you are less stressed in the morning and can head into your exam with a clear head. Start by packing your backpack so it contains all of your books, pens, and paper. Make sure you have working pens as you do not want to end up in your exam with a faulty pen. [10] X Research source You should also make sure you have any other supplies in your bag that you may need for your test, such as a graphing calculator and a ruler."

      "title": "Get a good night’s sleep.",
      "content": "Get a good night’s sleep. Many studies have shown that getting a full night’s sleep before an exam can help you perform better. Though it may be tempting to pull an all night study session, doing this could lead to a poor grade on the exam and an inability to recall important information for the exam. You should do a review of your notes before bed but try to get at least eight hours of sleep in the night before the exam. [11] X Research source You should also set an alarm so you wake up in the morning with enough time to review your notes one more time before heading to the exam. Walk into the exam calmly and with confidence. Walking to school might give you time to revise everything in your mind."
