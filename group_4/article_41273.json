      "content": "Determine if your picking is truly a compulsive behavior. Excoriation disorder, where you feel the urge to constantly pick at your skin, as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Compulsive skin picking is more than just a strong urge to pick at your skin. It can include recurrent picking that leads to open wounds, lesions, or other medical distress, and an urge so great that you can't stop your picking even if you make a concerted effort. [1] X Research source Excoriation disorder is a compulsive urge that is not caused by illicit substances or medications. If something you're taking is causing your compulsion, look into adjusting that before seeking treatment for skin picking. Skin picking may also be a side-effect of other mental health problems. If you have another mental or psychiatric problem, talk to your doctor or therapist to see if that may relate to your skin picking, or if it is a true compulsion on its own."
