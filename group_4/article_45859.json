      "content": "Cut aloe from a plant if you have one. If you have an aloe plant in your home or near where your burn occurred, you can use it to get fresh aloe. Remove a few meaty leaves near the bottom of an aloe vera plant, since that’s where they’re the oldest. Cut off any spines on the leaves to avoid getting poked, and cut the leaves in half down the middle. Then, score the insides with a knife to let the aloe flow out. [1] X Research source Aloe straight from the plant is the best way to get pure, all-natural aloe. However, there are store-bought options you can try as well. Older aloe plant leaves contain more aloe. Using younger leaves is fine, too, they just might not have as much aloe inside of them. Aloe vera plants are very easy to plant and maintain , and they’re great to have on-hand for minor injuries and sunburns. They grow in almost all indoor climates, and in warm outdoor climates."

[2] X Research source Look at the ingredient list of the gel you buy. Some that claim that they are \"made with pure aloe gel\" only actually contain 10% aloe, so it’s always good to double check."
