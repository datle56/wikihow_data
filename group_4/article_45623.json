      "content": "Find the metal pin sticking out underneath the handle on the rail. Stand behind the saw blade and locate the handle at the top of the saw. Follow the handle down to the rail that connects the head of the saw to the base. This rail is made of thick metal and runs vertically from the top to the bottom of the saw. On this rail, look for a small metal pin sticking out of the side. This pin is usually on the inside of the rail, but on older models it may be on the exterior side. [1] X Research source The lock pin is used to unlock the head of the saw so that you can move the blade up and down, but the guide rail will remain locked. You use the lever at the end of the guide rail to adjust the angle at the cut. If you have an older saw, this pin may be a knob. If you have knob lock pin, turn it counterclockwise to pull it out and clockwise to push it in."

      "content": "Press the handle down 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) and hold it in place. With your hand firmly on the handle, press the saw down a little and hold it in place. You cannot unlock the saw without keeping the blade held down. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pull the pin out 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) to unlock the saw.",
      "content": "Pull the pin out 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) to unlock the saw. With the handle held down, grip the pin with your free hand. Gently pull it out away from the rail that it is connected to. Pull it out as far as it will go, normally 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm), and release the pin. Your saw is now in the unlocked position and you can move the blade freely. [3] X Research source Whenever the pin is sticking out, the saw is unlocked. Always check this pin before picking your saw up to move it somewhere else. On a Dewalt compound sliding saw, pulling this pin out allows you to move the saw up and down on the rail that it’s attached to as well. To lock the rail in place, twist the knob on top of the large bracket where the rails slide back and forth. Turn this knob clockwise to tighten it in place. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the handle all the way down and press the pin in to lock it.",
      "content": "Press the handle all the way down and press the pin in to lock it. To lock the saw, press the handle down until the blade is as low as it can go. Then, press the lock pin back into the rail to secure the blade in place. Ensure that the saw is locked by pulling up on the handle with the pin pushed in. If the handle doesn’t move, your saw is locked. [5] X Research source Always lock the saw when you aren’t using it. It is dangerous to leave a saw unlocked, even if it isn’t plugged in or running."

      "title": "Inspect the end of the guide rail and look for a black lever.",
      "content": "Inspect the end of the guide rail and look for a black lever. To adjust the guide rail that guides the saw through your cut, go to the front of the saw. Follow the horizontal guide rail to the tip furthest from the handle. Look for a black lever that is sticking out of the saw at the end. This is the lock handle, which is used to adjust the location of the guide rail. [6] X Research source The guide rail is the horizontal platform that the saw blade drives in to. On compound miter saws, this rail can be adjusted so that you can make bevel cuts, which are precise cuts that are made at an angle other than 90-degrees."

      "title": "Press the button on top of the black lever and move the rail.",
      "content": "Press the button on top of the black lever and move the rail. If the lever is pointing down, flip it up so that it is flush with the guide rail. Then, inspect the top of the lever and look for a small, black button. This button releases the locking mechanism in the guide rail. Press this button and hold it down with your finger. Then, move the rail freely from side to side to adjust the angle of your cut. [7] X Research source You cannot move the guide rail if the lever is in the down position. If you need to make a cut at an exact angle, follow the angle guide at the base of the miter saw to line your blade up with a specific angle."

      "title": "Release the button and push the lever down to lock the rail.",
      "content": "Release the button and push the lever down to lock the rail. Once your compound miter saw is resting at the desired angle, release the button. Then, press down on the end of the lever to snap it into the locked position. When the lever is pointing down, the guide rail is locked and your cutting angle will not move as you make your cuts. [8] X Research source The lever has 2 positions—up and down. You will feel it snap into place every time that you move it. [9] X Research source"
