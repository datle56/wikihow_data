      "content": "Keep your back straight and your head held high. Good walking posture will help you avoid injury and walk for longer. When you start walking, stand up straight, and look about 15 ft (4.6 m) in front of you. Keep your chin parallel to the ground, and move your shoulders naturally as you swing your arms. [1] X Research source Relax your neck, shoulders, and back. Although your posture should be strong, your body should not be held too stiffly as you walk. Walking with good posture improves your blood circulation, and can even help lower your blood pressure."

      "title": "Walk heel to toe.",
      "content": "Walk heel to toe. When walking, you should step forward with your foot. Let your heel land on the ground in front of you. Then, roll your foot forward, transferring your weight to the ball of your foot. With your other foot, raise your heel, push your foot off the ground with your big toe, and repeat the first process. [2] X Research source Walking is different from running. Your feet should never lift off the ground completely at the same time. Find a stride that's comfortable for you. If you're losing track of the heel-to-toe motion, and aren't rolling your feet consistently, you may need to slow down."

      "content": "Avoid hyperextending your knee. Maintain a slight bend in your knee when walking, especially if you're prone to hyperextending your knee when standing. This will feel strange at first, but eventually your knees will adapt. Hyperextending your knee means moving your knee backwards slightly when standing or walking. Some people may have a natural tendency to hyperextend their knees, but hyperextending your knee can cause increased stress to your joints. When walking, be conscious of your knees to avoid hyperextending them.

      "content": "Take quick, not long, strides. When most people think of walking quickly, they often imagine themselves stepping in long strides. However, taking too long of a stride can hurt your lower back over time. Instead, take small, quick steps to pick up the pace. [6] X Research source Since we all have legs of different lengths, our strides are going to be somewhat different. Use the stride that’s best for you."

      "title": "Warm up your body for 5 to 10 minutes before walking.",
      "content": "Warm up your body for 5 to 10 minutes before walking. Warming up your body by starting slowly when you walk will reduce over-exertion on your muscles. Make circles with each ankle, swing each leg, make slow circles with your hips or legs, make arm circles, march in place, and swing your legs back and forth to loosen up your muscles. [7] X Research source If this is your first time walking for exercise , take a few extra minutes to warm up first. That way, you’ll avoid over-exerting yourself, which could lead to injury."

      "title": "Start with slow, short walks.",
      "content": "Start with slow, short walks. As with any exercise regimen, you might be more likely to quit walking if you try to do too much too soon. You also could strain your muscles. Be patient and work up to longer walks. Even though walking is a low-impact exercise, your muscles, joints and feet must adjust to new activity levels to avoid soreness and injury. Motivate yourself by remembering that you can burn about 400 calories from a brisk walk, although it takes about 5 miles to do so. If you want to lose weight, it’s a good idea to also reduce how many calories you eat per day and to eat healthier unprocessed foods. Try to add 2,000 steps into your daily routine when you first start walking. Sometimes you can add steps just by making small lifestyle choices every single day, such as taking the stairs at work when you could take the elevator. If you don’t see weight loss right away, it might be because you are starting to build up muscle, which is good. Be patient, and you will see results over the course of time. Slowly add more steps each week."
