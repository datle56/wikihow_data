      "content": "Like or retweet something that they have posted. This is an indirect but potentially effective way to get back in touch. This is something that you can do to build up your courage to talk to them, or this can be a primer for starting a conversation. Liking their posts or retweeting their tweets will remind them of you, and let them know that you are following their posts. Do not like everything they post. Choose one or two things that you genuinely like and space out the time between your likes to every few days. If you send too much attention to them all at once, it may come off like you are trying too hard. Do not like only the cute pictures of them. You can like one photo where you feel like they look particularly good, but if you like too many pictures of them looking pretty, you may come off creepy. Consider liking a variety of things that they post rather than just their pictures."

      "content": "Post on social media. If you have been liking or commenting on their posts, provide them with material to comment back on. Post clever or interesting thoughts you have about the world and people, share beautiful or interesting pictures that you have taken, or find funny gifs, pictures or quotes from the internet that you can post along with a comment about why you like it. Consider what they would find funny or interesting. You don’t want to post things for them; however, you want to take into consideration that their internet style might be different from yours. Take a look at their posts and the things they like to get an idea of their online interests and style. For example, if they write a lot of posts about bands they like and you share a band you like in common, you can post one of their music videos or the lyrics from one of their songs with a comment about why you like it. Stay true to yourself. Only post things that you genuinely like and are a part of who you are. It can come off fake if you are posting about things you haven’t shown an interest in before."

      "title": "Make a comment on one of their posts.",
      "content": "Make a comment on one of their posts. You should make a comment on a post that they write early after it has been posted. If you write the comment early, they will be more likely to respond. Look for things that they are into that is a common interest you share, like your music taste, love of food, love of movies, etc.. Consider praising the post, asking a question about it, or commenting about something you find interesting about it. For example, if they write a post about going to a show, you can respond “I am so jealous you got to see them! Did you think they were good live?” Hopefully your comments will spark a chain of comments back and forth. If this happens, you should send them a message asking them how they are doing or extending the conversation. Say “Hey, I am enjoying our conversation. How have you been? Are there any other bands you have been listening to lately that I should check out?”"

[1] X Research source [2] X Research source You can either create an event, or you can invite them to an event you are attending. For example, if you are going to a music festival that you think they would like, invite them to the event. There are several events that are open invite. You can send them an invitation by going to the page of the event and sending the invite from that page. Or if you and your friends are throwing a Halloween party, for example, make an event for it and invite them. After you invite them, you should send them a follow up message saying hello and telling them about the event. Say something like, “Hey, my friends and I are having a Halloween party and I was thinking it would be great to see you again. Are you free for Halloween?” If they cannot come to the event, use the event as an opportunity to continue messaging them. Ask her about how things have been going, and start a conversation with them."

Whichever way that you decide to reach out to them, you can follow the same tactic as writing a comment. Send her a message with a praise, talk about some common ground that you have, or ask her a question. [3] X Research source Send a message that praises them for something they have recently done or accomplished. For example, if they recently finished a program or got a new pet, for example, send them a message saying congratulations, and then ask her how they have been lately. Talk about something that you share in common. For example, if they did a hike recently and you also like to go hiking, send them a message that says something like “I saw that you went on a hike to Palm Canyon. I was just there a couple of months ago and really enjoyed the waterfalls- did you like the trail?”. Ask them a question about something they have posted. Say something like “I saw the pictures you posted of you surfing- what kind of board do you have? I love surfing and go every chance I get.”"

Try to approximately match the length of texts that they send you and wait time. For example, don’t text them back within a minute with three texts if they answered you with a line or two of text a couple of hours after you texted. Ask follow up questions like, “I didn’t know that you were working at a new restaurant. That’s cool! How do you like it?”"

Maybe you are not trying to go out of your way to see your crush, but you share a friend group and want to be friendly and cool with them- you can use these steps to help create a good connection with them. Or if you want to get into contact with your old crush and you can’t or don’t want to contact them directly, hang out with the mutual friends you have, and go to events they will probably be at. You can call your friends and ask them about the events and parties that are coming up and then attend those events. Or if you know they go to certain church activities, for example, you can start attending those activities again. Don’t use your friends to get to your crush. For example, when you hang out with your friends, be there to have a good time with them first, and consider seeing your crush second. That way if it doesn’t work out, you will still have a good time, and you won’t mistreat your friends."

If you see them across the room, give them a smile, and a friendly wave or greeting. If it doesn’t seem like a good time to talk, tell them “It is great to see you! I want to talk to you. Can you give me a minute?” You can finish doing what you are doing, and let them finish doing what they are doing, too. Giving yourself a minute will help you compose yourself and can add a good element of anticipation for your conversation. Think about an interesting topic of conversation or something that you can ask them about as an ice breaker before you walk up and talk to them. For example, you can make an observation about the party you are at by saying something like, “I like that they really made sure that all of our chip needs are met at this party.” Then gesture to a table covered in 10 different types of chips."

Once you two are settled, show them that you are happy to see them again by smiling, making eye contact, and simply saying “I am happy to see you.” Being positive and direct will make you seem confident and can help overcome any weirdness either of you might feel at the start of the conversation."

This will make you seem confident and happy to talk to her again. It can be a little less intimidating if you ask them how they are doing now because having to recount everything that has happened since the last time you saw each other might require a lot of explanation. Say something like, “I’d love to her how you are doing now.” Or you can start by saying what you remember of what they were doing last. For example, you can say “If I remember right, the last time we talked you were…” Avoid talking about anything awkward or difficult things from the past. If the conversation progresses that way naturally, you can talk about deeper topics, but at the beginning of the conversation you want to keep it light and positive."

[5] X Research source For example, if they are talking energetically and using lots of body language, use lots of body language in response and laugh often. Or if they seem a little more reserved, you can talk quieter and give them more physical distance. Don’t copy their gestures; however, do go for a similar level of energy."

If they seem interested in going out with you, make sure you have their correct contact information, and arrange to get together to do something in the near future. If they are ambiguous about whether they can hang out again, don’t push it. It is better to let them tell you when they are free. Sometimes people may be nervous in the moment and may come off uninterested, and at other times, they are sending you a message that they are not interested. Send them a follow up message or text to find out which is the case. For example, if they say something like “I don’t know, I’m going to be busy for a while.” You can say, “No problem, it was really good catching up with you. I’m glad we got the chance.”"

If you got their information and you are going to get together soon, you should send a follow up text sometime in the next couple of days that says something like “It was really good catching up- I am excited to hang out again.” If they seemed like maybe they wanted to hang out again, then follow up with a simple message or text that says “It was really awesome catching up with you- let me know if you want to get together sometime.” This kind of text is low pressure while also getting across that you are interested in hanging out more."
