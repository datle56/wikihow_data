      "title": "Avoid cliches.",
      "content": "Avoid cliches. It can be easy to slip into cliches, especially when you are writing a love poem. Avoid phrases that are so familiar they have lost their meaning. If you feel as thought a phrase or sentence is too familiar, change it up and make it more particular to your perspective as a poet. For example, rather than use a cliche like “My love is like a red rose,” you may write, “My love is like a hothouse orchid” or “a prickly cactus.”"

    {
      "title": "Use humor and wit.",

Notice if there are any lines that seem awkward or unclear. Adjust any phrases that seem cliche or familiar.
