      "content": "Leave a copy of your full itinerary and all applicable contact information with at least one person you trust. You need to let at least one person know where you'll be at all times. Set a time to get in touch as well, letting them know the easiest way to get to you in an emergency, as well as the day or days you will have the ability to check in with them. Don't assume that your cell phone will work when traveling in a different country; it might not be compatible with the local network. If you need a phone abroad, consider purchasing a local prepaid mobile phone as a safety measure."

Don't spend the whole day on a weak Wi-Fi signal trying to figure out what to see -- make a list in advance. The beauty of solo travel is that you aren't beholden to stick to your schedule, but you can have a wide range of options worth exploring if you aren't sure what to do next. Some good ways to find activities include: Travel blogs or forums TripAdvisor LonelyPlanet Recommendations from friends who have visited before Guidebooks from your local bookstore.

      "content": "Book accommodations in advance whenever possible. Whether you're staying at 5-star hotels, hostels, or camping, look into your sleeping arrangements before leaving. When you're alone, especially if you're in a foreign country, the last thing you want is a campsite to be full or the hostel to be booked. If you're intent on figuring it out on the fly, jot down 2-3 potential places to stay each night, along with phone numbers, to make your life easier. If you're looking to explore, aim for hostels or unique hotels with a bar and/or restaurant. You'll inevitably meet other travelers with recommendations and advice. Download or carry a Lonely Planet guide for your destination -- they have phone numbers, addresses, and descriptions of great places to stay (especially in a bind!) for your reference.

If you can, pick up as much of the language as possible -- even making an effort to speak a native tongue makes a big difference. Some areas to focus on learning include: Important cultural norms, including (in)appropriate gestures in public, titles and names, and religious or cultural customs. Appropriate dress and attire for your gender. Any safety or travel concerns you need to heed."

Make life much easier by only packing one light bag. You have enough to deal with without keeping track of luggage, and you do not want to be caught dealing with a lost bag by yourself. While the following list must adapt for your exact destination, it is a good starting point for solo travelers. Light, layer-able clothes, like jackets, scarves, and long-sleeves. Switchable clothing, like zip-off pants, will help you stay extra light. Try to avoid packing a lot of clothes. Keep in mind that many places will have laundry facilities, so you'll be able to re-wear the same stuff.

This means taking off expensive watches or jewelry and limiting the amount of cash on you at any one time. There is no reason to be flashy or flaunt wealth. Depending on your destination, you'll probably look enough like a tourist as it is. Leave the valuables at home or at the hotel to take undue attention off of you. If you are ever in a situation where someone wants your things, give them up. You can replace things and money, but it is difficult to read a dangerous situation safely when you're new in town. Just give it up and walk away."

Blending in is not only safer, it will generally lead to a less \"touristy\" experience. Keep your head high and your posture upright. Print directions in advance so that you don't constantly need to whip a map or expensive phone out. The more you look like you're in control, the less of a target you become. Don't wear headphones, especially if you're the only one with them in the street. They close you off to your surroundings and make you seem like a tourist Plain, simple clothing is almost always your best bet to blend in. A smile is perhaps your greatest weapon for disarming people and opening doors. [6] X Research source"

There is no reason, for example, to broadcast the fact that you're traveling alone. Instead, ask for directions by saying \"you're meeting a friend.\" If someone asks you where you're staying at night, let them know that \"you aren't sure yet, you're just exploring.\" Being a good traveler doesn't mean exposing yourself unnecessarily to danger. While there are always exceptions, in general: Don't tell people where you're sleeping. Don't tell people you're traveling alone. Don't broadcast your status as a foreigner or traveler Don't talk about your money or valuables, even obliquely. Don't tell people where you will be the next few days. [7] X Research source"

You are the best judge of your own safety -- if you feel safe, then you should feel free to explore. If not, say no and move on with your trip."

There will be people back home worrying that you're hurt or in trouble if you drop off the face of the earth without warning. In the rare worst-case scenario that something happens to you, time is of the essence. Have someone with a plan to help you if something goes wrong."

Take a trail that your fellow hostel mates are about to hike. Traveling alone gives you the freedom to explore now and make plans later. Get on the ground, then, and start exploring -- you'll never know who or what you'll find. If you're the type that likes organization and firm plans, hop onto a tour group. Ask the hotel/hostel staff if they know any pre-planned walking routes or good tour companies. The foods, people, and sights off of the beaten path are usually the most memorable. So get off the path and get on your own two feet. [8] X Research source"

A friendly smile and hello is usually all you need to start conversation. Most people are happy to give some guidance to a traveler on the road. Start with the staff at your hotel, asking them for recommendations or advice, and see where it leads you. You'll find no better guidebooks than the people who live and work in the place every day. Being alone means it is easy to pick up and drop plans. Keep your ears open for events at your hostel or hotel, or any parties or group activities with other travelers. A deck of cards is a great way to break the ice."

Traveling alone means the experiences are all yours, allowing you to find the \"right\" trip for you. So use the guidebooks as guides, not the law, and stay flexible. With the right attitude and willingness to experiment, your trip will turn out amazing. [10] X Research source"
