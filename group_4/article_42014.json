      "content": "Break out a Ouija board for a traditional option. The Ouija board is the go-to traditional solution for communicating with spirits. All you need is the board and a planchette, which is the small piece you move to select letters. [1] X Research source You and any other people joining you set the board down and touch the planchette (without moving it). If the ghost is nearby and wants to use it, it may move the planchette to spell things out. Keep a pen and notepad nearby so that you can start writing as soon as the ghost speaks up! It’s important to keep in mind that every ghost is different. Some ghosts will jump at the opportunity to use a Ouija board, while others won’t want anything to do with them. The same goes for every option here! The Ouija board was invented in Maryland in the 1880s. After the Civil War, people became interested in spiritualism and talking to the dead.

      "content": "Record EVP signals and take EMF readings. It’s hard to hear ghosts speak out loud—most people think it’s just too hard for a spirit to speak loudly in the human world. Luckily, you may be able to hear them using a recorder or an EMF reader. Set out any recording advice in the room you suspect ghost activity and review the recordings to spot any electronic voice phenomenon (EVP). Download an EMF app or buy an EMF reader and turn it on at the same time to catch any ghost activity in action. [3] X Research source With EVP, you may be able to hear the ghost speaking very quietly over the course of the recording. EMF stands for electromagnetic fields. These readers detect charges in the radioactive and electromagnetic field. In theory, ghosts cause disturbances in these particles when they’re around. EVP and EMF readers are the most popular tools among the professional ghost hunters you see on reality TV."

      "content": "Set out mirrors if you want to see the ghost show itself. Going all the way back to the Bloody Mary phenomenon, ghosts have supposedly been known to appear in mirrors when they want to. In the area where you suspect the ghost is hanging around, set some handheld or full-length mirrors out to see if you can spot anything. [4] X Research source People tend to report more ghost sightings in mirror when there is low or reduced light. Traditionally, it’s believed that ghosts cannot enter the physical world or interact with it when there is a lot of light. [5] X Research source The history of ghosts in mirrors goes all the way back to the Romans. Historically, mirrors were believed to be capable of “capturing” human spirits. Some believed mirrors were a portal to the afterlife. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Burn candles or incense to give the ghost smoke to work with. Some people believe that a lot of ghosts and spirits love to weave messages in smoke or reveal their physical shape with the smoke. Light a few candles or incense sticks in the area and wait to see if the ghost does anything with the smoke. Don’t leave candles or incense unattended, since they can cause fires. Using smoke to appease or communicate with ghosts is an ancient tradition. The Vikings used smoke to say goodbye to loved ones, and shamans in the Caribbean would use tobacco smoke to speak to spirits. Basically every culture has made this connection, so it’s a tried-and-true method."

A lot of ghosts just love toying with the real world, so leave some light and easy-to-move items in the area where you think the ghost is hanging out. Toy trucks, tennis balls, empty aluminum cans, dice, and thin pieces of fabric are all personal favorites of the otherworldly. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Connect with yourself and set your intention. The word “séance” comes the French word “to sit,” so get comfortable on the floor or sit at a table. Remind yourself that you and the ghost are safe and that you’re going to be in communion with one another. You can even recite some affirmations or mantras to let everyone in the space know you’re ready. In many Latin American traditions, only the purest and most open people are able to communicate with ghosts. If you’re too nervous, suspicious, or skeptical, the ghost may not show up!"

      "title": "Invite the ghost to demonstrate their presence.",
      "content": "Invite the ghost to demonstrate their presence. The first goal is to confirm that the ghost is actually nearby. Many people believe that the easiest way to do this is to ask the ghost out loud to present themselves. Keep your voice at room level and speak politely. Ask the ghost to do something to express their interest in interacting with you. [8] X Research source You might say: “If there are any spirits in the room with us right now, please let us know you are here. Any noise, sound, or movement is welcome. You are safe here.” “To the entities here now, I politely ask you to prove you’re here. Use the smoke from this candle to show us you’re present.” “Are you here with us, spirit? Move this tennis ball if you can. If you cannot, we understand.”"

If you think the ghost is present, ask them more questions to learn as much as you can about why they’re there, what they want, and what kind of ghost, so don’t be surprised if nothing happens and don’t give up! [9] X Research source You could ask: “Are you a friendly spirit? If so, is there any way you could prove it right now?” “How did you end up here? Did you used to live in this house?” “If you associate with anything in this room, please move that object now. It’s okay to show us what you care about, we won’t take it away.”"

      "content": "Observe and take in any signs the ghost gives you. Most mediums and experts suggest that ghosts are just as diverse as people are. In theory, some specters will immediately open up and start interacting with the environment once they know you’re safe, while others will try to hide until they’re positive it’s okay to come out and interact with you. Look for any evidence the ghost is present and take it into consideration. [10] X Research source For example, if a ghost completely ignores your Ouija board but you hear the blinds in the room next door rattling when you ask the ghost questions, perhaps it wants you to look at something outside the window. If the ghost seems to only show up at specific times, try performing another séance at that time to meet them when they’re most active."

      "title": "Thank the ghost and make an offering.",
      "content": "Thank the ghost and make an offering. Before you end the summoning, tell the ghost you appreciate them listening or talking to you (even if they didn’t do anything this time). Then, if you want to sweeten the deal, leave the ghost an offering. Believe it not, most cultural histories suggest that spirits are fond of sweets, so leave out something sugary. Candy, soda, cookies, or ice cream are all great options! In Gaelic traditions, they like to offer spirits flowers, coins, metalwork, or wood objects. In Thailand, it’s common to leave strawberry soda out. The red color is representative of blood the spirits long for, and the sweet soda is a favorite of ghosts. [11] X Research source"

If you don’t mind if the ghost sticks around, tell them you’re happy to have them and that you’ll be back to reach out to them soon. [12] X Research source Most experienced ghost summoners think ghosts mean humans no harm. There’s nothing in it for them to hurt or scare you, so don’t be afraid to let a house spirit hang out. Maybe they’ll be good luck!"

Burn a stick of sage and walk around your room while purging the negative energy from your space. Say goodbye to the ghost as you finish. [13] X Research source It’s actually really important to literally say “goodbye” out loud. If you don’t, it’s possible that the ghost won’t understand your communications are over and they may act out."

      "content": "Use salt to restrict the spirit if you’re especially scared. If you are 100% not okay with the idea of a ghost sticking around, grab some salt. Himalayan rock salt is traditionally the product of choice, but any kind of salt will work. Pour a line of salt around any area where you want to keep the ghost out. It is believed that ghosts aren’t able to cross salt lines, so you’re in the clear. [14] X Research source Don’t worry, the ghost shouldn’t take this as a sign that they need to fight back against you or anything. Ghosts aren’t vindictive that way; they’ll just leave you alone and go elsewhere."
