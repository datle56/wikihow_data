Add half a teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water and mix well. Sip and gargle for 10 seconds, then spit--do NOT swallow.

      "content": "Eat some honey. Honey is a fantastic natural remedy, as it coats the throat and quickly relieves any itchiness or irritation. For best results, eat a tablespoon of honey each morning. Use raw, local honey where possible. Stirring a tablespoon of honey into your tea is another viable option if you can't stomach the raw stuff. Never give honey to infants under the age of 12 months, as the bacteria it contains can cause a condition known as infant botulism, which may lead to death."

      "content": "Use a humidifier. Living or sleeping in a very dry environment can cause your throat to become dehydrated and itchy. Placing a humidifier in your living area or bedroom will add moisture back into the air and help to soothe an itchy throat. If you don't want to invest in a humidifier, you can achieve the same results by placing a large bowl of water under the radiator or by keeping plants in your living space."

      "title": "Drink more water.",
      "content": "Drink more water. Dehydration is one of the most common causes of an itchy throat, as your throat becomes dried out and there is not enough mucus to lubricate and protect the sensitive tissue. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day and drink plenty of green and herbal teas. Drinking water is especially important if you have a flu or cold, as you tend to lose a lot of fluids through sweat (from fever) and mucus (from sneezing and blowing your nose)."

Recreational drug use and certain medications (like antidepressants) can lead to dehydration and throat irritation. Smoking cigarettes is very drying on the throat and can lead to itchiness and irritation (along with a host of other health issues) so think about quitting , or at least cutting back."

      "content": "Protect your voice. Things like talking too much, shouting, or singing can cause your throat to become overworked, leading to dehydration and itchiness. If you believe this may be the cause of your itchy throat, try to give your voice a break by resting it (no talking, singing or shouting) for at least an hour or two each day. If your work involves using your voice a lot, remember to keep a bottle of water on you at all times so you can keep your throat lubricated and stay hydrated throughout the day."

      "content": "Suck on a throat lozenge or cough drop. Regular throat lozenges don't do much to heal your throat, but they do alleviate the pain.

      "content": "See a doctor for severe or persistent symptoms. Most of the time, an itchy throat will get better with at home treatment. However, if your symptoms last for more than 10 days, worsen rapidly, or are accompanied by a high fever, you should call your doctor. If you are experiencing wheezing or trouble breathing, hives, facial swelling, a severe sore throat, fever, or difficulty swallowing, see your doctor immediately. Any of these symptoms could signal a more serious problem. An itchy throat could be the result of an allergic reaction to food or medicine, which could occur between a few minutes and a few hours after consuming the trigger substance. This can be life-threatening. A itchy or sore throat may also signal a bacterial or viral infection that requires a doctor’s attention, like strep throat, tonsillitis, or the flu. In some cases, an itchy throat is the result of heartburn or a side effect of medication like ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure."
