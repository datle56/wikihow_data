      "content": "Soak the wart. To get a wart ready for treatment, you need to soften it. The easiest way to do this is to soak it in warm water. Fill a bowl with warm water that is not too hot to submerge your hand in. Keep the wart in this water for approximately 10 minutes. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source The wart only needs to be soaked for a few minutes to make it soft. If your fingers begin to wrinkle from being submerged, you have already soaked it longer than necessary."

      "content": "Sand the surface of the wart. To make sure the medication you will apply to it soaks down deep into the wart, you should take the surface of the wart off. Use a small piece of fine-grit sandpaper or a disposable nail file to take the top surface of the wart off. [4] X Research source This process should not hurt but the area can get irritated. If the sanding is too painful, stop doing it and move on to applying the medication. It is important to clean up any skin cells that you remove so that they do not contribute to the spread of the disease. To do this, sand the wart over a surface that can be easily cleaned, such as a bathroom sink. Throw away the item you used to sand the wart after you have used it. Keeping it and using it again can spread the wart virus further."
