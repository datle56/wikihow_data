      "content": "Toss refrigerated raw fish 2 days after the sell-by date. Raw fish doesn’t last very long in a refrigerator and begins to go bad soon after the sell-by date. Look for the sell-by date on the packaging. If more than 1 or 2 days have passed since that date, throw the fish out. [1] X Research source If you’d like to delay the expiration of refrigerated fish, put it in the freezer. Frozen fish can last indefinitely if kept at 0 °F (−18 °C) but is best used within 3 to 8 months. If the fish has a use-by date rather than a sell-by date, avoid keeping the fish past that date. “Use-by” indicates that fish will begin to spoil if it’s not eaten by the printed date.

      "content": "Keep cooked fish in your fridge for 3 to 4 days past the sell-by date. If you’ve bought cooked fish (or cooked your own ) and then stored it in the fridge in an airtight container, it will keep longer than raw fish. If you haven’t eaten the fish after 3 to 4 past the sell-by date, though, discard it. [3] X Research source If you know in advance that you’re not going to use the cooked fish before it expires, put it in the freezer to delay the expiration. To refrigerate cooked fish, place the fish in an airtight container or bag and refrigerate for up to 4 days. If you plan to discard the fish’s original packaging once it’s cooked and then refrigerate it, write down the sell-by date so you don’t forget it."

      "content": "Look for a slimy coating on raw fish. As fish ages and begins to go bad, its outer surface will become wetter and eventually develop a thin layer of slime. This is a good sign that your fish has already started to spoil. Once the fish has fully spoiled, the slimy moisture on the meat will feel thick and slippery to the touch.

However, refrigerated fish that has started to go bad will have an increasingly fishy smell. If given enough time, this potent fish smell will develop into the putrid smell of rotting meat. [7] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source As fish continues to spoil, its pungent fish smell will grow stronger and stronger. It’s best to discard fish as soon as it starts to smell “off.”"

      "content": "Spoiled raw fish has a milky color. Fish meat is typically light pink or white in color, with a thin, clear film of liquid. As fresh or refrigerated fish ages and begins to go bad, the meat will take on a glossy, milky color. The milky parts of the fish may also take on a blue- or gray-ish tint. [8] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source If you’ve already cooked your fish, it won’t develop a milky color. This sign of expiration applies only to raw fish. If you have a whole fish, the eyeballs will also look cloudy if it's gone bad."

Look for crystallized peaks of ice that have formed on the surface of the fish, and note any discolored patches as well. [9] X Research source Freezer-burned food is still technically edible, and it will not make you sick. However, fish will lose most of its flavor and take on a grainy texture as freezer burn sets in.

These lines indicate that the fish is still fresh and edible. If you notice that these white lines have disappeared—or if they’ve turned to a more gray color—the salmon has likely gone bad.

If salmon in your refrigerator has become squishy, mushy, or unexpectedly soft in texture, it’s likely expired.

Fish (especially spoiled fish) can have bacteria and parasites that can make you sick, so always be diligent. Wash all surfaces and items the fish may have touched. If the fish is exceptionally stinky, place the meat in a second plastic or sealable bag before placing it in the trash can. Alternatively, you can discard the fish in an outdoor trash can to avoid any odors."
