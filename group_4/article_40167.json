      "content": "Greet the recipient and address them by their name. When writing any professional email , it’s important to include a greeting. If you’re replying to a coworker's email and you’re friendly with them, an informal greeting would be acceptable. If you’re replying to a boss, manager, or important client, a more formal greeting is likely the way to go. [2] X Research source Either way, be sure to include their name to make the email more personal and genuine. More formal greetings: Dear [name], Good morning/afternoon/evening [name] Less formal greetings: Hello [name], Hi [name]"

      "content": "Explain why your response is late. You don’t need to go into too much detail, but it is helpful to provide some context. [4] X Research source This helps the recipient understand that you weren’t intentionally ignoring them or trying to be rude, and it also gives you a chance to explain that this is not the norm for you. Make sure to keep the tone of the email professional, and avoid oversharing details that are too personal. Some reasons for a delayed response include: You were out of the office on PTO, vacation, or a leave of absence You were dealing with an illness, personal issue, or family emergency You (or your workplace as a whole) were experiencing technical difficulties You are taking over the role from someone else and inherited their unanswered emails"

Will you be able to make it?” “I’ve attached the documents you requested to this email, along with the contact information for each of the clients.” “Yes, I’m free to work on the project next Monday if you still are.

This may be the case if you took over a position from someone else and inherited their unanswered emails, if you were experiencing technical difficulties, or if your workplace was shuffling around responsibilities on your team. If you want to acknowledge the fact that your response was late but you don’t think an apology is warranted, there are a few alternative phrases you can use. [7] X Research source These include: “Thank you for your patience.” “I appreciate your flexibility.” “I appreciate your understanding.” “Thank you for bearing with me.” “Thanks for being so accommodating.”"

      "content": "Try to reply within 24-48 hours. The appropriate response time usually depends on the situation. For example, if it’s an urgent or time-sensitive email from a coworker or your boss, a timely response time could be just a few minutes. For other general emails, an acceptable response time could be anywhere between two hours to two business days. [8] X Research source According to research, 90% of people respond to emails within a day or two of receiving them."

      "title": "Apologize for a delayed response to time-sensitive messages.",
      "content": "Apologize for a delayed response to time-sensitive messages. If you received an urgent or time-sensitive email and did not reply for several hours, an apology for your delay is a good idea. For other emails, an apology would usually be warranted if you took several business days (or even several weeks) to reply. [9] X Research source As a general rule of thumb, the longer you’ve waited to reply, the more necessary an apology would be. For example, if you received an email that was not time-sensitive and took 2-3 days to reply, you can provide a quick apology if you want, but it may not be necessary. On the other hand, if you received an important email from a coworker or client and didn’t reply for a whole week, an apology is more likely necessary."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source You may only need to schedule one session per day if you don’t usually receive a lot of emails. However, if you receive a ton of work-related emails on a regular basis, it’s probably best to schedule 2-3 times to check them throughout the day. For example, if you only need to check your emails once per day, your designated time could be every morning at 10:00 a.m. If you need to check your email several times per day, your designated times could be first thing in the morning at 8:30 a.m., after lunch at 1:00 p.m., and right before clocking out at 4:45 p.m."

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner—I was on vacation last week, so I’m still catching up on things I missed.” “Hi, Mr. Garcia!
