      "title": "The tongue should rest along your palate with the tip behind your teeth.",
      "content": "The tongue should rest along your palate with the tip behind your teeth. At rest (when you’re not talking or eating), the tip of your tongue should sit on the roof of your mouth just behind your top front teeth, near where your gums and teeth meet or slightly behind. The rest of your tongue should be slightly arched and relaxed along the roof of your mouth (your hard palate). [1] X Research source Your lips will also be closed, your top and bottom teeth will be slightly separated or just barely touching, and nose breathing should feel easy and natural. [2] X Research source When swallowing, the front of the tongue should be held against the roof of the mouth while the back of the tongue contracts to push food down your esophagus. [3] X Research source When speaking, your tongue will move into all sorts of shapes or positions depending on the sounds (especially vowel sounds) you’re making. For example, “ah” or “uh” syllables cause the tongue to drop lower, while “ee” or “ay” syllables make it go higher. [4] X Research source After swallowing or speaking, your tongue should return to its neutral, resting posture."

      "title": "Does your tongue push forward into your teeth?",
      "content": "Does your tongue push forward into your teeth? This condition is called “tongue thrust” and is a common tongue position problem in children that can continue into adulthood if left untreated. The most obvious sign of tongue thrust is the tongue sticking out of the mouth slightly when swallowing or speaking certain syllables. Other symptoms include: [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Trouble swallowing Problems with food falling out of the mouth Accidentally biting the tongue or cheeks Mouth breathing Trouble pronouncing sounds like “S,” “Z,” “Sh,” and “J” What causes tongue thrust? Tongue thrust commonly occurs when infants don’t outgrow their “tongue thrust reflex” from nursing. It may also be caused by using pacifiers past age 3, conditions like allergies that cause mouth breathing, nervous system conditions, or anxiety."

      "title": "Does your tongue lay too low in your mouth?",
      "content": "Does your tongue lay too low in your mouth? This is called a low tongue rest position (LTRP) and happens when the tongue habitually doesn’t make contact with the hard palate due to nasal breathing problems. [6] X Research source Try moving your tongue high up into the roof of your mouth, then lowering it into the floor of your mouth—you’ll feel a noticeable change in your jaw and throat. If the low position feels more normal, you may have poor tongue posture. [7] X Research source Other signs of LTRP include: Neck or jaw pain A jaw that protrudes slightly forward and/or hangs low Drooling and/or snoring Difficulty reaching the roof of the mouth with the tongue Mouth breathing or the inability to close the lips fully [8] X Research source Tongue pressing against the back of the lower teeth (tongue thrust) If the tongue is low and also off-center (pointing any direction but straight forward), the jaw may also become misaligned. What causes low tongue rest position? Chronic interruptions to nasal breathing (like allergies or a medical condition) cause the jaw and tongue to drop and go forward to open up your airways. Over time, this low position can become a habit (even once nasal breathing improves). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Proper tongue posture supports correct oral development. The tongue is a strong muscle that can exert force on your jaw, maxilla (upper jaw), and teeth. When it’s in the correct position, it uses this force to positively support your oral development and overall health. This includes benefits like: [10] X Research source Maintaining straighter teeth alignment Preventing teeth grinding Keeping your tongue from flopping backward Preventing snoring and sleep apnea Preventing mouth breathing Expanding your palate to support your jaw and cheekbones as you age"

Your tongue is a long, strong muscle whose position and movement can influence the development of other parts of your body like your mouth, head, neck, nose, eyes, and shoulders. [11] X Research source Here’s what you may experience if severely poor tongue posture is left untreated long term: Those with tongue thrust may develop misaligned teeth, an underbite or overbite, gaps between the front two teeth, and/or jaw pain. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Those with low tongue rest position may develop a slightly longer, flatter face shape or a jaw/chin that protrudes forward (sometimes permanently).

      "title": "Poor tongue posture may narrow your palate, jaw, cheekbones.",
      "content": "Poor tongue posture may narrow your palate, jaw, cheekbones. When the tongue rests properly against the roof of the mouth, it helps to expand your palate. [15] X Research source This helps support your jaw and cheekbones, making them look slightly more pronounced. However, when the tongue is in the wrong place (especially when it’s too low), your palate can narrow, leading to a recessed jaw (and potentially less defined cheekbones). [16] X Research source Maintaining good tongue positioning can prevent the narrowing of your palate, jaw, or cheekbones. However, there’s no evidence yet that retraining your tongue to rest properly can reverse these effects once they’ve happened. Some claim that mewing can widen the palate, but there is no evidence supporting this. [17] X Research source"

This will train you to check in with yourself more frequently and maintain your tongue position. [19] X Research source Also notice any times that you’re breathing through your mouth throughout the day. See if you can close your mouth and continue breathing easily. If not, you may need to see a dentist, ENT, or myofunctional specialist to fix potential issues with your airway."
