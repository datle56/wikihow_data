      "content": "Learn about the breed. Any person who owns a Rottweiler should have a good basic knowledge about the breed. Not only will this help you train your Rottweiler properly, but also keep it happy and healthy. Well-bred Rottweilers are large and athletic. Male Rottweilers can grow up to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 100 – 135 pounds. Female Rottweilers are slightly smaller: up to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weighing 80 – 100 pounds. Rottweilers have a thick, glossy black coat with tan patches on the body. You should brush the coat every few days to keep it glossy and healthy. Rottweilers were originally bred to herd cattle, protect their owners and guard resources. Because of this, they got the name “butcher’s dog.”"

      "content": "Understand the temperament of Rottweilers. Before you can train your Rottweiler, it’s important to learn about the temperament of the breed. While they are loyal and loving, they can also be aggressive. Understanding your Rottweiler will help you successfully train it. Rottweilers are very social animals and bond well with their human family. They don’t like to be left alone or isolated. It’s not uncommon for them to have separation anxiety. Rottweilers need a lot of physical and mental stimulation. Long walks and obedience training sessions will stimulate them and help prevent destructive behaviors such as digging, chewing, and whining. Rottweilers are naturally territorial and will be very protective of you. Rottweilers may act dominantly towards other animals and people. Proper training, which includes socialization, will help minimize this behavior. [3] X Research source Rottweilers may exhibit aggressive behavior if they are trained that this is acceptable behavior or if they are not trained properly. [4] X Research source Rottweilers reach maturity very slowly, usually at the age of two. This can mean they will be hyperactive and mischievous for a longer period than other dogs. They may also chew on articles more frequently until they reach maturity."

      "content": "Make a training plan. Develop a training plan that you can follow consistently. Making a plan will give you a chance to consider your dog’s personality and different factors that may affect the process, such as if your Rottweiler is older or a puppy. When developing your training plan, make sure to keep your Rottweiler’s personality in mind. If there are certain areas of behavior with which he has difficulty, focus on those. Since training is something you need to do regularly and over time, set short, mid and long term goals. You can develop your plan by setting daily, weekly, and monthly intentions or goals for you Rottweiler. By taking the time, if necessary, to teach your dog lessons, you will ensure that your dog is obedient and understands the lessons you’ve taught him. For example, you could have the goal one week of socializing your Rottweiler. Make a plan over the course of the week to expose your dog to other dogs and people. Remember to keep the activities short, like a walk to the dog park, followed by a reward if your Rottweiler behaves and then walk or run home. It’s important that you can commit ample time over a longer period to training your Rottweiler. Dog training doesn’t happen overnight and requires consistency."

      "content": "Consider a professional trainer. If you don’t have the time to commit to training your Rottweiler consistently and properly or if your dog is having specific issues, consider hiring a professional trainer. Often, a professional will be able to address an issue that you cannot. Professional trainers will ensure your dog is obedient, but you will still need to use commands consistently and undertake top up training so as to keep it fresh in the dog's mind. If you have an older Rottweiler or even a rescue that has been traumatized, they may have specific behavioral issues that need addressed by someone who understands how to handle these situations. Learn from the trainer what your problems are and the solution, so you can apply this consistently at home. Puppies may also be averse to training and require professional training. You may also want to use a professional to help reinforce your training methods and correct you where you are having difficulties. Consult the local chapter of the American Kennel Club or the AKC’s website to find obedience training programs for your Rottweiler."

In order to train your Rottweiler most effectively, you want to start training him as early as possible to establish acceptable behavior. From puppies to older dogs, Rottweilers respond well to training with the proper guidance from early on in your relationship. Start training immediately. No matter how old your Rottweiler is, you will be most successful if you start training him early. [5] X Research source You will be most successful if you train your Rottweiler between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months.

      "content": "Understand dominance. When you train your Rottweiler, you want to establish rules that he will follow so that he behaves properly. By understanding that dominance in the relationship with your Rottweiler doesn’t mean dominating him, you are more likely to encourage the behaviors you seek. Dominance means establishing rules your Rottweiler will follow by reinforcing them with a firm voice or hand motions that indicate he is a member of a pack that you lead. You can be dominant and firm while being kind and careful with your Rottweiler. For example, the best way to establish this dominance is to take your Rottweiler for a walk on a leash and have him heel beside or behind you. Don’t dominate your Rottweiler through verbal or physical aggression. This will only cause him to fear you and undermine your training plan. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify and manage aggressive behavior. Rottweilers can exhibit aggressive behavior at any age. Rottweilers can get aggressive with people and other dogs. Identifying aggression and actively managing it with training can help prevent your Rottweiler exhibiting this behavior in the future. A Rottweiler may not show aggression immediately because he is an observer by nature. The signs of aggression may be discreet and your Rottweiler may even seem calm. Ignoring even subtle signs of aggression, such as staring, can lead to later problems. [10] X Research source There are different signs of aggression in a Rottweiler including a low growling noise, showing teeth, snapping the jaw, or staring. [11] X Research source If you see your Rottweiler quietly staring at something, this is a sign of aggression. Remove him from the situation to calm him down and avoid potential problems. A Rottweiler will exhibit aggression for different reasons such as protecting his territory, as well as being territorial with food or with an owner. [12] X Research source A Rottweiler may show aggression towards other dogs, such as growling or barking, because he thinks he is protecting you. [13] X Research source Fear is a primary reason of aggression in Rottweilers. It can be a trained behavior. [14] X Research source For example, if a man with a beard verbally or physically punished your Rottweiler, this may have traumatized him and he may exhibit aggressive behavior when he sees any man with a beard. [15] X Research source Manage aggression by quickly neutralizing the situation in a calm manner. [16] X Research source If you get upset with your Rottweiler, you may compound his anxiety and aggression. [17] X Research source Manage your Rottweiler’s aggression by exposing him to triggers in a controlled environment. This will help reduce his fear and help minimize aggressive behaviors. [18] X Research source For example, if your Rottweiler fears men with beards, have him meet a friend or family member who loves dogs and can show your Rottweiler that he doesn’t need to be scared of everyone with facial hair. [19] X Research source If your Rottweiler if exhibiting aggression towards you, leave the situation and don’t confront your dog. [20] X Research source Never chastise a Rottweiler for growling. This will inhibit the behavior (growling) but not remove his underlying feelings of tension. Thus the dog may learn to bite without first warning of his intention because he feels inhibited about growling."

Rewarding your dog for his positive behaviors is an integral part of the training process.

For example, if your Rottweiler does something you like, such as following a command, it’s important to reward him immediately so he understands that this is the type of behavior you like. Don’t punish a Rottweiler for going to the bathroom in your home unless you see him do it. He won’t remember the behavior.

You can minimize digging, chewing, whining and many other destructive behaviors through leash walks and by giving dogs chew toys.
