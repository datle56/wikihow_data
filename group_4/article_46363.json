      "title": "Practice awareness.",
      "content": "Practice awareness. To become aware that you are dreaming, you have to notice your environment and realize, \"This is just a dream.\" Some experts say that practicing awareness of your environment while awake can help you do to the same while sleeping. [1] X Research source During the day, look around and notice details like the heat of the sun or the feeling of pain when you stub your toe. With practice and attention, when you are dreaming you should be able to notice the absence or difference in these details, and realize you're dreaming. An additional perk to practicing mindfulness during the day, is it can make your dreams more realistic and easier to remember."

      "title": "Try meditation at night.",
      "content": "Try meditation at night. Since lucid dreaming typically occurs during the REM sleep cycle, which happens toward the end of sleep or just before waking in the morning, some lucid dreamers recommend setting an alarm for 4 hours after you go to bed at night, and then when you wake up, practicing meditation to enter a lucid dream state. [2] X Research source Turn off your alarm but try to stay as asleep as possible. Concentrate on the darkness on the back of your eyelids and on your intent to enter a dream state in which you are in control. Think about what you might want to dream about. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Try safe supplements.",
      "content": "Try safe supplements. Some lucid dreamers use herbal supplements like choline or galantamine to induce a lucid dreaming state. These don't work for everyone, and sometimes can have adverse reactions like sleep paralysis, which is a state in which you are awake, but cannot move. (If this happens, stay calm and relax. If you are frightened, it only gets worse.) [4] X Research source If you want to try choline or galantamine, try a small amount once a week. These herbs are available from health food stores in pill form. Some experienced lucid dreamers recommend setting an alarm for 3 or 4 hours after you go to bed at night and taking the supplement then, to reduce the chances that you will experience sleep paralysis or nightmares. [5] X Research source Although some books and websites will encourage the use of off-label uses of prescription drugs or even illegal drugs to bring on lucid dreams, these are actually hallucinations and not lucid dreams, and can be dangerous. Some people have harmed themselves or others while using drugs. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Be careful as you learn.",
      "content": "Be careful as you learn. The definition of lucid dreaming is knowing that you are dreaming, but since lucid dreams typically feel very real, it is a good idea to test whether you are dreaming before trying anything dangerous like eating fire or jumping off of buildings. [7] X Research source To test whether you are dreaming, do what is known as a \"reality check.\" [8] X Research source A reality check helps you ensure that you are actually dreaming. To perform a reality check while lucid dreaming, attempt to do something impossible but not dangerous like floating in the air. If you can do that, then you can advance to harder things that would be dangerous in real life. [9] X Research source If you're not sure if you're dreaming or if you're awake, try to turn on the light. If you can't do it because your hand goes through it, then you know that you're still dreaming."

    {
      "title": "Choose what you want to be.",
      "content": "Choose what you want to be. You have to clearly have a goal in mind so that you can focus on it. Concentrating on your goal in a sort of meditative practice helps you control your dream. You can be anything, but many people enjoy becoming something that will allow you to experience the universe differently, like an alien, bird, or fish. You can also use shape-shifting to confront your fears: for instance, if you have a phobia of spiders, you can shape-shift into one and experience life from its point of view."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a mirror to shape-shift.",
      "content": "Use a mirror to shape-shift. A clear pond, window, or anything else that gives you a good reflection will also work. Stare at yourself and will your skin to change and form into the shape you desire. You can also start at one end of your body (for instance, your feet) and consciously think of each part changing. Some lucid dreamers like to walk through the mirror at this point, fully embracing the alternate persona."
    },
    {
      "title": "Act out your new shape.",
      "content": "Act out your new shape. This is another method if you don't prefer to use a mirror or if you find it hard to visualize a mirror. Simply behave as if you were the thing you want to become. . For example, if you want to shape-shift into a dog, go down onto your hands and knees. Start barking, and wag your tail. Pretty soon you'll feel your hands turn into paws and your face change."

    {
      "title": "Perform a reality check.",
      "content": "Perform a reality check. This is to ensure your safety before you attempt flying. Even if you are confident you are dreaming, other conditions (like being high on drugs or sick with a very high fever) can induce a lucid dream-like state, so you need to be sure you're dreaming. [10] X Research source Float up in the air or put one hand through a solid object before proceeding. As long as you can do this, you know you're dreaming and can move on. Reality checks also have the added benefit of increasing your lucidity. The more you are able to control smaller behaviors, the more likely you will be to do bigger things like flying, which takes more mental focus. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bounce around.",
      "content": "Bounce around. Before flying, enjoy the landscape of the dream by bounce around, increasing your height with each bound. This gives you a safety net because your height is not that great. [12] X Research source Don't focus on the feeling of landing when you come down, just on the feelings of going up. Keep increasing the height and distance that you bounce. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Find a high place to jump off.",
      "content": "Find a high place to jump off. While experienced lucid dreamers can often just float up into the air and start flying, one easy way for the beginner is to jump off something high. This will force your mind to decide that you can fly rather than fall. If you have the ability and control, you can design your dreamscape with mountains or cliffs. Otherwise, you will have to explore your dreamscape to find a suitable place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start running.",
      "content": "Start running. If you're on a cliff, run towards the edge. If you're on a flat surface, you can still make it work; start running in a straight line, like an airplane taking off. When you reach the edge or decide you are ready, jump into flight like Superman. It helps to make it seem as realistic as possible, so put your arms out and point your toes behind you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Focus on details.",
      "content": "Focus on details. Lucid dreaming is a lot like meditation and requires concentration and focus to keep it up. To keep yourself in flight, focus on the feeling of the air in your hair and the sensations of flying. If you start to lose altitude, aim your body up and surge upwards, imagining a rocket propulsion coming from your toes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't look down until you feel comfortable with flying.",
      "content": "Don't look down until you feel comfortable with flying. Once you are steady, looking down at how high you are and how tiny everything below you is can be very enjoyable as long as you're not afraid of heights! If you are afraid of heights, you have a couple of options: you can try to construct a version of yourself who is not afraid of heights (which can be helpful in overcoming your fear in real life [14] X Research source ), or you can fly just above the ground, sort of like hovering."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remember that you're dreaming.",
      "content": "Remember that you're dreaming. If you do begin to fall, remind yourself that nothing you are seeing is real. It doesn't matter if you fall. Sometimes, having this conscious thought is enough to steady your flight and help you stop falling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fly like a bird.",
      "content": "Fly like a bird. Some people find it easiest to fly by flapping their arms like a bird. Combine this with a jumping takeoff for the best results. You can use each flap of your arms to propel you higher into the air. Change directions by shifting your whole body."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shape-shift into a flying creature.",
      "content": "Shape-shift into a flying creature. Another way to fly is by changing your physical body into a creature, made up or real, that can fly. Then you can use whatever method they use to fly. For example, shape-shift into a bird, and then simply flap your wings to go soaring through the air. You can use a mirror method, discussed above, or simply envision yourself as a bird, bat, pterodactyl, airplane, or flying insect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swim through the air.",
      "content": "Swim through the air. This is another method for flying and has the advantage of allowing you to dive into any bodies of water and swim. You can use any swim stroke you are most comfortable with, and simply pick up your feet and begin the stroke to lift off."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a flying aid.",
      "content": "Use a flying aid. You can use a broomstick, flying carpet, or, if you prefer something more realistic, try a jetpack or helicopter. Imagine yourself in or on the object that will help you fly, then allow it to lift off on its own and fly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a gateway or portal.",
      "content": "Use a gateway or portal. This technique involves using a door, mirror, or anything else as a gateway to a different location, planet, or universe. [15] X Research source Concentrate on the place you want to reach. Your dream is technically a land in your imagination, so imagine it as well as you can. Then simply open the door or walk through the mirror. If you don't find yourself in the right place, try again or just explore where you are. The place you wanted might be right around the corner."

      "title": "Teleport without a gateway.",
      "content": "Teleport without a gateway. Imagine in as much detail as possible, the place you want to go. Then, will your surroundings to blur and fade, and your new location to fill in the blanks. You can also try spinning in place, knowing that when you stop, you will be in your desired location."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use other tricks to ease the teleportation.",
      "content": "Use other tricks to ease the teleportation. Close your eyes and decide that when you open them you will be in the right place (be wary of closing your eyes all the way because sometimes the dream will fade away and you will wake up). If you can't teleport without a gateway, don't worry. It takes more time and practice without a gateway but you'll get it in time."
