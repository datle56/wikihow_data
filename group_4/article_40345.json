      "title": "Instant connections are a sign that your souls are energetically linked.",
      "content": "Instant connections are a sign that your souls are energetically linked. Whether you’ve known your soulmate for a few seconds or several days, you may feel deeply bonded to them. [1] X Research source It may feel like something in the universe is demanding you pay attention to them, or you know that you belong together after a single conversation. You may gravitate toward them without thinking because your souls are so entwined! Listen to your gut. Even if you know, rationally, that you’ve never met them before or don’t know them very well, your heart and natural instincts may reveal a profound connection with this person. Do other people pick up on what a great match you are together? When you meet your soulmate, you may find that others pick up on your bond and mention that you two look like you’re made for one another."

      "title": "You may be manifesting one another if all you do is think about them.",
      "content": "You may be manifesting one another if all you do is think about them. Does it feel like you just can’t get this person out of your head? You might catch yourself daydreaming about them, thinking up fun things for you to do together, or texting them to say something even though you just saw them an hour ago. Soulmates are so deeply connected that they often end up thinking about one another, even if it’s totally involuntary. [2] X Research source It may feel super distracting to have your soulmate on your mind all the time, but it’s also a strong sign that they’re thinking about you too. When the energy between you gets really intense, it may drown out other thoughts!"

    {
      "title": "Souls that connect in past lives remember each other in the present.",
      "content": "Souls that connect in past lives remember each other in the present. If you feel an inexplicable familiarity with them from the moment you meet, like you’ve known each other forever, it may be a sign that they’re your soulmate. [3] X Research source Kindred souls are thought to seek one another out across lives and timelines, so a feeling of intense yet comforting familiarity could be your soul telling you that it has found its match. If the two of you decide to see a psychic, they may be able to confirm that you’re soulmates. #*Of course, you also don’t need to do that—if you’re seeing the signs on your own and sensing a deep, powerful connection with them, that may be all the proof you need. It’s up to you!"

      "title": "Soulmates’ lives often align in small but meaningful ways.",
      "content": "Soulmates’ lives often align in small but meaningful ways. Even if you’re from a completely different background than your soulmate, you may find that the two of you have a lot in common when it comes to personal history. You might discover that your families had similar dynamics or issues, you both did similar activities, or you both suffered a similar kind of trauma as kids. [4] X Research source For example, when discussing your childhoods, you might find that both of you played soccer as kids or broke your legs at age 13. Remember that even soulmates don’t have everything in common, and that’s okay too! Look for the similarities in your pasts, but embrace your differences as well, and talk about them to better understand one another."

      "title": "Soulmates have a near-telepathic awareness of their emotions.",
      "content": "Soulmates have a near-telepathic awareness of their emotions. You may find that you’re always in tune with what the other is feeling, what kind of day they had, or what might be on their mind. You’re on the same emotional wavelength—and may even be able to finish each other’s sentences. Soulmates often don’t need words to express their feelings because they can intuitively sense one another’s moods. [5] X Research source You may also have a lot more empathy for them than you do other people. You feel what they’re feeling and influence each other’s emotions. Keep in mind that absorbing one another’s emotional energy isn’t always ideal. Be mindful and practice separating your emotions from theirs sometimes. For example, if your soulmate is feeling crabby, you may not want to pick up on that energy. Try cheering them up instead!"

      "title": "Soulmates often gravitate together physically like magnets.",
      "content": "Soulmates often gravitate together physically like magnets. Physical chemistry is also important for soulmates. [6] X Research source Pay attention to how your body feels when you’re near this person: does your stomach get butterflies? Does your chest or face feel warm and fuzzy? Does your heart skip a beat? You may even notice that the two of you share lots of intense, heated eye contact , which makes it hard to focus on anyone else. Locking eyes with your soulmate is thought to be an almost psychic experience. You may be able to interpret one another’s thoughts with a simple knowing look or make one another feel safe and comfortable with a loving gaze."

      "title": "Most soulmate connections have a higher purpose or lesson to impart.",
      "content": "Most soulmate connections have a higher purpose or lesson to impart. The most significant relationships in your life are the ones that push you to grow as a person in ways you might not otherwise. Therefore, the universe connects soulmates who can teach one another valuable life lessons. [7] X Research source Consider this person’s effect on your life: do they encourage you to be a better person and bring out the best in you? If so, they may be your soulmate. Your soulmate is also someone who won’t give up on you, even when you make mistakes, and you won’t give up on them, either. In short, the two of you are committed to helping one another grow!"

      "content": "Divine timing brings souls together when they need each other most. When you’re meant to be with someone, it’s believed that the universe makes that connection happen at the best (and easiest) time. [8] X Research source If you meet someone who you have an inexplicably intense connection with, and the timing lines up perfectly for the two of you to get close to one another and (hopefully) date, then you may be soulmates. For example, you might meet your soulmate as a different relationship is ending or right around the time that you feel ready to start dating and putting yourself out there emotionally. Essentially, if it’s meant to be, everything will fall into place. If it doesn’t fall into place, then it’s safe to assume you weren’t meant to be after all."

      "title": "Soulmates can be spiritual sidekicks who help you achieve your goals.",
      "content": "Soulmates can be spiritual sidekicks who help you achieve your goals. Essentially, your soulmate is—ideally—someone who can give you all the love and encouragement you need in life. [9] X Research source Does this person pump you up before important events or encourage you to apply to dream jobs when you feel unsure of yourself? Are they always ready with a supportive word for you? If so, they may be your soulmate. For example, a soulmate might pull out all the stops to help you prepare for a presentation at work, letting you practice your speech, giving advice—and, of course, reassuring you that you’re going to do an amazing job."

      "title": "Because they’re meant for one another, soulmates get along seamlessly.",
      "content": "Because they’re meant for one another, soulmates get along seamlessly. When you meet your soulmate, you may notice that arguments are fairly uncommon—and when you do argue, you work together to reach a solution rather than leaving the problem unresolved. As soulmates, you respect one another; you’re both devoted to understanding each other and settling disputes in a way that leaves both of you feeling satisfied. [10] X Research source Every couple has ups and downs, and soulmates are no exception. You may have to work through the odd problem in the long run, but at the beginning of your relationship, you might be surprised by how easygoing it is."

    {
      "title": "Most soulmates share a deep level of patience and understanding.",
      "content": "Most soulmates share a deep level of patience and understanding. Your soulmate is the kind of person who won’t try to change you; because your souls are spiritually bonded, it’ll feel like you have an innate understanding of one another. Around your soulmate, you’ll feel comfortable being yourself because you know they love you unconditionally for exactly who you are. [11] X Research source Unconditional love isn’t always a good thing—after all, partners shouldn’t be expected to put up with toxic behavior for the sake of unconditional love. However, true soulmates rarely encounter this problem; their deep understanding and acceptance of one another make them capable of sharing healthy unconditional love."

      "title": "You may feel instant harmony and peace when meeting your soulmate.",
      "content": "You may feel instant harmony and peace when meeting your soulmate. Souls with similar energies and vibrations are thought to be drawn to one another. When you meet your soulmate, you may feel instantly soothed without really knowing why, like there’s a sense of peace and happiness radiating out from your soul. This is a sign that you’ve met your perfect match, and your soul senses it! [12] X Research source In short, when your energies align with your soulmate’s, that immediate connection you share will give you all the peaceful, positive vibes! It feels good to be with them because they’re the person you’re meant to be with."

      "title": "True soulmates are always dear friends as well as lovers.",
      "content": "True soulmates are always dear friends as well as lovers. You might not fall right into a romantic relationship with your soulmate. It’s possible you may start dating soon after meeting, but also very likely that they’ll become your best friend before becoming your lover. Regardless, your soulmate is supposedly the one person you want to be around more than any other—so they’re best friends as well as lovers. [13] X Research source Pay attention to the way you act even after you start dating. Do you talk about everything and act like best friends as much as you do lovers? A soulmate is that special someone who knows you better than anyone."

      "title": "The universe connects souls with similar aspirations and desires.",
      "content": "The universe connects souls with similar aspirations and desires. You may find that you and your soulmate want the same things out of life when it comes to both short and long-term goals. [14] X Research source While the two of you are still separate people and personalities, if you’re soulmates, you’ll often discover that you naturally align in terms of your preferred lifestyle. For example, you may both want to get married and have four kids, or you may both dream of traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures. Whatever your preferred lifestyle, you shouldn’t have to compromise on your dreams to be together—which is why your soulmate's preferences will likely be a great match. In some instances, you might find that your soulmate ticks a lot of the boxes on this list but doesn’t have an identical lifestyle to yours. In that case, the universe may be trying to open you both up to a new and unexpected lifestyle!"

      "content": "Soulmates amplify and enhance one another’s energies. Basically, being together feels like a breath of fresh air! Their presence cheers you up and makes you want to be the best version of yourself. Think about it: when you see them after a long and exhausting day, how does it feel? Do you suddenly perk up and feel like you could take on the world all over again? If so, that’s what it feels like to be around a soulmate.

      "title": "It’s easy to be with a soulmate because your souls want to connect.",
      "content": "It’s easy to be with a soulmate because your souls want to connect. Think about how it feels to be around this person. Is it as effortless as breathing? [16] X Research source Does it feel like you can co-exist with them without any strain or second thoughts? If you and your soulmate are destined to be together, then being with them will often feel simple and comfortable no matter what. It may also be easy to make time for them in your schedule, even if you work very different hours or have busy social lives. When the universe is backing you up, it often feels like everything just falls into place for the two of you."

    {
      "title": "Soulmates rarely worry about filling silences with empty talk.",
      "content": "Soulmates rarely worry about filling silences with empty talk. When you fall silent after talking for a while, does the silence between you feel comfortable? Can you roll with it without needing to find something else to say? When you’re so comfortable with them that you can simply sit, relax, and enjoy being together in those moments of silence, that’s a strong sign you’ve met your soulmate. [17] X Research source It’s also a sign that you really trust one another. You aren’t afraid that silence is going to make things awkward or make your soulmate stop having fun with you. You love being around each other, even if you don’t have much to say!"

    {
      "title": "Soulmates usually meet at the same level of spiritual awakening.",
      "content": "Soulmates usually meet at the same level of spiritual awakening. It’s very rare to find soulmates who don’t agree on matters of religion or spirituality. If you’re an atheist, they probably are too. If you’re highly religious, they likely are as well. There may be slight differences in your beliefs, but overall, you’ll likely find that you and your soulmate are on the same page right from the start. [18] X Research source Remember that it’s never okay to force your ideas of spirituality on someone else. Even if you and your soulmate don’t totally believe in the same things, you can’t make one another change. Sometimes soulmates change their beliefs over time to better match one another, but that happens naturally of their own will—in other words, they don’t force it!"

      "title": "Intuition is an internal sense that can help you make wise decisions.",
      "content": "Intuition is an internal sense that can help you make wise decisions. At the end of the day, your intuition (or “gut feeling”) has your best interests at heart—so don’t ignore it! Let your intuition lead the way. When your gut tells you that you’ve found your soulmate, believe it because that means somewhere deep in your mind, you already know with certainty that it’s true. [19] X Research source Some people ignore their gut instincts because they feel that things must make logical sense to be right, but that’s not always the case. Sometimes, things don’t make sense. It’s impossible to get tangible proof that you’ve found your soulmate, but you don’t need that—because your intuition will tell you everything you need to know."

      "title": "Angel numbers and other personal signs may point to a soulmate.",
      "content": "Angel numbers and other personal signs may point to a soulmate. If you want to know whether you’ve found your soulmate, keep an eye out for signs in your everyday life. You may start seeing a particular angel number whenever you think of them, repeatedly hear a song that reminds you of them, or see a rainbow right when you ask for a sign. You never know when the universe might send you a message! [20] X Research source For example, you may see the 1010 angel number on a license plate or receipt. It’s believed that 1010 is a sign you’ve met your soulmate (or “twin flame”) without realizing it."
