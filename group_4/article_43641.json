Adams “Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.” – Benjamin Franklin “A good teacher is one who makes himself progressively unnecessary.” – Thomas Carruthers “A good teacher can inspire hope; ignite the imagination, and instil a love of learning.” – Brad Henry “Good teaching is more a giving of right questions than a giving of right answers.” – Josef Albers “All students can learn and succeed, but not in the same way and not in the same day.” – William G.
