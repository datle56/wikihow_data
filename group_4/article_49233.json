      "title": "Start with an open-ended question.",
      "content": "Start with an open-ended question . An open-ended question cannot be answered by “yes\" or \"no\" and it usually does not have right or wrong answers. [1] X Research source An open ended question is a good way to put the candidate at ease. You want your candidates to feel comfortable. And if a candidate feels comfortable that person is more likely to engage. [2] X Expert Source Shannon O'Brien, MA, EdM Life & Career Coach Expert Interview. 25 May 2021. Open-ended questions are also a good way for you to find out some basic qualifications of the candidate, and to get some cues as to what to ask next. Try for questions like: “Tell me about the relationships you’ve had with the people you’ve worked with. How would you describe the best ones? The worst?” This question will immediately give you a good idea of well the candidate might fit on a team in your workplace. Candidates typically don’t like to speak badly about coworkers or bosses, especially in an interview. This question lets you see how this person navigates those waters."

      "title": "Formulate questions that force your interviewee to express a knowledge of your company.",
      "content": "Formulate questions that force your interviewee to express a knowledge of your company. You want to make sure that your interviewee did homework and learned about your company. And you should want to find out if this person just learned facts, or really understands you. [3] X Research source Questions that ask the candidate to visualize being in the role of an existing employee will quickly show you how well this person knows your company. You might ask “Pitch [name of your company] to me as if I were buying your product or service.” This question will immediately show you how well this candidate knows what you do and if this person has the ability to speak with the company’s voice. [4] X Research source Depending on the position you’re hiring for, be lenient on how well the candidate pitches your company. If you’re hiring for an internal, non sales position, all you want to know is if your candidate did the homework. You could also ask “If we were to sit down a year from now, reflecting on your year with the company, what would you like to have achieved?” A question like this will allow you to gauge how well the candidate sees the bigger picture of the work you do, and that this person has not only done the homework, but is committed to being a part of the company. A question like this will help weed out candidates who just read the job description."

      "title": "Prepare to summarize a candidate’s answers and transition to the next question.",
      "content": "Prepare to summarize a candidate’s answers and transition to the next question. Repeating what the candidate just said will give you a second to digest the information and can allow you to press this person with your next question. You want to find out of the interviewee is actually knowledgable on the subject at hand. For instance, if a candidate said “I managed a large system implementation project when I was with my last company.” You could repeat the answer and move on to your next question which will both follow up and get more information about how this candidate would perform in your company. After you repeat the answer (you shouldn’t just repeat it word for word, paraphrase it) you could as ask “Could you tell me some of the key activities you were engaged in when you managed that project? And how do you think that experience would relate to this job?”"

    {
      "title": "Write questions that allow you to obtain basic qualifications.",
      "content": "Write questions that allow you to obtain basic qualifications. During your interview, you’ll want to gauge how well a person’s resume translates to real life. Have a list of questions that will give you an idea of the candidate’s basic skill level for the job. Ask the candidate to describe some basic responsibilities and functions of the job. Ask what the candidate might find challenging about the job. You want to have a list of basic questions that have a correct answer. For example, if your candidate listed Adobe Photoshop as a skill, you may ask how long this person has been using Photoshop. Or, if you know Photoshop and know that using it is part of the job, you may ask a specific question related to using the program. You might ask “If I needed to create a banner and wanted to place a picture of someone’s body from another photo onto the banner, how would I do that?” If the candidate can clearly explain the process and use the right terms, you know this person possess a certain skill level."

      "title": "Write questions that challenge your candidates.",
      "content": "Write questions that challenge your candidates. You want to formulate questions that will allow you to see how the candidate performs under pressure and give you information on this person’s ability in the role. You may want to ask something simple yet potentially challenging at first like “Is it better to be perfect and late, or good and on time?” The candidate’s answer will show you what kind of employee this person is. It will also show you how well the candidate knows your company, depending on your answer to the question. [5] X Research source Ask the candidate about a time this person screwed up, and how the candidate fixed the problem. This is an old and good interview question. You’ll get to see how self-aware the candidate is and this person's problem-solving skills."

      "title": "Ask conversational and open ended questions.",
      "content": "Ask conversational and open ended questions. Test soft skills. You’ll want to know about a candidate’s personality, dedication, loyalty, communication skills, etc. These are the so called “soft skills” for the job. When writing interview questions, you’ll want to create your questions so that there’s an ebb and flow to the interview. Your first questions are meant to ease the candidate into the interview and allow you to gain knowledge on this person’s history. Then you want to have questions that tell you about a candidate’s actual skill level for the job. Now you’ll want to ease back up. write down a few questions to pick from during the interview that allows you to see this person’s personality. Feel free to have a list of questions to pick from that don’t even have much to do with the actual job. You could ask “Who is the smartest person you know personally? Why?” A question like this will test the candidate’s values and aspirations. Having the candidate explain why the person is so smart will give you an idea of how this person perceives others. Ask the candidate “What is something you’d be happy doing every day for the rest of your career?” This will let you find out what makes this person happy at work. If the answer is boilerplate you know that this person isn’t going to be very happy. If the answer is thought out and applies to the job, you know you could have someone who would be loyal to you. Consider asking “If you worked with us, were paid the salary you wanted, and loved everything about your job, what kind of offer from another company would you consider?” This question will give you insight into what the candidate values. Depending on the answer you’ll know if the candidate can be bought. Or if this person values loving the work and the company."

      "title": "Prepare a few experience-based questions.",
      "content": "Prepare a few experience-based questions. Depending on the answers to previous questions, you may have good knowledge of the candidate’s past experiences. But it’s a good idea to write a few questions you can throw in to find out a little more. You may ask the candidate to “Discuss a specific accomplishment you’ve achieved in a previous position that indicates you’ll thrive in this position.” Someone’s past performance will be a good indicator of future success with you. Ask the candidate about a time when this person succeeded professionally but didn’t like the experience and wouldn’t want to do it again. This kind of question will let you know how the candidate will act when getting the job done isn’t always fun. And it will let you see if this person understands the value of certain roles or functions."

      "title": "Conclude the interview.",
      "content": "Conclude the interview. When writing interview questions, plan to leave time at the end to let the interviewee ask questions. The questions a candidate asks will be very valuable.

Then explain your next steps and when you’ll be in touch."

This question shouldn’t be challenging and let the person brag a little about the work. Throw it away.

Whether you’re reporting or doing an informational interview with someone who works somewhere you want to. You want to create a dialogue, this means questions that don’t let the interviewee simply answer “yes” or “no” will help you. You can ask questions like “What was your favorite part of …” asking what this person person liked or didn’t like about the subject you’re interviewing for will give you insightful information to go on. Depending on the context of the interview, you may want to press this person a bit. You don’t have to be mean, but if you are interviewing for an article, you want to know all you can. When writing your questions, find a quote from the interviewee. Then create a question that lets you ask “You said [quote]. Why do you believe this to be true?”"

      "content": "Ask a reflection question. You’ll want to learn how this person thinks and what this person values. Parrot your subject and repeat phrases. Questions that make your interviewee look back and share a story or example are great to keep things going and give you useful information. When writing your questions, see if you can find any information on your interviewees career path. You can use what you find to steer the conversation during the interview and then ask “What were some of the unexpected hurdles? What about benefits?” You can also ask a question that has the person looking back. “Looking back at where you started this journey, where did you think you would end up?”"

If you know the answer to certain questions, you might not need to ask these specific ones during an interview. When writing your interview questions, consider forming a few that are similar to ones you can answer but might earn a different response based on the phrasing.

When writing your interview questions, see if you can find anything about your subject that you can use to get a feeling-based response. Did this person publish a book that didn’t sell well? Did your subject face constant rejection and setbacks before succeeding? If you can’t find anything, be prepared to formulate a question on the spot during the interview. Use what’s been discussed in the interview and write down this new question quickly so you don’t forget. Make sure to ask “why” and “how”. ”Why did you feel like you would never reach your goal?” “What motivated you to keep trying when you hit speed bumps?” “How do you feel about that experience now?”"

If you notice that you’re writing a lot of the same questions, you may want to search for one that’s different. Your curve ball question doesn’t have to be an attacking question on your subject.
