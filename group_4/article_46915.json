You can be charged with disorderly conduct if you are seen peeing or defecating in public places including public parks or public waterways. [1] X Research source In some very rare cases, urinating or defecating in public places can result in charges like indecent exposure or public lewdness, which can result in registering as a sex offender for the rest of your life. [2] X Research source Of course, there are circumstances when hiking or camping where you must relieve yourself even on public land. It is vitally important that you use common sense and ensure that you are in a relatively secluded area when you relieve yourself outdoors."

      "content": "Leave no trace. The ethical and responsible way to enjoy the great outdoors is by leaving no trace of your presence there after you've left. Not only does this mean leaving wildlife alone and not destroying natural landmarks, it also means leaving no trace that you've relieved yourself. This means you will need to properly bury your own fecal waste."

      "title": "Come prepared.",
      "content": "Come prepared. If you will be spending time outdoors camping, hiking, or picnicking, plan on the fact that you and your friends will need to relieve yourselves at some point in the outing. You will need a small trowel or hand shovel for digging a hole to bury feces, a roll of toilet paper, and a plastic bag to cart out used toilet paper when you leave. You will also need waterless hand sanitizer or biodegradable soap and water. Soap and water are always preferable."

      "content": "Know the local regulations. Some places have a pack-it-out policy where everything (including solid human waste) must be disposed of outside of the park. Some places require that you pack out your toilet paper. Others let you bury both waste and toilet paper in your cathole."

      "title": "Remember hygiene practices in advance.",
      "content": "Remember hygiene practices in advance. Because hand sanitizer and soap are going to have to get stored with the rest of your gear, you don't want to have to touch them with a dirty hand - for your sake but also the health of anyone else sharing them. You can either use exclusively one hand to do your bathroom business and then use the other to handle the hand sanitizer (in which case you may want to open the bottle in advance) or ask a friend for help - find the soap and say something like \"Hey! I'm going to go use the bathroom. Can you help me pour some water on my hands when I get back?\" Remember that soap and water are better than hand sanitizer, and good scrubbing is required either way. And you definitely want to know where they're located before your hands are contaminated."

      "title": "Choose your location.",
      "content": "Choose your location. Because you have to be discreet and also have a place to bury your feces that is sanitary, you need to keep the following guidelines in mind before you squat: Choose a place that is well hidden from passersby, preferably with the cover of trees. Choose a place that is at least 200 feet away from water sources like lakes or streams, and away from campsites or other places where other people are likely to discover it. Try to find a place with soft soil for digging."

      "title": "Dig a cathole.",
      "content": "Dig a cathole. A cathole is a small hole for defecating, similar to how cats dig a hole prior to defecating in the wild. Using the trowel or hand shovel that you brought with you, dig a hole six inches deep and about four to six inches wide. It needs to be big enough to be a target as you squat above it, and also deep enough that animals will stay out. For many trowels, a good rule of thumb is \"As deep as the blade of the trowel and with an equal diameter.\""

While you might have seen people in movies using leaves for wiping, unless you have a thorough knowledge of local vegetation, don't try this yourself. You might end up with a blistering rash in the worst possible place. Then, dispose of the toilet paper in your preferred manner, in accordance with local regulations: Put your used toilet paper in the plastic bag you've brought with you, then seal it and put it in another plastic bag to conceal the smell. Take it all out with you and dispose of it when you find a trash can, or when you get home. Avoid burying your toilet paper to leave as little impact on the environment as possible."

Cover your feces with the soil that you dug out of your cathole, then cover it with sticks, leaves, or rocks to disguise it. This also helps keep animals away. You should ideally move the dirt back with your hand to avoid contaminating your trowel, but if you choose to use the trowel, remember that it is not allowed to touch the contents of your cathole. the trowel must remain clean for future use."

If you have enough time and privacy, it's better to remove pants and underwear completely, just in case of urine dribbles. Set your pants and underwear on a dry spot on the ground or a nearby bush. Don't put them too close to you or you may soil them."

You might be used to squatting on the balls of your feet, with your feet close together, but this position is very unstable and hard on the knees. Squatting with feet hip-width or shoulder-width apart and with your feet flat is easier to hold for an extended period of time. If you're wearing pants, be careful not to let things fall out of your pocket as you squat."

Tampons, pads, and their associated packaging cannot be disposed of in outhouses, and cannot be buried in catholes like feces. Put the used products in the bag you brought for this purpose and dispose of it in a trashcan later. The associated clean packaging can be kept with your other trash or in the same bag as used products. Put menstrual cup contents into a cathole or outhouse. Dispose of contents of menstrual cups the same way you are handling poop - either buried six inches deep or in an outhouse. When you rinse it, use only water that is clean enough that you would drink it. Do not use untreated water - it would be better to empty it and reinsert without rinsing at all. Rinse reusable pads well and let them dry if possible. Keep them somewhere they won't stay soaking wet if possible, and if not put them in a plastic bag and clean them when you return from the outdoors later."
