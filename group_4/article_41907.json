      "title": "Curtain hair is long on top of your head and shorter on the sides.",
      "content": "Curtain hair is long on top of your head and shorter on the sides. The longer hair drapes elegantly around your face—which is why it's called \"curtains.\" Ask for a curtain haircut at the barber's, with the longer hair reaching the tip of your nose and the shorter hair underneath cut to 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. [1] X Research source To style, blow-dry while brushing your hair away from your face like you're slicking it back. Once your hair is partially dry, part it down the middle with a wide-tooth comb and finish drying, pulling the hair up with your brush to give it a natural lift. If you have straight hair, you won't need any products for this natural-looking hairstyle. If your hair tends to be frizzy , apply a fingertip amount of styling cream to complete the look. When your hair is damp, rub the cream in your hands and rake your fingers through your hair, spreading it from the roots to the tips."

      "content": "An undercut gives the classic middle-part style a modern twist. Ask the barber for curtain bangs with an undercut beneath them. That means instead of short 1 inch (2.5 cm) hair beneath the curtains, your hair will be shaved back even further in a partial buzz cut. [2] X Research source Blow-dry your hair the same way you'd do for a basic curtain cut, by brushing and drying towards the back of your head. Then add 3 to 5 pumps of sea salt spray to finish the look, working the spray in from root to tip with your fingers. This is a flattering look for most hair types since the undercut allows your curtain bangs to be the star of the show. You can also choose a high, medium, or low undercut. A high undercut means more hair will be cut short, leaving the longer hair at the top of your head, whereas a low undercut means more of your hair will hang down in curtains."

      "content": "A windy fade gives you tons of volume and style at the same time. Ask the barber for a low fade, curtain fringe, and middle part. You'll have long hair on top of your head reaching to your ears and sides shaved progressively shorter until skin is visible. To achieve the windswept look, use 3 to 5 pumps of sea salt spray , working it fully into your hair with your fingers. Tease the long hair on top of your head, separating it into bunches and lightly combing each one backward from mid-shaft to root. Finally, spritz it with hairspray to hold everything in place. You don't have to start at the roots when teasing your hair; just ruffle the hair loosely to make it seem larger. This particular style works best with straight or wavy hair! If you're unsure of the difference between an undercut and fade, the undercut isn't as short as the fade overall. Fades get gradually shorter until the hairline disappears, whereas the undercut is uniformly short. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Combed-back hair will give you a clean, put-together look. Start by getting a curtain cut and faded sides at the barber. Then, wash your hair and dry it partially with a towel, styling while it's still damp. [4] X Research source Part your hair down the center as usual and take a nickel-sized amount of matte pomade on your fingers, working it evenly through your hair. Finally, use a wide-tooth comb to slick back the hair on either side of your head. This style is a variation of the classic curtain bangs haircut, handy when you want to polish your look for special occasions."

      "title": "Wavy hair with a fringe shapes your face and gives you a relaxed look.",
      "content": "Wavy hair with a fringe shapes your face and gives you a relaxed look. Ask the barber for a curtain fringe if you have naturally wavy hair and decide if you want a short or medium-length cut. The longest part of your hair should reach your ears with a short cut, while your hair needs to be chin-length for a medium cut. Cover all of your hair with 3 to 5 pumps of sea salt spray and run your fingers through it to give your hair a beachy, tousled feel. [5] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a leave-in conditioner instead of sea salt spray to tame unruly or frizzy hair. Let your hair dry on its own once you've sprayed and shaped it."

      "content": "Bobs are a fantastic gender-neutral cut and an iconic style. Male bobs typically work best with straight or slightly wavy hair, though curly hair can work with a little extra product. Make sure your hair is long enough to reach the bottom of your chin when you ask your barber for a bob. At home, spread a dime-sized dollop of texturizing putty into your damp hair and creating the center part with a wide-tooth comb. [6] X Research source If you have curly or wavy hair, you can let it dry naturally. If you have straight hair, blow-dry it by brushing your hair while angling the hair dryer up and drying from underneath each bunch of hair. This gives your hair extra volume and lift!"

      "content": "Long bangs with curly or wavy hair give you a laid-back summer vibe. Get longer curtain fringe at the barber—the longest hair will fall naturally around the bottom of your ears. When styling at home, rub anti-frizz oil onto your palms and then press it into your hair, running your hands through every area you want to protect from frizz. After that, let your curls dry naturally for a loose, effortless, breezy look. [7] X Research source When growing your hair for this look, keep in mind that it needs to be long enough to reach past your ears even when curled—and not when your hair is lying flat because it's wet."

      "content": "Ask for a blunt cut if you're looking for a sophisticated style. A blunt cut features an undercut on the sides of your head to make the stark, straight line at the ends of the longer hair on the top of your head stand out. Polish off the look with matte pomade ; scoop a dollop onto your fingers and run it through your hair, working the paste in until it's no longer visible. [8] X Research source The sleek blunt cut works best with straight hair. If you have wavy or curly hair and want a blunt look, consider straightening your hair before styling it!"

      "content": "E-boy cuts are the slicked-back, textured version of curtain bangs. Ask your barber for the eboy cut, featuring long hair on top of the head falling around the ears and shorter hair on the sides of your head. When you get it, style your new hairdo with hair gel ; scoop a dime-sized amount in your hand and spread it all over your hair with your fingers. [9] X Research source Leave the fringe and middle part alone but pull the rest of your hair back to look sleek and neat. While typically sleek and straight, you can work the eboy style no matter your hair's shape and texture. Straight, wavy, and curly hair all looks good with this cut since the eboy's curtain fringe is more uneven and textured."

      "title": "A middle part with long, layered hair is simple yet versatile.",
      "content": "A middle part with long, layered hair is simple yet versatile. Ask your barber for long layers and make sure your hair is grown out to at least shoulder length for this cut—though it can be as long as you want. Maintenance is simple: blow-dry your hair after washing and use a wide-tooth comb to part your hair down the middle. Apply sea salt spray and rub a dollop of styling cream evenly through your hair to complete the look. Both products help you control your long hair. Sea salt spray gives it extra volume, while the styling cream makes it easier to shape your hair any way you like it. Long hair is flattering with a middle part; you can sport this style if your hair is straight, wavy, curly, thick, or thin. Your hair will look great when you wear it totally down, and you can easily brush it aside or tuck it behind your ears when you need to. Blow-dry from the roots of your hair to the tips, using your fingers to shift your hair and pull it closer to the dryer as needed."

      "title": "Braids",
      "content": "Braids are a great way to show off natural hair. Other braid styles can be worn regardless of your hair type, framing your face and emphasizing your features. Ask the barber for cornrow or box braids with a middle part if you have natural hair. If you have straight or wavy hair, part your hair and then tie it back in a single loose braid or two pigtail braids at home. Keep in mind that in general, cornrow braids do not last long in comparison to box braids, unless they are very small and tight (which is not good for your hair). Cornrows are hard to make on short hair unless they are super small. But if you have short hair, you can get extension cornrows, dread extensions or box braids to style in a bun if you find a braider that can braid short hair. Not only do braids look good, but they're also a handy way to protect your hair. They keep the hair healthy for longer, preventing damage and breakage. To care for natural braided hair, cover your braids with a dollop of leave-in conditioner , rubbing it into your braids until it's not visible. Do this on days that you don't wash your hair in the shower to keep your hair healthy and hydrated for longer periods!"

      "title": "Hair twists",
      "content": "Hair twists create a striking look and protect natural hair from breakage. If your hair has some length ask for hair twists with a middle part. Once completed, the twists can then hang around your face to emphasize your features or be pulled up on either side of your head when you need them clear of your eyes. Rub leave-in conditioner into each of your twists, focusing attention on the ends of your hair, and wash them every 3 days. [10] X Research source Just like natural hair in braids, apply the conditioner on days you don't wash your hair in the shower. When you wash your twists, wet them with warm water in the shower and scrub shampoo into your scalp, letting the shampoo trickle down into them as you rinse your head with water. Stop rinsing once the shampoo is all gone. Hair twists also take less time to complete than more intricate braids!"
