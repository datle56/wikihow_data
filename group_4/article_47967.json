      "content": "MB typically means “My Bad” when sent over chat. Maybe your friend mixed up the dates for an upcoming event, or assumed something that they shouldn’t have. For minor mix-ups and confusion, MB is an easy way to apologize without making a big deal out of the situation.

      "content": "MB usually stands for “megabyte.” A megabyte is a digital unit of measurement for data. A lot of times, MB is used to describe how much data a device can hold. In other instances, it can stand for download speed. For reference, a MB has 1 million bytes, a gigabyte (GB) holds 1,000 MBs, and a terabyte (TB) holds 1,000 GBs.

      "content": "Mb can also be short for “megabit.” A megabit is also a digital unit of measurement for data, but it’s way smaller than a megabyte—in fact, 8 megabits can fit in a single megabyte! To help differentiate the two, a megabyte is abbreviated as MB (all capitalized) and a megabit is abbreviated as Mb (with the “b” lowercase). [4] X Research source"
