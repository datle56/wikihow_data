Other varieties may shoot a stream of water to discourage the dog, though these may not be as desirable for use indoors. [3] X Research source Consider clicker training as well. Clickers can help your dog understand commands more quickly as well as get their attention quickly.

Never use crates as punishmentâ€”dogs should only be crated if they are comfortable and happy there. You can encourage your dog to be comfortable in his crate by feeding him his meals in it and leaving its door open all the time so that he can go in and out as he pleases when you're home."
