      "content": "Blow your nose sparingly . Your natural instinct may be to blow your nose when it feels blocked, but the jury's still out on whether this is actually a good idea or not. Some studies have shown that forcefully blowing your nose can actually lead to a build-up of pressure and trapped mucus in your sinuses, which may become infected. [2] X Research source On the other hand, some experts claim that it is important to blow your nose when you're suffering from a cold, as this rids the body of surplus mucus, helping you to decongest. [3] X Research source As a compromise, try to only blow your nose when absolutely necessary. Whatever you believe, make sure to blow your nose gently to avoid excess pressure and use the recommended blowing method, which involves pressing one nostril shut with your finger, while blowing very gently to clear the other, then repeating on the other side. [3] X Research source You should avoid sniffing and snuffling as much as possible, as this only draws the mucus back into your head. [3] X Research source If you have to be out of the house, be prepared and carry a handkerchief or tissues at all times. You should always wash your hands after blowing your nose to prevent spreading the cold virus. Frequent blowing can irritate your skin - use some soft, good quality handkerchiefs to avoid irritating your skin. Use moisturizer on your nose if you need to. Avoid using paper tissues or Kleenex; they irritate your nose more than cloth handkerchiefs."

      "content": "Drink honey and lemon tea. This is a simple yet effective cold relief remedy that has been around for a long time. To make the honey and lemon tea, boil some water, pour it into a mug, stir in 1 1 ⁄ 2 tablespoons (22.2 ml) of lemon juice and two teaspoons of honey. The honey will help soothe your sore throat, while the lemon helps to clear up a blocked nose. The vitamin C is also good for fighting infections generally. The tea should take effect immediately and should ease cold symptoms for at least a few hours. For optimum feel-good factor, drink this tea while curled up in a comfy chair in front of a roaring fire. You will feel a lot better very soon. Nasal virus thrives in cool temperatures, which is why they thrive in your nose out in the cold air or wind. Studies in Israel showed that breathing warm air reduced cold symptoms. Holding a warm hand over a cold nose for half an hour, breathing through the mouth, can also give the cold-loving virus a set-back."

      "title": "Use a nasal decongestant.",
      "content": "Use a nasal decongestant. Nasal decongestants can provide immediate relief from congestion, by reducing inflammation of the nasal passages and slowing mucus production. Nasal decongestants are available in both tablet and sprays and are sold over-the-counter at most pharmacies. [4] X Research source Just be aware that overuse of nasal decongestant sprays (over 3 to 5 days) can actually worsen mucus production, potentially trapping bacteria. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Flush out your sinuses",
      "content": "Flush out your sinuses . One treatment for nasal decongestion which has become very popular in recent years is the practice of flushing out the sinuses with a Neti pot. The Neti pot contains a saline solution which is poured in one nostril and out the other. This thins the mucus in the nasal passages, allowing it to be flushed away. The saline solution can be purchased at most drug stores, or you can make your own nasal saline solution . To use a Neti pot, lean over a sink and tilt your head to one side. Insert the spout of the pot into the nearest nostril and pour in the saline solution. The salty water should flow in one nostril and out the other. By reclining and tipping your head back, it can flow into sinuses too. Once the water stops dripping, gently blow your nose, then repeat on the other side. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Take an expectorant. Consider taking an expectorant medication which helps to clear decongestion by thinning mucous and loosening phlegm, freeing up your airways and allowing you to breathe more easily. [7] X Research source Expectorants come in liquid, powder and capsule form and are available over-the-counter. Side effects of expectorants include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and vomiting. If you experience any of these symptoms you should contact your doctor immediately. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Use essential oils . Essential oils such as peppermint, eucalyptus, clove, and tea tree oil can help to clear the nasal passages and make breathing easier. There are several ways you can use essential oils. One way is to add a drop or two of your chosen essential oil to a bowl of warm water. Soak a clean facecloth in the water, wring it out, then use it to cover your face and let it sit there for a couple of minutes. Try to inhale deeply and you should feel a noticed improvement in your breathing in just a couple of minutes. You can also mix a drop or two of essential oil into a little petroleum jelly to make your own vapor rub to massage onto your chest or feet before bed. Alternatively, you can add a drop or two to your pajamas or to a hot bath, making it easy to inhale the vapors."

      "title": "Take some time off.",
      "content": "Take some time off. Try taking two to three days off from school or work. This helps limit other people's exposure to the virus and also helps you conserve energy to fight off the illness. Staying at home will save you the discomfort of being sick in a place of productivity and give you easy access to all the blankets, hot drinks and other comforts that you'll need to get well again. Also there's less chance of you catching any other illnesses, which is especially important when your immune system has already taken a blow."

      "content": "Visit your doctor. Try telling your doctor about your problem and ask about any medication for you to take. If they offer medicine, be sure to take it on the prescribed basis (most often this will be daily or twice-daily). Specialists for medication will help. They do not offer medicine for all things, usually a cold will go away within 3-7 days. If it is over 7 days, visit your local doctor."

      "content": "Drink enough warm fluids. Staying hydrated will reduce the effects of many symptoms such as headaches and sore throat, while also preventing dehydration. Hot teas and soups are a good way to increase your liquid intake, while also helping to relieve sinus congestion and reduce inflammation in the nose and throat. [8] X Research source Drink enough fluids to quench thirst. Getting enough fluids when you're sick is important, but getting too many may actually force your liver and kidney to work overtime in order to process it. Drink a little more than normal when you're sick, but don't feel like you need to drink 12 or 15 glasses a day. A good indication that you are drinking enough fluids is that your urine will be almost clear. [9] X Research source The deeper yellows imply higher concentrations of waste in your body that are not dissolving and diluting enough - so raise your fluid intake. Avoid coffee at all costs. It contains caffeine that can run your body into even deeper symptoms of a cold."

      "content": "Get extra rest. Your body needs all of its resources to fight the cold virus. [10] X Research source If you do not give your body the rest it needs, you will do nothing but make yourself feel worse. Take frequent naps and don't overexert yourself with physical activity. Try to keep your head raised while sleeping, as this will assist with the drainage of your nasal passages. [3] X Research source Try propping your head up with an extra pillow or cushion in bed - even if it feels a little strange. If your head feels like it's at a funny angle, try placing the second pillow between the sheet and the mattress, or under the mattress itself, so it feels less noticeable."

      "content": "Gargle with warm salt water and baking soda. Gargling salt water helps to moisten the throat and fight infection, as salt is a natural antiseptic. Try adding a teaspoon of salt to a glass of warm water and stir to dissolve. You can add a little baking soda to help take the \"zing\" from the salt away. Gargle this solution up to four times a day to temporarily relieve a sore throat . [11] X Research source Just make sure the water is not too salty or that you don't do this too often or it could dry out your throat and make symptoms worse. If it's too salty, it will really hurt delicate membranes, your clue to add more water to the mix. Some pain, about as much as getting any water up your nose, is to be expected."

[12] X Research source This is especially helpful if your nasal passages or throat are dry and irritated. Keep in mind that although humidifiers might help soothe your throat, they probably don't help relieve cold symptoms or shorten the duration of the cold. Some studies have suggested that humidifiers and vaporizers may do more harm than good. That's because humidifiers can spread pathogens, mold, and toxins, in addition to causing nasty burns. Use your own judgement to decide if using a humidifier is right for you. [13] X Research source"

Wear plenty of layers during the day and cover up with extra blankets when sleeping or resting in bed or on the sofa. Staying warm will not get rid of a cold, but it will help you to feel more comfortable. It is a long-standing idea that you can \"sweat out a cold\", but there is little scientific evidence to back this up.

      "content": "Take over-the-counter cold remedies. These medicines cannot cure a cold, but they can certainly help to relieve symptoms such as headaches, congestion, fever and sore throat. Just be aware that all over-the-counter cold medications have common side effects including nausea, upset stomach, and dizziness. Make sure that you understand the risks associated with any medication you take and consult your doctor if you are currently taking prescription medications for other conditions. Analgesics (painkillers), including acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen, may be helpful if your cold is accompanied by muscle aches, headaches or fever. [14] X Research source Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers because it is linked to Reye's syndrome. [15] X Research source Antihistamines are a common ingredient in many OTC cold and allergy medications, and help to control runny nose and watery eyes. Cough suppressants, also known as antitussives, stop the body's reflex to cough. Only take them when your cough is dry and non-productive. [16] X Research source A productive cough that helps your body eliminate mucus is good and should not be suppressed. Do not give OTC cough medications to children under 4 years old. Only take over-the-counter medications that contain decongestants if your nasal passage is swollen, making it hard to breathe. They shrink the blood vessels in your nose to open your airway. Antihistamines can make you more comfortable, and will also make you drowsy so you sleep better while ill. Thin the mucus from your cold with an expectorant so that you can cough it out if it is too thick or heavy to move."
