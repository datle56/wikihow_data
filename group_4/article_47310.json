Professional dog groomer Terryl Daluz recommends giving your dog a lot of praise and yummy treats as you move them to the bathroom or another comfortable place so that they have a positive experience while they’re being groomed and cleaned. [1] X Expert Source Terryl Daluz Owner, Wash My Dog Pet Grooming Expert Interview. 18 February 2020. Spot-cleaning means you’ll just wash the affected area rather than giving your dog a complete bath. It works best if your dog rolled in dried poop or has it stuck to the fur around their bum. If your dog is really messy, like from having diarrhea for example, it’s probably best to give them a full bath. You may be able to brush out some of the poop before washing your dog. If there are large pieces that may make a mess in your house, take your dog outside and use a pet brush to loosen and remove as much as possible."
