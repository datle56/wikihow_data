      "title": "Phrase your question clearly and in a positive way.",
      "content": "Phrase your question clearly and in a positive way. Align your question with a positive outcome and be sure it is detailed and specific. When asking about love , instead of saying, “Will he leave me,” try something more specific like “Will he stay with me after I graduate next year?” This is, of course, if you consider his “staying with you” a positive outcome. Refine your question as much as possible so there isn’t any room for interpretation or vague answers. [1] X Research source Mention a time frame in your question that goes beyond “in the future.” Most “in the future” questions will end up with “yes” as an answer, but the more specific you are time-wise, the clearer an answer you’ll get. For example: “Will I move to a new city by the end of this summer?” “Will my marketing business be successful by the end of the coming year?” Avoid yes and no questions that involve “should,” as it asks for permission to act. It’s preferable to remain objective after considering you have; no one can give you permission to do anything. [2] X Research source Avoid: “Should I ask Jeffrey out on a date?” Instead: “Will Jeffrey and I go out on a date during the summer?” Astrologer Susan Levitt mentions the issue of wanting to ask too many questions at once about a partner. “Do they like me? Will we be together? How do we meet? What do you think? It's like 10 questions—it really comes down to relationship dynamics. Get down to what is the core essential issue.” She emphasizes asking one focused question to narrow down your intent. For example: “Will going on a date with Katie this weekend lead to a romantic relationship for us?” “Will passing my bar exam in February lead to my first job as a lawyer before Spring?”"

      "content": "Shuffle the cards to include both upright and reversed cards. Set up the cards by first cutting the deck, turn the cards 180 degrees from top to bottom, and then reshuffle them. Repeat this process to ensure you end up with a tarot card deck of both upright and reversed cards. Focus on your question as you shuffle the cards. [3] X Research source If you prefer you are able to shuffle the tarot cards using an overhand style by picking up small batches of cards from the top and adding them to the bottom of the deck. The riffle shuffle style involves cutting the cards in half and using both your thumbs to interleave the two halves of the cards together. Take a moment to imbue the new set of cards with your energy, especially before asking a yes/no question. Spiritual advisor Emily Christensen says that “when you first get a tarot deck, make sure you start off with it being tuned to you. The only reason that it's recommended you clear your cards is so that they stay tuned to you.”"

      "content": "Spread the cards face down and draw a single card. First, refer to the yes or no tarot cards list to tell you whether the card drawn from the spread is a yes, no, or maybe/neutral card (unless you’ve pre-determined what the cards mean intuitively). Then, determine whether the card is upright or reversed. An alternative tarot reading method is a 3-card draw. Select card 1 and place it face down, followed by a 2nd and 3rd card (one placed on each side of the original). If all 3 cards indicate a “yes,” the answer is likely to be positive If you get 2 “yes” cards and one “no” or “maybe” card, consider this a \"yes\" or \"very likely.\" If you pull 2 “no” cards and 1 “yes” or “maybe” card, the answer is “no\" or \"very unlikely.\" [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Interpret the card while taking its position into consideration. Generally speaking, when a tarot card is upright, it indicates a “yes” or positive answer; when it’s reversed (upside down), it indicates “no” or a negative answer. [5] X Research source Many cards are already associated with “yes,” “no,” and “maybe,” so it’s best to first check a list of tarot cards and their yes/no meanings. Keep in mind that “yes” or “no” often includes layers of meaning and interpretation. Your question may be about whether your business idea will succeed. If you receive a “no,” it may feel negative, but examine the card closely to understand the reasoning. For example, the Ace of Swords means you have the mind for success, but you may be missing the material resources necessary for success. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Draw another card to have more clarity. Once you’ve interpreted the first card, you can draw a 2nd card to gain more understanding; drawing a 2nd card is not required, but it’s an option if you feel you want to explore the nuances of the original answer. Using the scenario above about your business succeeding, if you first drew the Ace of Swords and then asked, “Do I currently have everything needed for my business to succeed?, and you draw the Ace of Pentacles as your 2nd card, it can indicate that you’re currently financially secure enough to have a successful business."

Pull another card for further clarity and ask a follow-up question. Some possible scenarios follow ahead: [9] X Research source Scenario 1: Eight of Wands The answer is yes . If you’re willing to stick with it and persevere, the company will prove to be a good fit for you. You’ll experience quick progress that ultimately leads to exciting new opportunities. If you then ask, “Will I flourish at [company name],” and your follow-up card is the High Priestess, it indicates a conditional yes (if upright), which means you might need further reflection. Scenario 2: Three of Wands The answer is yes . The new company presents new opportunities for your career path to grow even more than you originally thought. If you then ask, “Will I flourish at [company name],” and your follow-up card is the 8 of Pentacles, it indicates a yes (if upright) but puts the focus on learning new skills, working hard, and dealing with a very demanding job. Scenario 3: Eight of Cups The answer is no . Better opportunities can be found elsewhere. No matter how drawn you are to the current company’s prospects, you’ll succeed more in a new situation, so it’s time to keep moving. If you then ask, “Will I flourish at [company name],” and your follow-up card is the Devil, it indicates a “no,” which means that getting the job could lead to negative consequences. Scenario 4: The Hanged Man The answer is maybe . The Hanged Man is a sign to step back from your career decision to listen to your inner voice. Don’t let others influence your decision; only you know what’s best for you. Consider the theme of sacrifice and whether it’s something you’re willing to undergo. If you then ask, “Will I flourish at [company name],” and your follow-up card is the 6 of Swords, it indicates a “maybe” that leans towards “yes,” but involves being able to move forward and embrace change."

Many tarot card readers feel that a yes or no answer is limiting because a traditional tarot card reading looks beneath situations, while a yes or no reading examines one question in particular.

Generally speaking, pentacles tarot cards often point to the idea of “not now” or “maybe.” For example, asking if you’ll get a particular job may provide a “not now,” meaning it’s still possible you’ll get this job at a later date. The Five of Pentacles is typically a “no,” but as with every tarot card reading, each interpretation is unique and can be approached using multiple angles. [13] X Research source"
