After finding a place near your desk to put the tower, you will need to connect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse, as well as plug the tower into a power source. These are the only things required to be connected to the computer in order to use it. You can add more peripherals and accessories later. If you are using a new laptop , you will have significantly less to set up. Plug your laptop into a power source to ensure that it is charged, and then press the power button to turn it on."

Go to source When creating any type of account, you'll need to come up with a strong password to protect your personal information. Even if you're the only one who will be using the computer, you'll still want to protect it with a password to prevent hackers and thieves from accessing your data. If you're aren't asked to set up a new account, you may already have an account on the computer. If the computer is at your workplace or school, you'll usually be assigned a username and password by your administrator.

Your desktop appears every time you log into your account, and contains icons and shortcuts to your programs and files. The desktop will look and function differently depending on which operating system (such as Windows or macOS) you're using: If you're using Windows 10, you'll have a horizontal bar at the bottom of the screen—this is called the Taskbar, and it's where you'll find the Windows Start menu (sometimes just called the \"Windows menu\" or \"Start menu.\" This icon looks like a flag made of 4 small squares, and it'll be at the bottom-left corner of the screen. Click this icon to find the applications (apps) on your computer. Windows 8 has replaced the Start menu with the Start screen. It functions much the same way, but is fundamentally different in the way it displays information. If you have a Mac, you'll see a horizontal bar with icons at the bottom-center part of the screen. This is called the Dock, and it's where you'll find your apps, folders, files, and quick shortcuts. To find your apps, click the Launchpad icon on the Dock—this looks like a rocket on some Macs, and like 9 multicolored squares on others. Also on your Mac is the menu bar, which is the horizontal bar running along the top of your screen. The menu bar is where you'll find the controls for the currently-active app, as well as the Apple menu, which is represented by an Apple icon. The Apple menu is where you'll find the settings and preferences for your Mac."

Take some time to get familiar with how they work and how you can interact with your operating system and programs. Learn how to use a mouse to navigate. Your mouse allows for pinpoint navigation and control, and is necessary for a wide variety of activities. There are a variety of mouse types, and some have more buttons than others. A mouse on a Windows PC usually has two buttons—the left button is your primary mouse button, while the right mouse button generally opens menus and features. You'll usually need to double-click (click twice quickly) to open files and folders. A mouse on a Mac tends to have only one button. If you are used to using Windows and switching to a Mac, this may be confusing, especially when you're told you need to \"right-click\" something. To right-click on a Mac, you'll press and hold the Command key as you click your mouse button. If you're using a laptop that has a trackpad (a finger-controlled mouse) rather than a separate mouse, you can move the cursor around by dragging your finger on the pad. Some trackpads have separate buttons you can click, while others don't appear to have buttons at all. On a trackpad, you'll usually click by double-tapping, or by pressing hard enough to click the entire pad with one finger."
