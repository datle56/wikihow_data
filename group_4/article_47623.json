      "title": "Select a blue jean or neutral-coloured jacket if you want a more versatile piece.",
      "content": "Select a blue jean or neutral-coloured jacket if you want a more versatile piece. The “blue jean” look is a classic favourite because of its versatility. In fashion, blue jeans have come to be considered neutral, so it’s easy to pair them with other, more eye-grabbing items in your closet. White jean jackets are a popular alternative to blue jeans, as they can add a clean look to your outfit."

      "title": "Try brighter coloured denim for a more eye-grabbing look.",
      "content": "Try brighter coloured denim for a more eye-grabbing look. Denim jackets come in a range of colours as well, so blue isn’t your only option! These colors range from forest green to bright orange. Since coloured denim tends to be more attention-grabbing, it’s better to balance it out with neutral, more muted pieces. For example, you could match a burgundy denim jacket with black jeans."

      "title": "Choose medium and light washes for casual looks.",
      "content": "Choose medium and light washes for casual looks. If you’re looking for a blue jacket, the wash of denim is the shade of blue that you want. There are three main washes: dark, medium, and light. Medium wash is the most popular for jean jackets because it goes well with a variety of looks. It also usually feels a bit softer than dark wash jeans. [1] X Research source Light wash, the closest to the white of the washes, has a faded look to it, which is why it works best in casual settings."

      "title": "Select a dark wash jacket for more formal occasions.",
      "content": "Select a dark wash jacket for more formal occasions. Dark wash jean jackets can be easier to pair with more formal tops and accessories. Just keep in mind that, with enough washes, dark wash jackets will likely fade into a more medium-wash colour. [2] X Research source For men, dark wash jean jackets can take the place of a blazer when paired with a nice dress shirt, slacks, and formal shoes."

      "title": "Wear the jacket with other shades of denim.",
      "content": "Wear the jacket with other shades of denim. Some insist that denim-on-denim can never be done, but a denim jacket can look great with denim jeans as long as you mix and match colours and washes. Match a blue denim jacket with jeans that are a noticeably different shade of blue. If your jacket is fairly dark, go for lighter blue jeans, and vice versa. [3] X Research source If you’re hesitant about blue denim on blue denim, black skinny jeans are an easy go-to for a blue jean jacket! [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can also wear your jean jacket with coloured jeans or white jeans. [5] X Research source However, if you choose a white or coloured jean jacket, a pair of blue jeans will probably work just fine."

      "title": "Pair the jean jacket with leggings, coloured jeggings, or joggers.",
      "content": "Pair the jean jacket with leggings, coloured jeggings, or joggers. If you’re not into jeans, no worries! Leggings, coloured jeggings, and joggers are all very comfortable alternatives and are very in style for women. Jeggings are a cross between jeans and leggings that are designed to be more stretchy than denim. Khaki and olive green are jegging colours that tend to pair well with a classic blue jean jacket, as they prevent your style from looking too monochromatic. Matching a classic blue denim jacket with black leggings can create a casual athleisure look that you can live in on the weekends! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear the jacket with light and airy skirts and dresses.",
      "content": "Wear the jacket with light and airy skirts and dresses. Long, flowing dresses and skirts match surprisingly well with denim jackets. This is because jean jackets tend to have a heavier look to them, so clothes made of lighter fabric create a nice contrast. Airy and flowy dresses and skirts tend to accentuate this contrast the most, but you have a lot of freedom here. Pick your favourite summer dress. Maxi-dresses matched with a cropped jean jacket can work in both spring and fall outfits. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Complement your jacket with patterns and pops of colour. [8] X Research source Use your jean jacket to tone down more eye-grabbing pieces. This can range from tops with bright colours to patterned scarves. Print and colour trends are easy go-tos. A jean jacket lends itself well to stripes, but it can also work to simplify floral or other prints. [9] X Research source Blue jean jackets also look great with light pink tops or skirts. The light pink creates a pretty contrast with the blue, and it overall brings a spring or summer feel to an outfit. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Accentuate your curves by trying different cuts, belts, or high-waisted pants. If your denim jacket feels boxy, don’t fear! You can remedy the problem by drawing attention to your waistline through different jacket cuts or high-waisted bottoms. There’s a wide variety of cuts in women’s jean jackets, ranging from jackets that extend below the hip to jackets that are cropped just below the bust line. Cropped jackets work to accentuate the waistline. High-waisted jeggings or jeans can also draw attention to your waist if you feel like it’s being hidden by a larger jean jacket. High-waisted skirts or long dresses also lend themselves well to belts and sashes that can be tied around your natural waist. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Accessorize your jean jacket with jewelry or add-on pieces. Jean jackets lend themselves well to a variety of embellishments and add-ons. Chokers can be a great addition to a jean jacket — especially because of the way that the collar frames them and makes them particularly visible. [12] X Research source Decorate your jacket with pins. Enamel or button pins can be a fun way to express individualism and humor. They easily pin onto the pockets and collar of a jean jacket. [13] X Research source Iron-on patches are another fun alternative to pins, as they are temporary and can add some 1970s flair to your jacket. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Select a mid-length cut for a polished look.",
      "content": "Select a mid-length cut for a polished look. Jean jackets meant for men almost always extend down to the hip. Men can wear a longer-cut jacket if desired, but too much length can make the jacket look oversized. Similarly, a jean jacket that is too short can make it look shrunken rather than stylish."

      "title": "Balance denim-on-denim by mixing colours and washes.",
      "content": "Balance denim-on-denim by mixing colours and washes. A jean jacket can work with blue jeans, but you need to balance the washes carefully. When wearing a jean jacket with blue jeans, make sure that the washes are different. A medium wash denim jacket can look great with a dark wash pair of jeans, but similar washes tend to bleed together, creating denim overkill. If you like the feel of denim but not the look of jeans-on-jean, opt for a pair of black jeans with your blue jean jacket."

      "content": "Wear pants made from another material. There are a lot of other options when it comes to pants, so don’t worry if you’re not a fan of jeans! Chinos — which are dressier and more fitted than khakis — pair beautifully with light-wash jean jackets. Some go-to colours are brown, navy, green, tan, or even burgundy. [15] X Research source Corduroy pants or tan khaki pants will work with jean jackets of nearly any style and wash."

      "title": "Wear the jacket under another layer.",
      "content": "Wear the jacket under another layer. Layering is a great way to add texture and visual interest. Moreover, wearing multiple layers on top can reduce the monotony created when wearing a jean jacket with a pair of blue jeans. Throw a structured, neutral jacket over your jean jacket. Look for light materials, like a cotton-and-linen blend, and keep your look classy by choosing a muted colour like tan or gray. For an added degree of visual contrast, slip a sweater on beneath the jean jacket. A neutral colour can look stylish, but if you want to introduce a small trace of colour to your look, this bottom layer is a good, subtle way to do so. Make sure you stick with a lighter material, however, to prevent excess bulk. Opt for an unlined denim jacket to prevent the look from getting too bulky."

      "content": "Have the jacket stand in for a blazer. If you want a semi-professional look suitable for \"casual Fridays,\" you can replace your usual blazer with a classic, dark wash jean jacket. Wear this look with a collared, button-down shirt and tie like you would usually wear beneath your blazer. [16] X Research source Opt for corduroy trousers over blue jeans to keep this look from becoming too casual. You can keep your jean jacket partially buttoned, as you might do with a blazer. Allow the collar and tie to peek out, but keep the bottom half of the jacket closed."

      "content": "Wear a simple t-shirt or sweater. For an easy, casual look, pair your jean jacket with a clean sweater or t-shirt. A cotton sweatshirt or sweater can be great for the winter months, but a cotton t-shirt can look smart, casual, and classic when it’s warmer out. Tucking in plain T-shirts can add a level of sophistication to an otherwise casual outfit. [17] X Research source Wearing your jacket over a solid-coloured hoodie is very comfortable and can give you more of a casual street vibe. Gray or black hoodies work the best with medium and light wash blue jean jackets. [18] X Research source"

      "title": "Pair your denim jacket with a plaid shirt.",
      "content": "Pair your denim jacket with a plaid shirt. Layer a button-down plaid shirt beneath a denim jacket. Leave the buttons open and wear a striped cotton t-shirt beneath the plaid. This creates a more contemporary look. If you are going for the country-western look, wear a flannel plaid shirt beneath your jean jacket and leave it at that. Wearing a lined jean jacket will make this look appear even more rugged."
