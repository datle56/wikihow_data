Typically you would be asked to write an affidavit if you are close to the couple and have spent a lot of time with them. In the affidavit, you will relate facts or circumstances that support their marriage as a legitimate one, rather than simply a marriage of convenience to obtain U.S. permanent residency or citizenship. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Additionally, you may be asked to write an affidavit if you are a close family member of the couple, or a religious leader who knows the couple well. [3] X Research source Although affidavits aren't required by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), most immigration attorneys recommend submitting several affidavits along with the petition for permanent residency. [4] X Research source While your affidavit doesn't necessarily provide objective proof to the USCIS of the couple's relationship, it does demonstrate that the couple happily lives together and is planning for the future.

You may be able to find sample affidavits, or the person for whom you're writing the affidavit may provide you with one. However, you should only use any samples you have as a guide to the types of information that can be included in your affidavit – don't copy them directly. [6] X Research source You may want to review documents or talk to your friends to make sure you have dates and times correct. For example, if you went to the couple's wedding, you may double-check with the couple to make sure you have the date of the wedding correct. Ultimately, you want to present facts and observations that cause you to believe that the couple is sincerely in love and intends to remain together. [7] X Research source In some cases, the couple is no longer together. Affidavits still can be used to demonstrate the good faith intent of the immigrant candidate, even though the relationship itself didn't last. In these situations, you may include your understanding of the reasons the couple split. If spousal abuse was involved, you may have observed altercations between the couple. [8] X Research source"

Otherwise, you can choose the format with which you're most comfortable. Regardless of which format you choose, you should single-space your document with a double-space between paragraphs. Your word-processing application should have a template for business letter format. Date your letter and use \"Dear USCIS Officer\" as your salutation. [10] X Research source If you decide to use business letter format, you should include your name and address at the top, as well as the title and address for the USCIS service center where the letter will be submitted. You can get this information from the person for whom you're writing the affidavit. [11] X Research source If you're using the legal format, each paragraph should relate a single point or fact.
