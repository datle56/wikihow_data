  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Create termination points.",
      "content": "Create termination points. Cut off the ends of the coax cables to be spliced. Use small sharp wire cutters. Create squared off surfaces, rather than beveled surfaces. Mold the ends of the coax using your fingers. Mold the ends of the cables back into cylinders. They will have been distorted by the pressure of the cutting operation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the cables, one at a time, into a coax stripper tool.",
      "content": "Insert the cables, one at a time, into a coax stripper tool. Coax stripper tools are available at hardware and electrical stores. As each cable is inserted, make sure that the end of the cable is seated flush against the wall or guide on the stripping tool. This ensures proper strip lengths."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clamp the stripping tool around each cable.",
      "content": "Clamp the stripping tool around each cable. Once the tool is in place around the cable, smoothly spin the tool around the cable 4 or 5 times. Keep the rotation in 1 place on each cable. Do not apply any force that would pull on the cable insulation coating."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the coax stripping tool from each cable as the strip cut is completed.",
      "content": "Remove the coax stripping tool from each cable as the strip cut is completed. The stripping tool made 2 cuts simultaneously. Use your fingers to gently pull off the material nearest the end of each cable. This exposes the bare center conductor of each cable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull off the outer insulation that has been freed on each cable by the second cut made by the stripping tool.",
      "content": "Pull off the outer insulation that has been freed on each cable by the second cut made by the stripping tool. Pull gently with your fingers. This exposes a layer of foil on each cable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tear off the exposed foil on each cable.",
      "content": "Tear off the exposed foil on each cable. This will expose a layer of metal mesh on each cable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bend back the exposed metal mesh on each cable with your fingers.",
      "content": "Bend back the exposed metal mesh on each cable with your fingers. Do not tear the layer of foil that is under the metal mesh. The layer of foil protects the inner insulation. Bend the mesh all the way back so that it is molded over the end of the outer insulation on each cable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Press the end of each cable into the back of an F connector.",
      "content": "Press the end of each cable into the back of an F connector. Make sure that on each connector, the white inner insulation can be seen pressing against the front flange of the connector. It may be necessary to jiggle and continue to push the coax and the connector together to achieve proper seating. Use straight pressure only. Do not twist the coax in the body of the connector."
    },
    {
      "title": "Crimp the connections.",
      "content": "Crimp the connections. Place each F connector into a coax crimping tool, which is available at hardware and electrical stores. Execute the crimp by fully squeezing the crimping tool handle. Release the handle and open the crimping tool. Remove the finished crimp connection from the tool."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete the splice.",
      "content": "Complete the splice. Connect the 2 cables to either end of a BNC female to female coaxial adapter. These are available at hardware and electrical stores."
