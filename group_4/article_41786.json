      "content": "Fill a spray bottle with lukewarm water. Add at least 1 cup (240 mL) of water into an empty spray container. [1] X Research source Aim for the water to be around 90 to 95 °F (32 to 35 °C), instead of boiling or tap cold. [2] X Research source If the water is too hot, you might end up shrinking your denim. Some spray bottles come with a “spray” and “stream” setting on the nozzle. To cover more fabric at once, make sure that the bottle is set to “spray.”"

      "content": "Spritz your denim jacket with the water while it’s hanging. Place your garment on a clothes hanger, and hang it in an open area where you can spray the fabric easily. Squirt lukewarm water all over the material, focusing on the tightest parts of the fabric, like the armpit and shoulder area. Spray down the jacket until it’s damp, but not dripping wet. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay your jacket on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Lay your jacket on a flat surface. Take the damp garment and set it on the floor, taking a moment to flatten out any obvious folds or wrinkles from the fabric. If you’d prefer not to keep your jacket on the floor, place the denim on a different surface, like an ironing board or bedspread. [4] X Research source It’s difficult to stretch out fabric on an uneven surface."

    {
      "title": "Tug at the sleeves and tight areas of your wet denim.",
      "content": "Tug at the sleeves and tight areas of your wet denim. Use both hands to pull at your denim, focusing on the seams. Hold the sleeve or shoulder area in place with one hand, then use the other to yank on this portion of fabric. Don’t worry about pulling on the denim too much, as it’s a very durable material. [5] X Research source Pull on the same areas multiple times to get the maximum amount of stretch."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the jacket flat until it fully dries.",
      "content": "Keep the jacket flat until it fully dries. Set the garment in an open area where it can be exposed to plenty of open air. Don’t place the jacket in the machine, as this can cause the fabric to shrink. Instead, wait several hours until the denim is dry to the touch. [6] X Research source Check on the material every few hours to see if it’s dry."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try on the dry jacket and see if it fits more comfortably.",
      "content": "Try on the dry jacket and see if it fits more comfortably. If the material is still too tight, try repeating the spritzing and stretching process. If the jacket is too loose, there are several ways to shrink the denim to a more natural fit. Once the denim jacket fits comfortably, feel free to hang it back up in your closet! [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Soak the denim jacket in lukewarm water to get it completely damp.",
      "content": "Soak the denim jacket in lukewarm water to get it completely damp. Place the jacket in a lukewarm wash cycle to drench the material completely. To make the material even softer and more pliable, try washing it with a fabric softener, as well. [8] X Research source At this point, feel free to pull at some of the tighter portions of fabric, like the shoulders and underarm areas."

    {
      "title": "Slide on your wet jacket so you can stretch it out.",
      "content": "Slide on your wet jacket so you can stretch it out. Wear your denim jacket as you usually would, focusing on the tightest, most constricting portions of material. Work your arms and shoulders into these areas, forcing the material to accommodate to your desired fit. [9] X Research source While this may feel uncomfortable, wearing your wet jacket is a more efficient way to stretch your denim. For your own convenience and comfort, do this at home."
    },
    {
      "title": "Perform several arm stretches while wearing the jacket.",
      "content": "Perform several arm stretches while wearing the jacket. Pull 1 arm across your chest, holding it in place with your opposite elbow. Repeat this with your other arm to fully stretch the sleeves. Try experimenting with other arm stretches that force the material around the shoulder and underarm area to expand. [11] X Research source These stretches are most effective while the denim is still wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid placing your jacket into the clothes dryer.",
      "content": "Avoid placing your jacket into the clothes dryer. Let your garment begin to dry as you wear it, or hang it up to air-dry naturally. If you toss the jacket into the dryer, you could risk the material shrinking again, which would cancel out all of your hard work! Instead, hang up the jacket in an open area, allowing it to try over a day or so. [12] X Research source Don’t wear the jacket until it’s completely dry to the touch. Since denim can take awhile to dry, feel free to hang up the jacket after wearing it for several hours."
