      "content": "Apply beard oil after your daily shower. Beard oil moisturizes your hair, which helps make it straighter and easy to style. Tap out the oil into your palm and then rub your hands together about 5 times. Afterward, rub your hands across the sides and front of your beard with your fingers closed. Open your fingers slightly and run your fingers through the sides and front of your beard, working from the roots to the tips. [1] X Research source The amount of oil depends on the length, texture, and density of your beard. Apply beard oil to slightly damp hair. Beard oil can be purchased from most big-box stores and barbershops."

Use the palms of both of your hands to gently lather your beard with the conditioner. Afterward, massage it in with the tips of your fingers. Leave it in for 1 to 5 minutes before rinsing it out and drying it with a towel. [2] X Research source Purchase organic beard conditioners when possible. These products can be purchased from big-box stores, pharmacies, and popular online suppliers."

      "content": "Apply beard wax with the palms of your hands. Beard wax helps you sculpt your beard and hold the hairs in place so they stay straightened. Scrape a dime-sized piece of beard wax out of its container with the top of your thumbnail. Place it into in the palm of one hand and then rub it into both palms until it's a smooth, buttery consistency. Rub the palms of your hands along the sides of your beard to apply. [3] X Research source Always rub your hands downward in the direction of beard flow."

      "title": "Comb your beard using a blow dryer with a straightening piece.",
      "content": "Comb your beard using a blow dryer with a straightening piece. Attach your straightening piece and set the blow dryer to low speed and medium heat. Gently brush your hair outward from the center of your face to separate clumps, focusing on the messiest areas first. Continue brushing until the straightening piece flows smoothly through your beard. Use your fingers to untangle tough areas. [4] X Research source You can also dry your beard using a blow dryer with a nozzle attachment and a boar-bristle brush. Increase speed and heat as you wish. The faster the speed and higher the heat, the straighter your hair will come out, but the higher the risk of damaging your hair or burning your face. If you straighten your hair often, stick to low speed and moderate heat. Apply texture paste prior to blow drying to give yourself more control. Rub a dime-sized drop into your hands and apply it using your palms on the sides and front of your beard. You can purchase straightening pieces from most appliance and electronics stores that sell straightening irons."

Pull down sections of your beard with your thumb and two fingers, with about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair between your fingers and chin. Starting from the top, pinch along the length of your hair from top to bottom with your straightener 1 time in a slow motion. [8] X Research source Mini-straightening irons are designed for short hair and can be purchased from most beauty product suppliers. Avoid using standard-sized straightening irons. Clip up 2 sections of your beard to open your face. Once you finish straightening all of the other portions of your beard, remove the clips from the remaining sections and straighten them."

      "content": "Run a small comb through your beard for 15 minutes daily. A key part to retaining straight beard hair is keeping it neat and untangled. Set aside a bit of time each day to run the fine end of a small, plastic comb through your beard outward from the center of your face. If you're busy, comb your hair during any downtime you have, such as when watching a television show or before bed. Use beard oil and a boar-bristle brush to smooth and soften your beard. Small plastic combs are cheap, easily transported, and can be purchased everywhere from big-box stores to convenience stores."

      "title": "Wash your beard",
      "content": "Wash your beard once a week to preserve natural oils. Without natural oils, your hair gets dry, which leads to curls. Massage and rub beard shampoo through your beard during showers for a few minutes at a time. Be sure to rinse it all completely out when you're done. Wash every other day if you're exposed to dirty environments on a daily basis. For example, if you work in the construction industry, in a factory, or outdoors. Avoid regular hair shampoos and those with harsh chemicals, especially sulfates. These are strong detergents that strip your hair of its natural oils. Other chemicals to avoid are parabens, synthetic colors, and synthetic fragrances."

      "content": "Purchase a showerhead water filter to remove unwanted chemicals. Hard water has high levels of minerals, which tangle your beard and reduce the effectiveness of shampoos and soaps. Look into a showerhead water filter at your local home hardware store to keep your water ideal for straight hair. Purchase water hardness strips from hardware or big-box stores to test your water's hardness. Keep an eye out for chalky residue around regions of high water exposure—this is a sign of water hardness. If you want to make a bigger investment, consider a water softener ."

      "content": "Snip off unruly hair using small-sized trimming scissors. For tough spots that don't seem to straighten properly, you might have to remove the problem hairs . Focus on patches of hair that are giving you the most trouble. You can also use electric clippers, although this is a bit more difficult to remove smaller hairs and hair clusters. For electric clippers, start by trimming your hairs with a guard in place. Afterward, remove the guard from the clippers and gently drag it along the outside of your beard with the clean edge. If trimming still isn’t working, consider shaving off your beard and trying a different style. After all, there are plenty of types of beards to choose from, some that are better suited to your face than others."
