      "title": "Use a blue or black pen to write VOID across the check.",
      "content": "Use a blue or black pen to write VOID across the check. Use a permanent pen or marker to cover the majority of the front of the check with the word “void” in all caps. You don’t need to mark any specific area so long as most of the check is covered and people can’t write in the lines. [1] X Research source A voided check cannot be deposited—the word “void” on the check prevents it from being deposited, cashed, or used for any financial transaction. Avoid writing on the account, routing, and check numbers that are listed at the bottom of the check (if you’re using the voided check to verify bank information or personal data). Don’t add your signature to the check, as this may cause confusion. You may want to make a photocopy of the check for future reference."

      "content": "A voided check is an unusable check used mainly as a reference. If someone were to get their hands on a blank check of yours, they could theoretically fill it in themselves and use it to commit fraud. By writing “void” across the face of the check, no bank or cash checking institution will touch it if someone tries to use it. At the same time, a voided check serves as proof of your account information at a bank, so it can be a useful reference tool for certain financial transactions. [2] X Research source The big takeaway here is twofold: voided checks are safe to hand over to anyone you want to have your bank account and routing number, and voided checks cannot be used to take money out of your account."

      "content": "To set up direct deposit Employers will often ask for a voided check to help set up direct deposit. They’ll use the account number and routing number printed on the check to set up the direct deposit, and the check itself will confirm the account information matches the employee records you’ve provided.

      "content": "To correct a mistake you made If you ever fill out a check and you misspell someone’s name, write the wrong amount, or you just end up not wanting the check to be cashed, write VOID on the check. This way, nobody can actually use the check. [6] X Research source You can also tear the messed-up check to shreds, but you may want to keep the check for your records (in which case, “void” is the way to go). If you want to destroy a voided check, you can also shred it or tear it into pieces yourself."

      "content": "Direct deposit form If you don’t want to give your employer a voided check (or you just don’t have a checkbook), ask if they have any direct deposit forms instead. You’ll have to fill out the form with all of your personal information, but it’ll functionally be the same thing as a void check. [7] X Research source HR departments will often ask for a void check to fill out the direct deposit form on their own. Void checks save them time when onboarding a new employee. If you don’t have a checkbook but need a single voided check for something, your bank will usually give you 1-5 checks for free if you stop in at a branch and ask politely. If your bank doesn’t provide checks, they’ll likely have an alternative option for you."

In lieu of a voided check, you can probably use a letter from your bank that contains your account number and the bank’s routing number. Any statement should work, but you can also stop by your local bank branch and ask for a letter proving you have a valid account. [8] X Research source Check ahead of time with the utility company or institution to ensure that your bank letter will be an acceptable substitute."

These deposit slips normally have your account number and routing number pre-printed on them. If your slips do have your account info on them, you can probably use one of those instead of a voided check. The info on the slip is identical to the info on your checks. [9] X Research source You don’t need to void a deposit slip because they’re only used to put money in your account. If someone wants to commit fraud by throwing funds in your account, there’s no reason to stop them!"
