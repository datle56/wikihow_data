You can't turn them off completely using this switch, but you can temporarily disable notifications for up to 24 hours. In this case, you won't get notified by sound, vibration, or lights when you receive a message on Messenger. You'll only see new messages by opening Messenger. Alternatively, leave this switch on to still hear a Messenger notification, but you can turn off notification previews, vibrate, and light (if your phone is able). If you don't want to have sounds notify you of Messenger activity while you're using Messenger, tap the switch next to \"In-app sounds\" to toggle it off (this will also mute actions like the \"Heart\" reaction, which makes popping sounds). If you want to completely turn off all notification sounds from Messenger, open your Settings app and navigate to \"Messenger > Notifications\" and turn them off."
