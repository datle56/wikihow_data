A vet can diagnose your pet and prescribe medication to treat this problem. If your vet rules these out, your dog may just have a weak bladder. Try letting them out right before bed or providing a pee pad for them near their bed.

One way to address this is to have your dog sleep in the same room as you. By moving your dog into the same room as you, you may eliminate the reason why your dog is barking and waking you up. Provide your dog with a crate, bed, or somewhere to sleep in your room. Make sure to set boundaries from the very beginning.
