Then move your head down and your spine up while rounding out your back and stretching out your spine. [1] X Research source If you have a neck injury, speak to your doctor about whether or not this pose is appropriate. If your neck is simply sore, just be sure to keep your neck in line with your torso instead of tucking your chin toward your chest. Also, if you have difficulty rounding your upper back, have a friend place a hand in the middle of your shoulder blades while you push your vertebrae against it."

      "content": "Transform your cat pose into a dog pose. Start from the cat pose (on your hands and knees with a rounded spine, hands flat with fingers pointing away from you). Slowly straighten your back and then keep going until your spine is concave and you are looking up. Hold for five seconds, then transition back to cat pose. The gentle tension and release in the spine helps to increase flexibility and to ease lower back pain. The dog exercise is also known as the cow exercise in yoga."

      "content": "Do a stability ball back extension. With this exercise, you will drape your body over an exercise ball before stretching to extend your back. Drape yourself over the ball so your stomach and pelvis are comfortably resting. Then place your hands behind your head, as if you were doing a sit-up, and stretch your body upward, making your back concave. The stability ball provides extra support and helps the spine to curve naturally, as you stretch your back. Engage your glutes and your hamstrings so that you don’t overarch your back and so that you have a stable base for the exercise. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Do a seated twist.",
      "content": "Do a seated twist. This is a good stretch for your back without getting up from your chair. To do a seated twist, simply sit upright with your back erect, and slowly twist to one side from the waist, moving your waist, stomach, back, and shoulders all in one direction. Once you have twisted to one side for 15-20 seconds, you can revert to the middle position and then twist to the other side. [5] X Research source Make sure to do this slowly and carefully. If you twist too quickly or too far to one side, you can strain your neck or back. Try to avoid twisting to the point of causing a \"pop,\" as this can cause misalignment. To deepen the twist, you can place one hand on your opposite knee, and gently push back against it. If you are twisting to the left, place your right hand on the outside edge of your left knee. Look over your left shoulder if you are twisting to the left. If you are twisting to the right, look over your right shoulder. You can also place your arms on the side of the chair that you're stretching towards. If you are stretching toward the left, then place both arms on the left side of your chair."
