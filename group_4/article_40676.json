You might start with something really simple and straightforward, such as, “I’m going to share one of my favorite memories of Aunt Rosa.” If you prefer, you could open with something more attention-grabbing, such as a few words that you feel capture whatever you are trying to say about your loved one. For example, “Phil never went anywhere without his camera and a sense of wonder.”"
