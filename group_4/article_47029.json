      "title": "Inconsistent",
      "content": "Inconsistent The mutable quality of Pisces also makes them changeable and, at times, inconsistent—which is why some Venus in Pisces men have a reputation for being flaky. They don’t mean to be, and it’s rarely personal. They just get so caught up in their fantastical thoughts that they forget existing plans. They’re also daydreamers and can be a little spacey at times; even if they remember to show up, they might be late! In relationships, a Venus in Pisces man’s changeable nature can make him difficult to understand. He may even flip-flop on the idea of romance at times—eager to find love one day and interested in some other pursuit the next."

[6] X Research source If you’re a Venus in Pisces man, it’s important to distinguish when you’re actually in love and when you’re just holding on to the idea of love.

Venus in Pisces men are very forgiving, but they need to feel like a situation has been fully resolved before they can move on from something. If you’re seeing a Venus in Pisces man, try to talk problems through, especially if there’s conflict or emotional turmoil.
