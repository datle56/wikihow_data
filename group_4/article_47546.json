      "title": "Cinch your pants with a belt loop before buttoning them in place.",
      "content": "Cinch your pants with a belt loop before buttoning them in place. If your pants are a little loose, grab the belt loop to the left of your pants button and loop (or “cinch”) it around the button. At this point, secure your pants button as you normally would to hold your pants in place. This is a great option if you’re in a rush."

      "title": "Pleat the waistband and use a belt to hold everything in place.",
      "content": "Pleat the waistband and use a belt to hold everything in place. Start by pulling your pants forward so you can see how oversized they are. Fold and pinch the excess fabric into 2 large pleats, until the waistband is taut and comfortable around your waist. Hold these pleats in place with 1 hand and thread a belt through the loops. Once you’ve tightened the belt into place, you’ll be ready to go! [1] X Research source The size of your “pleats” depends on how oversized your pants are. Extremely oversized pants might need two 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) pleats, while slightly baggy pants will only need small pleats."

      "title": "Shrink your pants manually to make them smaller.",
      "content": "Shrink your pants manually to make them smaller. Depending on the fabric of your pants, you can possibly wash, soak, or steam them to become smaller. Choose a method that works well for the type of pants that you’re dealing with. [2] X Research source Machine-wash and dry any clothes made with cotton, denim, jersey, hemp, or linen to shrink the material that way. If you have corduroy, denim, khaki, cotton, silk, or drill pants, you can soak your pants in warm water for up to 6 hours. Then, hand-wash the pants with detergent, rinse out the suds, and air-dry the pants. You can shrink silk, cashmere, tweed, camel, boucle, and mohair pants with a steam iron. If you’re shrinking velvet, turn it inside-out before steaming."

      "content": "Cuff or roll your jeans to get rid of the extra fabric. Take a bit of time to roll up the extra fabric along the bottom of your pants. Roll up the fabric slowly, keeping it flat and about 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) wide against your ankle. You can also flip up the bottom of your pant legs to create a 4 to 5 in (10 to 13 cm) cuff. [3] X Research source You don’t want to roll up the fabric too quickly, or it’ll look bulky and awkward."

      "content": "Roll up oversized pant legs with a hair tie. Lift and roll up the bottoms of your jeans so they’re a comfortable distance away from your shoes. Stretch a hair tie around this rolled cuff, then fold the exposed pant hem down over the hair band. As a finishing touch, roll the banded cuff into your pants completely, so it’s not visible whatsoever. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Hem your pants",
      "content": "Hem your pants to bring them in. Measure the total length of your inseam, which starts at your crotch and goes to the very bottom of your pants. Remove this seam with a seam ripper, and flip your pants inside-out so you have a better look. Measure and cut away some of the excess material around your feet and ankles, then fold and restitch the new hem back in place. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Mark off 3 spots along the back inner waistband of your pants. Take off your pants and set them flat on the ground, making sure that the inner waistband is visible. Grab a fabric marker and draw vertical lines along the left and right sides of the inner waistband, as well as the center. [6] X Research source These marks are where your elastic band will go. The back, inner waistband refers to the inner portion of your pants that touches the back of your waist."

      "title": "Cut vertically along each mark through the top layer of fabric.",
      "content": "Cut vertically along each mark through the top layer of fabric. Grab a pair of fabric scissors and gently cut along each mark. Try not to cut through the entire waistband—the goal is to cut out several openings, so you can slip your elastic band inside the waistband. This strategy works especially well with jeans, but works with any kind of pants with a hemmed waistband."

      "title": "Thread an elastic band through the first and second cuts.",
      "content": "Thread an elastic band through the first and second cuts. Cut out a stretch of elastic that’s longer than 2 outer marks you sketched on your pants. Insert 1 end of elastic into the leftmost opening, using your fingers to pinch and pull the elastic through the waistband. Continue doing this until you’ve pulled the elastic out of the middle cut in your waistband. [7] X Research source This may seem a bit tricky at first, but don’t give up! The cut in the center of your waistband will make this easier. Leave 1 end of the elastic sticking out from the pants."

As you did before, pinch and pull the elastic with your fingers until you can pull it out through the rightmost cut on your back waistband.
