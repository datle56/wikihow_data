      "content": "Astrologer Angel Eyedealism classifies Aquarius as an independent sign that \"needs time and space for intellectual detachment. Don't get too personal too fast.\" As such, Aquarius is least compatible with earth and water signs—they tend to get attached. Earth signs like Taurus and Capricorn are traditional, which Aquarius finds stifling. Water signs like Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio force the logically-minded Aquarius to wade through intense emotions. Aquarius is most compatible with fiery Aries and Sagittarius or other air signs, like Gemini and Libra, who, according to Astrologer Angel Eyedealism, can \"Engage mentally first [and] talk about ideas, concepts, and the intellectual construct of love from a perspective that allows Aquarius enough distance to relax into intimacy.\""

      "content": "Scorpio Aquarius and Scorpio are bold, so they’ll be attracted to each other’s intensity—however, each will also fight for control.

How to make it work : Scorpio can value quality time with Aquarius instead of focusing on how much space the air sign takes.

How to make it work : Since both of these signs value independence, they have a flimsy idea of what “commitment” is.
