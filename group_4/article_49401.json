      "title": "Use a reputable news source.",
      "content": "Use a reputable news source. Choose a source that offers well-written and well-researched news. Avoid blogs and other personal websites, since these types of writings are more rooted in opinion than factual news. Determine the credibility of the source by examining the author, the news source, who owns the news source, and so on. Some possible news sources might include your local newspaper or larger newspapers such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and others. Check with your teacher for suggestions. He may have specific news sources to use."

For a story on a recent arson case, you might say, “The people involved are four teenage boys who were charged with arson, a police investigation team, and the community that lost its historic baseball stadium.” What: This is the event or the action discussed in the story. In an arson case, it might be: “The oldest wooden baseball stadium in the country burned to the ground.” When: This is the date and time when the event took place: “The stadium burned down at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, June 29.” Where: This is where the event took place: “The baseball stadium was in the middle of the city, surrounded by residences.” Why: This is the cause or reason for the event: “The summer has been unusually dry and hot.

Once the fire was set, they ran off.”"
