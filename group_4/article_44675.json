[1] X Expert Source Pradeep Adatrow, DDS, MS Board Certified Dentist & Oral Surgeon Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. There are a variety of exercises that can be used in the treatment of TMJ problems. The main aim of these exercises is to make use of your jaw muscles and to increase the jaw's mobility without fear of pain. Most exercises are focused on relaxing the muscles of your neck, your shoulders, and your jaw. Tension in any of these can worsen TMJ pain. If your dentist identifies \"trigger points\" for your TMJ pain (trigger points are areas of muscle that are prone to causing you pain), she may recommend that you see a massage therapist for help in loosening these muscles.

[3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This may sound obvious, but avoiding triggers for your jaw pain, such as chewing gum, yawning, or even singing, can help to prevent worsening of the pain. Also, eating softer foods can help, as this decreases the stress and strain of chewing. [4] X Expert Source Pradeep Adatrow, DDS, MS Board Certified Dentist & Oral Surgeon Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Pencil biting, pipe smoking and other repetitive movements and positions (such as with playing certain instruments like the violin or viola) are also thought to be associated with TMJ. Opt for foods such as oatmeal, eggs, mashed potatoes, soups, and other options that are gentle on your jaw in order to decrease the pain."

Especially for those who work at a computer all day, getting up to move around and changing posture frequently is important. TMJ problems can be worsened by tense neck and shoulder muscles, which happens frequently to those who are poised over a computer keyboard all day. [6] X Research source If at all possible, break up your workday by scheduling in a walk or other activity every couple of hours. This will give your neck and shoulder muscles a chance to relax, and may help to ease the discomfort in your TMJ. In addition, pay attention to sleeping positions. Sleeping on your side or stomach may put pressure on your jaw, exacerbating TMJ pain. Try to sleep on your back instead, and don't elevate your head too much."

Start by taking a warm, moist towel and place it on the side of your jaw. Apply the towel for five minutes or until you feel increased comfort. [7] X Research source You can apply this warm, moist towel four to five times in a day. This procedure can help relieve discomfort and increase jaw flexibility."

Applying ice packs can reduce the inflammation and pain by constricting the blood vessels around your TMJ. Use a cold pack, take a plastic bag and fill it with ice cubes, or simply keep a towel in your freezer and apply it on your jaw and face. Apply it for 10 minutes each time, four to five times per day. [9] X Research source Always wrap cold packs in a towel before applying them to your skin. Putting ice or a cold pack directly on your skin can cause frostbite."

Exercise produces endorphins, which are natural pain-killing chemicals in the brain. As a result, maintaining a healthy exercise regime can help to combat the pain in your jaw. A general guideline to follow is to do moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 30 minutes at least five times per week, or 150 minutes total. Ideally, you want to choose sports that elevate your heart rate such as swimming, biking, speed walking, or running. In addition to aerobic exercise, try to incorporate two to three days of strength training, which will build muscle and improve bone density."

[16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For patients who also experience anxiety and/or depression, treating the condition with methods such as medication or relaxation/stress management training can also be helpful for TMJ pain. Tricyclic antidepressants are generally considered after lifestyle changes, NSAIDs and muscle relaxers have shown to not be effective. Once the effective dose of the tricyclic has been determined, it is generally prescribed for up to four months and then tapered down to a lower dose."

If you have the habit of clenching your jaws and grinding your teeth, your dentist can take a teeth impression and make acrylic splints to fit on your upper and lower teeth. TMJ is weakly associated with teeth grinding (bruxism). [18] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source These splints help reduce your clenching and grinding habits by preventing the teeth from contacting each other. The shape of the splints also helps to keep your teeth in their appropriate positions and to correct bad bites. You can wear the occlusal splints throughout the day, except when you are eating. You can use night guards that are similar to splints during the night if you have a habit of grinding your teeth. Your dentist will advise you on the exact splints or mouth guards that will suit your TMJ problems. Using a splint in addition to making lifestyle changes is more effective in treating TMJ pain than using the splint alone."

It is a non-invasive method, and 30 – 60 minutes in each session of TENS normally provides a good result.
