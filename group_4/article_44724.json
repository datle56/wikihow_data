      "content": "Look for signs of a toenail injury, like pain, pressure, and blood. Injury to the nail bed can cause blood to accumulate under the nail, creating a black or dark brown discoloration. This is called a subungual hematoma. You may also experience symptoms such as a feeling of pain or pressure under the nail. [1] X Research source In some cases, it may be obvious that your black toenail was caused by an injury—for example, you may have dropped something on your foot or stubbed your toe. Black toenails can also develop gradually from repeated injury, such as pressure from overly tight shoes. If your shoes are slightly too small, you can stretch them at home to make them more comfortable. A black toenail is common in runners, ballerinas, and soccer players."

Go to source Rest: Rest the nail by minimizing the use of the injured foot as much as you can. For example, avoid running or hiking for a couple of weeks after the injury. Ice: Put an ice pack wrapped in cloth or plastic wrap on the injured toe to numb the pain and reduce swelling (if you don’t have an ice pack on hand, you can make one at home . You can safely use an ice pack up to once an hour, for 20 to 30 minutes at a time. [3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Compress: Apply gentle pressure by wrapping a bandage around the injured toe. This can help minimize the amount of blood that pools under your nail. Elevation: Reduce swelling by elevating your foot above the level of your heart as much as possible. For example, you might lie down on your couch with your foot resting on the arm rest or lie in bed with your foot propped on a pair of pillows."
