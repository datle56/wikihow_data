People love feeling smart when they solve a tricky clue,” he says. For example, a question about the number of words in a Charles Dickens novel might be tricky, but it’s not all that interesting. Cohen offers an example of a literature question that’s equally tricky but way more fascinating and unique: Question: Ray Bradbury's classic sci-fi novel \"Fahrenheit 451\" was serialized in three 1954 issues of which magazine, lending credence to people who claimed they \"only bought it for the articles\"?
