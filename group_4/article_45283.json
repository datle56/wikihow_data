      "content": "Mirrors facing each other are believed to create a portal for spirits. In various folklore and cultural superstitions, myths emerge of mirrors acting as a portal to other realities.

      "content": "Some cultures believe two mirrors facing each other trap spirits. Because of the seemingly infinite loop of reflections they create, two parallel mirrors are believed by some to generate a vortex. They think the loop of reflections is similar to a whirlpool of light, and it has the power to trap malevolent spirits and negative energies within it. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Some Christians think facing mirrors create a portal for Satan. While two mirrors facing each other are not explicitly mentioned in religious texts like the Bible, some Christians hold the belief that two mirrors facing each other create a doorway for Satan to enter the home. This superstition is curbed by covering one mirror or moving it so they do not reflect each other. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "In Feng Shui, two mirrors facing each other disrupt the energy flow.",
      "content": "In Feng Shui, two mirrors facing each other disrupt the energy flow. Because two mirrors reflecting each other creates a seemingly infinite loop, Feng Shui practitioners believe it disturbs the flow of “good” vital energy or chi (life force energy) in a space. Levitt agrees that fewer mirrors are better to avoid feeling overly self-conscious in a space. Mirrors also make it harder to focus on the spiritual over the physical during practices like Tarot readings."

      "content": "Breaking a mirror brings seven years of bad luck. You’ve probably heard of the superstition that if you break a mirror, you’ll have bad luck for the next seven years. The belief comes from ancient Rome. The Romans thought if you broke a mirror, the gods would be disrespected and curse you with bad luck. They also thought the body renewed every seven years, ending the curse. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Mirrors should be covered when someone dies.",
      "content": "Mirrors should be covered when someone dies. In faiths like Judaism and cultures throughout time, people have practiced the custom of covering mirrors in a house after someone dies. The practice is said to help mourners avoid vanity, or to prevent evil spirits from entering to fill the void left by the departed soul. Another superstition is that the soul of the dead person will see itself in the mirror and the mirror will turn into a picture of the dead. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Mirrors let you contact ghosts or supernatural entities. Many urban legends and superstitions suggest you can summon entities through mirrors. Popular examples are Bloody Mary and the Candyman , figures who are said to appear when you repeat their name in front of a dark mirror. [6] X Research source These are urban legends, meaning they’re not real."

      "content": "Mirrors help you see the future. Scrying, also known as catoptromancy, is a divination method where a mirror or other reflective surface is used to divine future events and omniscient insights. [7] X Research source The practitioner often uses an obsidian mirror. They focus their mind before gazing into the mirror and interpret what images, symbols, or visions they see there.

      "title": "No, the reflections are not infinite.",
      "content": "No, the reflections are not infinite. While two mirrors facing each other, they appear to create an infinite loop of reflections called the “infinity mirror effect.” However, the number of reflections isn't infinite. As the mirrors reflect and light bounces between them, some of it is absorbed or scattered. Thus, the reflections eventually darken and fade into invisibility. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Move one of the mirrors.",
      "content": "Move one of the mirrors. If you own the mirrors and they aren’t fixed to the walls by a landlord or previous homeowner, move one of them to a different part of the room. Alternatively, move it to another room that doesn’t have a mirror. Consider hanging it above a centerpiece like a fireplace, or opposite a window to allow more light into the room.

      "title": "Cover one or both mirrors with a sheet.",
      "content": "Cover one or both mirrors with a sheet. Find a heavy sheet or tarp that fits over the surface of one of the mirrors. Carefully drape it over the mirror to prevent it from reflecting the parallel mirror. If you can’t cover it, consider smearing it with a mirror-safe paint (like chalk paint) to turn it into an art piece while interrupting the loop between mirrors. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Cleanse each mirror spiritually.",
      "content": "Cleanse each mirror spiritually. If you’ve inherited one or both mirrors or purchased them secondhand, you may want to cleanse them of potential negative energy. Witchcraft practitioners also refer to this as “closing” the mirror. Start by physically wiping the mirror down with a clean wipe. Then, cleanse it with incense or smoke from burning sage . Finally, use a spiritual liquid to close the mirror off to bad energy, such as salt water or Florida water. [12] X Research source Open windows before burning anything. Don’t leave a lit herb bundle unattended. If you’re sensitive to smoke, use a mirror-safe cleansing spray instead. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Angle mirrors to reflect away from each other.",
      "content": "Angle mirrors to reflect away from each other. When two mirrors face one another, it may make you feel restless or unsettled. Prevent this by angling one of the mirrors to reflect away from the other. Avoid having it reflect a door, either—this can let good energy out of your space according to the principles of Feng shui. “I should not open a door and, bang! There's a mirror mirroring me right back out,” explains Levitt. “I don't want someone to go, the mirror, my hair, my lipstick! Or as a man, my tie! ” Instead, face a mirror to the side of a hall, entryway, or room so it’s not the first thing someone sees when they enter."
