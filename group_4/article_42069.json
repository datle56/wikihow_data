      "title": "Photocopy a friend’s worksheet for an easy solution.",
      "content": "Photocopy a friend’s worksheet for an easy solution. If you forgot some type of worksheet or essential assignment sheet, call up a friend. Ask if you can borrow their worksheet for a few minutes. Then take the worksheet to a nearby office supply store and have it photocopied. If you have a scanner and printer or a copy machine, you can complete this task at home. Most printing places charge $0.10 for a single black and white copy. If you do not have access to a copy machine, or do not have a ride to your friend’s house, you can ask them to take a picture of the worksheet or scan it and send it to you by text or email.

      "title": "Look on the website for your course, if applicable.",
      "content": "Look on the website for your course, if applicable. Does your school use an online platform to post assignments and grades? If so, it is possible your teacher posted a copy of this worksheet to that page. Log in, look for the name of this assignment or the chapter it corresponds to, and locate the worksheet. Print it out at home. [2] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 26 March 2021."

    {
      "title": "Find a PDF of the worksheet online if possible.",
      "content": "Find a PDF of the worksheet online if possible. If the worksheet was produced by the company who made your textbook, you can likely locate a copy of it online. Search by the publisher, textbook title, and subject matter or chapter you are working on. Locate a PDF of the worksheet and print it out at home."

    {
      "title": "Email your teacher as a last resort.",
      "content": "Email your teacher as a last resort. Often times, your teacher will have an electronic copy of the worksheet that they can send to you. Email your teacher right away and request a copy of the worksheet, or politely ask them for an extension if you won't be able to get the homework in on time. [3] X Expert Source Katie Styzek School Counselor Expert Interview. 26 March 2021. Be sure to use clear grammar, complete sentences, and good etiquette in your email. You can only use this method once or twice before your teacher will become frustrated with you. Your teacher may be less than pleased that you don’t have the worksheet if you’ve had an extended period of time to complete it rather than if it was assigned that day."

      "title": "Find your book at the library if possible.",
      "content": "Find your book at the library if possible. It is very likely that a copy of the book will be held at your school’s library. You may be able to search by the name of your course, the course number, or your teacher’s name. If the library at your school is not open, a public library may also have the book. You can search an online card catalog or call the library to see if they have your book. Then go there in person and check it out. Sometimes the textbook may be “on reserve,” meaning you will have to work with it in the library."

    {
      "title": "Search for the book online if you can’t find a hard copy.",
      "content": "Search for the book online if you can’t find a hard copy. You may be able to find an ebook or PDF of the book. Search by the title of the textbook, the publisher, and/or the author. Download the PDF or ebook and read it on your computer or tablet. Ideally, you will want to try to find the exact same edition, but a different edition will be better than nothing. Keep in mind, though, that the chapter or worksheet may be different from the one your teacher assigned. If you can find out the ISBN code for your textbook, this can be a good way to search as well."

      "title": "Borrow a friend’s book for a quick remedy.",
      "content": "Borrow a friend’s book for a quick remedy. If you have a friend in the class, call them up and ask them to borrow their book. If they have the same assignment, you may need to wait until they are finished using the book. Another option is to go over to their house, share the book, and work on the assignment together. Be careful not to violate your teacher’s policies on completing assignments!"

      "title": "Look for other books on the subject if all else fails.",
      "content": "Look for other books on the subject if all else fails. If you simply need your textbook in order to answer questions, you may be able to find different books containing the information. If you need information about United States history, for example, the library will have many books that will contain the answers you need."

      "title": "Search for alternative sources online to find key information.",
      "content": "Search for alternative sources online to find key information. You may also be able to find the information you need using online sources.

      "title": "Go to school early the next day to try to finish it before class.",
      "content": "Go to school early the next day to try to finish it before class. If there was no way for you to complete your assignment without the materials you left at school, try to go in early the next morning. If your school offers early morning study hall (or a breakfast period), you can easily get there early and work in the morning. [4] X Research source If you need to get into your classroom, you can email your teacher to see if they can let you in early."

      "title": "Work during any free periods if you need to.",
      "content": "Work during any free periods if you need to. If you are not able to go into school early (or if you do not finish your assignment during that time), you can work during any downtime you have during the day. If a teacher gives you time in class to work on something, you can work on the homework from last night instead. [5] X Research source You can work during any free period, recess, or lunch in order to get the assignment done."

      "title": "Stay after school so you can turn the assignment in that day.",
      "content": "Stay after school so you can turn the assignment in that day. If you were not able to get the assignment done during your school day, you may still be able to turn it in without getting a late grade. Talk to you teacher and find out if you can stay after school for a little bit to finish the assignment. It is likely that your teacher will need to stay for a little while anyway, and they may respect your initiative to get the late assignment complete as soon as possible."

    {
      "title": "Email it to your teacher if allowed.",
      "content": "Email it to your teacher if allowed. A similar option is to email the assignment to your teacher. Sometimes if you can get it to your teacher the same day it is due (even in a digital format), your teacher will not mark the assignment late. Talk to your teacher and find out if this is an option for you. Then complete the assignment as soon as you get home. If you have multiple email accounts, use the one associated with your school. Once again, use proper grammar, complete sentences, and good etiquette when you communicate with your teacher via email."

      "title": "Get an extension if necessary.",
      "content": "Get an extension if necessary. If all else fails, talk to your teacher about getting an extension. Explain what happened, describe all the methods you tried in order to get this assignment done, and ask for permission to turn it in late. Keep in mind that if this happens more than once, your teacher may be less likely to give you an extension."
