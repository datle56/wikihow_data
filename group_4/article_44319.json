      "content": "Determine whether you're eligible for a transfer. The Compact has established specific criteria a parolee must meet to be eligible for transfer. You must go through the Compact's transfer process if you were convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors that involve more than a year probation, and you have more than 90 days of probation remaining. Misdemeanors for which transfer through the Compact is required include those involving physical or psychological violence, possession of a firearm, or sex offenses for which registration is required. Generally, you qualify for a mandatory transfer if you were a resident of the state to which you want to move for at least a year or have family who've lived there at least 180 days and are willing to assist with your supervisory requirements. You also must be in compliance with all the probation rules in your state prior to transfer. Keep in mind that if you don't meet the criteria for a mandatory transfer, whether your transfer will be approved is subject to a good deal of discretion on the part of committees both in the sentencing state (where you currently live) and the receiving state (where you want to move).

      "content": "Discuss your desire to move with your parole officer. If you believe you meet the basic eligibility criteria, bring the idea up with your parole officer and get his or her opinion on the viability of a transfer. If you need to travel immediately, you should mention this the first time you talk to your parole officer so he or she can set the process in motion. You also may be eligible to receive a temporary travel permit until your transfer is approved, but this process must begin as soon as possible if your need to travel is urgent. [2] X Research source However, if you were convicted of a sex offense you are not eligible for a temporary travel permit, and cannot travel to another state for any length of time without completing the Compact transfer process and being approved for transfer. Ask your parole officer about the fees and cost of supervision in the state where you want to move, as they may differ from the costs you pay in your current state. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that the Compact doesn't require your probation officer to cooperate with you. If your probation officer doesn't agree with your plans to transfer, or doesn't believe the transfer is viable, it may be extremely difficult if not impossible for you to get the transfer approved.

      "content": "Provide the necessary information to your probation officer. To complete your application, your probation officer must have additional documentation about the opportunities you want to pursue in the other state. Your reasons for transfer will determine in part whether you qualify for a mandatory or discretionary transfer. If your reason does not qualify for a mandatory transfer, the receiving state has the right to reject your transfer request. [5] X Research source For example, relocation to attend an inpatient treatment or rehabilitation program in another state is not in and of itself enough to qualify for a mandatory transfer. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that submitting a transfer application with inadequate information can result in the delay or even rejection of your transfer. [7] X Research source"

Along with your application form, the packet also must include evidence of employment or other means of financial support in the state to which you want to transfer, proof of your own prior residency in the state or the residency of your family, and evidence of your compliance with all the legal conditions and requirements of probation. Your family or friends in the state where you want to move may assist you with gathering evidence, but your transfer application can only be completed by you and your probation officer."

Keep in mind that the transfer process may take several months, and no specific criteria exist for determining when circumstances justify expediting an application. Both the sentencing state and the receiving state make independent decisions regarding the speed with which your application will be processed. [8] X Research source You may have to pay transfer fees when you submit your application. These fees vary widely among states, and may be anywhere from $25 to $200. The fee is non-refundable regardless of whether your application is approved. [9] X Research source A few states provide a waiver of fees if you can demonstrate that paying the fee would result in undue financial hardship; however, the vast majority of states have no waiver provision.

Once the compact office in the sentencing state receives your application, they will review it to determine if you meet the state's requirements for a transfer. If your current state determines that your plan and reason for transferring to the other state is not viable, it will reject your application and the transfer will not take place. In some jurisdictions, you have the right to request a hearing before a judge if your transfer application is rejected by your current state. Check with your probation officer if your application is available to find out if you can request a hearing. Keep in mind that your current state court has no authority either to allow or order your transfer to the other state. The other state must grant permission before you can move there."

If the sentencing state approves your transfer, it must send the application to be reviewed by the receiving state. Your current state will determine whether your reasons for transfer and supervision plan are viable before sending the application to the state where you want to move. Keep in mind the Compact does not include a deadline by which your current state must make its decision regarding your application, so this step may take some time.

[11] X Research source If your reasons for transfer do not meet the criteria for a mandatory transfer, the compact office in the state where you want to move has discretion on whether to accept or reject your application. Keep in mind that the ability to transfer your probation is a privilege, not a right, and as such you have no right to appeal the decision if your application is rejected by either your current state or the state to which you want to move.

The receiving state only has to supervise you in the same way it would anyone else on probation in that state. [15] X Research source Although you have been given permission to move to the new state, the state in which you were sentenced still has jurisdiction over your case and can order you to return at any time.
