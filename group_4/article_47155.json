      "content": "Check your cable connections. A loose cable can cause your screen to flicker. Check that any cables are connected tightly at each port and that they don't have visible damage. For example, Vizio SmartCast Displays have awesome HDR capabilities as long as your HDMI cable is tightly connected to both ports and isn't damaged. You want to make sure you're using an HDMI 2.0 cable since the older 1.4 cables can cause the screen to flicker. While you're checking for any signs of damage or wear in your cables, you also want to disconnect and reconnect them to make sure they are securely connected."
