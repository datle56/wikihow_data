      "content": "Find a good etymological dictionary. To start informally studying etymology, buy or gain access to an authoritative dictionary that includes the linguistic origins of words in its definitions. The easiest way to tell that it does is if it has, “etymological” in the title. However, it may still include etymologies even if it does not include this in the title. Check a definition to see if there is a section labeled “origin” or “etymology.” [1] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. The most respected print dictionaries for English’s etymology include An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English, A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, and The Oxford English Dictionary. The last also has an online subscription option. There is also a free, well-researched online dictionary that’s specifically dedicated to etymology, available here: https://www.etymonline.com/"

      "title": "Look for the roots.",
      "content": "Look for the roots. Etymologies seek the earliest origin of a word by tracing it back to its most basic components, that is, the simple words that were combined to create it in the first place. When you know the roots of a word, you can better understand how we arrived at the sound and meaning for the word that exist today. [2] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. For instance, the word “etymology” itself has Greek roots: “etymos,” which means, “true sense,” and “logia,” which means, “study of.” [3] X Research source Besides helping you to understand the origin of a word, knowing its roots can help you understand other words with similar roots. In the case of “etymology,” you’ll note that the root “logia,” which means “the study of,” appears in multiple other places in modern English, from “biology” to “astrology.” [4] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. Take note of any patterns you find, particularly if you’re working with the etymologies of multiple words. This will help streamline your studies."

      "title": "Trace the word’s journey into English.",
      "content": "Trace the word’s journey into English. Etymology traces not only the word’s origins but also how its meanings and spellings have developed over time. Sometimes that means that a word has traveled through more than one language on its journey into modern English. [5] X Research source Etymological dictionaries will usually present this trajectory in reverse-chronological order, starting with the most recent usage and showing where each iteration came from in turn. If we return to the word “etymology,” it entered into Old English as ethimolegia (\"facts of the origin and development of a word\"), from Old French etimologie, ethimologie, from Latin etymologia, from Greek etymologia (\"analysis of a word to find its true origin\"). So, it appeared in the written record of 3 languages (Greek, Latin, and French) before it entered into English."

      "title": "Understand the dates.",
      "content": "Understand the dates. Most etymologies will include dates in their origins of words. These represent the first time a particular word appeared in a document written in English. (Keep in mind that a word may well have existed in spoken English a long time before that, but this is the date of the first written record of it that has survived.) [6] X Research source For example, “etymology” entered English in the 14th century but did not take on its modern spelling and definition until the 1640s. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the examples and sources.",
      "content": "Check the examples and sources. Thorough etymological dictionaries will often include documentary sources for each iteration of a word and/or examples of how a word has been used in context over time, usually through a phrase or sentence from a written document in English. This provides concrete historical evidence for the word’s origins while giving you insight into how its meaning has changed. For instance, the word “queen” comes from the Middle English “quene,” which can be seen in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and the Old English “cwen,” which appears in Beowulf. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Look up words you’re curious about. Now that you know what to look for, start studying the etymology of those words that make you wonder, “Where did this come from?” It’s an entertaining way to get to know the historical meaning behind the things you say, and you’ll often be surprised about where they come from. It’s also edifying to look up those words that seem so normal that you’ve taken their origins for granted. For instance, if you study the etymology of a familiar word like “nostril,” you’ll find that it comes from Old English “nosu” (nose) and “pyrel” or “thrill” (hole). It’s literally a “nose hole.” You’ll also note that “pyrel” and “thrill” once sounded alike in English, which shows how far the language has developed phonically. That also means that the word “nostril” is surprisingly related to the word “thrilling.”"

      "content": "Follow up on surprising word origins. If what you find when you look into the etymology of a particular word does not make obvious sense today, do some research to figure out why its original meaning is what it is. If you’re writing a paper on etymology, briefly discuss these origins and why they are unexpected. For instance, you may wonder where a word like “disaster” came from. When you look it up, you’ll find that its Greek roots are the negative prefix “dis” and “astron” (star). So, it’s earliest meaning was something like “bad star.” This might be surprising until you consider Greek astrology and their strong belief that celestial bodies exerted control over our lives on Earth.

[10] X Expert Source Katherine Demby Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. In the case of etymology, there are not a lot of related words, but you can see that “etymological,” “etymologically,” and “etymologist” are all closely related forms. In the case of a word like “autopsy” with the Greek root “autos” (meaning, “self”), there’ll be a whole host of related words, from “autonomy” (self-governing) to “automobile” (self-moving) to “automatic” (self-acting).
