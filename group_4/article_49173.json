      "title": "Place your gift in a box.",
      "content": "Place your gift in a box. It's much easier to wrap something that has a square or rectangular shape. Sometimes, the gift itself will already come in rectangular packaging—in that case, you can skip this step. However, if your gift is an unpackaged item like clothing or a stuffed toy, you’ll need to place it into a gift box , which you can usually find in the same store aisle as the wrapping paper. [1] X Research source Remove the price tags from your gift at this point, as well. This is considered good etiquette, since the recipient doesn't need to know how much you spent. If you can’t remove the tag, get a pen and black out the price. Make sure to secure any fragile items, like glass drinkware or candles, so they don’t move around and break. Wrap these items up in some tissue paper before placing them in the gift box. If you don’t have a gift box and don’t have time to buy one, an old shoe box from somewhere around your house can work in a pinch. You can also make your own gift box using cardstock or felt."

      "title": "Unroll your wrapping paper and lay the box topside down on it.",
      "content": "Unroll your wrapping paper and lay the box topside down on it. Work on a flat surface, like a hardwood floor or table. Unroll the wrapping paper until you have a section that’s about twice the length of the box, but don’t cut it yet. Place the box in the middle of the paper (about halfway between the edge of the wrapping paper and the roll of wrapping paper) with the top facing down. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the paper over the box to estimate how much you’ll need to cut.",
      "content": "Wrap the paper over the box to estimate how much you’ll need to cut. Take the edge of the wrapping paper and wrap it around so it covers about half the box. Then, pick up the tube end of the wrapping paper and cross it over to estimate how much you’ll need. As a rule of thumb, your wrapping paper should be long enough to cover the box completely, and the two sides should overlap by about an inch or two. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut the paper so that the two sides slightly overlap.",
      "content": "Cut the paper so that the two sides slightly overlap. Once you’ve eyeballed about how much paper you’ll need, it’s time to make your cut. Using your scissors , cut a straight line across the upper layer of wrapping paper, separating it from the rest of the roll. [4] X Research source ”When you want to cut a straight line with scissors, it’s best to have a guide,” says arts and crafts specialist Amy Guerrero. “You can use a ruler to lightly draw a line with a pencil and then cut over the line.” Or, if your wrapping paper has a repeating pattern, you can “find a part of the pattern to follow in a straight line to help your cut stay straight,” Guerrero recommends."

      "title": "Tape one side of the paper to the box.",
      "content": "Tape one side of the paper to the box. Once you’ve cut the paper to the right size, grab your tape. Make sure your gift box is still centered, then lift up one side of the wrapping paper and fold it over the box (it should reach about halfway across it). Secure the paper to the bottom of the box with a piece of tape. [5] X Research source If you don’t have any tape, you can still wrap your gift, but it’s a bit of a different process. Check out this helpful guide on how to wrap presents without tape if you’re in this situation."

      "title": "Fold over the other side of the paper and tape it down.",
      "content": "Fold over the other side of the paper and tape it down. Fold the other side of the paper over the top of the box. It should overlap slightly with the paper you just taped down. Place a piece of tape on the center of the box, securing the top layer of paper to the bottom layer. [6] X Research source If you’re wrapping a large gift , you may need to use a few pieces of tape along the edge to make sure everything stays in place. The edge of this piece of paper will be visible on the outside of your gift wrap. If you didn’t cut a super straight edge, you can fold the edge of the paper inward by about a half inch (1.2 cm) to create a clean line before taping it down. [7] X Research source If you don’t want your tape to be visible on the outside of the gift, opt for double-sided tape instead."

      "content": "Fold the upper and lower flap together and secure with tape. At this point there should be two triangle-shaped flaps at the end of the box. Fold the top flap down, making sure it is flat against the box. Next, fold the bottom flap upward so it’s overlapping the top flap. Secure this in place with a piece of tape. [10] X Research source This side of the box should now be fully concealed by wrapping paper. [11] X Research source"

Crease the triangle-shaped wings, then fold the upper flap downward and the lower flap upward. Secure the folds with tape. [12] X Research source And that’s it! You’ve completed a basic gift-wrap. You can stop at this point, or you can add some embellishments to make your gift stand out even more, which we’ll cover below."

      "content": "Add a To/From tag. It's always a nice touch to add a To/From tag on a package to give it a personal touch. You can use store-bought tags, or you can make your own by cutting decorative cardstock into the shape you’d like, writing the recipients name and your name on it, and taping it onto your gift. [13] X Research source Many store-bought gift tags are stickers, so you can easily stick them onto your gift. There are also tags that you can tie onto your gift with ribbon or string."

      "title": "Tie a ribbon",
      "content": "Tie a ribbon around the gift. Use a thick ribbon , which you can purchase at a department store or somewhere like Target. Turn the present upside down, so the seams you taped earlier are facing upward. Tape down the end of the ribbon in the center of the box, near where the two ends of wrapping paper are taped together. Loop the ribbon around the package length-wise until it circles the package completely. Cut the ribbon and tape down the other end. If desired, you can also repeat this process and wrap the ribbon around the package width-wise to create a nice criss-cross effect."

      "content": "Measure your object. Measure the circumference of the object using a measuring tape . Add 4 inches (10 cm) to the circumference. Then, measure the rough length of the object from top to bottom and the diameter of the flat side. To measure the circumference, wrap the measuring tape around the curve of the object. To measure the diameter , measure the flat side of the object from one end to the other. If an object has one flat side that's bigger than the other, measure the diameter of the bigger side."

      "content": "Cut out your tissue paper. Cylinder objects should be wrapped in tissue paper instead of wrapping paper. Cut the tissue paper into the shape of a rectangle. The rectangle's width should be the object's circumference plus 4 inches (10 cm). Its height should be the diameter plus the length. For example, say a circle's circumference was 5 inches (13 cm), its length was 8 inches (20 cm), and its diameter was 4 inches (10 cm). Your rectangle would be 9 inches (23 cm) by 12 inches (30 cm)."

      "title": "Twist both ends to enclose the cylinder.",
      "content": "Twist both ends to enclose the cylinder. The paper on the flat side of the cylinder should still be sticking out. Starting on one end, pinch the paper at the base of the object and twist it around two or three times. Then, wrap a piece of tape around the twist to secure it. Repeat on the other side. [17] X Research source The wrapping job should resemble the wrapping of a piece of candy, like a Tootsie Roll. This doesn’t apply for wine bottles (even though they are sort of cylindrical). Certified wine consultant Murphy Perng recommends wrapping one or two pieces of tissue paper around the bottle then placing the whole thing into a wine bottle gift bag."

      "content": "Wrapping gifts shows people that you care. Your loved ones will be excited to receive any gift from you , but they’ll be even more excited and impressed if the gift is beautifully wrapped. It shows them that you actually sat down and took the time to make the gift look its best, which is a big sign that you care. Plus, once you learn how to wrap a gift once, you’ll pretty much have the skill locked in forever. This means that you can impress friends and family with neatly wrapped, aesthetically-pleasing presents for many more birthdays, holidays, baby showers, and weddings to come."

      "title": "Certain gifts don’t need to be wrapped because of their size or shape.",
      "content": "Certain gifts don’t need to be wrapped because of their size or shape. For example, things like gift cards or paper receipts for an experience (a spa day, a weekend getaway, etc) don’t need to be gift wrapped. [18] X Research source Just place these inside whatever greeting card you’re using for the occasion, and seal it up in the envelope. You can also forgo wrapping paper for bigger gifts like bouquets , giant stuffed animals, appliances, or bicycles. Try tying a large bow or using a stick-on bow for these items, instead."
