      "content": "Hot Takes To play this game, take turns sharing a “hot take”—a strong personal opinion that might be controversial or highly contested in the group. Each time someone calls out a hot take, the rest of the players can weigh in and share their own thoughts on the topic. It’s as simple as that! Example hot takes could include: Cats make better companions than dogs. You should pour your milk into your bowl before the cereal. The Percy Jackson series is way better than Harry Potter. Everyone should own at least one pair of Crocs."

      "content": "High, Low, and Buffalo Have each player take turns sharing one “high” (something great in their life), one “low” (something that’s been bothering them), and one “buffalo” (something random or funny about their life). This game is a fun way to get more details from friends and family about their lives and share more about yours in return! For example: High: I got tickets to see my favorite musician in concert! Low: I paid too much for those tickets, which totally blew my budget. Buffalo: I’m thinking of getting a new rug. Do you think purple would look good in my room?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Would You Rather",
      "content": "Would You Rather Play the game by coming up with two scenarios and asking other players which one they’d prefer if they had to choose one—in the form of a question that starts with “Would you rather…?” See what everyone else says, and give each player a turn to devise their own scenarios, too! For example: [1] X Research source Would you rather have smelly feet or bad breath? Would you rather live on a boat or in a treehouse? Would you rather have a photographic memory or the ability to read minds? Would you rather give up showering for a month or give up the internet for a month?"

      "title": "Two Truths and a Lie",
      "content": "Two Truths and a Lie Share two true things about your life and one made up (without revealing which is which). Then, let the other players try to guess which statement is the lie! Anyone who guesses correctly gets a point for that round. Play the game until everyone has had a chance to make up two truths and a lie; then, the person with the most correct guesses wins. Example statements include: [2] X Research source I’m a vegetarian. I’m colorblind. I’m terrified of clowns. I’m an only child. My first pet was a turtle."

      "title": "I Like You Because…",
      "content": "I Like You Because… Sit in a circle and take turns saying one thing you appreciate about the person sitting next to you (either on your left or right, your choice). Then, have everyone move around and change their seating places, then go around the group again so you can say what you appreciate about someone else. For example: I like you because you have great fashion sense. I like you because you’re super reliable. I like you because you’re honest no matter what. I like you because you’re a great listener."

      "title": "What If?",
      "content": "What If? Take turns making up a hypothetical situation that starts with “What if…?” and pose the question to another player of your choice. That player must then say what they’d do in that situation and describe what would happen next. When they’re done, the player that came up with an answer can ask someone else a “What if…?” scenario. For example: What if you had superpowers? What if you could talk to your 10-year-old self? What if you could live forever? What if you could talk to animals?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Group Consensus",
      "content": "Group Consensus Start by posing a question to the group or offering a hypothetical scenario. Then, the group must talk it over and come up with a single answer that everyone can agree on, debating their different perspectives and suggestions until they reach an understanding. Once the group has an answer, someone else can pose a new question! For example: If you could insult one famous historical figure to their face, who would it be? If you could travel in time, what decade and century would you visit? If you had to re-watch a movie once a week for the rest of your life, what would it be?"

      "content": "Ten Things In Common In this simple game, the entire group must find ten things they all have in common. Talk amongst yourselves to find similarities—and remember that they have to be more specific than, “We’re all human” or “We need air to breathe.” You might be surprised by what you have in common with the rest of the group! If you’re worried about the group being too big, you can always break into smaller groups and have each one find ten things they have in common instead."

      "title": "The Alphabet Game",
      "content": "The Alphabet Game Choose a topic to start with. Then, have everyone take turns calling out a word related to that topic. The catch is that each word must start with a specific letter of the alphabet, going in alphabetical order (so the first word must start with “A,” then the next one should start with “B,” and so on). You're out of the game if you can’t think of a word. [4] X Research source Topics or categories could include names (either men’s, women’s, or both), foods, celebrities, movie and TV show titles, or animals.You can always get creative without own topics, too!"

Then, establish the following rhythm: have everyone slap their thighs twice, clap their hands twice, and finally snap their fingers twice. Once the group has that pattern down, play the game as follows: Get one person to start by saying their name during the first snap, then calling out someone else’s name on the next one. The person whose name is called must do the same thing, saying their name on the first snap and someone else’s on the second. Keep a steady beat as you play, and keep going until everyone’s name has been called!"

      "title": "Ask Me Anything",
      "content": "Ask Me Anything “Ask Me Anything” is an easy game where players can ask one another any question, and the person they ask can answer or decide to skip it. Before you start, decide on a penalty for skipping a question. Then, have players take turns thinking of questions and choosing someone to ask—and give everyone a chance to go! There’s no winner or loser for this game (unless you decide the penalty for skipping a question is getting kicked out of the game). Other penalty ideas could be doing ten push-ups, eating something unappetizing (like a sliver of lemon), or contributing a dollar to a communal pile (which you use to get candy or ice cream after)."

Example questions include: Where’s my favorite place to be kissed? What do I love most about your body? What kind of flirting do I find irresistible? What’s the most sensual dream I’ve ever had?"

      "content": "Orange Flags Most people know about red flags (negative warning signs) and green flags (positive, desirable traits) in relationships—but what about orange flags? Orange flags are qualities that aren’t complete deal-breakers but could definitely make you stop and think. To play the game, take turns naming something you consider an orange flag. Then, let everyone else chime in with their opinion. Some players might consider your orange flag a red flag, for example, while others might not have a problem with it. Example orange flags could include: Having one really ugly household decoration they insist on keeping Sleeping with a fan on all the time, even during winter Always leaving half-finished drinks around the house Wearing socks, underwear, and other clothes with holes in them."

      "content": "Perfectly Perfect, But… Similar to Orange Flags, this game involves coming up with flaws for an imaginary partner and seeing how everyone else reacts. Start by saying “They’re perfectly perfect, but…” and then naming a single flaw for this otherwise ideal partner. Then, let the rest of the group chime in and say whether they’d be okay with that flaw, or if they’d find it unacceptable. For example: They’re perfectly perfect, but they pick their nose. They’re perfectly perfect, but they end every sentence like a question. They’re perfectly perfect, but they refuse to watch any movie made after the year 2000."

Talking games can be fun for just about anyone, but it's important to consider what kind of game might fit the players best. If you're playing with people you don't know as well, opt for casual icebreaker games that won't get too personal. The more personal games are perfect for a group of close friends! Here are a couple other tips for making conversation games fun: Have a good sense of humor. Don't take the games too seriously. Remember to relax and laugh at yourself—the games are supposed to be silly! Plus, it'll show other people they can laugh at themselves, too. Be sensitive to other players. If someone seems uncomfortable answering a certain question or revealing something about themselves, don't force it. Steer the conversation away from them, or let them choose another question. Make everyone feel included. Everyone should get the chance to speak in a conversation game! Keep an eye out for all the players, and if you notice someone hasn't been able to speak in a while, make space for them to do so."
