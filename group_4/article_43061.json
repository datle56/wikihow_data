Keep firm in your decision by re-iterating your reasons for why you cannot attend. [3] X Research source To keep it friendly you can (if applicable) try joking around about the last time you asked your friend to do something and he said no. This will remind him that he has turned down your plans before, too, so he especially shouldn't be trying to guilt you into doing something."

[5] X Research source Try not to be afraid of how your friend will react. Again, as long as you are doing your part to be a good friend, you don't have to make plans with your friend every time he wants. If he reacts really negatively to your turning him down, perhaps he isn't the best friend to have around. Keeping that in mind should help alleviate your fear of his reaction.

If you don't want to hang out with your friend because they suggested something that you do not want to do or that you don't have time to do (e.g., hanging out the entire weekend), try compromising. You could let your friend know that you want to make plans but can't do the particular plan he suggested. [8] X Research source For example, if he wants to spend the whole weekend together but you're only free on Saturday, try suggesting something you both like to do that could be done on a Saturday. Is there a new movie out that you both want to see? That's one idea for a compromise; going to the movies can be fun and only takes a few hours."

To offer a sincere apology, don't breeze past it; take your time saying sorry and give your friend your full attention when you are speaking. Here is an example of how to sincerely apologize to your friend: \"I'm really sorry, I'd love to make plans with you but I just really can't this time.

If you do not wish to share the reason, you can use something more vague such as \"I'm just really swamped this weekend\" or \"my life is a bit crazy right now so I can't this weekend\" or \"thanks for the invite, and sorry, but I just really need some alone time to recuperate this weekend\". Whatever you do, if you are going to give a specific excuse, make sure it is legitimate to avoid looking like a liar or a flake.

You can also try offering a suggestion for another mutual friend he could bring along instead; this will make it clear that you want him to have a good time and care about the friendship, and that you just can't make it this particular time."

If you find yourself caving more into doing things you don't want to in person, try giving your final answer through a text message or other similar form of communication where your pushy friend can't so effectively be so pushy.

Write out the reasons why you can't or don't want to make plans, and look them over so that you remember them. This way, if your friend gets pushy, you will be less likely to forget that you really don't want to make plans. When writing your script, think about past conversations with your friend where you gave in. Try to remember how he acted or what he said that made you make plans despite you not wanting to. For example, if in the past he has said that you never say yes to his plans, you could write a script where you re-iterate the last few times that you did hang out together to show him that his claim is not true. By planning with a script, if he tries using the same tactics on you again, you will be ready to defend yourself."

By the way, did you see [insert some movie here]? What did you think?\" Try reminding your friend that people have different personalities and time constraints and that some people like to hang out more than others or do certain things that others don't enjoy. Try letting your friend know that you will make plans whenever you feel that you can, but that when you say no, you mean it, and it isn't OK for him to try to pressure you or to get angry when you say no."

This makes me feel like you don't value my perspective and my time constraints. I will absolutely make plans with you when I can, but sometimes I just can't, so it would be great for both of us, I think, if you didn't get angry when I say I can't hang out.\""
