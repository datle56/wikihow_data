      "title": "Focus on your chakras while you're stretching or meditating.",
      "content": "Focus on your chakras while you're stretching or meditating. Tantric yoga is more about spiritual balance than physical training. The main way to bring your mind and body into balance is concentrating on your chakras, or 7 specific energy points along your spine, while you're practicing. No matter which pose you're holding, focus on different chakras to get the real tantra experience. [2] X Research source The chakra locations are the base of your spine, the top of the sacrum (just above your tailbone between your hips), behind the navel, between your shoulder blades, in your throat, between your eyes, and the top of your head. Spend some time focusing on each one during your routines. You can focus on multiple chakras while you're holding the same position. It will look the same from the outside, but you'll be balancing your spiritual energy."

      "title": "Repeat a mantra to focus your mind.",
      "content": "Repeat a mantra to focus your mind. Mantras, or spiritual words, are a big part of tantrism. In general, repeat a mantra every time you release a breath. This focuses your energy and concentration. [3] X Research source The most common mantra is “Om,” but there are also other Hindu phrases you could use. In some poses, you can repeat a mantra every time you focus on one of your chakras. Yoga is a great way to strengthen your body, but it also allows you to really tap into your soul and purify your consciousness.

In all the partner poses where you’re facing each other, look into each other’s eyes for maximum intimacy. [5] X Research source Eye contact is especially important if you’re working with a romantic partner."
