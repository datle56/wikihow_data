Simplistic backpacks have 3 main spots to tie shoes to, the handle or at the base of either shoulder strap. More sophisticated hiking backpacks, meant for longer, enduring hikes, may not offer the handle option. However, these backpacks do provide a wider range of possibilities to tie your shoes to, such as through a strap/band or a clip. Try securing your footwear to a clip or carabiner to hold it on the outside of your backpack.

Remember to maintain the heel to toe shoe positioning The reason for this is to distribute the weight evenly across your backpack/body. [6] X Research source Use straps or bungee cords to strap your footwear down so it will stay firmly in place while you're hiking. If your backpack has outer pockets or flaps, you can also tuck the boots into that."

If the shoes are at your mid-back, this will eliminate the pulling effect you may feel and reduce, if not eliminate, soreness in your lower back. [7] X Research source"
