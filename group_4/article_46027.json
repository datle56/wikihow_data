You should basically avoid any activity that requires good visual acuity, such as driving or operating heavy machinery. Once your vision has returned to normal, you can resume such activities. Your vision should return to normal after a few minutes. Never rub your eyes even if you have blurred vision. Rubbing will only worsen the blurriness or injure your eye."
