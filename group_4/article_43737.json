      "content": "Pour your syrup into a saucepan on low heat. Choose a wide saucepan with high sides for a quicker reduction and keep the heat low so you don’t burn your syrup. The more syrup you put in your saucepan, the longer it will take to reduce. [1] X Research source If you have a lot of syrup you want to thicken up, you can use 2 saucepans."

      "title": "Simmer your syrup for 10 minutes as you stir it occasionally.",
      "content": "Simmer your syrup for 10 minutes as you stir it occasionally. Keep the heat down low and use a wooden spoon to stir your syrup occasionally for 10 to 15 minutes. If it starts to boil, turn the heat down so that it doesn’t get too hot. Leave your saucepan uncovered so that the liquid has somewhere to evaporate."

      "title": "Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it reaches 223 °F (106 °C).",
      "content": "Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it reaches 223 °F (106 °C). Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature in the middle of your saucepot. Once it reaches between 223 and 230 °F (106 and 110 °C), it will be thick enough to stick to pancakes or cake. [2] X Research source Keep your syrup below 241 °F (116 °C) so that it doesn’t get too thick."

      "title": "Take your syrup off the heat when it is hot enough.",
      "content": "Take your syrup off the heat when it is hot enough. Turn off the heat and let your syrup cool down for about 2 minutes. Serve your syrup while it’s still warm, and use it to sweeten up pancakes, french toast, or ice cream."

      "content": "Make a 1:1 ratio of cornstarch and water. In a small bowl, combine equal amounts of cornstarch and warm water, starting with 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of each. Mix them together with a spoon until they form a gritty paste. [3] X Research source Cornstarch is a thickening agent that won’t change the flavor of your syrup."

      "title": "Put the syrup in a saucepan over low heat.",
      "content": "Put the syrup in a saucepan over low heat. Choose a wide saucepan and pour all of your syrup into it. Turn your heat on low and wait for small bubbles to form in your syrup, stirring it occasionally. [4] X Research source Don’t let your syrup boil. If you start to see large bubbles, turn down the heat."

      "title": "Pour 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of the mixture into the syrup and stir it.",
      "content": "Pour 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of the mixture into the syrup and stir it. Start out with a little bit of your cornstarch mixture to see how it combines with the syrup. Use a wooden spoon to mix the cornstarch and the syrup together, and keep an eye on the thickness. [5] X Research source If you are thickening a light-colored berry syrup, cornstarch may make it look more dull or grainy."

Depending on how thick you’d like your syrup, you can keep adding the cornstarch mixture 1 US tbsp (15 mL) at a time every 5 minutes or so. Stir it into your syrup until it is thick enough for your liking. [6] X Research source"

If you want to save your syrup, wait until it cools down and then store it in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days. [7] X Research source Syrup tastes the best when it is eaten fresh."

      "content": "Simmer your syrup for 10 minutes on medium heat. Put your syrup in a wide, deep saucepan with high sides and turn your stovetop to medium heat. Allow your syrup to simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring it occasionally so that the bottom doesn’t burn. Gelatin works the best in liquids that have already been warmed up."

      "content": "Add 1 tbsp (14 g) of powdered gelatin to your syrup. Use a powdered, flavorless gelatin and stir it in with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes. Make sure you let it dissolve completely so that you can’t see any of the powder left in your syrup. [8] X Research source Flavorless gelatin won’t change the taste of your syrup. You can find flavorless gelatin at most grocery stores."

If your syrup isn’t thick enough after your first round of gelatin, keep adding more and stirring it in about every 5 minutes. Serve your syrup when it’s warm for the best flavor.
