[2] X Research source For example, if your equation is 2 ( 10 − 2 x ) = 4 ( 2 x + 2 ) {\\displaystyle 2(10-2x)=4(2x+2)} , use the distributive property to multiply the terms in parentheses by the number outside the parentheses: 2 ( 10 − 2 x ) = 4 ( 2 x + 2 ) {\\displaystyle 2(10-2x)=4(2x+2)} 20 − 4 x = 8 x + 8 {\\displaystyle 20-4x=8x+8}"

For example, if the term is subtracted in the equation, cancel it by adding. If the term is added in the equation, cancel it by subtracting. It is usually easiest to cancel the variable with the smaller coefficient. For example, in the equation 20 − 4 x = 8 x + 8 {\\displaystyle 20-4x=8x+8} , cancel the term − 4 x {\\displaystyle -4x} by adding 4 x {\\displaystyle 4x} : 20 − 4 x + 4 x = 8 x + 8 {\\displaystyle 20-4x+4x=8x+8} ."
