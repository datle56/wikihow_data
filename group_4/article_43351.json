      "content": "Watch how she acts around you. If you guys were friends before, if she knows you like her there may be more awkward silences. She may also avoid you a bit, even if she is interested, because she's not quite sure what to do. And if you guys are still friends, well then, great. Take it up from there."

      "title": "Look at her behavior.",
      "content": "Look at her behavior. If you guys weren't really friends before you liked her, the girl will probably not say or do anything that will let you know. Girls can be annoying that way. She may talk to you more, or completely ignore you. Basically, any drastic change in behavior is a good sign that she knows."

      "title": "Think about who you've told before.",
      "content": "Think about who you've told before. If you told any of her friends or any of your friends that you both have in common that you like her, chances are she knows."

      "content": "Stay attentive of her actions. If she knows and does like you back she will talk to you more, walk near you, sit next to you, make eye contact, twirl her hair, or give you compliments. She may also be secretive about who she likes."

      "title": "Avoid her for some time.",
      "content": "Avoid her for some time. See if she eventually talks to you but you are making one of the biggest mistakes you can. You should talk to her more and that way she might be the one to say, \"I like you\" first."
