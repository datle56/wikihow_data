      "content": "Install batteries in the device. Although some ab stimulators can be charged at the outlet, most work on battery power. The instruction manual will tell you what size batteries you'll need. You might need a small screwdriver to remove the cover so you can put the batteries in. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's usually a good idea to remove the batteries when you're not using your ab stimulator to avoid draining them too quickly and prevent the device from accidentally being turned on. Some devices come with rechargeable batteries. Plug your device in to charge it fully before using it for the first time."

Press the gel pads into your skin, then release slowly to make sure they've adhered properly. Each device is configured differently, so check the instruction manual for diagrams that show you how to correctly position your device. If the gel pads won't stick at first, wipe your skin with a cloth doused in rubbing alcohol, dry it thoroughly, then try again. Residual moisture on your skin might make it difficult for the pads to stick. [6] X Research source"

At least the first time you use your stimulator, take a seat before you turn it on to give yourself more stability. The initial muscle contractions may catch you off guard. [7] X Research source Make sure you know how to turn the stimulator off and how to adjust the settings while it's on your body, just in case you have to change them. If the stimulator feels uncomfortable or painful, or if you develop a cramp in your abdominal muscles, turn it off immediately and remove it from your body."

      "title": "Increase the intensity every 5 to 10 sessions.",
      "content": "Increase the intensity every 5 to 10 sessions. Using a higher intensity before your muscles are ready for it can lead to shock and cramping. Even if you're relatively fit, starting at the lowest intensity is usually best. Gradually upping the intensity helps you avoid cramping and muscle soreness. Increase the time you use the ab stimulator following the same schedule. You might want to stagger the time increase and the intensity increase so you have at least one shorter session at a higher intensity before increasing the time. For example, you might do 5 10-minute sessions at light intensity, then raise the intensity to moderate for 2 sessions, then increase the length of your session to 15 minutes."

In the US, as of 2020, there are 2 devices approved by the FDA, both manufactured by Bio Medical Research Ltd.: the Flex Belt and the Slendertone. [14] X Research source Avoid devices that haven't been inspected or approved for use. While you might be able to save a few bucks, you also risk being injured while using a device that isn't safe."
