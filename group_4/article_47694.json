      "content": "A strapless bra provides support without being visible. Plus, there are lots of styles and varieties to choose from! Instead of battling traditional bra straps, try a classic strapless or bandeau bra instead. Adhesive and backless bras also offer a lot of flexibility and freedom. [1] X Research source If your off-the-shoulder dress has a plunging neckline, a plunge or short line bra might be a good option. Body tape is another handy choice if you’re in a pinch."
