      "content": "Learn power chords on the guitar to play any pop punk song. Power chords are the backbone of every punk song ever written. They are short, easy to play, and sound great when played loud. A power chord is just three notes -- your index finger on the E or A string, and the next two strings fretted two frets down. You can move this form anywhere on the guitar to play every single chord. For example, an A, G, D, chord would look like: A-Chord | G-Chord | D-Chord | |e|----x-----|------x------|-----x------| |B|----x----|------x------|-----x------| |G|----x----|------x------|-----7------| |D|----7----|------5------|-----7------| |A|----7----|------5------|-----5------| |E|----5----|------3------|-----x------|"

      "content": "Follow the guitar chords on bass to get the basics of pop punk. Bass players have a lot to look forward to in pop punk. If you're stuck or a newbie, quickly repeated 16th notes on the bass (basically playing one note over and over again) can follow the chords on the guitar to instantly fit in. For example, if the guitarist is playing an A-bar chord, you play the A note in time with each one of her chords. From here you can feel free to improvise during chord changes, before switching to the chorus or verse, or if you can think of a fun bass riff. Check out Green Day's \"She,\" which opens with a great but simple bass riff, and note how it follows the guitar, but with subtle flourishes. Rancid's \"Olympia, WA\" is almost straight 16th notes on the bass, carrying the song along."

      "content": "Focus on your kick, snare, and hi-hat on the drums for a driving, strong beat. You want to keep the song moving forward with a quick, regular beat. Sixteenth notes on the hi-hat, alternating the kick drum and the snare every other note. While there is a lot more to drumming than this, this basic beat can go behind any pop punk song. Big, quick fills on the toms and crash cymbals are the common way to transition into new parts of the song. Pop-punk drummers like Travis Barker are talented musicians who drive the song forward. Focus on keeping time perfectly, especially at high speeds, to become an invaluable drummer."

      "title": "Start writing a song with just one good guitar riff.",
      "content": "Start writing a song with just one good guitar riff. 95% of pop punk songs are short, fast, and guitar-driven. Find 3-4 notes or power chords that you think sound good together and make up a short little phrase to repeat. Most pop-punk songs are simple -- find a riff you like and repeat it to write a verse or chorus. Chop up and change your favorite riffs from other bands. Pop-punk is heavily borrowed, adapted, and repeated. In general, three power chords are the bare minimum for a song. Play with the rhythm and timing of your chords to give them a unique spin."

      "content": "Write a new riff for the chorus or verse, so you have two unique melodies. To be honest, many bands play the exact same chords, just in a different order or tempo (listen to the Ramones for proof). In general, the verse is slower and or muted and the chorus gets louder, faster, and more melodic. When coming up with a chorus: Keep it simple -- the chorus should not be hard to follow. Aim for catchy melodies -- this is where you hook people's ears. Add a short, improvised 1-2 bar riff coming in and out of the chorus to mark each change."

      "title": "Consider coming up with one new section for the breakdown or solo.",
      "content": "Consider coming up with one new section for the breakdown or solo. After hearing the verse and chorus twice, most bands add in one quick, unique section to change the song up. This is called the breakdown, and there is often a solo, different lyrics, or a slow drop and build back to full energy or tempo. They are usually slower, either building up power or leaving room for another instrument to play by itself. If you're struggling to write breakdowns, try to: Play the verse or chorus at half-time. Replay or change up the intro riff or melody. Simplify the chords to the 1-2 most important ones, leaving space for vocals or a solo. Drop out certain instruments, then slowly build them back in."

      "content": "Follow the basic pop song structure when crafting songs. Most pop punk songs begin with an intro, and they usually then follow this order: Intro, first verse, second verse, chorus, third verse, chorus solo and/or bridge, and then finish with the chorus again or outro. Though some songs will be different, this is the most common structure of a Pop Punk song. Blink-182's \"Dammit\" is an excellent example. All you have to write is a riff for the verse, the chorus, and the bridge. when it comes to solos, they are usually very simple. Occasionally it's just the intro again, and in some cases there are no solos at all"

      "content": "Play the song as fast as possible. Pop punk is not about sitting back quietly. It is about brash, loud, youthful energy. All pop-punk songs should be played as fast as you feel comfortable, and maybe even a little faster. Once you've got the structure down, start thrashing. When you play live, your number one goal is to have high, contagious energy. Quick songs make it much easier to get people jumping around with you. It is rare for songs to go longer than three minutes. Many are even over before the two minute mark."

      "content": "Pick up influences from other bands and genres to make your songs stand out. Pop-punk, luckily enough, is easily adapted to other influences and ideas. Keep playing music of all types to learn new riffs and styles. It is the best way to make your own song unique. Common genres to blend with pop punk include: Ska and Reggae (Rancid, Operation Ivy, Less Than Jake. Country (Social Distortion, Lucero) Swing/Rockabilly (The Misfits, Cobra Skulls)."

      "content": "Come up with one image, idea, or person to write a song about. Pop-punk songs can be about almost anything. Most commonly, however, they talk about love, adolescence, and rebellion. Unlike its older cousin punk, pop-punk songs are focused more on melodies and relatable lyrics than hard-hitting social criticism. Common subjects include: Love and heartbreak Suburban angst Rebellion against school, parents, etc. Joke-y and goofy lyrics Growing up."

      "content": "Focus on a simple, catchy chorus before anything else. Pop music, no matter what subgenre, is about music that hooks the listener in. You want everyone singing or humming your chorus when the song is done. Keep it short, simple, and make sure it sounds great. Whistling the lyrics is a great way to hear the melody. Write lyrics so that they sound great even when you're just whistling. Green Day, Blink-182, Operation Ivy, and Rancid are great bands on their own, but it is their ability to write a catchy, radio-friendly chorus got them famous."

      "content": "Make verses short, matching the same length and rhyme scheme for each. The easiest way to write song lyrics is in rhyming couplets . Basically, you write one line, then write another line that rhymes with it. These lyrics need to flesh out your chorus and idea. If you're stuck with the verses, you might-- Tell a story (\"Timebomb\") Describe related moments or images about a girl, life, school (\"Story of my Life.\"). Explore a theme or idea, using each verse to talk about a different aspect (\"Longview\")."

      "content": "Consider adding a refrain or sing-along section. The sing-along, often little more than \"lalalas\" \"oooohhhs\" and \"ahhhhhhs,\" is a staple of pop-punk. Often used in the chorus or outro, a good sing-along section is key for a pop-punk section. You don't need one in every song, but even something as simple as \"nananana nanananana\" in \"All the Small Things\" is the difference between a good song and a hit."

      "content": "Get personal. Pop punk is personal medium. Your own worries, fears, and anger will fit right at home in the lyrics, so don't shy away from personal stories or opinions. Punk is known as an inclusive, do-it-yourself genre, so just be yourself. Even somewhat angsty, emo-type lyrics work well, as evidenced by Good Charlotte, Fall Out Boy, and Screeching Weasel. Feel free to get weird. The Lillingtons, for example, made their mark with sci-fi inspired songs. Feel free to be funny. Pop-punk has a long history of pranksters and joke songs, from the poppier NOFX songs to the self-awareness of The Steinways."
