      "content": "Wear leg warmers with flats and tights. If it's 40 degrees outside and you're just dying to wear that dress, leg warmers and leggings or footless tights are a great option. Black tights and black leg warmers are an understated, classic combination. It's like wearing boots, but much more comfortable! Make sure they're a little bit bunched, especially around the ankle. They shouldn't be so low they're dragging on the ground, but there should be overlap between your shoe and the leg warmer."

      "title": "Wear 'em with pumps.",
      "content": "Wear 'em with pumps. This one takes a bit more confidence, though it's a totally acceptable look. As long as your heels are on the understated side, leg warmers will look good. Stick to heels that are nude, brown, black, or gray. Leg warmers are a cozy look. If you're wearing stripper heels that glow-in-the-dark, leg warmers will look a bit out of place. Unless your leg warmers are glow-in-the-dark too, of course."

      "title": "Wear leg warmers with a skirt.",
      "content": "Wear leg warmers with a skirt. This is the same concept as with a dress. Tights are only necessary if the weather requires it, though they can streamline the leg. If you have a skirt that's a little on the short side, leg warmers can make it more modest. [3] X Research source Your shoe options are endless here. Flats, pumps, boots -- it's all good. Just keep the colors neutral yet varied!"

      "content": "Wear 'em over skinny jeans. [4] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 21 October 2021. [5] X Research source You know those skinny jeans you have, but your pear shape makes you feel a little funny wearing them too often? Wear leg warmers over them! Problem immediately solved. Again, your footwear here can be anything. Anything but flip flops!"

      "title": "Wear them peeking above your calf-high boots.",
      "content": "Wear them peeking above your calf-high boots. For an extra textual touch (or a bit more warmth), wear them just peeking above your boots. Anywhere from 2-6 inches is good. [6] X Research source Don't worry about matching colors. Unless you're wearing black, this will be hard to do. Different shades of brown and beige are totally fine. It'll just draw attention to your attention for detail!"

      "title": "Wear them on top of your ankle boots.",
      "content": "Wear them on top of your ankle boots. If the pants, skirt, or dress you're wearing don't go well with your calf-high boots, you can get a similar look with ankle boots and leg warmers. Just pull them a bit over the tops of your booties and scrunch 'em up! [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Go totally urban.",
      "content": "Go totally urban. Wear them with Converse or Converse high tops for an urban look. No one said leg warmers had to be for dressed up occasions! You can wear them whenever you want! [8] X Research source Fashion is, as of late, about intentional chaos. [6] X Research source If it doesn't go together, in a way it...goes together. A quick Google search will verify this if you're skeptical. So if you're think you're not in line with current trends, just in being so, you are. Blowing your mind, huh?"

      "title": "Rumple them up a little bit.",
      "content": "Rumple them up a little bit. Leg warmers are not meant to be stretched flat. You want them below your knee and appearing a bit loose. If you don't have them hidden by a boot, they should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) from your knee, extending down to just above your heel."

    {
      "title": "Stick to neutral colors.",
      "content": "Stick to neutral colors. What makes leg warmers wearable after the millennium is their inconspicuousness. When they used to be neon yellow and pink, now they're mostly donned in browns, beiges, blacks, navies, and creams. While they don't have to be a color in your outfit necessarily, stick to neutrals that match everything. Leg warmers are a definite accessory and shouldn't really be a focal point. If your eye goes straight to your leg warmers, you're probably doing it wrong."

      "title": "Get leg warmers in neon colors and patterns.",
      "content": "Get leg warmers in neon colors and patterns. 1983 was awesome. If you weren't there, know that it was awesome. You could practically go hunting in your day clothes you were so brightly-colored. Sunglasses were worn just so you could look at your friends' bright orange shoulder pads. Sadly the 80s are over, but you can bring them back with some bright plaid leg warmers! They can either be a solid, bright color or several colors in a pattern. As long as they can't be missed, you're good. Magenta, lemon yellow, magenta and lemon yellow in a paisley pattern -- don those bad boys like you're being paid by Cosmo."

      "content": "Wear those ell-dubs with matching fingerless gloves. Someone less in tune with fashion history would call this \"overkill.\" But the 80s didn't have such a word in their vocabulary and fingerless gloves the same color and pattern as your legwarmers were a go-to look. It's called \"matching\" and it never occurred to anyone 30 years ago that it could be a bad thing. Does your local leg warmer supply warehouse not have matching fingerless gloves? Well for one, shame on them. For two, looks like you're going to have to take matters into your own hands. Take out that sweater your grandma knitted you in 2007 and put it to good use. Turn the arms into leg warmers and whip up some palm warmers out of the shoulders. She'll be glad you did something with it. '83 was thirty years ago . If that fact makes you a little nauseated, you're not alone."

You'll look like you're straight outta Olivia Newton John's \"Physical\" video. [9] X Research source You may not want to take this look to the gym, however.

The 80s were a little less...put together than fashion is now. How do you think they birthed the grunge era? Because of this, wear your leg warmers with anything. Tennis shoes? Sure. Chucks? Sure. The question is: Are your legs cold? If the answer is yes, wear leg warmers. Most people are a little bit hipster, whatever that means. If you have any of that I-just-grabbed-this-out-of-my-closet-and-I-look-super attitude in you, leg warmers are a safe bet. If none of your outfit goes together, your leg warmers make sense. In other words, it's a crazy, mixed-up world, and you can't do it wrong. Leg warmers in the morning', leg warmers, in the evening', leg warmers at dinner time. You can definitely match them with any other accessory in your outfit. [11] X Expert Source Elle Monus Image Consultant Expert Interview. 21 October 2021."
