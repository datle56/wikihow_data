      "content": "Use a conversational tone in your speech. [1] X Expert Source Patrick Muñoz Voice & Speech Coach Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Keeping your speech simple and conversational will help it reach the maximum amount of potential voters and will prevent people from not understanding your points or tuning you out. Avoid using long words that are hard to pronounce or sentences that are overly complex just to sound smart. This will prevent you from stumbling on your words when you deliver the speech. You should write the speech with phrases and words that you normally use when talking to people. For example, don’t write something like, “Voters and citizens, the abhorrent nature of my opponent while he assumed the position as treasurer saw that governmental coffers were drained to their lowest point in a decade!” Instead, write something like, “Can you really trust my opponent? When he was treasurer so much money went missing that we’re now at the lowest level in 10 years!”"

[2] X Expert Source Patrick Muñoz Voice & Speech Coach Expert Interview. 12 November 2019.

[3] X Research source If you’re running for school president you can say something like, “Hey everyone. Today I’ll be talking about the important things that everyone here cares about, like the quality of our lunch, access to sports, and lack of programs and what faculty can do to fix it.” If you're running for city council or mayor, you can say something like, “Thank you to everyone who decided to come. Today I’ll be talking about how essential educational investment is and what we can do about bringing jobs and industry back to our town.”"

      "title": "Create a paragraph for each point you want to make.",
      "content": "Create a paragraph for each point you want to make. Start the paragraph by stating the issue and end the paragraph with the solution. Each point in the speech should be set up as an issue or problem facing the voters and how you'll provide the solution. Make a separate paragraph for each issue that you want to talk about in your speech. [4] X Research source If you're running for school president your paragraph could start something like \"We all know that school lunch is bad, but would it surprise you to find out it's actually unhealthy? I have a plan to work with facility to improve the quality of our lunches.\" If you're running for a federal office, you could write \"There are many issues that face us today, but one of the most important things right now is access to healthcare. My plan for a single-payer system will ensure that everyone, regardless of income, will be able to afford high-quality health services in our state. I believe that healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.\" Jumping from point to point will only confuse the listeners.

We've all seen the videos online and we know how dedicated he is to getting better. But we don't have a team here. And that needs to change!\" For instance, if you’re talking about increasing the minimum wage, you could say something like, “I know a girl in my district named Gabby who is a single mother without her high school diploma. She’s one of the hardest workers and most genuine people I have ever met, but she is on government assistance because the only job she can get will only pay $8 an hour. This is just not an income that can sustain any sort of family, and it’s up to us to make sure that corporations reward workers who put in the effort and do the right thing. That’s why I’m proposing a major increase of the minimum wage over the next 5 years to $15 per hour.”"

And I've also layed out every way we can solve these problems together.
