      "content": "Pick a gentle, natural soap. The inside part of your genitals, known as the vagina, is self-cleaning—which means you don’t need to wash it. However, it’s a good idea to clean the outer parts, including the folds of the labia (the “lips” that surround your vagina) and the rest of the pubic area. To avoid irritation, choose the simplest soap possible. Look for white varieties that have the fewest ingredients in them and that don’t contain harsh chemicals. [1] X Research source Soaps with lots of dyes, perfumes, or other harsh ingredients can irritate your vulva or cause allergic reactions and itchiness. Unscented glycerin or Castile soap is a good option. Don’t use soaps, douches, or intimate washes to clean the inside of your vagina unless instructed by a doctor."

      "content": "Avoid perfumed soft soaps or other liquids to prevent irritation. Fancy soaps with fragrances aren’t healthy to use on your body’s most sensitive parts and can cause itchiness or redness. Read the bottle of soap you’re thinking about picking carefully to see if it contains heavy fragrances or other chemicals that could irritate your body. [2] X Research source Steer clear of antiseptic intimate washes as well. These can disrupt the healthy bacteria that your body needs."

      "content": "Look out for products with misleading labels. Many intimate washes will have claims on the bottles saying that they help your body maintain healthy pH levels or will keep your vagina super clean. However, your vagina is self-cleaning and maintains its own pH level perfectly, so it doesn’t need extra soaps to help it do this. [3] X Research source Products with these kinds of claims on them will likely have harmful chemicals or fragrances in them, making it important to check the ingredients list first."

      "content": "See a doctor if you’re experiencing lasting symptoms. An intimate wash isn’t going to fix itchiness, redness, or worse symptoms that you’ve had for a while, and can possibly make them worse. Visit your doctor if you’re worried about your reproductive health so they can give you directions for how to get better. [4] X Research source If you notice a change in odor, schedule a checkup. This could be because of pregnancy, your menstrual cycle, or a change in diet, but it’s best to check with your healthcare provider to make sure."

      "content": "Use a small amount of mild soap with warm water. It’s easiest to use intimate wash while you’re in the shower. Use a dime-sized amount of soap—since you’re washing such a small area, you barely need any soap at all. [5] X Research source Avoid using water that’s too hot. Pick a basic, unscented soap."

Splash the soapy water around your vulva, or use the washcloth to gently pat the area clean. [6] X Research source Avoid using the washcloth to aggressively rub the area or you might cause irritation."

Putting soaps or sprays into your body to wash your vagina can mess up its natural pH balance and get rid of important healthy bacteria.

While douching and other internal cleansers are heavily marketed, avoid using them to keep your body safe and healthy."
