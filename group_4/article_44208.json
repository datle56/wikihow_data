Having your Shih Tzu familiar with her crate can help with vet trips, road trips, and other incidents where your Shih Tzu may need to be temporarily confined. Pick a small dog crate for your shih tzu. You only need enough room for your Shih Tzu to sit, stand, and turn around. [1] X Research source Crates should also have ventilation on all four sides. It's not a bad idea to keep the crate somewhere in your home where you hang out frequently. That way, your Shih Tzu can occasionally go in her crate while still feeling like part of the family. [2] X Research source Going in the crate should be thought of as a treat rather than a punishment. [3] X Expert Source Ty Brown Dog Trainer Expert Interview. 4 June 2020.

[5] X Research source It is important not to treat the crate as a \"cage\" or \"prison\" and to keep use to a minimum. If necessary, when you are home keep the dog on a lead so you can keep an eye on him and take him outside to toilet as soon as you spot signs of him wanting to toilet."

      "content": "Decide whether you want your dog to go inside or outside. While most owners prefer their pets eliminate outside, as Shih Tzus are smaller pets many apartment dwellers own them. If you don't have easy access to the street or a yard, you may want your Shih Tzu to eliminate inside on newspaper or padding. Paper training's main pro is convenience. For people who have difficulty taking a dog outside for whatever reason, whether a busy schedule or a physical problems, paper training can be an alternative option. In addition to padding and newspaper, dog litter boxes are sold in many pet stores. [6] X Research source Paper training's main drawback is that it creates odor and might not be the best option for your dog. Shih Tzu are high energy and crave the outdoors. [7] X Research source Whichever route you go with, it's important to be consistent. Shih Tzus may get confused if they're told they can sometimes use a pad but are sometimes expected to go outside. Shih Tzus need a strict schedule for training, so you'll need to pick one option or the other. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Teach your Shih Tzu to be alone. Shih Tzus are highly social dogs and want to be with their owners as much as possible. Separation anxiety is a problem for Shih Tzus and, as it's not possible to bring your dog everywhere, you need to train your Shih Tzu to adapt to solitude. A crate can be an excellent way to lessen separation anxiety. Shih Tzus tend to be less nervous about being left alone if they have a place of their own to retreat to. Make your Shih Tzu's crate comfortable, with bedding and toys, and leave the crate door open when you are home. This way, the Shih Tzu will not see the crate as a forced experience but her own special refuge. Some people are wary of leaving their dogs in crates, especially if they're gone for long hours during the day. If this is the case with you, you could try allowing your Shih Tzu access to your bedroom, study, or another closed off area of the house where she feels safe."

      "title": "Expose your Shih Tzu to a variety of sounds and experiences.",
      "content": "Expose your Shih Tzu to a variety of sounds and experiences. Shih Tzus might develop nervous tendencies if overly coddled. This can result in timidness and even aggression. Expose your Shih Tzu to a variety of sounds and experiences. Sounds like whistles, lawn mowers, sirens, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and other day-to-day noises should be familiar to your Shih Tzu. As separation anxiety is an issue, you don't want to risk her hearing an innocuous noise and panicking while you're gone. Exposing your Shih Tzu to a variety of stimuli simply means taking her with you different places and remaining calm and collected in the face of loud or sudden noises. Dogs pick up on cues from their owners. If you get frightened or anticipate a negative behavior from your dog, it's more likely to occur. Staying calm in the face of sudden noises, other dogs, or other people can help your dog stay calm. Do not treat her any differently so she sees the event is normal and not be feared. If she displays any timid behavior, such as cowering or whimpering, it's okay to say something soothing to her or to provide with a treat to make the moment seem happy and positive. However, do not remove her from the situation, pick her up, or otherwise overreact as this encourages an overreaction in the dog. Oftentimes, owners are overprotective of small dogs, leading to what is known as \"small dog syndrome.\" Owners ignore aggressive behavior, like biting, and try to protect smaller dogs from bigger animals by picking them up or panicking when they interact with larger breeds. The combination of lack of discipline and coddling means smaller dogs end up both fearful and somewhat aggressive. Allow your Shih Tzu to safely interact with bigger animals and scold her if she bites or redirect the nipping towards a toy or treat. [15] X Research source"

They provide the foundation for solid training. To teach your Shih Tzu to sit, at first you should stand before her and say \"sit.\" Then, use a treat and draw an arc over the puppy' s head so that as his head goes up his bottom goes down.

[25] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Sit is an important command for maintaining control over your Shih Tzu. You'll need her to sit when people come to the door, before you take her for walks, and in other situations where she needs to remain calm.

Start the same way you started teaching her to sit. Ask her to sit, and then use a treat to lure him into a lying position.

      "content": "Allow for flexibility. Shih Tzus love their people, but they're not as people pleasing as other breeds. They tend to be stubborn and may not consistently follow your rules. A Shih Tzu's mood is dynamic. She may be willing to sit and stay one day in order to get a treat, but may show no interest in the treat the next day. You can't always use the same training tactics with a Shih Tzu. You might have to switch up how you reward and punish behavior. If your Shih Tzu is ignoring food one day, try rewarding her with praise, toys, or a walk. Shih Tzus are a highly intelligent breed and expect rewards for good behavior. Have a variety of ideas on hand to reward your dog for being good."

Although Shih Tzus can be notoriously difficult to train due to their stubborn streak, being firm with them without resorting to scolding or heavy discipline, is an effective means of training. If your Shih Tzu is acting out or misbehaving, it's better to simply ignore the behavior. Do not give in to jumping, biting, or other attention grabbing behaviors. Do not make eye contact with your Shih Tzu if she misbehaves and do not speak to her or touch her. If your Shih Tzu realizes certain behaviors do not result in attention, she'll cease using them. Always praise a Shih Tzu for behaving well. Shih Tzus enjoy human interaction and affection and are willing to work for praise. Positive reinforcing good behaviors while ignoring bad ones is a great way to get your Shih Tzu to behave."

If you have young children, consider opting for a different breed or keeping your kids and your dog separate."
