      "title": "Pick a pan with raised ridges.",
      "content": "Pick a pan with raised ridges. Generally, grill pans with dramatically raised ridges are better than those with gentle or shallow ridges. Ultimately, the deeper the ridges, the more dramatic your sear mark. In addition, the larger the ridges, the more grill-like your final product will appear. Look for a grill pan with ridges that are taller than 1 ⁄ 2 centimetre (0.20 in)."

      "title": "Choose a cast iron pan.",
      "content": "Choose a cast iron pan. Cast iron pans tend to retain more heat than pans with a nonstick surface. In addition, cast iron pans tend to mimic the grill better than nonstick surfaces. Finally, cast iron pans will sear your food better than nonstick pans. While nonstick pans are easier to clean, they won’t cook your food the same way. Avoid using a cast iron grill pan if you have a ceramic stovetop."

      "title": "Go with a square-shaped grill pan.",
      "content": "Go with a square-shaped grill pan. Round grill pans work fine, but they offer less surface area than square grill pans. With a square grill pan, you'll have more room to cook your favorite meats and vegetables. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for a grill pan with a matching press if you want defined grill marks.",
      "content": "Look for a grill pan with a matching press if you want defined grill marks. Some grill pans come with matching presses you can use to press the down the food as it cooks to enhance the grill marks. You can still get grill marks without a press, but they may not be as defined or even."

      "title": "Get a pan with a lid if you want your food to taste like it was made on a grill.",
      "content": "Get a pan with a lid if you want your food to taste like it was made on a grill. When you cook on an actual grill, you usually close the grill lid to trap in heat, smoke, and flavor as the food cooks. Covering your grill pan with a lid while you're cooking food on it can help create the same effect."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse and dry the pan.",
      "content": "Rinse and dry the pan. Before you use the pan to cook on, quickly rinse it with warm water. This will make sure any dust that accumulated on the pan while it was being stored is washed away. After rinsing, dry the pan with a clean cloth. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut your food into relatively thin slices.",
      "content": "Cut your food into relatively thin slices. Because you’re trying to simulate the grilling experience without burning your food, you’ll need to slice your food relatively thin. This way, your food will get char marks and a smoky taste but won’t burn while you’re trying to cook the inside. Some foods you can prepare using a grill pan include: Thin hamburgers, slices of chicken, or steak. Bacon and eggs. Vegetable slices like zucchini, potatoes, carrots, peppers, or onions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush oil on the food.",
      "content": "Brush oil on the food. Before placing your food on the pan, carefully brush oil on your food. By brushing oil onto the food instead of the pan, you’ll make sure the food doesn’t stick and the oil doesn't burn on the pan. Use an oil with a high smoking point, like peanut oil, canola oil, avocado oil, or soybean oil. Avoid using olive oil, which has a low smoking point. Avoid brushing oil on the entire pan, as it may burn."
    },
    {
      "title": "Preheat the pan on medium high.",
      "content": "Preheat the pan on medium high. Allow the pan to heat for at least five minutes. By doing this, you’ll make sure the entire surface of the pan is equally hot. This will ensure your food cooks evenly. In addition, it’ll help you get good char/grill marks. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your food on the pan.",
      "content": "Place your food on the pan. When the pan has had sufficient time to heat up, you’ll need to gently place your food in it. Do so with tongs or other grill equipment. Allow half an inch (1.25 cm) between large items (like pieces of chicken or steak). Lay the food perpendicular to the grill ridges so you get grill marks. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the pan.",
      "content": "Cover the pan. While grill pans seldom come with covers, covering the pan may increase the speed with which your food cooks. In addition, it may enhance the smoky/charred flavor. To cover your pan, carefully place a lid or upside-down metal bowl over the food on the grill pan. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Avoid moving food for about one minute.",
      "content": "Avoid moving food for about one minute. Once you place the food onto your grill pan, you shouldn’t flip it or move it for about a minute. By leaving it in place, you’ll help create those sear/grill marks that add so much character to your food. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rotate or move your food after a minute or two if needed.",
      "content": "Rotate or move your food after a minute or two if needed. If you think your food is burning or cooking unevenly, use tongs to rotate the food slightly. Depending on the food, your pan, and your stove, you may need to experiment to determine how often you need to rotate your food. Keep in mind that rotating the food will cause the grill marks to be diamond-shaped instead of straight lines."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip your food.",
      "content": "Flip your food. Once you’ve rotated your food and allowed it to sit for several minutes, you’ll need to flip it. Flipping it is important so that you cook the food evenly. In addition, flipping your food will help prevent burning. If you’re cooking steak that is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, allow it to sit for 3-5 minutes on one side before moving or flipping it. If you’re cooking chicken that is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, allow it to cook for 5-10 minutes on each side. Let pork cook for 6-7 minutes on one side before flipping it. Flip burgers after 3 minutes. Cook bratwurst for 5 minutes before flipping. Allow shrimp to cook for 2-3 minutes before flipping. Let vegetables cook for 3-4 minutes on one side before flipping them over. If you notice your food charring or burning too much, flip it more. If it continues to burn, turn your heat down.

      "title": "Take the temperature of your food.",
      "content": "Take the temperature of your food. If you’re cooking meat, you should take its temperature before you remove it from the pan. This way, you’ll make sure the inside of the meat has risen to minimum temperatures that will guarantee it is safe to eat. Without taking the temperature, you’ll simply be guessing about whether the food is done and safe. Shellfish should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). Poultry should be cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). Beef, pork, veal, and lamb should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). Ground meat should be cooked to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).

      "content": "Clean the pan with hot water. After you’ve allowed the pan to cool, rinse it thoroughly with hot water. Then, take a clean cloth, soak it in hot water, and carefully wipe the pan down. Focus on the grooves in between the ridges. To clean them good, take your finger, cover it with the cloth and wipe along the groove. Rinse the cloth from time-to-time. After cleaning the grill pan, dry it thoroughly with a towel. Allowing it to air dry will invite rust. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Season the pan if it's cast iron.",
      "content": "Season the pan if it's cast iron. Before storing a cast iron grill pan, you want to rub a light coat of vegetable oil onto the pan with a paper towel. Then, place the pan on the middle rack of your oven and set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Let the pan bake for 1 hour, turn the oven off, and allow the pan to cool. Seasoning your pan after each use may increase the effectiveness of your cooking and prolong the life of your pan. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the pan in a dry location. When storing your cast iron grill pan, you’ll want to make sure to put it in an area that is dry. If you put it in a humid location – like in an outside storage area – it could wind up rusting. As a result, try to store it in a pantry or another location that is cool and dry."
