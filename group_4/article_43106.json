      "content": "Foul, moldy odor When your brussel sprouts are still fresh and good to eat, they won’t have much of an odor or they may smell a little earthy. Brussel sprouts normally only smell after you cook them, so toss out any that have any strong odors while they’re still raw. [1] X Research source When you cook brussel sprouts , it’s normal if they have a slight scent of sulfur. Compounds breaking down in the leaves during cooking release the smell."

      "content": "Yellow or wilted leaves Fresh brussel sprouts have bright green leaves that are tightly compacted together. As the brussel sprouts get older and start to spoil, their color lightens and the leaves soften and separate. [2] X Research source If only the outermost leaves are yellow or wilted, just peel them off and cook the rest of the brussel sprout. If it looks wilted or yellow throughout the entire veggie, then toss it out. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Mushy or slimy texture Brussel sprouts feel firm and dry to the touch while they’re fresh, but bacteria that cause spoilage will break down and soften the leaves. If you feel a slimy film or if your brussel sprouts have soft tender spots, then throw them away instead of eating them. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Black or brown spots",
      "content": "Black or brown spots Brussel sprout leaves normally look bright green and have light green or white stalks. While they age, more brown and black spots form as the leaves deteriorate. If you notice multiple dark brown or black spots covering the leaves and stalk, the brussel sprouts have started going bad and it’s time to toss them. [5] X Research source If the brown or black spots are light and only on the outer layers, peel off the leaves or slice the stalk with a sharp knife. If it still looks brown or black, then throw the brussel sprout away."

      "title": "Multiple insects inside the leaves",
      "content": "Multiple insects inside the leaves Brussel sprouts are a little prone to pests like aphids and beetles that may hide between the tightly packed leaves. Cabbage worms may also chew through leaves and create holes. While you can rinse away a stray bug here or there, it’s better just to throw your brussel sprouts away if they’re crawling with pests.

      "content": "Unpleasant, sour odors While cooked brussel sprouts already have a slight sulfur smell, the odor may turn sour the longer you keep them in your fridge. If you notice that your brussel sprouts have a different smell than they had before, play it safe and throw them away instead of risking getting sick. [8] X Research source Bacteria may grow on leftovers even if there are no signs of mold or odors. If you’re not sure how long the brussel sprouts have been stored, it’s best to throw them out to play it safe."
