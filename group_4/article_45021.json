      "content": "Check that your bouzouki is Greek and not Irish. Double check before you tune your instrument because Greek and Irish bouzoukis are generally tuned to different patterns. The easiest way to tell the difference between a Greek and Irish bouzouki is to look at their shape. A Greek bouzouki has a bowl-shaped back, while the back of an Irish bouzouki is flat. [1] X Research source You can also look at the scale length of your instrument to determine whether it’s a Greek or Irish bouzouki. A Greek bouzouki will have a longer scale, measuring around 680mm (about 27 inches), while an Irish bouzoukis scale length measures around 530mm (about 21 inches). [2] X Research source"

Other versions of the Greek bouzouki have four string courses with two strings each, or a total of eight strings. [3] X Research source"

Determine which tuning pegs adjust which strings before you begin tuning your instrument. With the front face of your bouzouki facing you, look at the tuning pegs: The two tuning pegs on the lower left side of your bouzouki will adjust the highest-pitched string course, while the two knobs on the lower right side will adjust the lowest-pitched string course. The two remaining top knobs on each side will adjust the middle-pitched string course. [4] X Research source"

With the front of your bouzouki facing you, look at the tuning pegs: The two tuning pegs on the lower right side of your bouzouki will adjust the lowest-pitched string course. The two pegs on the upper right side and the two pegs on the upper left side will adjust the middle-pitched string courses.

Begin by tuning the string course located at the bottom of the instrument, which contains the highest-pitched strings. [6] X Research source After finishing your adjustments to the bottom course, move on to the next string course up the scale. Keep moving up, one course at a time, until you reach and tune the top course, which contains the lowest-pitched strings."

The bottom course of your bouzouki should be tuned to the appropriate note above Middle C. For both six-string and eight-string bouzoukis, this would be the D just above Middle C (d' or D 4 ).

If the tone sounds flat or too low, tighten the string by turning the tuning peg clockwise. If the tone sounds sharp or too high, loosen the string by twisting the tuning peg counterclockwise. [8] X Research source You may need to play the correct note several times on your pitch pipe or tuning instrument. Keep the sound in your mind for as long as possible and replay it each time you feel uncertain of how much further to adjust the course."

The display on your tuner should read something like: \"440 Hz\" or \"A = 440.\" [10] X Research source Every tuner is adjusted differently. Read the instructions that came with your tuner to find out how to adjust its frequency. Typically, there is a \"mode\" or \"frequency\" button on the device that you can press. You should set the frequency on your tuner to 440 Hz. If your tuner prompts you to set the frequency by instrument, choose the “bouzouki” or \"guitar\" setting."
