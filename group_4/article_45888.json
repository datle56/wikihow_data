      "title": "Test the Ph level of your soil.",
      "content": "Test the Ph level of your soil. Wet your soil a bit with distilled water. Sprinkle a handful of baking soda over the damp soil. If it begins to bubble, your soil is acidic, meaning its pH is below 5, and will not be able to support healthy plant growth. If your soil is acidic, you can raise its pH level by mixing ground or powdered lime into the soil. Over time, your soil will become more alkaline. Wood ashes might also help. [1] X Expert Source Ben Barkan Garden & Landscape Designer Expert Interview. 2 June 2020. Search online to find out what pH level the plants you plan on growing require before you make any changes to the soil."

If you have an ant problem in your garden, mix confectioners’ sugar and baking soda in equal amounts. For instance, you might mix five teaspoons of baking soda and five teaspoons of confectioner’s sugar. Sprinkle the powder in the vicinity of the ant hills. The ants will eat the powdered mix and die. [10] X Research source You might choose to add a spoonful of water to the mix after you’ve combined the sugar and baking soda to help it clump together. Don’t use regular sugar, as it won’t cling to the baking soda in the way confectioner’s sugar will."
