This could include your cell phone, tablet, iPod Touch, Game Boy, laptop, D.S., some books, a notebook or diary, pencils, MP3 player, snacks and/or drinks, or a PSP. Sneak some snacks into the room. Just a few snacks (salty, sugary snacks are best) and a bottle of any drink would be perfect. Try to get sugary beverages such as soda or juice. The drinks don't have to be cold. You might want to get some water too. If you are going to get on the computer, turn it on before going to bed, because it makes noise when it turns on. Just ensure your speaker volume is low (or turned off)."

Normally, when pretending to be asleep, you do not move, however, it is okay to turn a little in your \"sleep\". Don't snore unless you are known to snore. It helps to pull your blanket over your face to save half the trouble of keeping a straight relaxed face. Consider sleeping with the radio on to give you cover. If you accidentally make a sudden noise, it'll be blamed on the radio."

If not, keep doing things quietly in your room, but if your parent(s) lock their doors, carefully try to hear through the door. If it's quiet they're probably asleep.
