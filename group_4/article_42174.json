When this light blinks or turns on , it means there is a problem somewhere in the system that monitors the air pressure in your car’s tires. [1] X Research source When the light comes on, the first thing you want to do is stop to check the air pressure in your tires. You can find the recommended pressure for your tire on a label inside the driver’s side door or in your owner’s manual. If you don’t have a pressure gauge, you can take your car to a nearby gas station or garage as long as your tires aren’t visibly flat."

Once you have determined which of your tires is low, you can fill them with a manual pump or automatic air compressor. Remove the cap on your tire’s valve stem and attach the air hose to the valve to fill up your tires, making sure to check the pressure as you go. If you don’t have an air pump or compressor, most gas stations have free or low-cost air dispensers you can use. Filling up a tire with a manual pump can be time-consuming. You should only use one if the air in your tire just needs to be topped off. Check to make sure you don’t overinflate your tires ."

The most common issue is a damaged or faulty sensor in the tire. [4] X Research source You can replace your own tire pressure sensors , but some types of sensors require you to remove the tire. It’s also helpful to have a TPMS diagnostic tool that indicates which sensors are in your tires and what their status is.

Make an appointment to have the TPMS checked out by a professional. They have specialized tools and experience with tire monitoring systems to help them troubleshoot issues and get you back on the road safely. Replacing the TPMS sensor in a single tire usually costs from $50 to $350. For reference, a sensor alone can cost anywhere from $40 to $200. [6] X Research source"

While a damaged TPMS sensor doesn’t directly affect the tire’s safety, if you continue to drive with the light on, you won’t know when there’s a real issue with the tire. [7] X Research source If your SVC tire light comes on while you’re driving, pull over and check the tire pressure before continuing to drive. It’s best to check your tire pressure when the tire is cold or has been more than 3 hours since they’ve been driven on. However, if your tires appear to be close to the appropriate air pressure, you can usually drive to a nearby service station as long as you take it slow."

When the air pressure drops below a safe level, the sensor signals the system to turn on the SVC tire monitor light. [9] X Research source This type of TPMS provides the most accurate readings since it measures the real-time air pressure in each tire. A direct TPMS requires regular battery changing and can be more expensive to repair or replace."

[10] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source If the TPMS detects significant differences in your tires’ rotation speeds, the warning on your dashboard lights up. This type of system is cheaper to maintain because there are no sensors in the tires. However, it’s less accurate than a direct TPMS, and uneven tire wear can cause false alarms."

If your TPMS sensors haven’t failed completely, it can be difficult to tell if they’re malfunctioning. [16] X Research source Use a good-quality tire pressure gauge to check the pressure of all 4 tires. Make sure you are checking the tire pressure when they’re cold to get the most accurate reading. Compare the TPMS readings for each tire to the ones you take with your gauge. If there are any significant differences, have a mechanic check your TPMS."

If you live in an area with extreme weather or poorly maintained roads, the battery life can be shorter. [17] X Research source Watch for false warning lights. If your SVC tire monitor light stays on even when you’ve confirmed your tires are at the proper pressure, it might mean the sensor has a dead battery. Test your TPMS after your car is serviced. If your TMPS light stays on after a recent trip to the shop, it may not have been reprogrammed correctly. Manually check the tire pressure and add air if necessary. If the light doesn’t turn off, it may need to be reset. Check after tire rotation. This is especially important with indirect TPMS since it tracks tire speeds. If you see the light come on after a rotation, it may mean the system was not properly calibrated."

This can be especially dangerous in an emergency or when there are hazardous road conditions. Underinflated tires cause poor handling and can wear out faster. A blowout at higher speeds on a freeway can be life-threatening for you and other drivers. [18] X Research source A TPMS can let you know when the air pressure is dangerously low so you can stop the car and check your tires before disaster strikes."

      "content": "Properly inflated tires can help you save money. There’s less wear and tear, so they last longer. Tires inflated to the recommended pressure also improve your car’s fuel efficiency. When a tire is flat, more of its surface makes contact with the road surface. This can increase the resistance, meaning your car requires more fuel to move forward. [19] X Research source This increased resistance can also cause more wear on the treads, shortening your tire’s life. With better fuel economy and longer tire life, you can lower your carbon footprint, minimize road wear, and help reduce the number of tires going into local landfills."
