      "content": "Maintain a pH between 7.2 and 7.8 with pH increaser or decreaser. When you own a hot tub, it’s important to maintain proper levels of pH to reduce eye and skin irritants caused by the disinfectants in the water. pH is a scale that tells you how alkaline or acidic a substance is. Pure water has a pH of 7, and a spa or hot tub should be between 7.2 and 7.8. If your water’s pH is too high or too low, purchase pH increaser or decreaser at your local home improvement store to change the levels accordingly. You can use hot tub test strips to test the pH of the water. To use a strip, submerge it in the water for about 15 seconds. The strip will change color according to your water’s pH, and you can match that color to the label to identify it."

      "content": "Test your calcium levels to protect the water from impurities. If your calcium levels are too high, you’ll notice cloudy water and scaling on the sides of the tub. On the other hand, if the calcium levels are too low, the water can cause erosion and damage to the tub. You can use water hardness test strips to check the calcium levels, then take action to make the necessary adjustments. [1] X Research source It is recommended that calcium levels remain between 175 and 275 ppm (parts per million). But keep in mind that the ideal calcium hardness depends on the type of hot tub you own. Make sure to check with your hot tub’s manufacturer for this information. Add calcium booster if calcium levels are low. If calcium levels are too high, drain water from the hot tub and add low calcium water to balance it out."

      "content": "Add chlorine or bromine to sanitize the water and prevent the spread of germs. You can choose either bromine or chlorine to keep your hot tub clean. Both of these chemicals come in either powder or tablet form. Bromine levels should stay between 3-5ppm, depending on whether you use tablets or powder. Chlorine levels should always stay between 2 and 5 ppm. Check the levels of these chemicals using test strips, and then make adjustments accordingly. [2] X Research source Bromine and chlorine in tablets are added to a dispenser that floats around the pool and gradually dissolves in the water. These chemicals in powder form are measured and poured directly into the water. Whether you use chlorine or bromine is up to you. Some people prefer bromine because it doesn’t have that chlorine bleach smell. However, it will break down from sun exposure, so it should only be used in spas that are not in direct sunlight. Some advantages to chlorine are that it is cost-effective, easy to manage in the water, and it’s very aggressive when killing bacteria."

      "content": "Clean your hot tub monthly. It is important to keep your hot tub clean to remove any impurities and buildup. To give it a proper cleaning, you’ll first need to completely drain the hot tub. Then, using the manufacturer’s recommended hot tub cleaner, wipe down the entire surface. Make sure to clean the filters thoroughly by spraying them with water and soaking them in an oil-cutting solution. Clean your hot tub cover when you clean the rest of the hot tub because it is constantly exposed to dirt and other germs."

      "content": "Keep surfaces around the hot tub clean. When you have a group of people using a hot tub, users will be constantly getting in and out and walking around. Make sure the areas around your hot tub are clear of debris. If there is a lot of dirt and grime near the hot tub, someone may step in it and get it into the tub, dirtying up the water. Keep a broom nearby to sweep any dirt, leaves, or other loose items from around your hot tub."

      "title": "Maintain an appropriate temperature during use.",
      "content": "Maintain an appropriate temperature during use. The maximum temperature in a hot tub depends on a few different factors. The ideal hot tub temperature for adults is 100 °F (38 °C). For children at least 10 years of age, the temperature should not be above 98 °F (37 °C). As a general rule, a hot tub should never be hotter than 104 °F (40 °C). Most hot tubs have thermostats that read the water temperature, but they may be inaccurate by as much as 4 degrees. It’s better to check the water temperature using a thermometer. [3] X Research source Pregnant woman should not be in a hot tub over 102 °F (39 °C), and should only stay in for 10 minutes at a time."

      "content": "Check the hot tub water and equipment regularly. Regular hot tub maintenance is important for both safety and to keep in good working condition. You should have your spa checked by a professional quarterly. They have access to advanced testing equipment and can perform tune-ups to evaluate any hardware or wiring issues. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that if you’re about to enter a hot tub, you should be able to listen and hear the pumps and filtration systems running. This is a good sign that the hot tub is working effectively."

      "content": "Always keep the hot tub locked and covered when you're not using it. Keeping the cover on will save energy and prevent animals and young children from falling in. Plus, it will keep dirt and debris out. Consider using a locking cover to prevent children and unwanted guests from using it when you are not around. [5] X Research source Also, remember to clean the hot tub cover regularly when you clean the rest of the hot tub."

      "title": "Limit the time you spend in the hot tub.",
      "content": "Limit the time you spend in the hot tub. Sitting in a hot tub for too long can make users nauseous, lightheaded, faint, or dizzy. To prevent these symptoms, you should spend no more than 15-20 minutes in a hot tub at a time. If you’d like more time in the water, get out after 15 minutes, and then return after cooling down for a few minutes. You can also lower the temperature to normal body temperature (98.6 °F (37.0 °C)) to stay in for a little while longer. Pregnant women should spend no more than 10 minutes in a hot tub at a time. If you’re pregnant and you feel uncomfortable at all during your soak, you should get out immediately. It is also important to sit with your arms and chest above the water at all times to keep yourself from getting too warm. Children should also limit their time in a hot tub to no more than 10 minutes."

      "content": "Avoid drug and alcohol use in the hot tub. Drinking alcohol increases your body temperature, which can lead to overheating when combined with the warm water from the hot tub. Drinking alcohol can cause drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, and like drug use, can impair your judgment and increase the risk of drowning due to loss of consciousness."

      "content": "Accompany children in the hot tub and prohibit use under 10 years old. Children under the age of 10 should be nowhere near a hot tub. The hot water is dangerous because their small bodies have trouble with temperature regulation. Children age 10 and older should be watched carefully by an adult, especially near suction vents. If available, use raised seats to make sure their heads stay above the water at all times. [7] X Research source When children are in the hot tub, keep the temperature under 98 °F (37 °C)."

      "content": "Keep your head above the water. Hot tubs are equipped with powerful suctions that keep the water warm and bubbly. If your head goes under the water near these vents, your hair can get caught and become tangled. If your hair is long, put it up in a ponytail or bun to avoid getting it caught in the filter or drain."

If you have to use an electrical device, use a battery-powered one, and keep it on a table far away from the water. You should also make sure there aren't any electrical outlets near the hot tub since corded devices and outlets are an electrocution hazard if they get wet. [8] X Research source"
