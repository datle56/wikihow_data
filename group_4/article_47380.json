      "content": "Brush the coat. Use a garment brush and wipe the coat gently to remove dirt, dust, food, mud, and other particles that have collected. To prevent felting and making the wool fluffy, brush lengthwise from the collar to the bottom. You can use a damp cloth to brush the coat if you don’t have a garment brush."

      "title": "Spot clean the coat.",
      "content": "Spot clean the coat. Look over the garment for dirt, food, and other stains that may be on the fabric. To spot clean, apply a small amount of mild detergent, such as Woolite, to the affected area. Rub the detergent in gently with your finger until the dirt comes loose. Even if you don’t see any soiling, spot clean the collar, cuffs, and armpits of the coat. You can also use a stain bar or cashmere and wool shampoo to spot clean a wool coat."

      "title": "Clean out your tub.",
      "content": "Clean out your tub. Rinse out your bathtub with a bit of soapy water and a sponge. Rinse out all the soap with clean water. This will ensure that you have a clean area to work in, and will prevent dirt from the tub from being transferred to the coat. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a bathtub you can use, clean out a large sink or wash basin."

      "title": "Fill the tub with water and detergent.",
      "content": "Fill the tub with water and detergent. When the tub is clean, put in the plug and fill it with lukewarm water. While the water is running, add ⅛ cup (29 ml) of mild liquid detergent, like Woolite or baby shampoo, to the stream. Let the tub fill with enough soapy water to immerse the coat. It’s important to use lukewarm water instead of hot water, because hot water can shrink the coat."

      "title": "Soak the coat.",
      "content": "Soak the coat. Immerse the coat in the soapy water. Push it down until it’s saturated enough to stop floating. Leave the coat to soak for 30 minutes. Squeeze the jacket all over with your hands to make sure the soapy water gets into all the fibers. Saturating and soaking the coat will help prevent shrinkage."

Then, swish the coat around in the water to dislodge dirt and other particles. Don’t scrub the wool against itself to clean it, because this can cause felting. [3] X Research source"

Return the coat to the tubful of clean water. Swish the coat around in the water to remove excess dirt and soap.

      "title": "Place the coat into a wash bag.",
      "content": "Place the coat into a wash bag. It is possible that your jacket has a care label that says the garment can be machine washed. Before washing the coat, turn it inside out and place it inside a mesh wash bag. This will protect it from rubbing and getting snagged in the washer. [5] X Research source You can use a large pillow case if you don’t have a wash bag. Place the coat inside and tie the top of the pillow case in a loose knot. If the coat is too large for a pillow case, wrap it up in a bed sheet and tie the bed sheet together around the coat."

As the water is running, add ⅛ cup (29 ml) of a delicate or wool-specific detergent like Woolite or wool shampoo. Let the drum fill with soapy water. Soaking a wool coat is an important part of the washing process. If you have a front loader and aren't able to soak the coat in the machine, either wash it by hand, or soak it first in a tub and then transfer it to the machine."

      "content": "Wash the coat. After 30 minutes of soaking, close the washing machine lid. Set your washer to a delicate, hand-wash, or wool setting. Turn the machine on and let it wash the coat. It’s important to use a cycle for wools or delicates because it will involve less agitation and rubbing, both of which can cause felting. Make sure the washing machine temperature is set to lukewarm, otherwise the coat may shrink. When the wash cycle is complete, remove the coat, take it out of the wash bag, and turn it right-side out."

      "content": "Squeeze out excess water. Hold the coat over a sink or tub. Working from the top of the coat toward the bottom, gently squeeze the coat to remove excess water. Do not wring or twist the wool or you could distort and stretch it. When you get to the bottom of the coat, go back to the top and squeeze the coat again from top to bottom."

When the jacket has been rolled up into the towel, squeeze the towel to help it absorb moisture from the coat. [6] X Research source Do not twist or wring the jacket when it’s rolled in the towel. Unroll the towel and remove the coat."

After the first day, turn the coat over to let the other side dry. Drying may take two to three days. Never hang wet wool to dry, as it could cause stretching and misshaping. Never dry a wool coat in the dryer, as it can cause shrinkage."
