      "content": "Clean your car before entering the drop off zone. It is appropriate and courteous to pick up any trash or garbage before dropping your car off with a valet service.

      "content": "Stop to get some cash for tips beforehand. Tipping your valet is an important thing to do, as valet jobs are difficult and drivers are sometimes reliant on tips to complete their full minimum wage. Plan on spending $2 - $5 (USD) on tips when you drop off your car, and 2 to 5 dollars when you pick your car back up. [2] X Research source Taking out ten dollars in cash and saving it specifically for tipping will keep you from not having any cash on hand when the time comes. Although a two to five-dollar tip is average, you can tip more if your valet was particularly professional and hard working."

      "content": "Remove any valuable personal items from the car. Before arriving at your destination, place your valuables in a bag, or take them out of your car before you leave for your destination.

[3] X Research source Things like electronics, wallets, or sentimental items should all be removed prior to dropping your car off. If you have items that you are not particularly worried about, you can tuck them under the seats of your car."

      "title": "Call ahead for the price of the valet.",
      "content": "Call ahead for the price of the valet. The prices for valet services could vary significantly depending on where you are dropping off your car. Some businesses will provide complimentary valet parking, but others will charge you. Checking beforehand will allow you to prepare for the expense. [4] X Research source Ask if they take credit or debit cards, or if they only accept cash. If you are using valet services at a hotel, they will mostly like charge you a daily rate."

      "content": "Remove your car key from the rest of your keys. When dropping your car off at the valet, there is a chance that your key could be lost. Although this is rare, it is not worth risking your entire key ring. Either bring a spare car key to give the valet worker, or take the key off the ring and bring the rest of your keys with you, keeping them safe and secure. [5] X Research source Giving your entire key ring to the valet worker is also a pain for them, especially if you have an abundance of keys on your ring."

      "title": "Identify the drop off zone and approach slowly.",
      "content": "Identify the drop off zone and approach slowly. Approaching the drop off zone at an appropriate speed is safe and polite. Look for a sign that says “valet parking drop off,” or any signage that indicates the drop off area. Keep an eye out for valet workers, as they will direct you and show you where to pull up. Come to a slow stop in front of the sign and gather your belongings as the valet worker approaches your vehicle. [6] X Research source If you have trouble finding the drop off zone, do not be afraid to ask someone who works at the establishment. They will be happy to direct you to the valet parking area.

      "title": "Let the valet worker open your door for you.",
      "content": "Let the valet worker open your door for you. Although this is not mandatory, as you can absolutely open the door yourself, it is a part of the valet parking culture for the valet worker to help you out of the car. This will also let the valet worker move at their own pace. Getting out of the car too early may throw off the pace of the worker and slow them down. [8] X Research source Having your door opened for you is a pleasant experience and will show that the valet worker is professional and hard-working, so consider this when you tip. This service will also depend on your environment. If you are arriving at a luxurious hotel or restaurant, it can be expected."

      "content": "Tell the valet worker about any problems with your car. If there is any problem with your vehicle that will impede in the process of parking the car, the valet drive will need to be informed. Do not go into too much detail, though, as the valet worker will be in a hurry. Simply and directly communicate the car’s problems or quirks and let the worker keep moving. [9] X Research source It is a good idea, for instance, to tell your valet if you have any problems with your brakes or door latches, or if your seats have problems adjusting. You can tell them some other important details, too, like whether the vehicle is an automatic or manual."

      "content": "Check your vehicle for damages once it arrives. Before tipping the valet driver or receiving the keys to your vehicle, do a quick walk around your vehicle looking for damages, large and small. Check the doors for dings, the back bumper for dents, and the front of the car for any damages that weren’t already there. [14] X Research source If there are damages to the car, inform the driver and ask to speak with a manager about the damages. Depending on where you live, the liable party for damages to your car will differ. Often, the driver is liable, but some companies will take on the liability themselves. Communicating damages right away is vital, as you will not be able to prove that the company is responsible if you drive away."
