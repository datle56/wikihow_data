      "content": "Start testing the brownies so they don't get a chance to overcook. Check the recipe for how long it recommends and then start testing your brownies 1 minute before the earliest time. This way you won't accidentally overbake your brownies, especially if your oven runs a little hot. [1] X Research source For example, if your recipe says to bake the brownies for 30 to 35 minutes, start checking them after 29 minutes in the oven. All types of brownies continue to set up after you take them out of the oven, so it's better to remove them a little early."

      "title": "The brownies are done if just a little batter clings to the toothpick.",
      "content": "The brownies are done if just a little batter clings to the toothpick. If the toothpick comes out completely wet and coated with batter, you know the brownies are underdone and need more time. If the toothpick comes out with just a few crumbs clinging to it, the brownies are ready! [2] X Research source If you pulled the toothpick out and it looked clean or there weren't any crumbs sticking to it, the brownies are most likely overbaked. Keep in mind that fudgy brownies will have more crumbs clinging to the toothpick compared to cakey brownies, especially if you added chocolate chunks or chips to the batter."

    {
      "title": "The brownies are done when they feel firm to the touch.",
      "content": "The brownies are done when they feel firm to the touch. You should be able to give a quick tap without any batter sticking to your finger. Cakey brownies might even spring back after you press on the center. If your finger sinks into the brownies when you tap, they're not ready yet! [3] X Research source If you're making chewy brownies, the top might feel kind of crisp when they're done."
    },
    {
      "title": "If the brownies still look wet or aren't pulling away, they aren't done.",
      "content": "If the brownies still look wet or aren't pulling away, they aren't done. Even fudgy brownies will pull from the edges once they've finished baking. You'll see that the edges look dry while the middle still looks soft or slightly wet. Chewy and cakey brownies will have dry edges with firmer-looking centers. [4] X Research source The edges of chewy brownies might even look crispy—this is totally fine!"

    {
      "title": "Your recipe might tell you to pull the brownies out when you see cracks.",
      "content": "Your recipe might tell you to pull the brownies out when you see cracks. As brownies cook, moisture evaporates, so a few cracks mean that the brownies are cooked, but still moist in the center. You can also check the sheen of the surface—cake brownies will look matte or dry instead of wet and shiny. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that some fudgy or chewy brownies stay shiny even after they've finished baking. [6] X Research source If you see a lot of cracks over the entire surface, you might have overcooked the brownies, especially if they're cakey."

    {
      "title": "Fudgy brownies are done when they're still slightly jiggly in the center.",
      "content": "Fudgy brownies are done when they're still slightly jiggly in the center. Pop on a pair of oven mitts and hold both sides of the pan. Gently shake the pan back and forth a few times and look at the middle of the brownies—if you're cooking fudgy brownies, they should wobble or jiggle slightly. They'll finish cooking after you take them out of the oven. [7] X Research source If you're cooking chewy or cakey brownies, you shouldn't see any movement in the middle of the pan. If you do, put the brownies back in the oven and recheck them in a few minutes."

      "title": "The brownies must reach at least 165 °F (74 °C).",
      "content": "The brownies must reach at least 165 °F (74 °C). Insert an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the brownies. To kill harmful bacteria, the brownies need to reach at least 165 °F (74 °C). If you like your brownies super fudgy to the point where they ooze onto your plate, you can take them out once they hit 165 °F (74 °C). However, if you're making cakey brownies, cook them until they reach 210 °F (99 °C). [8] X Research source If you prefer chewy brownies, take them out any point between 165 and 210 °F (74 and 99 °C)."
