      "content": "“Touch grass” means to go outside and connect with the real world. “Touch grass” is a slang phrase popularized on social media around 2020 or 2021. It can be a lighthearted way to poke fun at someone’s internet habits and encourage them to enjoy nature, though it’s more often used in arguments to tell someone they’re “chronically online” and need to get in touch with reality. [1] X Research source For example, if someone only speaks in internet slang, you might encourage them to touch grass and interact with people in the real world. Or, if someone keeps trying to start arguments in your social media comments, tell them to touch grass to show them that you’re not going to engage further. In addition to being popular with Gen Z, the phrase is also commonly used in cryptocurrency circles to encourage people to get away from work and enjoy nature. [2] X Research source"
