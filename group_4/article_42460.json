      "title": "Take 1 daily capsule in the morning on an empty stomach.",
      "content": "Take 1 daily capsule in the morning on an empty stomach. You want your stomach to be as empty as possible when taking Linzess, which makes \"shortly after waking up\" the ideal time for most people. Make swallowing the capsule a set part of your early morning routine so you remember to do it every day. [5] X Research source You don't have to take the capsule at the exact same time every morning (for instance, if your wake-up time varies). The important thing is to take it on an empty stomach. Instead of focusing on a time, consider making it (for example) the second or third thing you do during your morning routine. It's generally safe to take other prescribed medications at the same time, but clear this with your doctor first. [6] X Research source Ask your doctor what to do if you forget to take a dose before eating. Never “double up” on the medication the following day if you forgot the prior day’s dose."

      "title": "Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water.",
      "content": "Swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water. Drink 6–8 fl oz (180–240 ml) of tepid to slightly cool water with your Linzess dose. Do not chew or crush the capsule—swallow it whole within a few seconds of putting it in your mouth. [7] X Research source Don’t take Linzess with liquids other than plain water, as no testing has been done using other drinks. For safety when swallowing, it is not recommended to take Linzess or any other type of oral medication without water."

      "content": "Wait 30 minutes to 2 hours to eat, based on your doctor’s guidance. According to the manufacturer, you should wait 30 minutes before eating after taking your daily capsule. However, based on their experience with other patients, your doctor may recommend a longer waiting period—possibly up to 2 hours.

      "content": "Add 1 tsp (5 g) of room-temperature applesauce to a small dish [10] X Research source . If you cannot swallow a Linzess capsule whole, the makers of the drug recommend 2 alternatives: taking the capsule contents with either applesauce or water. If you prefer applesauce, make sure it is at room temperature before proceeding. No studies have been done to determine if the contents of Linzess capsules can be taken with other soft foods (for example, yogurt), so stick with applesauce or use water. As when swallowing the capsules whole, take this Linzess dose in the morning on an empty stomach, 30-120 minutes before your first meal (depending on your doctor’s recommendation).

Hold the Linzess capsule over the dish of applesauce and use your hands to snap it into 2 halves. The capsule should come apart fairly easily right in the center. Each Linzess capsule is filled with small, medically-inert beads that are coated by the actual medication. Do your best to make sure every single bead falls into the applesauce.

The water shouldn’t be too warm or too cool—aim for room temperature. Use this method only if: you cannot take a whole capsule orally with water; and, you cannot (or choose not) to take the capsule contents with applesauce.

If you still have a few beads in the cup after this second go-round, simply discard them. All the medication will have dissolved off of the beads by this point."
