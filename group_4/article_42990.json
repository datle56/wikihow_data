      "content": "Their body language is closed off or tense. Body language is a great cue about how a person is feeling about you or your conversation. Look at how the person is standing to see if they’re interested in talking to you. Some examples of body language that could indicate the person doesn’t want to talk to you are: [1] X Research source A stiff or immobile body. Tense and raised shoulders. Facing their body away from you. Pointing their feet away from you. Standing an unnatural distance from you. Crossing arms over the chest. Touching their neck or collar. Fidgeting or doodling. Yawning. [2] X Research source"

The following signs might indicate your conversation partner is finished: [3] X Research source Looking at the floor. Picking up their phone. Staring around the room. Watching the clock. [4] X Research source Glazed-over expression. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "They give one-word or unenthusiastic responses.",
      "content": "They give one-word or unenthusiastic responses. Observe someone’s responses, whether during in-person or online communication. If most of their messages are a single word like “yeah,” “sure,” or something similar, they’re showing a lack of enthusiasm when communicating with you. The following types of responses can indicate the person is bored with the conversation or doesn’t want to talk to you: [6] X Research source Lazy responses like “Oh really,” “You’re so right,” or “Totally.” Mirroring your language, such as responding to “It’s really cold today” with “Yes, it is cold.” [7] X Research source Ignoring questions or statements. Giving one-word or closed statement answers, including a simple “no” or “yes.” Using gestures such as a head nod can also indicate that a person doesn’t want to talk."

      "title": "They’re letting you do most of the talking.",
      "content": "They’re letting you do most of the talking. If you suspect a person doesn’t want to talk to you, figure out who is leading the conversation. If they're not contributing to the conversation, your conversation partner may have checked out and is waiting for you to wrap up your chat. [8] X Research source Notice if you hear your own voice considerably more than that of your chatting partner, which can be a sign that they are no longer interested in the conversation. Hold back a bit to see if the person begins talking more. This can indicate that they want to talk, but you’re overwhelming them. Check to see if you are integrated into the conversation if there are more than two people in the group. If not, try saying something and see how the other participants respond."

      "content": "They speak with an irritated or disinterested tone. The tone of voice someone uses when speaking to you can tell you a lot about how they are feeling. Noticing the tenor of the conversation can help you figure out if the person isn’t engaged and cue you to exit elegantly. Ask yourself the following questions about their tone: Do they sound irritated when I say something? Do they seem tired, slow, or bored when responding? Do they sound pleasant or excited about our interaction? Does it seem like they’re questioning everything I say?"

      "content": "They take a long time to respond to your messages. If you’re texting or using social media sites, you cannot see their body language or hear their tone unless you are having a video call. But by reading responses and seeing how long it takes for the person to respond, you can gauge if the person doesn’t want to talk to you. [9] X Research source Look for a “read” indication on sites like Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp. If there is a long lapse between your text and the response, or if the person doesn’t respond at all, she likely doesn’t want to talk to you. You can never be completely sure what is going on, though. It might be that she is busy or forgot to answer your message. Notice if the person goes offline when you send them a message. It could be that she doesn't want to talk to you, but once again, you can't really know what is going on. She might be busy."

If you’re sharing a story with someone and they only reply with one-word answers, they may be wanting to exit the conversation. Someone who’s interested in talking to you will ask you for more information, rather than giving curt and limited responses. [10] X Research source They may also talk over you or abruptly change the subject to something completely unrelated in order to end the exchange"

They might make up an excuse like they have to run, have plans, or have something else to do. However, these may sometimes be valid—they could actually be busy or not feeling well. But if this situation happens multiple times, that’s a stronger indicator that they might not want to talk to you anymore. This idea also applies to social engagements or hangouts with a friend or loved one. If this person is frequently making up excuses to cut short your time together, they may not be that interested in talking to you or spending time with you."

They may be difficult to get a hold of and act like they’re always too busy to hang out or respond to your messages. [11] X Research source When you manage to make plans with them, they might cancel those plans more often than not."

If you feel like you’re always the person reaching out, try to avoid messaging or calling them for a few weeks.

Sometimes, people just don't feel like talking; they might be busy, or they have had something happen in their personal lives. Avoid immediately jumping to conclusions or becoming angry, especially if this is the first time you’ve felt like this person doesn’t want to talk to you.

If you notice your conversation partner isn’t engaging, draw upon an “easy out” to leave the chat while leaving things on a positive note. [14] X Research source You could excuse yourself by saying that: You would like to get another refreshment at the bar. You need to take or make an important call. You need to use the restroom. You’re feeling slightly ill and need some fresh air. You have plans with another friend. You’re feeling tired and need to go home and rest. You have an appointment."

Try one of these natural ways to excuse yourself: [15] X Research source Say, “I’ve really enjoyed chatting with you, but I need to get going because I have an early meeting.” Look for something in the room that makes you “realize” something. For example, say, “Wow, I didn’t realize it got so late. I need to get home for my daughter’s bedtime,” after looking towards a clock or at your watch.

Asking for information about how to contact the person naturally indicates that the conversation is coming to an end. Find a nice way to say that you’ve enjoyed the conversation and would like to follow up for more information. [17] X Research source Ask a specific question about the person’s business, course of study, or interests. Use this to lead you to ask, “I’d love to know more about that. Do you have a business card or contact information where I could reach you for more information?” Make sure to look at the information when they give it to you as a sign of respect. Offer to help the person. You can say, “I really enjoyed chatting with you and learning about your work.

If you notice the person doesn’t want to talk to you any longer, find a way to end the conversation by bringing it back to what you started talking about.

When they do respond, observe whether or not it’s an enthusiastic response or something short and dismissive. For example, a message like “Hello, sorry, I can’t get together” probably means that they don’t want to get together. If the response is friendlier and more enthusiastic, they may have just been having a bad day the last time you met. Take a lack of response as a sign the person doesn’t want to speak to you.

If a person’s unenthusiastic responses or lack of contact with you has led you to realize that they don’t want to talk to you, stay away from them. Not only can your continued attempts at connection upset them and you, but it may also have other repercussions, such as giving you a reputation for being clingy or irritating. Avoid sending further messages. Unfriend or unfollow this person on social media. This action can show that you understand the person doesn’t want to speak with you. Allow the person to contact you if you like and decide how you want to respond. You may want to consider giving them another chance. It never hurts to be kind to others, even if they haven’t always been nice to you.
