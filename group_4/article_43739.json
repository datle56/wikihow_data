      "content": "Refrigerate a carton of heavy whipping cream. Keeping the whipping cream cold will make it hold its shape longer when you whip it. Heavy whipping cream or heavy cream both work great. Whipping cream, with no “heavy” in the title, works too, but it doesn’t hold its peaks for as long, so if you can find it, the heavy stuff is better. [1] X Research source You can buy whipping cream in the dairy aisle of the supermarket. To make sure everything’s cold throughout the process, consider putting your bowl and beater in the refrigerator too, this will help make the whipping process easier. They only need to be in there for about 5 minutes to get chilled. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Pour the cold whipping cream.",
      "content": "Pour the cold whipping cream. The cream will at least double in volume when you whip it up, so make sure to use a large bowl. If you want to make 2 cups (470 mL) of whipped cream, start with 2 cups (470 mL) of heavy cream. If you want to make plain whipped cream without any sugar or vanilla, then leave them out. The cream will still whip up to a lovely texture, it will just taste less sweet. Only use heavy cream or whipping cream for this, not half and half."

      "content": "Whip the cream with a hand mixer until soft peaks form. If you’re using an electric mixer, put it on medium-high speed for about 3 minutes. If you’re using a manual egg beater, move the beater around the bowl to make sure you whip all of the cream. [3] X Research source If you draw the mixer out, and the cream comes up in a peak, then you know it’s almost done. If you over-mix and start making butter, stir in a little more cream.

      "content": "Pour in the sugar and cream of tartar as you keep whipping. Once the cream has formed into soft peaks, it’s time to incorporate 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of confectioners’ sugar and .25 teaspoons (1.2 mL) of cream of tartar. Gently pour in the sugar and cream of tartar with one hand, and with the other, keep whipping the cream. [5] X Research source Cream of tartar is a fine white powder that is a byproduct of winemaking. Lots of recipes use it to stabilize or increase volume. You can buy it in the baking aisle of the supermarket. [6] X Research source Confectioners’ sugar generally contains a bit of starch in it, which helps with stabilizing too. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Continue whipping until the cream reaches the desired consistency. You can decide how soft you want your whipped cream to be. Soft peaks are good for eating with berries, and stiffer peaks are great for piping on cakes. Just make sure you don’t overdo it and make butter! [8] X Research source Add in a .5 teaspoons (2.5 ml) of pure vanilla extract if you’d like to lightly flavor the whipped cream. You can tell that you’ve whipped your cream too much if it clings to the sides of the bowl. Don’t despair! Just eat it as tasty homemade butter and start over for your whipped cream.

Even stabilized whipped cream will lose its shape if it sits out at room temperature for a while, so either eat your whipped cream right away or store it in the refrigerator. Freezing whipped cream isn’t good for its consistency, so try to avoid that. [10] X Research source Whipped cream makes a delicious topping for cakes, pies, and ice cream."

When you draw a spatula through the cream, it should hold its shape in soft billows. [13] X Research source You can use a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, or a hand mixer that you hold over a bowl. For better results, chill the mixing bowl before pouring in and whipping the cream. [14] X Research source"

Unlike regular whipped cream, which deflates after about 3 hours, stabilized whipped cream will hold its shape for a whole day. The gelatin will not affect the flavor or texture, but will make the peaks stay firmer for longer. [16] X Research source You can make desserts with stabilized whipped cream in advance and they will stay pretty until you are ready to serve them."
