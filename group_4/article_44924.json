      "content": "Tilt your head back and carefully insert the nose trimmer. This is best done in front of a well-lit mirror. The trimmer should fit easily and never be forced inside your nasal canal. Nose trimmers are designed to safely insert into your nose. The blades are covered so they will never touch the sensitive skin. Many trimmers may provide painless hair removal with less chance of nicking your nose than scissors; however, sometimes a hair may be yanked from the root and cause pain. Do not insert the trimmer too deeply in your nose. You always want to only trim the hairs peeking out below your nose. Leave the rest of the hair alone to help protect you from pollutants."

Just pluck the ones visible to a person standing a reasonable distance away."

This may be a little painful, so you can put a small ice cube up the nostril for about a minute if you'd like to numb the pain a bit. Your eyes will water a bit, and your face may go a tinge red. Be careful. Many doctors advise against tweezing because it can be dangerous, can cause bleeding, or leave small holes or gashes that can be infected easily [7] X Research source"
