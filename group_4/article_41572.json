      "content": "Wash the fresh turmeric root, using a brush to remove dirt. Whether you bought the turmeric root from the market or grew it at home, cleaning it is very important. If you just harvested it, it likely still has dirt on it. If you bought it, who knows how far and wide your fresh turmeric root has traveled since it was pulled out of the ground. Wash it thoroughly with warm water to get rid of germs and chemicals. [1] X Research source Use your fingers or a veggie brush to give the root a quick scrub, removing any dirt that is stuck to it. If you're using a brush, angle it to get into all the corners of the gnarled root."

      "content": "Wrap the turmeric in a second paper towel and place it in a sealed bag. After you've dried the turmeric root, wrap the whole thing in a dry paper towel. The paper towel will absorb extra moisture, ensuring your turmeric root doesn’t develop mold. The paper towel should be loosely wrapped around the root. Place the root and the paper towel into a resealable plastic bag, squeeze all the extra air out of the bag, and seal it. [3] X Research source Alternately, you can store fresh turmeric root in a rolled up paper bag. The paper bag will work similarly to the paper towel, by absorbing excess moisture.

      "content": "Cut the turmeric into smaller pieces. If you cut it into pieces, the turmeric root will be more manageable to work with when it's frozen. Visualize how much turmeric you would use in 1 recipe (or for 1 cup of tea, etc.), and cut the root into pieces that will allow you to grab 1 or 2 when you need to use them. If you aren’t sure what size, start with pieces around 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. Turmeric will stain your hands a yellow/orange color. You can avoid this by wearing gloves. Avoid touching your clothes until you’ve washed your hands or removed the gloves. Hot water and a bit of dish soap should do the trick."
