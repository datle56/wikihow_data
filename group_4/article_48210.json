      "title": "Shirk means worshiping or viewing another deity as an equal to Allah.",
      "content": "Shirk means worshiping or viewing another deity as an equal to Allah. “Shirk” comes from an Arabic root word that means “to share.” In a religious context, it means to share divine qualities or powers with Allah. In Islam, Allah is unique and singular–the one true God. Shirk is a grave sin in Islam, and engaging in shirk can prevent you from receiving Allah’s salvation. [1] X Research source There are three types of shirk in Islam, categorized by severity: Major shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Akbar) Minor shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Asghar) Inconspicuous shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Khafi) [2] X Research source A loose translation of shirk would be “polytheism” (worshiping or believing in many gods) or “idolatry” (worshiping someone or something other than God). [3] X Research source A person who commits shirk is called mushrik . The opposite of shirk is tawhid . Any person who commits tawhid is muwahhid (the opposite of mushrik). [4] X Research source There are 10 key rules in the Islamic faith (similar to the 10 commandments in Christianity), and not engaging in shirk is rule number one."

      "content": "Major shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Akbar) Major shirk refers to the most serious sins associated with practicing polytheism, or worshiping deities or powers other than Allah, in any way. [5] X Research source Allah despises shirk because it reduces one's love for Allah and transfers it to another power or deity. There are three types of major shirk: Shirk-ad-Du’a: invoking or praying to other deities. Shirk-ad-Niyyahwal-iradahwal-Qasd: planning or intending to worship other deities. Shirk-ad-Ta’ah: obeying any authority over or against the order of Allah. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Minor shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Asghar)",
      "content": "Minor shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Asghar) Minor shirk is anything that could lead a person to commit major shirk, including acts of “showing off” or doing anything to gain praise, honor, or fame for worldly reasons. When an act of minor shirk becomes habitual, it becomes major shirk. [7] X Research source Acts of minor shirk include: Swearing by something or to someone other than Allah. For example, saying things like “I swear on my mother’s life” and “I swear on my brother’s grave.” Performing good deeds to receive praise or rewards. For example, volunteering at a homeless shelter just to get a scholarship or public recognition. Wearing any kind of amulet. For example, wearing an amulet of protection or healing (even as a fashion choice). [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Inconspicuous Shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Khafi)",
      "content": "Inconspicuous Shirk (Ash-Shirk al-Khafi) This type of shirk refers to being dissatisfied with your status or upset about the way things turned out in your life. For example, saying things like, “If only I’d done this or that, my life would have been so much better” or “I wish I’d never met such and such, they ruined my life” is inconspicuous shirk. This is the least serious form of shirk and is easy to commit, even unknowingly, unless you stay vigilant."

      "content": "Allah forgives shirk if you sincerely repent and stop the behavior. Allah forgives all sins if you repent, but shirk is a particularly serious sin in Islam. Engaging in shirk without repenting will keep you from salvation after death—you will spend eternity in hell (instead of in paradise). That said, as long as you repent and stop participating in shirk before you die, Allah will forgive you. [9] X Research source There are many minor sins in life that Allah will likely forgive you for on the day of judgement if you die without repenting for them. Shirk is the only sin that absolutely will not be forgiven unless you repent for it before your death. If you’ve committed shirk and want to be forgiven, recite this du’a: O Allah, I seek refuge with You lest I should commit shirk with You knowingly and I seek Your forgiveness for what I do unknowingly.

      "title": "Many verses in the Quran address the grave sin of engaging in shirk.",
      "content": "Many verses in the Quran address the grave sin of engaging in shirk. Allah is very firm about the severity of shirk; it’s one of the most serious sins in Islam and is said to be unforgivable unless you repent. Many passages in the Quran warn of the dangers of engaging in shirk: Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin. (Quran 4:48) [11] X Research source Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners in worship with Him, but He forgives whom he pleases sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away. (4:116 Quran) Luqman counseled his son, ‘My son, do not attribute any partners to God: attributing partners to Him is a terrible wrong.’ (31:13 Quran) O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah. (3:64 Quran) [12] X Research source Almighty Allah says: “And when they embark on ships they invoke Allah, making their faith pure for him only, but when he brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” (Quran 29:65)"

      "content": "Believe in the severity of shirk and the risks associated with it. Islam teaches that engaging in shirk could potentially cause you to spend eternity in Jahannam (hell). It may sound scary, but in the Islamic faith, you’re risking your immortal soul when you commit this sin. That alone is reason enough to avoid it, but we’re only human–we make mistakes. If you engage in shirk, knowingly or unknowingly, just repent as soon as you can and Allah will forgive you. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "Make tahweed the most important principle in your life. Tawheed (or tawhid) is the most crucial component of Islam. It means fully believing and accepting that Allah is the one and only God and that there are no other divine beings as highly exalted as Him. Essentially, put your faith in Allah (and no other gods) and only pray to and worship Allah. Shirk can creep into your life in many little ways, so stay vigilant. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Pray to Allah daily and at the proper times.",
      "content": "Pray to Allah daily and at the proper times. Daily prayer (salat) is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. Engaging in salat provides a regular interruption in your daily activities, allowing you to focus your mind and heart on priority number one: service to Allah. Regular prayer can help you keep Allah in the center of your thoughts and avoid engaging in shirk. [15] X Research source There are five daily prayers in Islam: Fajr , Zuhr , Asr , Maghrib , and Isha . Perform these prayers at dawn, afternoon, in the mid-afternoon, at sunset, and at night, respectively."
