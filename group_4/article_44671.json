Each has benefits, so you can see which one works best for you. You may have a sensitivity to some of the herbs listed, so try them out on a small patch of skin before you apply them to your rash. These soaks include: Distilled or tap water, which can be boiled and then cooled before application. Diluted chamomile and green tea, which has healing properties. Make 2–3 normal cups of tea, dilute it with equal amounts of water, and let it cool. Milk, which should be straight from the fridge so it's as cold as possible. Undiluted aloe vera juice, which should be chilled. Coconut milk, which should be cooled in the refrigerator. Equal parts of apple cider vinegar and cold water. Baking soda. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.4 g) of baking soda with 1 cup (240 ml) of chilled water. Turmeric and buttermilk.

      "content": "Expose your skin slowly. The easiest and simplest way to prevent a sun rash is to expose your skin to the sun slowly. The most common areas are the legs, arms, and chest, so take your time in the spring wearing these uncovered. [8] X Research source Try exposing one area at a time instead of them all at once, and limit the amount of time you spend in the sun at first to about 10 minutes. For example, wear a short-sleeved shirt with a high collar and long pants to begin with. You can also try shorts with a long sleeve shirt and a high neck. As long as only one new area is uncovered, you can help prevent sun rash."

Make sure you look for sunscreen that’s over 30 SPF that offers broad spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays since both can cause sun rash. Reapply the sunscreen about once every 2 hours. If you live in an area with high elevation, you’re more likely to get sunburn or sun rash with shorter exposure times."

The term polymorphic indicates that the rash will look different when it develops on different people. This condition is most common in the spring, which is when your skin is exposed to stronger sunlight for the first time after winter. [11] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Sun rash is more common in women than in men and it most often occurs in children and adults between 20 and 40 who live in Northern Europe or North America. This is due to the temperate climate in these areas. [12] X Research source You may also be more susceptible to PMLE if you have a family history of it. If you do get PMLE in the winter, it could be from exposure to tanning beds."

This can happen within 20 minutes of sun exposure, but it can also take a few hours. The rash will typically appear on your arms, your chest, or your legs. This is because these areas are generally covered more during the winter months and become desensitized to the sun. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even if you treat the first instance of the rash, it may recur if you go back out into the sun. These recurrences are typically less severe than the first. [15] X Research source Sun rash usually lasts 1–4 days before healing if you don’t expose your skin to the sun, but in very rare cases, it could last for 1–2 weeks. The rash should not leave any scarring."

      "content": "Learn the causes of sun rash. In addition to direct exposure to the sun, you can get a sun rash from exposure to the sun through a window or by exposure to fluorescent lighting. Another form of sun rash can occur as a reaction to chemicals or medications. These 2 conditions are called photoallergic dermatitis and drug-induced photosensitivity. Certain chemicals in soaps, perfumes, skin lotions, detergents, and makeup can react to sun exposure and cause a sun rash. This can easily be remedied if you stop using the product that causes the reaction. There are many medications that may cause sun rash, including water pills, anti-convulsants, quinine, tetracycline antibiotics, NSAID painkillers such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen, and some anti-diabetes drugs.

You may have a different kind of rash or there may be a larger, more complicated reason for your sun rash. If your sun rash gets worse after any home treatment, you should also see your doctor. Your doctor will examine you and ask for your recent medical history. If the cause is in doubt, your doctor may take a small sample of your skin affected by the rash. If it is just a skin rash, your doctor may recommend hydrocortisone cream, but he will likely suggest preventative methods with no medical treatment. [17] X Research source If you have a severe case of sun rash, your doctor may prescribe oral corticosteroids, which you usually need to take for about 1 week."
