      "content": "Choose a container for the chamber. To create a humidification chamber that will help soften the photo, you need a sealed container. A plastic storage bin works well because it has a lid that allows you to seal it. [1] X Research source The storage bin must be deep enough to fit a wire plate rack and still leave some room between the top of the rack and the lid."

      "content": "Set up a work station with the container. Place a clean towel down on the floor or another flat surface that is out of the way. Add the storage container on top, making sure that it's secure and will not be disturbed. [2] X Research source If you are placing the container on the floor, you do not necessarily need a towel if the flooring has a rug or carpet over it."

      "content": "Fill the bottom of the bin with 2-inches (5-cm) of water. Make sure the water is room temperature; if it is too hot, it will cause condensation on the inside of the lid that might drip down onto the photo. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Set a wire plate rack in the bin.",
      "content": "Set a wire plate rack in the bin. With the water in the storage bin, place a wire plate drying rack in it so it fits and you can still close the lid. The rack only needs to be large enough to fit your photo, but it is best to choose a rubber-coated style to protect the photo. [4] X Research source You don't necessarily have to use a plate drying rack. Any wire rack that holds the photo above the water while still allowing the humidity to reach it."

    {
      "title": "Place the photo on the rack.",
      "content": "Place the photo on the rack. It should be face up, but there’s no need to try to unroll it. Leave it as it’s naturally curled. Keep in mind that the photo should not be touching the water at all. It’s best to start with a test photo if you’re new to the process. That way, you won’t damage a photo that means a lot to you if something goes wrong. You can use this process to uncurl any paper document. You can uncurl more than one photo at a time. Just make sure there's a couple of inches (5-cm) between the items on the rack."

      "content": "Examine the container for condensation after a couple of hours. Open the storage container and check the interior for moisture. There shouldn't be any beads of water, but if you find them, wipe them away immediately. Make sure that the photo isn't wet -- dry it off with a clean towel right away too. [6] X Research source"

Allow the photo to sit in the chamber for three to four more hours so it has more time to soften. [8] X Research source You may need to repeat this process more than once. Continue leaving the photo in the chamber for a few hours at a time until it becomes flexible enough to uncurl."

Use your hands to gently unroll the photo. [9] X Research source You can usually find archival blotting paper at art supply stores. The piece of blotting paper should be large enough to rest the photo. However, there should also be some overhang that you can fold over the photo to cover it later."
