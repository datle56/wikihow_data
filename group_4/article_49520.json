His approach to managing application support, maintenance, and training was highly professional and greatly respected, both by end users and by the executive team.\" \"Gina was always inquisitive but never pushy. Despite being able to answer almost any question, Gina would rather sit back and help others find the answer for themselves. Countless students, who I thought were doomed to struggle, happily told me how tutoring sessions with Gina helped them turn the corner. And I had many conversations, both as her professor and a peer, that I will remember happily for years.\" \"When Ms. Bonham hears the word \"no,\" you can almost see the gears start to turn.
