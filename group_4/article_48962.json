When faced with an obstacle, tell yourself that you can overcome it. [1] X Research source Even if you’re not feeling confident, try acting confident with body language. Stand up straight while you're walking or sitting. Avoid standing with your arms crossed. Instead, put your hands on your hips. Just smiling, even if you force it, can help you feel instantly happier and more confident, as your brain releases endorphins. [2] X Research source Stop negative thinking. It's normal to have self-doubts, but you can overcome them. Every time you start having negative thoughts about yourself, stop yourself and re-frame the thought into a positive or neutral one. For example, if you find yourself thinking \"I am so worthless,” think instead, “I am really valuable to myself and others.” [3] X Expert Source Sydney Axelrod Certified Life Coach Expert Interview. 30 June 2020."

Try avoiding distractions, such as TV or reading, while you eat.
