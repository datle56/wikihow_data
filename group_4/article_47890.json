      "title": "“B” is a term of endearment that can mean “babe,” “baby,” or “bae.”",
      "content": "“B” is a term of endearment that can mean “babe,” “baby,” or “bae.” When you respond to a text from your partner, friend, or family member, you might add a “b” to the end of your message to show your affection. This little letter simply shows that you care for the person you’re texting, whether that’s romantically or platonically. [1] X Research source “B” can also stand for other terms of endearment like beautiful, boo, babydoll, bestie, and bro. “Thanks, b. ❤️ I thought you looked good tonight, too 😉” “You’re the best, b. I don’t know what I’d do without a friend like you. 🥰”"

      "content": "“B” can also be short for b*tch in texts and online. If you’re angry at someone, “B” might not be a term of endearment and instead, be an insult standing for “b*tch.” You might call someone “b” instead of typing out “b*tch” when you’re venting to a friend or arguing with someone on social media. [2] X Research source “I can’t believe that Stella didn’t invite me to her party. What a total b 🤬” “Can you stop being a b and grow up? 😡 I’m done with this conversation.”"

      "title": "“B” might be an abbreviation for a name that starts with B.",
      "content": "“B” might be an abbreviation for a name that starts with B. Sometimes, texting “B” is simply a way to shorten someone’s name. You might call your friend or partner “B” if you need to fire off a quick text, or you can’t be bothered to type out their name. “Hey B, can you call me? I have a favor to ask you.” “omg b likes you! he’s hands-down the cutest guy in school 😍”"

      "title": "She’s interested in you.",
      "content": "She’s interested in you. Because “b” usually means “babe” or “baby,” a girl might call you this little letter to flirt with you and make her crush on you known. Just look for other texting cues that she’s hoping to be more than friends —if she’s complimenting you, showing interest in you and the conversation, and using flirty emojis like 😘, 😉, or 🫦, she’s likely interested in you! [3] X Research source If you’re interested in the girl you’re texting, flirt with her back ! Ask her about her interests and drop her compliments about her appearance and personality."

      "title": "She appreciates and cares for you.",
      "content": "She appreciates and cares for you. A girl calling you “b” can also be a term of endearment that shows her affection for you. She might text you, “Thanks b!” when you help her out with an assignment, or ask “What are you up to, b?” when she wants to hang out. Her “b” can mean that she sees you as a really great friend, or something more. If the girl you’re texting is giving you mixed messages, ask her if she likes you in person or over text. For example, you might say, “I’ve been feeling like there’s the potential for us to be more than friends. Do you feel the same way?” If you only see her as a friend, say something like, “You’re one of my best friends and I love hanging out with you. How do you feel about us?”"

      "title": "She sees you as a friend.",
      "content": "She sees you as a friend. “B” can also be short for “bro” or “bestie,” so a girl might call you “b” if she thinks of you as a friend or sees you like a brother. To suss out if she’s putting you in the friend zone with her “B” text, analyze your conversations and in-person interactions. If the girl you’re texting talks about her crushes or relationship issues and always invites other people to your 1-on-1 hangs, she might just think of you as a friend. [4] X Research source If you have feelings for the girl you’re texting and you want to get out of the friend zone , tell her how you feel. This is the best way to show her that you want to be more than friends and see how she feels, too. For example, say something direct and simple like, “Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I have feelings for you.”"

      "content": "A guy calling you “b” can mean he likes you. A guy might call you “b” as a term of endearment, but whether he likes you romantically depends on your relationship. So, look out for signs that he likes you more than a friend : does he text you “Good morning,” respond to your messages quickly, or compliment you unprompted? There are all positive signs he’s caught feelings. [5] X Research source If you have feelings for the guy you’re texting, flirt with him to let him know you’re interested. Ask him open-ended questions about himself, compliment him, and tease him a little bit, too!"

      "content": "A guy might call you “b” if he sees you as a friend. If the guy you’re texting just sees you as one of the guys , he might call you other friendly nicknames like “dude,” and “bro.” You might also notice that he only seems to hang out with you if other people tag along. [6] X Research source Ask him if he likes you to see how he really feels. Whether you talk to him in person or over text, ask him straightforwardly like, “Hey, I’ve been wondering where we stand. Do you like me more than a friend?” If you have feelings for the guy you’re texting, say something like, “I want to know how you feel about me because I have feelings for you.”"
