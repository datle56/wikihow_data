However, a period that's on schedule is likely a regular period. However, a heavy period that’s a week or more late might be a sign of miscarriage. Check your calendar to find out when your period was supposed to start. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that it's normal for your period to come a few days late, especially if you're stressed. This is usually not a sign of miscarriage. For instance, if you expected your period on October 1 but it arrived on October 8, then it’s possible you had a brief pregnancy. However, consider if you have other signs of a miscarriage before getting worried."

However, you likely won’t be expecting your period at that point, so it’ll be easier to recognize the discharge as a potential miscarriage."
