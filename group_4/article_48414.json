These brands don’t simply make your undergarments—they take them back once you’ve gotten your wear out of them and turn them into new clothes or give them to people in need. And most participating companies don’t limit the clothes they accept to their brands—so even though you didn’t buy your underwear from Knickey , The North Face , or hanky panky , they’ll take your old undergarments anyway."

If your undergarments aren’t too worn and torn, invite a group of friends over for a fun night of food, music, and new-to-them clothes. Who knows, an article of clothing you’ve gotten tired of might just be exactly what your friend is looking for. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Resources Defence Council Multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action Go to source Of course, your friends might not want to wear your used underwear (although who knows, your mileage may vary), but an old bra can find a second life in the hands—erm, on the chest, technically—of a new owner. A clothing swap acts as a win-win-win: you’ve not only disposed of your unwanted items in an environmentally responsible way, you’ve made someone else’s day and saved money you otherwise might have spent on new clothes.

Certain online thrift stores like Poshmark or Vinted accept gently used bras, but they only sell unused underwear with tags attached. Thredup , another popular secondhand online retailer, doesn’t accept underwear at all, but they do take bras."

      "content": "What better material to use as a pad than your old underwear? Create your own reusable sanitary napkins using old cotton undies, a few extra household objects, and a bit of sewing. Just make sure your underwear is 100% cotton (or another natural material), as synthetic material could cause itching or infection. Making your own pads is better for you than buying disposable pads. Disposable pad manufacturers use potentially harmful chemicals in their products (and this includes menstrual products labeled \"organic,\" \"natural,\" or \"for sensitive skin\"). When you make your own reusable pad out of your old underwear, you know exactly what's in it. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source And it's not only healthier to use reusable pads (just make sure you're washing them well!), it's cheaper in the long run, and better for the environment, as reusable menstrual pads cannot be recycled."
