If you do that thing again, does the problem keep happening? Think back to when the computer started having issues. Was a certain program installed, or a change made to the hardware? Was something suspicious downloaded or installed with a program you got? Was there a power outage and now things aren't working correctly? Narrowing down the possible cause of the problem will make it much easier to determine how to proceed. If your PC started acting up after an update or a software install, run a system restore to restore it to a point in time before the problem began.
