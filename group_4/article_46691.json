      "title": "Chop up your ingredients to help them fit in the blender.",
      "content": "Chop up your ingredients to help them fit in the blender. If you’re making a smoothie, juice, or soup, cutting your fruits and vegetables can make blending that much easier. Aim to cut larger ingredients (like apples, bananas, celery, etc.) in halves or quarters to help them fit better in the NutriBullet cup. When in doubt, always cut! The smaller your ingredients are, the less work your blender will have to do."

      "title": "Fill your cup to the max fill line with dry ingredients.",
      "content": "Fill your cup to the max fill line with dry ingredients. Toss everything you want in your blended concoction into the cup. Throw in vegetables, fruits, nuts, and/or leafy greens—the possibilities are truly endless. Try filling the cup with 50% fruit and 50% leafy greens to make a nutritious smoothie . Bonus tip: Put the greens into the cup last so they’re on top of the fruit. This way, when you flip the cup over to blend, it’ll be the first ingredient to hit the blade, helping them blend more evenly. Toss almonds and oats in the cup with the Milling blade to make a granola-like crumble to top yogurt or cereal."

      "title": "Add your desired liquid if you’re making a smoothie or soup.",
      "content": "Add your desired liquid if you’re making a smoothie or soup. If you’re using the Extractor blade, you likely want a smoothie or blended liquid concoction. The amount of liquid you use depends on how thick or thin you want the final product to be. [1] X Research source As long as you don’t fill the cup over the max fill line, you’re good to go! Use juice or a milk of your choice when making a smoothie. Try using a broth or water when making soup . If you want your concoction to be super soupy, fill the cup with liquid to the max fill line. If you want it to be thick like ice cream, try filling it ¼ of the way and adding more if needed. If you’re turning something into a powder (such as coffee grounds or spices), there’s no need to add any liquid."

      "title": "Screw the blade onto the cup.",
      "content": "Screw the blade onto the cup. Once all of your ingredients are in the cup, twist the Extractor or Milling blade onto the top of the cup so that the grooves of the blade line up with the grooves on the cup. Press down as you twist until the blade is tightly secured. [2] X Research source Remember, the Milling blade turns dry ingredients into a powder, while the Extractor blade blends ingredients together."

    {
      "title": "Press the cup blade side-down on the Power Base.",
      "content": "Press the cup blade side-down on the Power Base. Look at the top of the Power Base (the bottom half of the NutriBullet machine with the cord). See those 2 notches on either side of the logo? Now, look at the rim of the blade—there are 2 round bumps. Flip the cup upside down so the bladed end is on top of the Power Base. Place the bumps inside the notches and press down to activate the blade. [3] X Research source The cup may vibrate in your hands as the blade spins—this is normal! Stop pressing down on the cup to stop it from spinning. To keep the blade on without holding the cup, press down and twist gently to the left. This locks the notches into place. To stop the blend, press down again and twist to the right. Blend for as long or as little as you like! Just know that the longer you blend, the hotter the Power Base may become (because more energy is used)."

      "title": "Tap or shake the cup to loosen stubborn ingredients.",
      "content": "Tap or shake the cup to loosen stubborn ingredients. Sometimes, ingredients get stuck alongside the edge of the cup or blade while blending, especially if there’s not much liquid in the cup. To ensure all your ingredients are blended, lift the cup out of the Power Base and gently shake it. Then, when everything’s all loosened up, place it back in the base to blend it again. [4] X Research source Consider flipping the cup right-side up and carefully twisting off the blade to add more liquid to your concoction to help it blend easily."

      "title": "Remove the cup from the Power Base and twist off the blade.",
      "content": "Remove the cup from the Power Base and twist off the blade. Once your ingredients are blended to your liking, take the cup off of the Power Base and place it right side up (with the blade on top) on a flat surface. Gently screw the blade off of the cup to take it off. [5] X Research source Let the contents of the cup settle for a few minutes before twisting off the blade. This way, there won’t be as much food or drink at the top of the cup when you take off the lid."

      "title": "Pour your blended concoction into another container or enjoy from the cup.",
      "content": "Pour your blended concoction into another container or enjoy from the cup. The beauty of the NutriBullet is that it’s portable. Dump the contents of the blender into another cup, bowl, or resealable container to enjoy now or save for later. As an alternative, drink or eat a smoothie or soup right from the cup. Consider purchasing resealable NutriBullet lids to save your blended concoctions in their cups or bring them on the go."

      "title": "Pick a Tall cup for large quantities or a Short cup for smaller quantities.",
      "content": "Pick a Tall cup for large quantities or a Short cup for smaller quantities. The NutriBullet typically comes with 2 cups: Tall (32 fl oz (4.0 c)) and Short (18 fl oz (2.2 c)). If you want to blend a lot of ingredients together, opt for the Tall cup; if you want to make a smaller concoction, stick with a Short cup. Make sure to obey the max fill line labeled on the cups before filling them. If your solid or liquid ingredients exceed this line, your ingredients won’t blend correctly. Consider buying extra cups online to fit your needs. NutriBullet (and competing companies) make cups with handles and flippable lids ."

The Extractor blade has 4 sides and is mainly used to make smoothies, soups, and juices. The Milling blade only has 2 sides and is commonly used to mix dry ingredients into powders or butters (such as making oat flour or nut butter). [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash the NutriBullet cup and lid on the top rack of a dishwasher. The best and easiest way to clean a NutriBullet is to place the cup and lid in the dishwasher. Place these components (and these components only) on the top rack to ensure they get nice and clean. Alternatively, wash the cup and lid by hand. Never put the blades or Power Base in the dishwasher. The dishwasher’s power could damage the blades, and the water will ruin the electrical components in the Power Base. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Wash the blade by hand with warm soapy water. After each use, make sure to wash the blades thoroughly to avoid bacteria build-up. Simply use regular dish soap, warm water, and a sponge to rinse and scrub them clean. Be careful handing the blades, as the edges are sharp. [8] X Research source Use a scrub brush to reach down into the crevices of the cup."

      "content": "Clean the NutriBullet Power Base with a damp rag. Do not submerge the Power Base in water. However, it can be wiped down. Use a damp rag or paper towel to wipe away any residue from the base. Always unplug the Power Base before cleaning it to avoid electrocution."

      "title": "Clean stubborn residue inside the cup by blending soap in the NutriBullet.",
      "content": "Clean stubborn residue inside the cup by blending soap in the NutriBullet. If you leave a cup out too long after drinking or eating its components, it can get crusty. Luckily, getting rid of these stubborn pieces of food is easy! Fill the cup ⅔ of the way with water, add a few drops of soap, screw on the Milling blade, and blend. Empty the contents of the cup into the sink and finish cleaning it by hand or put it in the dishwasher."
