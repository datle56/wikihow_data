To reduce straining and make bowel movements easier, try putting a footstool in front of the toilet so that your knees are slightly higher than your hips. Rest your elbows on your knees and lean forward slightly while keeping your back straight. While you’re sitting this way, let your stomach muscles relax. You shouldn’t be pushing hard or straining. Never hover above the seat while you’re trying to have a bowel movement, since this can put extra strain on your pelvic floor muscles. If you’re in a public bathroom and don’t want your skin to touch the seat, use toilet paper or a paper shield to cover the seat."

Lie down comfortably on the floor or a firm mattress, then bend your knees up to your chest. To do the massage, perform the following movements: [21] X Research source Gently but firmly stroke your abdomen downward in a straight line from the bottom of your left ribcage to the top of your left hip. Do this 10 times. Stroke from the bottom right side of your ribcage to the bottom left side, then down to your left hip, forming an upside-down letter “L”. Make 10 “U”-shaped strokes from the right hipbone up to the bottom right ribcage, then across to the bottom left ribcage and down to the left hipbone. Finally, massage the middle of your belly in a clockwise, circular motion for 1-2 minutes. Maintain a radius of about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) from your belly button."

Instead, try to relax as much as possible while you’re on the toilet, and bear down gently instead of forcefully pushing. In addition to eating a fiber-rich diet and using a healthier sitting position on the toilet, it might also be helpful to practice relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation exercises."
