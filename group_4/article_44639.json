You’ll usually feel it on 1 side of your chest or the other, but it might also feel like it’s coming from your whole chest.

      "content": "Listen for a dry cough. Pleurisy can cause a dry cough. If you notice you’ve been coughing a lot, listen to the cough itself. If it’s dry – that is, if it doesn’t produce any phlegm – that can be another symptom of pleurisy. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Get a medical diagnosis. Only a doctor can order the tests necessary to diagnose pleurisy. If you experience any of the symptoms of pleurisy, see your doctor right away. Your doctor will listen to your lungs to check for the distinctive sound caused by pleurisy – a dry, crunching sound. [4] X Research source Make sure you bring a list of your symptoms with you, including when they began."

      "content": "Go for an ultrasound. If your doctor can’t tell for sure if you have pleurisy from listening to your lungs, they might order an ultrasound for you. You’ll likely have to go to another office for the ultrasound, and the results will be sent back to your doctor. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Not all insurance plans cover ultrasounds for diagnostic purposes. You might want to check your benefits to see if you’ll have to pay for the ultrasound, and how much."

Your doctor may prescribe 1 or more antibiotics to clear up the infection. Depending on how severe your symptoms are, the antibiotics might be in pill or injection form.

      "content": "Have fluid drained from your lungs, if needed. If the pleurisy is caused by a pulmonary embolism or a very severe bacterial infection, fluid might build up around your lungs. In that case, you’ll need to have the fluid drained. Either a general anesthetic – which makes you unconscious – or a local anesthetic – which numbs 1 area of your body – will be administered. Then a tube will be inserted through your chest to drain the fluid. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Depending on how much fluid needs to be drained, you might have to stay in the hospital for a few days. Your doctor will let you know if you can have the procedure done in their office or if you’ll need to be admitted."

      "content": "Get extra rest for 2-3 days if you have a viral infection. If the pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, there’s not much you can do but wait it out. Get as much rest as you can to speed up your healing process. Try to find the position where you are most comfortable – but keep in mind you still might have a bit of pain – and rest. [12] X Research source If you can, try to rest for 48 to 72 hours. It seems a little counterintuitive, but lying down on the side of your chest that hurts can help relieve some of that pain. [13] X Research source Once you start feeling better, you might be tempted to overdo things. Make sure you’re still resting, even after you start to improve. Otherwise, your illness can come back."

Pleurisy is basically an inflammation of the tissue in your lungs, so taking anti-inflammatory medication can help relieve your symptoms. An anti-inflammatory medication that’s also a pain reliever – like ibuprofen – can give you some relief, too. Follow the directions on the bottle of medication for dosage and timing.
