      "content": "Add cold water to the base of the egg boiler. The amount of water you need depends on how many eggs you're cooking and how well you want them cooked. Read the instruction manual and use the lines on the measuring cup that came with your egg cooker to figure out the right amount of water to use. Then fill the measuring cup to the right line with water and pour it into the base of the egg cooker. [1] X Research source The exact measurements will depend on your model but, generally, soft-boiled eggs require less water than hard-boiled eggs. Most measuring cups that come with egg cookers include specific measurement lines for soft, medium, and hard-boiled eggs. If you lost or never received an instruction manual with your egg boiler, search for one for your model online. Popular egg cooker models include the DASH Rapid Egg Cooker , the Hamilton Beach 3-in-1 Egg Cooker , and the Cuisinart Egg Cooker ."

      "content": "Pierce a tiny hole in the large end of each egg. Most egg boilers come with a pin (often found on the bottom of the measuring cup) for this purpose, but you can also use a regular sewing pin. To pierce the egg without cracking it, turn the large end face up toward you and hold it firmly in your hand. Then slowly push the needle into the shell. Avoid squeezing your hand too hard or punching the needle in too quickly, or you might get egg everywhere! [2] X Research source The holes will help steam escape and keep the eggshells from cracking as they cook."

      "title": "Set the boiling tray onto the base and put the eggs in it.",
      "content": "Set the boiling tray onto the base and put the eggs in it. The boiling tray has egg-shaped wells that lift the eggs above the heating plate in the base. This ensures the eggs cook instead of burn. When putting the eggs into the boiling tray, make sure the holes you poked in the previous step are facing up! [3] X Research source Extra-large eggs may not fit into the wells of the boiling tray as easily, so try using large or small eggs instead. Depending on the size of your egg cooker, you may be able to boil 6-10 eggs at a time."

The cooking process can take 7-16 minutes depending on how many eggs you're cooking and how \"done\" you want them. [4] X Research source Some egg cooker models automatically turn off after they’re done, while others need to be turned off manually. Generally, they make a sound or the light on the front switch turns off when the eggs are finished."

Lift the eggs out with tongs and submerge them in a bowl filled with cold water from the sink or water filled with ice cubes. This will stop them from overcooking. Be careful to avoid escaping steam as you take off the lid. [5] X Research source If you want your eggs hard-boiled, leave them in the egg cooker for 1 more minute after the timer goes off. For medium-boiled eggs, leave them in for a few extra minutes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose a cooking tray and place it on top of the boiling tray. Most egg boilers come with 2 trays: one divided into 2 small sections and one with no division in the middle. The tray with 2 sections is great for poaching eggs or preparing small omelets for kids. Meanwhile, the open tray is more useful for cooking omelets in adult-sized portions. Some boilers come with only one tray, which can be used for either poaching eggs or cooking omelets."
