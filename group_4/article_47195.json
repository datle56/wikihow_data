      "title": "Rent or buy a beginner’s wakeboard.",
      "content": "Rent or buy a beginner’s wakeboard. Look for a longer wakeboard; longer wakeboards are easier to control and their landings are softer than a shorter board. The size of the board will also depend on your weight. The more you weigh, the longer your wakeboard should be. [1] X Research source Get a board with a continuous rocker for a smoother, easier ride. You’ll know it has a continuous rocker if when you’re looking at it from the side it’s in the shape of one continuous curve from tip to tail. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Get a pair of wakeboarding boots.",
      "content": "Get a pair of wakeboarding boots. Wakeboarding boots, also known as bindings, go on your feet and hook onto your wakeboard so you’re held in place during your ride. Look for a stiffer, less flexible pair of boots for when you’re just starting out. It will be easier to balance and steer the board if your ankles are tightly locked into place. [3] X Research source Your boots will screw into the tiny holes built into your wakeboard. Not all bindings attach to a board the same way, so check the instructions that came with your boots before you attempt to attach them to your board."

      "title": "Talk to the boat driver.",
      "content": "Talk to the boat driver. Make sure they understand that you’re a beginner and ask them to take it slow with you. A boat driver should never speed with a beginner wakeboarder. Because you’ll likely fall several times during your first few go’s, remind the driver to slow down before turning around to come retrieve you so you don’t get caught in any choppy waves.

      "content": "Designate someone to be the spotter. The spotter is someone on the boat (other than the driver) that keeps an eye on things while you’re wakeboarding. The spotter should alert the driver whenever there’s nearby boats or objects or if they see you fall down during your tow."

      "title": "Decide which foot you want to face forward.",
      "content": "Decide which foot you want to face forward. If you’re regular or goofy footed in other board sports like snowboarding and surfing, you’ll probably be the same in wakeboarding. If you’re not sure, think about which foot you use to kick a ball with and place that foot in the back. You want your non-dominant foot to face forward. [5] X Research source If you’re regular footed, your left foot faces forward on the board. If you’re goofy footed, your right foot faces forward on the board."

      "title": "Use a short rope during your first few tows.",
      "content": "Use a short rope during your first few tows. A shorter rope will position you in the narrower part of the wake, making it easier to stand on your board. Use a rope that’s between 30-50 feet (9-15 meters) long."

Stretch out your arms straight ahead with your knees in between, as if you’re holding onto a tow rope. Have someone grab your hands and pull you up to a standing position, as if a boat is pulling you up onto your board via the tow rope. [7] X Research source The key to the land drills is learning how to relax when you’re being pulled up to a standing position. Don’t try to stand up on your own or fight the pull. Let the person pulling you up do all the work. [8] X Research source"

Once you’re strapped in, place your board in the water and slowly slide off the edge of the swim platform until you’re off the boat. Your board should be floating on its side with the front edge at the water’s surface. Bend your knees so they’re touching your chest and stretch your arms out in front of you like you’re holding onto a tow rope handle."

Have someone stand on the swim platform of the boat, each of you holding on to opposite ends of a tow rope. Have them pull you in as close to the swim platform as possible via the tow rope and then pull you up onto the swim platform so that you’re standing on your board. [9] X Research source If you tense up or fight the pull, have the person on the swim platform release you back into the water. Keep repeating the drill until you’re able to relax and get pulled up onto the platform without resisting. [10] X Research source"

Most experienced wakeboarders will raise a hand to signal the driver, but as a beginner, letting go of the tow rope with one hand may cause you to lose your grip. Instead, hold onto the tow rope handle with both hands and raise it into the air when you’re ready to begin."
