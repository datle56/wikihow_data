      "title": "Read the problem carefully.",
      "content": "Read the problem carefully. Even if the problem seems simple, read it very carefully. Don't just skim the problem and attempt to solve it. If the problem is complex, you may need to reread the problem multiple times before you fully understand it. Just take your time and don’t move on until you feel confident that you know what the problem is asking you to do. [1] X Expert Source Daron Cam Math Tutor Expert Interview. 29 May 2020."

      "title": "Paraphrase the problem.",
      "content": "Paraphrase the problem. To help wrap your mind around the problem that you are facing, it may help you to say or write it out into your own words. You can simply say it or write it out if you in a situation where you cannot speak out loud, such as during a test. Check what you have said or written against the original problem to make sure that you are representing the problem accurately. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Draw the problem.",
      "content": "Draw the problem. If you think it will help with the type of problem you are facing, create a visual representation of the problem to help determine what you need to do next. The drawing does not have to be elaborate, it can simply be a shape or shapes with numbers. Consult the problem as you draw and check your drawing against the problem after you have finished. Ask yourself, “Does my drawing accurately represent the problem?” If it does, then you can move forward. If not, start over by rereading the problem. [3] X Research source Draw a Venn diagram. A Venn diagram shows the relationships among the numbers in your problem. Venn diagrams can be especially helpful with word problems. Draw a graph or chart. Arrange the components of the problem on a line. Draw simple shapes to represent more complex features of the problem."

      "title": "Look for patterns.",
      "content": "Look for patterns. Sometimes you can identify a pattern or patterns in a math problem simply by reading the problem carefully. You can also create a table to help you identify a pattern or patterns in the problem. Take notes on any patterns that you identify in the problem. These patterns can help you to solve the problem and may even lead you directly to the answer."

      "content": "Review your information. Check what you have written down against the problem to make sure that you have accurately copied the numbers and other information. Don't go on to the planning stage until you are certain that you have all of the required information and that you fully understand the problem. If you don't understand the problem, take a moment to look at some examples in your textbook or online. Looking at how other people have correctly solved similar problems may help you to understand what this problem is asking you to do.

As you complete each step, you may also want to compare your answers to the estimates you came up with for each step as well as your overall estimate for the problem’s answer. Ask yourself, “Do my answers match or closely resemble my estimates?” If they do not match up, consider why. Check your answers to see if you have completed all of the steps correctly.
