If there are other Sims in the household, you'll be asked if your Sim is going alone, with a group (if you have Nightlife), or with their household. (If you have Bon Voyage or later, you can pick individual Sims to go with your Sim, rather than the whole household.) Sims who are not part of your household cannot go with your Sim this way. If you want your Sim to meet another Sim at a community lot, you'll need to click on the phone, go to the Transportation menu, and select \"Invite a Sim to a Community Lot\". Babies and toddlers cannot be taken to community lots, and children cannot be left at home alone. You'll need to leave a Teen or older Sim behind, or call a nanny to watch over them."
