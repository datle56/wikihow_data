[12] X Research source You typically only have time to ask 3 to 5 questions at the end of the interview. Compiling a longer list can help you adapt to the information you learn in the interview and ensure you’re getting your most pressing questions answered. Be respectful of the interviewer’s time and limit your questions to avoid going over the scheduled meeting time. You’ll have time to ask additional questions at the next interview or when you get the job offer."

So, make sure the questions you ask aren’t easy to find on the company’s website or have already been answered by the interviewer. [13] X Research source Asking engaging questions also helps you stand out from the competition, as it's apparent you’ve done your research on the company and are curious to learn what it’s like to be in the specific role. For instance, avoid asking what the company does or what the basic responsibilities of the job are, as these have likely already been covered. Note : It’s okay to get clarification about certain points the interviewer brought up. Just ensure you expand or build off of their clarification so they’re not just repeating themselves."

      "title": "Ensure your questions are open-ended.",
      "content": "Ensure your questions are open-ended. Ask questions that require the interviewer to give you detailed answers rather than a “Yes” or “No.” This helps you get the information you need to make a better decision. Open-ended questions are also a great way to highlight the skills and strengths you’re bringing to the table. [14] X Research source Plus, open-ended questions give the interview a more conversational feeling, which can help you relax a little bit. For instance, ask “What skills and experiences do you expect the ideal candidate to have?” rather than “Is it important that I have leadership experience to succeed in this role?” Note : If there’s a specific and direct question you want answered, life and career coach Shannon O’Brien says it’s fine to ask a “Yes” or “No” question."

For instance, if you’re doing a phone screening or interviewing with a recruiter, you might want to stick to questions about the job, company, and next steps. If you’re interviewing with a team member or your boss, they’ll have more insight about the group dynamics, management styles, growth opportunities, and onboarding process."

      "content": "Write down the interviewer’s answers to your questions. Whether you’re interviewing in person or remotely, have something with you to take notes about the interviewer’s answers. This is a simple way to ensure you remember what they said. Plus, it can help you stand out, as it shows that you’re interested and serious about the role. [15] X Research source Just write a few, quick words that summarize their answer so the interviewer knows you’re listening. Writing down every word they say can take time away from the interview or even look like you’re not paying attention to them."

      "content": "Wait to ask questions about salary or benefits until you get a job offer. Unless the interviewer brings it up, avoid asking about salary or benefits until you know the company is invested in you or offers you the job. [16] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Asking about salary and benefits in the initial interviews can come across like you’re only interested in the compensation. Plus, at this point, you don’t have much power or leverage to negotiate a better salary. [17] X Research source During the initial interviews, the interviewers might ask you about your salary requirements. Either ask them what the salary range is for the position, or provide the salary range you’re hoping to receive."
