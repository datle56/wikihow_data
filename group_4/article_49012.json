Cables must be secured so that, if there is tugging or pulling further down the line, the live wires don't rip out of the box and cause issues. Some boxes have clamps to hold onto the wires. Current electrical codes require any switch box without built-in clamps to have the wires secured within eight inches of the box. Secure to the center of the stud, in the wall, so that it will not be hit by drywall studs later on if you were to hang anything near the light."

Leave 8–10 inches (20.3–25.4 cm) of wire inside both boxes (source and first switch) before cutting the cable to facilitate easy connection to the switch and power source. Connect the ground wire to the circuit ground wire(s) with a wire nut or other approved connection (see How to Connect Electrical Wire ). The ground wire should be connected to the neutral terminal bar. Finally, connect the black wire to the hot supply or the circuit breaker / fuse and the white to the neutral supply or neutral terminal bar in the electrical panel. If equipped with a separate ground bar, rather than connecting to the neutral terminal bar, the ground wire can connect to the ground terminal bar. However, if all the existing ground wires connect to one bar and all the existing white wires connect to a different bar, maintaining separate ground and neutral connections is required. Never introduce ground wire(s) to a terminal bar with only white or gray insulated wires connected or vice versa. If the power source is an electrical panel or fuse box, the cable should be cut at least long enough to reach the furthest termination point (breaker or fuse, ground and neutral bar) without the need of splicing."

Provide as shorter lengths (8 inches/20.5 cm) of bare or green insulated wire to this wire-nutted group to allow connection to green ground terminal screws on each device in the box (switches, outlets, fixtures, etc.) - one length of insulated wire per ground terminal screw. If the switch or junction box is metal, it too must be securely grounded with a green ground screw or approved grounding clip. This must be done at each and every box that a cable enters and at each device that provides a termination point for ground. It is highly recommended that you complete these ground connections first, and then gently fold them into the rear of the box - out of the way - leaving only the shorter ground leads out for easy connection to devices.

NM cable is easier to work than other cable types, requires no special tools or preparation, and costs less. For these reasons, it is widely used.

Cables lacking a green insulated wire use the outer metal jacket as the ground conductor. Type AC is fabricated with a continuous internal bonding conductor in contact with the metal sheath.
