      "content": "Get your family off their phones and out of the house. These days, it seems like we’re always glued to a screen, whether it’s a phone, a computer, or a tablet. If your whole family is distracted by technology, you may not be bonding as much as you should. To get your family off their devices, childcare and parenting specialist Kathy Slattengren recommends that you “Go for family hikes, go camping, go to the park… If we want our kids off their digital devices, we’ve got to get off ours and go and engage with them.” Here are some examples of fun activities you can do in your own backyard: [2] X Research source Draw on your sidewalk with chalk Fly a kite Catch fireflies Jump in the pool Camp in your backyard Walk your dog Ride your bikes Practice rollerskating Play tag Play kickball Have a water balloon fight Plant a garden Collect bugs Build an obstacle course Look for 4-leaf clovers Play in the rain (or the snow) Build a birdhouse Tie-dye t-shirts Look for shapes in the clouds Have a BBQ"

      "content": "Plan activities your teen will actually enjoy. Every teenager is different, but it’s often hard for parents to get their teen excited about family activities. Get to know your child’s current interests and hobbies. Then, find a way you can enjoy them together. If you’re not sure what your teen will enjoy, Panlilio says to have a discussion with them: “It’s asking them what their interest is, what they are valuing, what’s important to them, and letting them try it without having to commit to it.” Here are some great teen-friendly ideas: [5] X Research source Tell scary stories Make a scrapbook Take about the future Start a gratitude journal Try foods from different cultures Take a class together (like painting or photography) Tour a nearby college Make a t-shirt quilt Learn to play a new sport Volunteer at an animal shelter Play video games Get a manicure or pedicure Create a vision board Make TikTok videos Go laser tagging Do an escape room See who can tell the worst dad joke Make a song parody Take online personality tests Binge-watch a TV show"

      "content": "Spend time with your adult family to strengthen your bond. Once you’re an adult, life often gets in the way and you may not see your family as often as you used to. If you have adult children (or if you’re the adult child), try to plan some fun activities with your family to bond and create new memories.

      "content": "Do something by yourself if you need time away from your family. Even if you’re close to your family, you’ll need some personal space now and then. If you can’t get away from your family altogether, try slipping away to your room or another private area so you can destress. Do something you enjoy by yourself rather than being bored around everyone else. Panlilio says, “Boredom is a choice. You can choose to be bored, or you can choose to be proactive and find something to do that creates stimulation.” Here are some examples of fun, solo activities: Read a book Do origami Call a friend Listen to a podcast Practice learning a new language Journal Listen to music Write a letter to your future self Research your family tree Rearrange your bedroom Solve a crossword puzzle Start a blog Draw something Learn to knit Learn to sew Take a bubble bath Meditate Give yourself a facial Start a workout routine Write a story"
