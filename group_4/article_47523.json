      "content": "Clip 1 end of the chain to a front belt loop. Find a belt loop along the front of your waist, close to the center of your waistband. Secure 1 end of the chain to this loop, so the jean chain is visible along the side of your leg. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Attach the other end of the chain to a back belt loop.",
      "content": "Attach the other end of the chain to a back belt loop. Locate a belt loop directly above your bottom and clip the other end of the chain there. Choose belt loops that are on the same side, so the chain can drape nicely over 1 leg. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Attach the other end to your wallet instead of a belt loop, alternatively.",
      "content": "Attach the other end to your wallet instead of a belt loop, alternatively. Clip the chain to the wallet’s “grommet,” which is the loop or ring attached to the accessory. Secure the other end of the chain to a front belt loop. Then, slip the wallet into your back pocket, so you can grab it easily. Most people like to keep their wallet along the same side as their dominant hand."

      "title": "Drape your chain between 2 front belt loops for a unique look.",
      "content": "Drape your chain between 2 front belt loops for a unique look. Clip the chain between the loops along the front of your pants. This sets a really cool, industrial tone for the rest of your ensemble. [3] X Research source You can also wear more than 1 chain at once. For instance, you can drape a decorative chain along the front of your pants, and wear your actual wallet chain as normal."

    {
      "title": "Layer multiple chains between your front and back pocket.",
      "content": "Layer multiple chains between your front and back pocket. Some chains are designed with multiple chains strung between point A and point B. Pick out one of these chains if you’d like a really eye-catching, dynamic accessory. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a chain metal that’s in your price range.",
      "content": "Choose a chain metal that’s in your price range. Most jean chains are made with brass, silver, or stainless steel. Pick a silver chain if you’re going for a more expensive, luxurious option. For a budget-friendly accessory, look for brass or stainless steel chains instead. Brass tends to be a little more lightweight, but it’s not as long-lasting as other metals. Silver and stainless steel chains look great when paired with dark clothing. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick out chains with a fun, unique design.",
      "content": "Pick out chains with a fun, unique design. A lot of companies make chains with special charms or keychains coming off the side. Pick out a design that matches your personal taste and aesthetic, so you feel comfortable wearing your jeans chain out and about. [6] X Research source For example, you might wear a jeans chain designed with skulls for a more punk look. You could wear a long chain with colorful charms hanging off for a more eclectic, relaxed style. Pick out a woven, non-metal chain for a more relaxed look. Some chains have funky, custom clips, like a boat anchor."

      "title": "Change things up with a really long chain.",
      "content": "Change things up with a really long chain. Most jeans chains fall a little below your front pocket, but they don’t have to be that way! Shop for a really long jean chain that falls below your knee, instead. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick out a chunky chain for a dynamic look.",
      "content": "Pick out a chunky chain for a dynamic look. If you like rocking bolder looks, wear an extra thick chain that’s as wide as a normal industrial chain. To really switch things up, look for thick chains in a bright, flashy color."
