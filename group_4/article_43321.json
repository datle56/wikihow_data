When you’re looking at a designer bag, the stitching will always be high quality. [1] X Expert Source Daniel Gbenle Sneaker Authenticator & Founder of Certisfied Expert Interview. 18 April 2025. For the designer to keep a pristine reputation, they have to consistently sell quality products. [2] X Research source Make sure to check the stitching on the inside of the bag too.

      "content": "Inspect the purse's leather and lining. Smell the bag you're considering purchasing—if it's made of leather, it should smell like leather. Then, give it a quick lift; leather bags will be pretty heavy. If you notice that the bag is very light and flimsy, then there's a good chance that it's fake. [4] X Expert Source Daniel Gbenle Sneaker Authenticator & Founder of Certisfied Expert Interview. 18 April 2025. A real designer bag will be lined, often with polyester, nylon, or cotton material. For reference, lining is sewn on the inside of the bag's outer shell. [5] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Image Consultant Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. If the bag's lining is sloppy, bumpy, or loose, then there's a good chance that the bag you're considering is a fake."

      "content": "Check the functionality and quality of the zipper. The zippers should zip very smoothly, and feel heavy and of high-quality. Zip your bag's zipper all the way up as a test. If the pull falls off quickly, the bag's probably fake. Or, if the zipper feels light and flimsy, that’s a bad sign too. [6] X Expert Source Daniel Gbenle Sneaker Authenticator & Founder of Certisfied Expert Interview. 18 April 2025. [7] X Research source Usually, the underside of the zipper pull will have a logo. Many handbag manufacturers use the same high-quality zipper manufacturer on all of their bags. So when in doubt, check for this as well! Balenciaga, for instance, typically uses zippers with \"Lampo\" printed on the back."

      "content": "Examine the bag for brand tags, authenticity labels, and serial numbers. Check to see if your bag has an inside tag with a brand name and a serial number on it (because almost all authentic purses will). The inside tags should be hand-stitched or stamped into the leather. [8] X Expert Source Daniel Gbenle Sneaker Authenticator & Founder of Certisfied Expert Interview. 18 April 2025. In some cases, designers also include authenticity labels on the outside of the bag. Chanel actually comes with a physical card separate of the bag, which has a 6-number serial code. [9] X Research source Some fake bags may have authenticity tags, but the text will be in a different font and size than the original. [10] X Research source These numbers are sort of like a passport or license—they give one bag a unique identity, making it way harder to replicate. If your bag is missing one, that’s a red flag! A lot of the time, these codes can be searched online with code checkers. This is a great way to tell if your bag is fake, but not an effective way to be sure that it's real (because even though it's hard, codes can be replicated by scammers)."

Check the clasps, buckles, and other hardware on your bag—it should all be made of the same metal, and that metal should have the same color and finish (the exception to this is Chloé bags, which might use a variety). The hardware should be heavy, feel smooth, and be of high-quality. [11] X Expert Source Daniel Gbenle Sneaker Authenticator & Founder of Certisfied Expert Interview. 18 April 2025. [12] X Research source Real designer bags’ hardware is metal, while many fakes use plastic. Unlike plastic, metal hardware will absorb heat or cold. So quickly feel your bag’s hardware—if it’s been sitting out in the sunshine, is it hot? If it’s been in an air-conditioned room, is it a little chillier? [13] X Research source"

Take a close look at your logo and google standard logos for the designer, then compare. If you notice a difference, then this means you’re buying a legal knockoff—but a knockoff nonetheless. [15] X Research source For example, fake Michael Kors bags often feature an \"M\" charm instead of \"MK\" hanging from the handle. Meanwhile, fake Yves Saint Laurent bags often have an \"SL\" charm instead of \"YSL.\""
