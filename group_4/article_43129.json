Signs of lust might include focusing on each other’s appearance, having a relationships that revolves around sex, and little interest in having real conversations and getting to know the other person. Having a relationship based entirely on sexual attraction can work for a while, but things can become complicated if one partner feels love for the other while the other only feels lust.

Think about whether you and the other person have long and deep conversations to really get to know each other and if you value each other’s happiness. Analyze if you want to be part of that person’s life by getting to know friends and family, and whether you feel romantic attachment to that person. Do you share similar values and interests? Do you feel a deep connection to that person? Some qualities you might find in a suitable partner include: A commitment to personal growth and becoming a better person. An awareness of their own baggage or weaknesses. Emotional openness. Responsible and respectful. Integrity; they practice honesty with you, themselves, and others. Loves because they feel good about themselves, not in order to feel good about themselves."

If they only talk about your appearance or your sex life, that points to it being primarily a case of sexual attraction. Even if you might feel love, you have to consider the other person’s feelings and ideas about the connection you share. Discussions like these can be uncomfortable, but they can also help clarify how you both feel. \"I really like hanging out with you and I hope you like hanging out with me. What do you have the most fun doing together?\" \"I don’t want a big serious conversation, but I wanted to know if you like keeping things the way they are between us or if ultimately you might be looking for more.\" \"I know we haven’t defined things, and that’s fine, but I wanted to know how you see our relationship.\""
