      "content": "Apply a cold compress to soothe the hives. Cool temperatures usually alleviate the itching from hives. Take either an ice pack or a towel soaked in cold water and press it against the affected area. Hold it on for 15 minutes at a time to soothe the hives. This is a good treatment for hives that don’t cover a widespread area. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If you use ice or a cold pack, always wrap it in a towel before applying it. Cold temperatures directly on your skin can cause damage. You can re-wet the towel as needed if you’re using cold water."

Then soak for 20-30 minutes to soothe your skin. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you can bear it, a cool bath will soothe the hives best. However, this may be uncomfortable, so a lukewarm bath is a good choice for more comfort that won’t aggravate the hives. You can buy colloidal oatmeal at most food stores and pharmacies.

Until your symptoms improve, stick with comfortable, loose-fitting clothing to let your skin breathe. Good choices are sweatpants, loose shirts, pajama pants, and athletic shorts. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to dress as cool as possible too, because heat can make hives worse.

      "content": "Track your activities to see if something specific causes your hives. In many cases, your hives have a specific trigger that causes a flareup. Figuring out your triggers can help you treat the hives and avoid further outbreaks. Track your meals, outfits, and activities to see what you were doing leading up to a hive outbreak. This will give you an idea of what caused it. [9] X Research source Almost anything can cause hives, so the triggers are very specific to you. Common hive triggers are certain foods, medications, pet dander, plants, dyes and food colorings, heat, stress, and pressure. Keeping a hive journal is a good way to track your activities. Write down when your hives started and what you did 1-2 hours before that, including what you were wearing and what you ate. If you see a doctor or allergist at some point, bring the journal with you."

      "content": "Avoid your triggers to prevent further flareups. Once you’ve made a list of activities you were doing before getting the hives, you’ll probably have an idea of what caused them. If you can narrow the list down to a few specific ingredients or activities, then avoid them as much as you can to prevent future hive outbreaks. [10] X Research source If you can’t narrow down your triggers, try gradual elimination. For instance, if you suspect that either shellfish or Advil caused your hives, eliminate Advil first and see if your hives come back. If they do, then avoid shellfish instead. This way, you can gradually see what activities do and don’t cause your hives. Remember that you can still treat your hives effectively even if you don’t know what causes them. Many people with chronic hives never find out their specific trigger, but still manage their symptoms just fine.

If you suffer from chronic hives or regularly get outbreaks when you’re feeling stressed, then take steps to alleviate that stress. Take some time to do enjoyable activities like listening to music, watching a movie, or anything else you enjoy. Regular exercise is also a great stress-reducer. Try some stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Set aside 10 minutes in the morning and evening to de-stress with these activities. If you do get hives, try to remain calm because increased stress can make the hives worse. Remind yourself that the hives are an inconvenience, but they aren’t dangerous.
