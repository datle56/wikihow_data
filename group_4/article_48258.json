Since this is one of the 4 base races you have a chance of rolling at the beginning of the game, it's easier for everyone to get, change to, and use. Shark gets a boost to defense and an even bigger boost in water. You can even opt for a heal ability when the race is upgraded to V4, so grinding is easy and fast! The damage reduction abilities make this the best PVP race for beginners. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "While some races, like Rabbit, are very situational, other races, like Shark, are more well-rounded and easier to play. Races like Cyborg and Angel are sometimes slotted as the best for the game, but they are more difficult to get than the starter races, so this guide takes that added level of difficulty into mind when considering the best race in Blox Fruits. Race Tier Ranking Reason Angel S Upgraded versions of Angel can fly; and the V3 ability called Heavenly Blood increases defense and heals the player around 20% of their maximum health, making this a formidable race in PvE and PvP. The Angel race has fewer defense skills so it's not as tanky as Shark. [2] X Research source Shark/Fishman S You can get a lot of defense buffs with the Shark race, making it harder or near impossible to kill. This race excels in the water and further increases damage reduction. It's the best race for newer players since it's very forgiving. [3] X Research source Cyborg A The energy core move deals substantial damage and breaks enemy combos, and the v4 ability gives you a dash ability, which makes Cyborg great for PvP Get this race by completing the Cyborg Puzzle. Human B There aren't any damage-reduction skills for Human, but this race is focused more on dealing damage. In v3, Human has a skill called Last Resort that deals damage based on the player's current health, which can be high if the player is under 50% health. This race is riskier to play in PvP. [4] X Research source Rabbit/Mink C It's a fast race that excels at running away, getting out of danger, or chasing other characters. The v4 skill that summons green tornadoes is a strategic skill that spawns after the player dashes, but this isn't a race based on dealing damage. Ghoul D The life steal passive is weaker than expected and doesn't make this race stand out too much from the pack of available races in Blox Fruits. Most of the awakened abilities are visual instead of awesome skills. Get this race for 100 ectoplasm and a Hellfire Torch through Experience. [5] X Research source"
