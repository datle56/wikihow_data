      "content": "“Ugly hot” is another term for “unconventionally attractive.” A conventionally attractive person checks all the boxes for beauty standards (whether or not those standards are fair). [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Ugly hot people, on the other hand, might have unique or unusual features that you (or others) find irresistible, even if they aren’t what you first think of when you think of a “hot person.” [2] X Research source They just make it work! For example, society tends to value symmetrical faces, clear skin, toned bodies, and features that align with a person’s gender. Ugly hot people might have asymmetrical faces, unique builds, etc. Personality is a huge factor, too. Someone who’s endearing, sweet, funny, or confident might be considered attractive, even if they don’t have the typical “attractive” features."

      "content": "Adam Driver We want to get it right out of the way that we don’t love the term “ugly hot” and would never call anyone on this list (or anyone in general) “ugly.” We definitely prefer “unconventionally attractive.” It’s just more sophisticated, don't cha think? Anyway, Adam Driver is the poster celeb for unconventionally attractive. It’s hard to pinpoint it, but we like that he’s just so… big."

These are people who by all means should be attractive, but just… aren’t. They might check all the boxes—dazzling eyes, full lips, the whole nine yards—but the sum of all those parts is maybe a bit underwhelming. [3] X Research source Just like with ugly hotness, personality is a factor. Even the hottest people are sometimes spoiled by a mean, rude, or otherwise unsavory personality."
