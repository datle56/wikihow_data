      "content": "Every verse ends with the same word or group of words (radif). It makes sense to choose one that can be flexible in use and meaning, so you can use it in different ways in each sher , or couplet. You're bound to make a few false starts, and you'll soon realise that your choice of radif is the single most important factor in determining how successful your ghazal is likely to be."

      "title": "The qaafiya is a rhyme that precedes the radif.",
      "content": "The qaafiya is a rhyme that precedes the radif. Again, pick something with lots of possibilities. [5] X Research source Qafiya, a cornerstone of Arabic poetry, serves as a rhythmic anchor, unifying the poem's structure while enhancing its melodic flow and emotional impact. A poet's mastery in old Arabic poems was often measured by their adeptness at using qaafiya. Like a skilled weaver crafting a tapestry, they carefully selected threads of words that not only rhymed but also enhanced the poem's meaning."

      "title": "Traditional topics include wine and drunkenness.",
      "content": "Traditional topics include wine and drunkenness. When taken literally, this is quite something when you consider the time and place of origin of this poetic form! When taken metaphorically, wine represents the divine, or a connection or conduit to the divine. Drunkenness represents a meal of this food for the spirit. Another traditional topic is love (where it's often deliberately ambiguous whether the poet is referring to divine love or love between two people). At the same time, however, the key word is \"traditional\". As with any poetic form, you can write about any topic that works. See also for example Patricia Smith's \"Hip-Hop Ghazal\"."

      "title": "A ghazal consists of a series of couplets (two-line verses).",
      "content": "A ghazal consists of a series of couplets (two-line verses). Each line contains the same number of syllables. Each couplet is a separate, complete mini-poem, so there's no need for any narrative progression, or any real connection between the couplets. Both lines of the first verse end with the qaafiya and radif. See down the page for an example ghazal. [6] X Research source Remember, each couplet constitutes a separate little poem, so don't have one verse rely on a previous one to make sense."

      "title": "Try to end with something subtle yet unexpected.",
      "content": "Try to end with something subtle yet unexpected. This will cause the reader to ponder your words, and hence will add more depth to your ghazal. Traditionally, the poet's pen-name was included in the last verse; this final couplet usually contains a 'turn', or change of tone, to something more personal or quirky. In the past, Arabic poets often included their names, titles, or family names in their poems to express pride. While you don't have to do this if you prefer a humbler approach, it can be fun to try a traditional Arabic title. For example, you could use 'Abu' (Father of) followed by your son/ daughter's name, or if you don't have kids yet, you could use a future name. Another option to emulate the style of ancient Arab poets is to use a descriptive adjective as a title. For example, \"Al-Nabigha\" (meaning \"the genius\") is a well-known title used by poets. You can create your own title by finding an adjective you like, translating it into Arabic, and adding \"Al-\" at the beginning. For example, if you like the word \"wise,\" you could use \"Al-Hakim\" (the wise) as your title."
