      "content": "Tightness around the legs Ideally, the leg holes in a diaper should be snug but not tight. You can test this by slipping 2 fingers in between your baby’s leg and the diaper. If you can’t fit 2 fingers in between, then the diaper is too tight. [1] X Research source Similarly, the diaper’s leg holes should be snug without gaps. If you notice the diaper gaping or your baby has frequent leaks, their diapers might be too big."

      "content": "Irritated or red skin A diaper that is too small will rub and chafe your baby’s skin. Take a look at your baby’s belly and legs to search for any red marks. If you find irritated or red skin, it’s likely that your baby needs to go up a size. [2] X Research source The front of the diaper should sit just below your baby’s belly button."

      "content": "Tabs don’t reach the stomach The tabs, or the sticky parts that hold the diaper closed, should fold easily over your baby’s belly and stay put. If the tabs don’t reach your baby’s belly or they continuously pop open, it’s probably time for a new diaper size. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Frequent blow-outs or leaks",
      "content": "Frequent blow-outs or leaks All diapers have a maximum absorption rate; after they are too full, they tend to leak. When your baby wears a diaper that’s too small, they tend to have more blow-outs and leaks, mainly because they’re reaching the maximum absorption rate very quickly. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Diaper rash While diaper rash isn’t always caused by a too-small diaper, a tight diaper that doesn’t allow air flow could exacerbate the problem. If your baby just recently started dealing with diaper rash, double check that their diaper is the right size. If it’s too small, it could be irritating their skin. [6] X Research source The best way to treat diaper rash is to keep your baby’s bottom clean and dry as much as you can."

      "content": "Diapers are sized by weight, not age. Your 6-month-old baby may not be the same size as someone else’s 6-month-old baby. That’s why diaper sizes go by your baby’s weight, not how old they are (plus, weight is the most accurate way to determine the right fit). [8] X Research source There are general height and weight charts that your baby may fall on, but babies tend to grow at different rates. As long as your pediatrician says that your baby looks good, you can rest assured that they are developing normally."
