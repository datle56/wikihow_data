While XLOOKUP is designed to only look up a single value, you can use Boolean logic or concatenation to find multiple criteria. Boolean logic is the easier of the two. Boolean logic in Excel is when the result of a query is either true (1) or false (0). When you combine Boolean logic with XLOOKUP, the formula will create a temporary lookup array of 1's and 0's to find a result that matches all of the lookup criteria. Basic Boolean XLOOKUP formula: =XLOOKUP(1, (lookup_array1=lookup_value1) * (lookup_array2=lookup_value2) * (insert one array for each lookup_value), return_array) Concatenation in Excel is when the & operator is used to join values together. [1] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source When you use concatenation with XLOOKUP, the lookup_value and lookup_array will be concatenated to make the formula think it's only looking up one value. Basic concatenation XLOOKUP formula: =XLOOKUP(lookup_value1 & lookup_value2 & [insert each lookup value], lookup_array1 & lookup_array2 & [insert each lookup array], return_array)"

The \"Criteria\" section will be used to input lookup values into your formula, and the \"Result\" section is where you will actually put your XLOOKUP formula to get the intended result. Example: You have a spreadsheet with columns for cake flavors, cake sizes, and prices. You want to create an XLOOKUP formula with Boolean logic that will look up the price of a cake based on the flavor and size that you input. Your spreadsheet has 3 columns (cake flavors, cake sizes, and prices) that are in columns A, B, and C. Skip column D, then put the \"Criteria\" and \"Result\" sections in columns E and F as follows: E F 1 Criteria 2 Flavor (you will enter a flavor here) 3 Size (you will enter a size here) 4 5 Result 6 Price (the formula will return a price here)"

Comparing this to the basic XLOOKUP formula ( =XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, result_array) ), the 1 in the XLOOKUP Boolean logic formula is considered the lookup_value . The reason that you set 1 as the lookup_value is because \"1\" correlates to \"TRUE.\" When you input lookup criteria into your formula, XLOOKUP will check that criteria against the arrays in the formula and create an array of TRUE and FALSE values. These values are then converted into numbers, and XLOOKUP will then look for the first 1 in that array (in other words, the first result that matches all of the lookup criteria)."

Separate each pair with an asterisk (*), and add a comma after the last array/value set. Your lookup array will be the cell range that contains the information you want to look through for that particular lookup value. Your lookup value will reference one of the cells under the \"Criteria\" section you made in Step 2. Example: Your lookup arrays will be the contents of the \"flavor\" and \"size\" columns. Each column has 9 rows of data, so the flavor array is A2:A10 and the size array is B2:B10. Your lookup values will be F2 (for flavor) and F3 (for size) as they are the cells directly to the right of the Flavor and Size labels in the \"Criteria\" section.
