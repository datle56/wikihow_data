      "title": "Your package hasn’t been scanned yet.",
      "content": "Your package hasn’t been scanned yet. More often than not, a UPS tracking number is “invalid” because the package is still waiting to be processed. While UPS has your package, they haven’t loaded it onto the truck yet, and this can cause a delay in shipment information. Our best advice? Wait 24 hours, and then try tracking the package again. This reason is often the case during holiday seasons. For instance, if you drop a package off the day before a government holiday (like Labor Day), the tracking number may not be available until the following day. If your tracking number is still “invalid” after 24 hours, contact Customer Service at 1-888-742-5877 or message Customer Support through live chat . [1] X Research source"
