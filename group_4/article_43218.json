      "content": "Note when you have trouble getting or keeping an erection. The telltale symptom of erectile dysfunction is the inability to achieve an erection or to maintain one during sexual activities. Watch for times when you don’t have an erection when you otherwise should (e.g., during foreplay). [1] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Having ED doesn’t mean you can never achieve an erection; it just means that you frequently experience this type of difficulty. Note that occasional difficulty getting an erection isn’t necessarily a cause for concern. It’s just when it happens frequently that it becomes a problem."

      "content": "Be on the lookout for reduced interest in sexual activities. Reduced sexual desire is another very common symptom of erectile dysfunction. However, this type of disinterest can have a number of different causes, so this by itself doesn’t necessarily point to ED. Always get a professional diagnosis before leaping to a conclusion regarding ED. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For instance, a mental health issue like depression can also cause reduced sexual desire. Additionally, SSRI or SNRI mood medications used to treat depression, such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Celexa, can lower your libido."

      "content": "Watch for symptoms that persist for 2 months or more. Although it can be alarming, being unable to get an erection once or twice is not necessarily cause for concern (in fact it’s quite normal). However, if you experience the symptoms of ED for 2 months, then you should visit your doctor to have yourself diagnosed. If you experience more severe symptoms (such as the inability to get an erection at all), then you may want to visit your doctor sooner rather than later."

      "content": "Look for other sexual disorders that coincide with your ED. If you experience the symptoms of other sexual disorders, such as premature ejaculation or delayed ejaculation, this may indicate a more serious underlying health issue. Make an appointment with your doctor to have these different symptoms evaluated and find out what is causing them. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re experiencing the symptoms of multiple disorders, you should schedule a doctor’s visit regardless of how long you’ve been experiencing them (i.e., don’t wait 2 months to get them checked out)."

      "content": "Have your doctor conduct a physical and psychological exam. The physical exam will likely include a careful examination of your penis and testicles for any outward signs of an illness. Your doctor will also ask you questions to ascertain what, if any, psychological issues may be causing your symptoms. For example, your doctor might ask if you’re under a lot of stress, if there are any problems in the relationship with your sexual partner, or if you’re experiencing any mental or emotional distress. Your doctor may also check the nerves in your penis to see if they properly respond to sensation."

Your doctor will take a small sample of blood intravenously and have it sent to a lab to check for illnesses that might cause ED. These include diabetes, heart disease, prostate cancer, or low testosterone levels. [5] X Research source Blood tests generally take about 24 hours to perform, so don’t expect to receive the results from your test right away. Your doctor can do a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to check for prostate cancer, which may contribute to ED or urinary symptoms.

      "content": "Undergo a fasting blood test or A1C test to check for diabetes. Your doctor will likely check for diabetes because it can cause erectile dysfunction. For a fasting blood test, you'll avoid food and beverages besides water overnight. Then, you'll get your blood drawn in the morning so your doctor can test your blood sugar. If you get an A1C test, your doctor will draw your blood and test it to check your average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. [7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source These tests won't be painful, but you might experience some discomfort during the blood draw. Your doctor may also do a urinalysis to check for diabetes. This test will involve you urinating into a sterile container, which a lab technician will examine to see if it indicates that you may have diabetes.

      "content": "Ask your doctor if you should have an ultrasound performed. An ultrasound is performed in order to determine if there are blood flow problems that may be causing your erectile dysfunction. This test is typically performed by a specialist, so your doctor may recommend you to a different healthcare provider for this exam. [9] X Research source During the ultrasound, a specialist holds a transducer over the blood vessels that supply the penis to create a video image of the blood flow into your penis."

      "content": "Take medications to treat ED as prescribed by your doctor. Not all men with erectile dysfunction need to take medication to treat it, but some may benefit from taking certain ED medicines. The most commonly prescribed medications are sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil. [10] X Research source These drugs are typically taken as needed, rather than on a regular basis. Talk with your doctor to determine how you should take any medication they prescribe you. These drugs enhance the effects of nitric oxide, the chemical that regulates the muscles in your penis. This enhancement increases blood flow to your penis, making it easier to get an erection. Not all drugs or dosages will be right for you. Work with your doctor to figure out which drug and dosage has the best effect on your condition."
