Continue to mix the texture mix with water until it reaches a pasty consistency like pancake mix. One of the most popular brands of texture mix is Sheetrock texture paint. You can use a 5-gallon (3.7 liters) bucket for this."

Practice painting your textured paint onto the surface of some cardboard. If the mixture is too thick or not the texture that you want, add more water to your drywall mixture."

A textured hopper will look like a paint gun with a large funnel on the end of it. If you can't find textured paint guns, ask a sales associate at the hardware store or search online for a \"textured spray paint gun.\" Sprayers typically cost $225 to $400.

For the traditional drywall compound, use one part powder to six parts water and mix it together until it reaches a pancake batter-like consistency. If your drywall mixture is too thick, add more water until it loosens up. [3] X Research source If you are having trouble mixing your compound by hand, use a drill and ribbon mixer."

      "content": "Wait 30 minutes and push the paint with a knock-down blade. Allow the paint to harden a little, but not enough to be completely dry. Once it's stiffened up, use a knock-down blade to press down the textured ceiling. A knock-down blade is a handheld tool with a flat edge that you can use to push down overly textured stipple. [6] X Research source Using a knock-down blade over the entirety of your ceiling will give it a unified texture."

To preserve the look of your furniture, make sure to move it out of the room. If you have oriental rugs or carpets, you can roll those up and put them out of the room as well. Dried paint is easier to clean off hard flooring than carpet or upholstery. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove fixtures from your ceiling. Fixtures will cover up portions of your ceiling and make it impossible to stipple it consistently throughout. Find your circuit breaker box and turn off the power for the fuse that you're working on. Unscrew ceiling lights , fans, and chandeliers from your ceiling with a Phillips-head screwdriver or screwdriver that fits the screws in your lighting fixtures. Double-check that the flow of electricity to your light is off by flipping the light switch on and off. If you're uncertain how to disconnect electrical fixtures properly, hire an electrician. For fixtures that you can't remove, apply painters tape around the edge of them so that they don't get paint on them."

To prevent your paint from dripping onto your walls, you'll need to apply painter's tape to the edges of where your walls meet your ceiling. Roll out long pieces of tape and apply it to the top of your walls and around the perimeter of the ceiling you intend on painting. Applying 5-8 inches (12.7-20.32 cm) of painters tape will ensure that the ceiling paint will not drip onto your walls. If you paint outside of the lines, your paint will end up on the painter's tape and not the walls."

Use a brush and dip it in the primer before applying it to your ceiling. Allow the primer to dry overnight before continuing with the rest of your project. Applying primer will allow the heavy textured paint to adhere to your ceiling. [9] X Research source When using an oil-based primer, make sure to open the windows and to have proper air ventilation."
