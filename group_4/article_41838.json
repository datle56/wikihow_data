      "content": "Take courses in metaphysics. There are many institutions that offer courses on the metaphysical sciences – like the University of Metaphysical Sciences. [1] X Research source These kinds of courses will allow you to study metaphysics with the help of trained professionals who will guide you in your journey toward understanding. These courses will help you learn about various metaphysical philosophies as well as aid you in your path toward a career relating to the metaphysical sciences if that is what you desire. [2] X Research source Some regular universities offer courses on metaphysics too."

      "content": "Gain legitimacy by attaining a degree in metaphysical teachings. Getting a degree in metaphysics will allow you more prestige as a metaphysical teacher or counselor by supplying you with the academic/professional background necessary to foster the kind of trust and respect so often required in this field. A degree will help you acquire more job opportunities [3] X Research source A degree in the field of metaphysics will help you achieve greater potential for opportunities to involve yourself in your chosen field, a greater understanding of the world around you, and better prospects in the field of metaphysics with regard to possible future employment."

      "title": "Become ordained in the field of metaphysics.",
      "content": "Become ordained in the field of metaphysics. Many people who work as a metaphysical professional do so under the umbrella of religious affiliation. Since the law does not typically separate the religious from the spiritual, metaphysical practitioners usually become ordained in their field in order to teach and guide others in the study of metaphysics. [4] X Research source To become ordained as a metaphysical practitioner, you will most likely need to enroll in a training program that offers ordination as an option. Consider a program like the two year course offered by the International Metaphysical Ministry (IMM) that ordains those who complete their training. [5] X Research source While a metaphysical degree can help you establish yourself as a trained professional, becoming ordained in the field will legally allow you to teach your beliefs to others."

      "title": "Introduce yourself to some basic metaphysical concepts.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself to some basic metaphysical concepts. Start by understanding the basic concepts of physics, math, logic, and philosophy. It seems difficult but introductory level books and Internet research can help. These fields are all crucial to your learning about metaphysics in general. Understand the philosophy of mathematics. Do not simply solve sums. Understand the concept of numbers and patterns in the universe. Gain a sound understanding of concepts related to physics. Concentrate on Einstein’s theory of relativity which explains how motion works by moving at constant, relative speeds between different inertial frames of reference. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn how to tell whether an object is abstract or concrete.",
      "content": "Learn how to tell whether an object is abstract or concrete. Metaphysics deals largely with understanding the difference between concrete and abstract objects. A concrete object is something quantifiable – a thing that you can physically touch or see. An abstract object is less definable because it is not something represented physically, but something embodied by an idea. For example, a number is an abstract object because it correlates to the idea of counting or measuring something. The physical thing being counted is a concrete object. [7] X Research source An abstract object does not exist in any particular time or space (such as ideas, mathematical objects, and fictional entities). Abstract objects are often called “particulars” or “universals.” Morality is considered causally inert because being good or bad doesn’t cause something to happen. It is merely an idea that qualifies or categorizes a thing. Metaphysicians are mostly concerned with the nature of objects and their properties."

      "title": "Study quantum physics.",
      "content": "Study quantum physics. Quantum physics posits that objects have a dual type of nature – what is known and what is not known. Simply, one cannot determine every unknown aspect about a particular object because there is always something beyond human knowledge, something unknown. [8] X Research source Quantum physicists believe that determinism was proven incorrect with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle claims that there is a limit to what one can know about things; therefore, nothing can ever be fully known."

      "title": "Research cosmology and cosmogony.",
      "content": "Research cosmology and cosmogony. Metaphysical Cosmology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the origin and development of the universe. It addresses questions about the universe beyond the scope of physical science. Cosmology is the study of how the world/universe operates. An example of a question cosmologists try to answer would be, “What is the purpose of the cosmos?” Cosmogony is the study of how the world/universe originated. An example of a question cosmogonists try to answer is “Did the Big Bang event create the idea of time itself?”"

      "title": "Consider whether you believe in determinism or free will.",
      "content": "Consider whether you believe in determinism or free will. Determinism proposes that every event — including every human decision and action — is the \"inevitable and necessary consequence\" of prior occurrences. [9] X Research source Determinists believe a human being's future depends on present and past events beyond the individual's influence. In philosophy it is believed that human decision is based on past events. Since metaphysics is related to the study of questions about existence, creation, and what it all means, there is a clear link with religion. Deciding whether you believe in determinism or not is a key factor in furthering your personal understanding and study of metaphysics because this is the foundation of how people interact with the world. If there is no free will, then humanity’s relationship with the world is much different than if they do have free will. Your study of metaphysics hinges largely on how you personally understand this one aspect."

      "title": "Study the relationship between metaphysics and religion.",
      "content": "Study the relationship between metaphysics and religion. Since metaphysics often focuses on the origins of the universe and the connection of humans to the universe, religion often comes in to play. Scientifically, the study of metaphysics deals with much more than just the religious aspects; however, those who want to teach and understand the more abstract elements of metaphysics usually do so under the umbrella of religion. Religion attempts to provide a metaphysical understanding of human existence, so the two are closely related."
