      "content": "Buy a pre-built steel cage trap from a hardware or hunting store. Choose a steel trap that is at least 12 in (30 cm) high, 10 in (25 cm) wide, and 30 in (76 cm) long. Steel traps made for raccoons are the perfect size for armadillos, and are built sturdy enough to handle its strength without breaking if it starts to panic. [1] X Research source While it is possible to build your own trap out of wood, it is much more convenient and just as cost-effective to buy a steel cage. Plus, you won't have to worry about whether the cage is strong enough."

      "content": "Set up the cage next to a fence or near its burrow. Armadillos are not interested in food if they do not have to dig for it — instead of enticing it with food, you will need to put the trap in a place where the armadillo will simply wander in. Place the trap directly outside of its burrow so it walks straight into the cage, or place it by a fence nearby its burrow to catch it as it wanders around the garden. Putting bait in the trap, such as earthworms, grubs, or fruit, can attract other animals such as raccoons and rabbits and render the trap useless until you empty it and reset the door mechanism.

      "title": "Place wooden boards on either side of the trap to funnel the armadillo in.",
      "content": "Place wooden boards on either side of the trap to funnel the armadillo in. Lay long wooden boards on either side of the trap to create a \"corridor\" leading to the opening in the trap. While it wanders around the yard, it will eventually find its way to the corridor and continue forward until it cannot anymore, leading it into the doorway of the trap. [3] X Research source You can use the side of a fence or a wall as one side of the corridor. Alternatively, placing the trap in a corner of the yard will have the same effect — the armadillo will have nowhere to go except into the trap."

      "content": "Consider alternatives, such as using a net or catching it by hand. While trapping an armadillo in a cage is the most effective method of capture, it is possible to catch it with your bare hands or a net. At night, stand outside the burrow and wait for it to come out, then either throw a net over it or grab it firmly by the tail and lift it into the air. Armadillos are strong, and will thrash around if you catch it by hand or with a net. [4] X Research source Wear thick gloves that cover your arms to prevent it from scratching you. Armadillos have a strong sense of smell, but terrible eyesight — stand downwind so you don't alert the armadillo to your presence. After a few minutes the armadillo will stop thrashing and succumb to its fate. Place it into a sturdy closed container, like a regular cage or wooden box, and get ready to transport it."

      "title": "Check the trap every morning.",
      "content": "Check the trap every morning. Armadillos tend to be out of their burrow and most active from dusk to dawn, so check the trap every morning to see if you have caught the mischievous critter. [5] X Research source Don't let it stay in the cage for too long or you could cause it to go hungry and act out of desperation. If another animal has found its way into the trap instead of an armadillo, look up how to relocate the animal, and clean out any droppings from the cage. The armadillo may avoid the trap if it smells another animal's scent."

      "title": "Place the trap holding the armadillo in the trunk of your car on a plastic sheet.",
      "content": "Place the trap holding the armadillo in the trunk of your car on a plastic sheet. Put down a piece of tarp or plastic before you put the trap in the trunk of your car to prevent dirt and waste from making it dirty. Put a blanket over the cage to block out light and make the armadillo more comfortable while you drive. Don't put the cage into the back of a pickup truck, as the wind may irritate and disturb the armadillo and you could hurt the armadillo if you hit bumps in the road and it gets tossed around."

      "title": "Look up relocation areas and services online, or find a natural area.",
      "content": "Look up relocation areas and services online, or find a natural area. Some states have special areas to relocate armadillos to, or have animal control experts who can handle the pest for you. Look up animal control services in your area who can come pick up the armadillo, or find a dedicated zone for armadillo relocation. [6] X Research source If there is no such service or area, find a natural, forested area to bring it to. If vegetation is thriving and there is a water source nearby, the armadillo won't want to come back and will stay in its new insect-ridden home."

      "title": "Take the trap out of the car, open the door, and let the armadillo run away.",
      "content": "Take the trap out of the car, open the door, and let the armadillo run away. Put the trap on the ground and open the front door. Step back a few feet and let the armadillo escape by itself. It may take a while, as the armadillo could be scared from the car ride. Don't try to remove the armadillo yourself as it may aggressively act out of desperation. [7] X Research source If the armadillo is particularly stubborn in leaving the cage, tip it forward by holding the rear to gently encourage it to leave the trap."

      "content": "Plant garlic and lay cayenne pepper around your garden to prevent intrusions. Garlic and cayenne pepper produce very strong scents for armadillos, and they may avoid digging in your garden if they smell overpowering scents. If you don't have room for new plants, sprinkle some garlic powder and cayenne pepper powder around the perimeter of your garden instead, as this will have the same effect. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure your fence is 18 in (46 cm) deep into the ground. The main way that armadillos get into yards is by burrowing. If armadillos are a particularly bad problem for you, consider uprooting your fence and install a new one that is at least 1.5 feet (0.46 m) deep into the ground. [9] X Research source Armadillos rarely dig deeper than this as it takes too much effort."

A regular insecticide treatment on your yard and garden will dissuade armadillos from settling on your property as they will not have any food to eat, and instead will look for a new place to get their grub."
