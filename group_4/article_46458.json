      "content": "Use xanthan gum as a binder if you’re vegan or have an egg allergy. Xanthan gum is a versatile thickener, and is a great substitute for eggs in baking recipes. Simply omit the eggs and whisk 1 to 2 tsp (2 1/2 to 5 g) of xanthan gum into your dry ingredients. [3] X Research source The more xanthan gum you use, the denser your baked good will be. In general, use 1/2 to 1 tsp (1 to 2 1/2 g) of xanthan gum per 1 c (120 g) of flour, or about 1/4 tsp (1/2 g) per egg. You can also find lots of recipes that incorporate xanthan gum online. [4] X Research source Look for xanthan gum in your local market’s baking supplies section, or purchase it online."

      "content": "Thicken sauces and condiments with 1/8 tsp (1/4 g) of xanthan gum. If you check the ingredients of your favorite salad dressing, chances are it’ll list xanthan gum. Try adding a pinch to your next made-from-scratch pan sauce, gravy, or dressing. It acts as an emulsifier, which means it helps thicken sauces and condiments and keeps them from separating. [5] X Research source For instance, blend together 2 1 ⁄ 2 c (590 mL) of ketchup and 2 US tbsp (30 mL) each of soy sauce, yuzu-kosho paste, and yuzu juice. When the ingredients are well-combined, add 1/8 (1/2 g) of xanthan gum, then blend on low for 10 to 20 seconds."

      "content": "Make lower-calorie smoothies and cocktails with it. Instead of using yogurt or ice cream, thicken your healthy smoothies with 1/2 to 1 tsp (1 to 2 1/2 g) of xanthan gum per 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid ingredients. Remember, more xanthan gum means a thicker mixture, so use more or less of it based on your preferences. If you’re a fan of frothy cocktails, like a gin fizz, but want to nix the egg white and its extra calories, try adding a pinch of xanthan gum to your cocktail shaker. For sweetened drinks, such as margaritas, try making a simple syrup by boiling equal parts water and sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Let the syrup cool to room temperature, transfer it to a blender, add 1/8 tsp (1/2 g) of xanthan gum, and blend the syrup on low for about 15 seconds. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Whisk it with oil or glycerin to prevent clumping. Xanthan gum is water soluble and dissolves in both warm and cold water. However, it sometimes forms clumps, especially when it’s not mixed vigorously. To help it dissolve evenly, try whisking 1 part of xanthan gum with 1 to 2 parts of oil or glycerin before adding it to liquids. [7] X Research source You can find glycerin at grocery stores, pharmacies, and online. You may also see it labeled as glycerol or glycerine. When you add xanthan gum in powdered or dissolved forms to a liquid, be sure to stir constantly until the liquid thickens. When you add xanthan gum in powdered form to dry ingredients, such as flour, whisk it in thoroughly to disperse it evenly."

Dampen a paper towel with about 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of canola or vegetable oil, then wipe it across the bottom of your cake pan. Alternatively, grease the bottom of the pan with cooking spray.

When they’re combined, add the rest of the dry ingredients. Stir just until the batter is moistened, then pour it into the cake pan. Over-mixing the batter can lead to a tough, dense cake, so stop stirring when you can no longer see any streaks of the dry ingredients."

[9] X Research source If you used a muffin tin, place a towel over the pan, flip it upside down, and catch the cupcakes with the towel. Then place them on a wire rack to cool completely.

      "content": "Brew 1 US gal (3.8 L) of tea for 5 to 6 minutes. Pour the water into a large pot, then bring it just to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn off the heat, add tea leaves or tea bags, and steep them for 5 to 6 minutes. As a rule of thumb, use 1 tea bag or about 1 tbsp (2 g) of loose tea per 1 c (240 mL) of water. For 1 US gal (3.8 L) of tea, use 16 tea bags or about 1 c (32 g) of loose tea. Go with your favorite tea, or a variety with a scent you love. Green, lavender or citrus teas make great fragrances for shampoos. Note that strong black, raspberry, rosemary, or sage teas may darken your hair, and chamomile, turmeric, and calendula teas can lighten or add highlights. The effects usually aren’t dramatic after just one use. If you do want to use a tea shampoo to dye your hair , apply it every 1 to 2 days until you’ve achieved your desired shade."

Then stir in the baking soda until it’s completely dissolved. The baking soda will fizz a bit, so be sure to use a large pot. It won’t be a volcano, but it could bubble over if the water fills the pot right to the brim."

Add the xanthan gum first, stir vigorously to distribute it, then mix in the castile soap. Stir constantly as you add the xanthan gum and castile soap until the mixture starts to thicken and froth. Stirring constantly can help reduce the risk of clumping. If you’re worried about clumping, try whisking the xanthan gum with 2 to 3 teaspoons (9.9 to 14.8 mL) of glycerin before adding it to the tea mixture."

[14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you love citrus flavors and fragrances, go with lemon or wild orange teas and oils. Try combining 4 or 5 drops of tea tree oil with 5 or 6 drops of lemon, orange, or lavender essential oils. Tea tree oil may help treat dandruff and promote scalp health. [15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Before using an essential oil, do a patch test. Mix 1 drop of essential oil in 1 ⁄ 4 c (59 mL) of coconut or olive oil. Apply 2 to 3 drops of the mixture to a bandage, wear it on the inside of your forearm, and check it after 48 hours. Don't use the essential oil if you notice any signs of irritation. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour your shampoo into a bottle. Purchase a container with a spout, or rinse out and reuse an old store-bought shampoo bottle. Use a 1 US gal (3.8 L) bottle, or divide your shampoo into multiple smaller bottles. Remove the bottle's cover, place a funnel into the opening, and fill it with your shampoo. If possible, use 1 hand to hold the funnel and bottle in place, and the other to pour. If you need 2 hands to hold the pot of shampoo, have a helper hold the bottle steady. Store the shampoo in the fridge for 2 to 3 months. For convenience, store the main batch in the fridge, and keep a 2 to 3 day supply in the shower. For a smaller batch, just use half (or a third or a quarter) of each ingredient; just make sure your proportions are the same."
