You’ll need about a cup of very strong coffee to make your tanning lotion, so only put enough water in to brew that amount. If you brew an entire pot of coffee, then it will not be strong enough because a standard coffee maker will not hold enough coffee grounds to brew a pot that strong. If you usually use another type of coffee maker, such as a French Press, you can still use it to brew your tanning coffee as long as you can add enough coffee grounds to brew extra strong coffee."
