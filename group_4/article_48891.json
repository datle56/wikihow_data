      "content": "Decide what category you will enter. The five possible categories are tough, cute, cool, beauty, and smart. Certain Pokémon and moves are more suited to a category than others; the only other differing factors between the categories are the prizes won and the opponents you go up against."

      "content": "Pick a Pokémon. It would be more advantageous if their favorite food corresponds with the type of contest you entered. If picking the right Pokémon isn't already vexing enough, then you'll be ever so happy to hear that the Pokémon's nature will also factor into their favorite flavor of Poffins. Best suited berry flavors and natures: Cute: sweet berries/Poffins; sweet berries will be their favorite food if their nature is timid, hasty, jolly, or naive Cool: spicy berries/Poffins and a lonely, brave, adamant, or naughty nature Beauty: dry berries/Poffins and a modest, mild, quiet, or rash nature Smart: bitter berries/Poffins and a calm, gentle, sassy, or careful nature Tough: sour berries/Poffins and a bold, relaxed, impish, or lax nature Neutral natures: hardy, docile, serious, bashful, and quirky. Therefore, Pokémon with any of these five natures will eat anything."

To find him, go to the top of the Poké Mart, then up until you see a house, then directly right. You can teach your Pokémon a move for one heart scale."

      "content": "Collect berries and plant them. Rarer berries make better Poffins and can also be traded in for accessories. There's a woman whose house is left of the moves tutor's house in Pastoria, the berry master who can be found through the left exit of Hearthome, and a girl inside of the Floroma flower shop who all give out free berries each day."

      "title": "Make Poffins.",
      "content": "Make Poffins. Feeding your Pokémon Poffins will increase their condition, and in turn, their score in the Visual portion of the contest. Check the tag on the berry before making it into a Poffin, though. Poffin flavors correspond with your Pokémon's favorite food and will increase their condition in usually only one respect. For instance, if you give a Pecha berry (which is sweet, so it increases cuteness) to a Marill whose favorite food is sweet and has a jolly nature, and you plan to enter them in a Cute contest, then it would be the best match. The Poffin house is in Hearthome. In Pokémon Platinum, you can buy Poffins, berries, and other contest items in the Veilstone Department Store's basement."
