      "content": "Tie your shoelaces in a standard bow knot. Make a loop with 1 end of the laces by doubling it back over itself. Wrap the other end of the laces around the base of the loop you made, then push it through the hole you just made by wrapping it and pull it into another loop. Pull both the loops in opposite directions to tighten the bow knot. [1] X Research source For the best results when tying a double knot, make sure the loops and laces are even on both sides of your bow knot. Use this method if you’re having problems with your laces coming undone all the time or if they’re too long and you want to keep the excess length out of the way."

      "content": "Pass the left loop over top of the right loop and wrap it around the back. Pinch the right loop between the thumb and forefinger of your right hand. Grab the left loop with the thumb and forefinger of your left hand, then wrap it on top of and around the back of the right loop. [2] X Research source This is basically the same thing you did when you created the second loop for your standard bow knot, except this time you’re doing it with the loop you already made."

Push the tip of the loop through the hole until you can grab it from the other side. [3] X Research source When you pull the left loop through the hole, you will be pulling it towards the right."

      "content": "Pull the loops in opposite directions to tighten the double knot. Grab the left loop, which is now going to the right, with your right hand and the right loop, which is now going to the left, with your left hand. Pull them firmly until the knot is tight. [4] X Research source To untie this standard double knot, just work your fingertips in between the knotted loops to loosen them up and pull them apart. After that, you can untie the standard bow knot as normal by pulling on the straight loose ends of the laces."

      "content": "Make an overhand knot like you would to start a standard bow knot. Wrap the right lace over and under the left lace or vice versa. This is exactly the same as the first step of tying your laces into a normal bow knot. Use this method if you want a double knot that you can untie quickly by pulling on the laces instead of picking at them to loosen them."

Wrap the right lace over the left lace again or the left lace over the right lace again, depending on which way you wrapped them to start with. This is exactly the same as making the first overhand knot. Your laces will now look like a simple overhand knot with 3 loops in it, instead of the normal 2 loops."

The thing that makes it quick-release is the additional overhand knot at the beginning."
