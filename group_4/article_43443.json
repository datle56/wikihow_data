To get a peek at the inside of the salmon, use just the tip of a sharp knife to push into it about halfway down. You can use a fork, but they usually do more damage to the salmon, which may mar your presentation ."

While the fish should be an opaque white, beige, or brown on the outside depending on the cooking method, it should still be a slightly translucent pink in the center.

If the center is completely translucent, it likely needs to cook further. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Check to see how easily the fish gives way. You don’t want the salmon to flake. If it flakes, it’s likely overcooked and dried out. Instead, the salmon should resist flaking but give way and pull apart into pieces when you press the knife into it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Take the salmon off the heat and let it finish cooking for several minutes.",
      "content": "Take the salmon off the heat and let it finish cooking for several minutes. If the salmon is opaque on the outside and slightly translucent on the inside and gives slightly when you poke it, it’s likely done. It will still continue to cook for several minutes off the heat, so remove it from the stove, oven, or grill, and allow it to sit for about 5 minutes before serving. Because the salmon continues to cook off the heat, it's okay if you remove when it's slightly under cooked. If you wait until the center is a slightly translucent pink and the fish gives way easily with the fork, it should be perfectly done after it sits."

If the temperature is below 110°F (43°C), the salmon is essentially raw. At 110°F to 125°F (43°C to 52°C ), the fish is medium-rare. Between 125°F and 140°F, it’s medium to well-done. You don’t want it to reach above 140°F (60°C), though, because it will be dried out and tough. [7] X Research source"

Adding salt and pepper is obviously key to flavorful fish, but if you add the salt too early before cooking, you’ll wind up drawing out all the moisture, which can lead to overcooking. Instead, add the salt and pepper to the salmon right before you cook it. [9] X Research source"

Avoid placing the fish flesh side down or it will cook much too quickly. [10] X Research source To ensure even cooking, place a weighted object, like a dish or bowl, on top of the salmon as it cooks.
