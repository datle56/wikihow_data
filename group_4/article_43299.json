He used to call you every night and text you each morning, but now it’s silent. This could be his way of quietly telling you he’s no longer interested. Send him a text asking him what’s up. You deserve the truth! “Hey! Haven’t heard from you in a few days. Is everything okay?” or “You didn’t call over the weekend like you usually do. I hope everything’s okay.” Call him to see what’s up if you’re tired of playing games. Be upfront with him immediately so you can both talk about how you’re both feeling about the relationship. “I thought I’d call since I haven’t heard from you. Have I done something to upset you?” or “Why haven’t you called me?”"

Maybe you were planning future vacations and getaways together at the start of the relationship. Now, it seems like he shuts you out whenever you bring up the future.
