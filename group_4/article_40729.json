These usually show a number of different films at one time in individual theaters housed within the building. Second-run theaters: These specialize in films that have already been shown in first-run theaters. Independent theaters: These may show independent films, specialized features, classics, major-release films, or some combination of these. These are more likely to have only one or a few screens. These may also be theaters that open up in a bar or restaurant. Drive-in movie theaters: These are open, outdoor areas which show films on large screens to viewers who park and watch from their vehicles. They need special projection and sound equipment, and ramps for cars to park on. Drive-ins can often only be used in warm months of the year. They can be repurposed during other times, for as flea market spaces, etc. [10] X Research source You can also set up a very simple theater that might be a homemade screen set up in someone’s yard, or a consumer-grade projection system set up indoors. This could be sufficient for your needs if you are just interested in showing films to fairly small groups of people, such as for non-profit community events."

If you live in a small city or town, there may be one theater or none at all. Talk with the other theater owners to see how well their businesses thrive. Just because you’ll be a competitor doesn’t mean that you can’t have a friendly professional relationship. Conduct a survey of the local community to determine what kinds of films people watch. You’ll want to make sure you’re playing movies that people will actually watch. If you live in a really conservative area, for example, you probably won’t have a lot of success showing really racy, edgy films."
