      "content": "Try the skull-thumping trick. If you're coming home from a concert or a club, and your ears won't stop ringing, it's because you've damaged some of the little hairs in your cochlea, which causes inflammation and stimulation of nerves. Your brain interprets this inflammation as constant ringing or buzzing, and this trick can help make that annoying sound go away. While some people think skull-thumping has a positive effect, more research needs to be done to determine whether it is effective. Cover your ears with your palms. Your fingers should be pointed back and resting on the back of your skull. Point your middle fingers toward each other at the very back of your skull. Rest your index fingers on top of your middle fingers. Using a snapping motion, flip your index fingers down off your middle fingers and onto the back of the skull. This motion will sound like the beating of drums. Because the fingers will also hit your skull, the noise may be quite loud. This is normal. Continue snapping your fingers onto the back of your skull 40 to 50 times. After 40 or 50 times, see if the ringing has subsided. [3] X Research source Keep in mind that there’s no scientific proof that this trick will make the ringing in your ears go away, but it's harmless and experts say it’s worth giving a try."
