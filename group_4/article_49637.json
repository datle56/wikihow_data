    {
      "title": "Write your and the agent’s addresses at the top of the page.",
      "content": "Write your and the agent’s addresses at the top of the page. At the very top of the page, write out your first and last name, followed by your address on the next two lines, followed by your phone number on the next line, and finally your email address below that. [1] X Research source Leave one space, and then write out the agent’s name, the name of the publishing company or agency, the address, and contact information below your address."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the whole thing short.",
      "content": "Keep the whole thing short. Agents are busy people, and if your query letter is too long and too wordy, there's a good chance it’ll just get thrown out. Moreover, the agent may just skim your letter, and you want that person to still get the gist of the story. Keep the query letter to one page, and use short, succinct sentences and short paragraphs. The entire body of the query letter shouldn’t be longer than five paragraphs. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Type your letter in a regular font with basic formatting.",
      "content": "Type your letter in a regular font with basic formatting. Query letters are professional business letters, and business letter best practices dictate using basic formatting only. This includes using: [3] X Research source 12-point font Single spacing Left-margin alignment for the entire letter Times New Roman or Arial font A single line of spacing between new elements and paragraphs"
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow the formula.",
      "content": "Follow the formula. Query letters have a basic formula that you should follow closely. This will ensure that you include all the relevant information, and increase the chances that your letter will be read. Along with contact information, a query letter will include: [4] X Research source Line one: the greeting Paragraph one: the personalization, or introduction, and the hook Paragraph two: the synopsis of your story Paragraph three: a short bio about you Paragraph four: your closing A farewell (on a separate line) Your signature"
    },
    {
      "title": "Greet the agent by name.",
      "content": "Greet the agent by name. A personalized query letter is the only way to grab the attention of a publisher or agent right away, and it demonstrates that you're diligent, careful, and that you’ve chosen that agent for a reason. Moreover, make sure that the agent you're sending your letter to actually deals with your genre of work. For example, if you’ve written a children’s book, seek out agents who represent children’s authors. The best formats for addressing your letter are Attn. Ms./Mr. Smith: or Dear Sam Smith: Do not address a query letter to To Whom It May Concern, as this will more than likely never get read. If you cannot find the name of the agent or publisher online, call and ask to whom you should address your query."
    },
    {
      "title": "Personalize the letter.",
      "content": "Personalize the letter. The first paragraph is an introduction between you and the agent, and this is where you explain to the agent why you have chosen that person specifically for representation. This could be because you’ve met, or have something in common, or any other reason that can link you to the agent. [5] X Research source Start by explaining any sort of relationship you have with the agent. This could include a mutual friend, a time when you two met, a conference you attended together, a lecture you heard that the agent gave, or any other connection you may have. If you don’t know any mutual people and have never met the agent, mention the name of a similar author the agent has represented. Once you've made your introductions, talk about your book. Be sure to mention the title, the word count, and what genre it falls into. Lastly, if your manuscript has been professionally edited, say so. This demonstrates that you're serious about your work."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create your hook.",
      "content": "Create your hook. This comes in the second paragraph, and the job of the hook is to get the agent interested in your work. The hook is a concise but engaging sentence that sums up who the protagonist is, what he or she is trying to achieve, and what struggles are encountered along the way. [6] X Research source Don’t give away the ending. Instead, leave the end of the story a mystery or cliff hanger, so that the agent will want to keep reading on to the summary. For example, if the book you were pitching was Romeo and Juliet, you would mention that the two protagonists are star-crossed young lovers who must defy the wishes of their respective families and risk everything in order to be together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide a summary of your book.",
      "content": "Provide a summary of your book. After the hook, use the next paragraph to provide a slightly more in-depth summary of the story. The important thing here is to write a compelling synopsis that will leave the agent wanting more. [7] X Research source Include information about the important characters involved. Explain when, where, and why the story takes place. Demonstrate who the characters are, rather than just describing them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tell the agent about yourself.",
      "content": "Tell the agent about yourself. In the next paragraph, provide a brief biography about yourself. This should include writing credits, awards, writing experience, previously published material (include the name of the publications), and any personal experiences that make you the perfect author for your story. [8] X Research source Make sure your bio is no longer than two sentences. It should only include information that’s relevant to your story, that demonstrates your credibility as a writer, and that shows why you're an authority on that particular topic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank the agent for his or her time.",
      "content": "Thank the agent for his or her time. The final paragraph of your query will be the closing, where you thank the agent for reading your letter. Do this simply and quickly, by saying something like thank you kindly for your time . [9] X Research source In the closing, you should also mention what, if any, other material you’ve included along with the query. The information you should include will be laid out in the submission guidelines provided by the publisher or agency. With works of fiction, mention that the entire work is available to read (as long as you have completed the manuscript). At this time, you should also mention that you're prepared to send additional information at the agent’s request."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bid farewell and sign off.",
      "content": "Bid farewell and sign off. Use appropriate business farewells when signing off your query letter, such as sincerely, or yours truly. Leave a couple spaces for your written signature, and then type out your full name to end the letter. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Edit!",
      "content": "Edit! While including all the relevant information and following the query letter formula is important, editing your letter is just as vital. Errors in your query could cause an agent or publisher to immediately throw out your query. After all, if there are errors in your query, it doesn’t bode well for your book. Read your entire letter out loud, slowly, so that you can hear mistakes. Check and double check for things like: [11] X Research source Proper grammar Typos Spelling errors Correct spelling of the agent/publisher’s name and the name of the agency or publication"
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow submission guidelines provided by the agent.",
      "content": "Follow submission guidelines provided by the agent. Most publishing companies and agencies provide submission guidelines for writers looking for representation. [12] X Research source Make sure you follow these guidelines exactly. Guidelines can include things like: The method by which you should send your query (such as via email or regular mail) Where to send physical queries What other information to include with your letter The proper format for your letter"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope.",
      "content": "Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. For physical queries, you should always include a SASE, which is a return envelope with your address and prepaid postage that the agent will use to reply to your query. [13] X Research source This is a courtesy to make the lives of agents and publishers easier, so that they don’t have to waste time pulling up your contact information when responding."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow up.",
      "content": "Follow up. If you don’t hear back within a month of sending your letter, follow up with the agent or publisher. If your original query was sent by regular mail, send your follow up to the same address. Otherwise, send the follow up by email, using the same address as the original letter. [14] X Research source Do not follow up repeatedly, and do not call or drop by in person to follow up."
