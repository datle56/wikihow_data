      "content": "Figure out exactly what it is you want to manifest. Every person will have a different goal in mind when they practice manifestation. Think about what it is you want and make your desire as specific as possible. Once you’ve come up with a general idea of what you want, whittle it down even further by thinking about where in your life you want this thing to manifest. Here are some examples: [1] X Research source I want money in the form of a raise at my job. I want success in my new hobby. I want to feel love by having my crush text me. I want enlightenment by figuring out exactly what it is I want in life. Focus on desires that are realistically attainable within your personal situation. For example, if you’re just starting out in a new job, manifesting taking over the company probably won’t yield immediate results. Instead, focus on more achievable goals like earning a promotion, getting a raise, or finding a really good mentor. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Make your intention as specific and positive as possible. You know what you want, but now you have to think about why you want it. Make an effort to transform your intentions into something positive. If your reasons for manifesting are negative—such as getting back at an ex or showing up your coworkers—you’ll likely end up manifesting that negative energy into your own life. [3] X Research source \"I want to get a raise so that I can make my coworkers jealous\" could become \"I want to get a raise so that I can provide more for my family.\" \"I want my crush to be obsessed with me\" could be \"I want my crush to see me for who I am, so we can be a positive force in each other's lives.\" \"I want to get this job so I can brag to my sister\" could be \"I want to get this job so that I can learn more about myself and what I'm capable of.\""

      "content": "Decide who you’re going to be whispering to. What sets the whisper method apart from other manifestation techniques is the fact that you’re meant to whisper your desire to a specific person. So think about who is most closely related to your desire. For example, if you’re manifesting a promotion, your boss is probably a good choice. If you’re manifesting a text from your crush, they’re going to be the one you whisper to. [4] X Research source If your desire has something to do with self-transformation, picture yourself as the person you’ll be whispering to. It also doesn’t have to be a person at all. If you’re searching for spiritual enlightenment or something similar, picture yourself whispering into the ear of the universe. This could look like the night sky with stars, or you can come up with a physical body for the universe."

      "content": "Practice positive affirmations to help visualize your ideal self. Your ideal self is the person you want to become once your desires have been granted. Come up with some positive affirmations to repeat to yourself that will help you transform into this best version of yourself. If you’re able to imagine how you’ll feel once your desires are granted, you’ll have an easier time manifesting them. [5] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to manifest a raise, you probably want your boss to regard you as capable, responsible, and talented. So tell yourself throughout the day “I am capable. I am responsible. I am talented” to help form this positive perception of yourself. A big part of visualizing your ideal self is breaking the stereotypes you may hold about yourself. Remind yourself that who you are goes beyond the expectations society has for you and conjure up the image of who you want to be. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Visualize your specific person as clearly as possible. Along with their physical appearance, if you know what environment they can usually be found in, picture that in your mind as well. For example, if you’re visualizing your crush and have been to the place they work or a place they frequent often, make that the setting of your visualization. Here are a few things to think about to make your visualization as detailed as possible: [9] X Research source What color are their eyes? Their hair? What are they wearing? What kind of expression is on their face? Are they standing? Sitting? Laying down?"

      "title": "Imagine yourself approaching your person and whispering in their ear.",
      "content": "Imagine yourself approaching your person and whispering in their ear. Rather than a physical body, picture yourself more as a ghost or spirit, but retain that image and feeling of your ideal self. Imagine yourself going to your specific person’s side and leaning down to whisper your desire in their ear. Whisper your desire 3 times using the exact same words each time. When you say your desire, phrase it so that you’re inserting your name and talking about yourself in the third person. Some examples are: [10] X Research source “Call Jane and ask her on a date.” “Dan is exceptional at his job. Give him a pay raise.” “Text John and tell him you’re sorry and that you love him.”"

Picture yourself returning to your body once you’ve finished and let go of any worries or anxieties you may have about whether your desire will be manifested. Open your eyes, take a deep breath, and let yourself come back to reality before going about the rest of your day. [11] X Research source A central concept of manifestation is releasing your desires to the universe and having faith that the universe will provide. This doesn’t mean to completely forget about your desire. Keep your desire and intentions in mind as you go about your daily life, but pair it now with the positive thought that it will come true."

      "content": "Create a list of actions you can take to help your manifestation come true. Manifesting is about collaborating with the universe to bring good things into your life. Come up with a list of steps you can take to reach your goals yourself and work on incorporating them into your daily routine. If you’re being active in working towards your goal , the likelihood of being able to manifest your desire will be much greater. [12] X Research source For example, if you’re manifesting a career change, start networking with people in your desired field, updating your resume, and practicing for an interview. If you’re trying to manifest a text from your crush, make an effort to get to know them in person or interact with them more on social media."

This law states that energy provides manifestation, so if you go about your life full of very positive energy, good things will come to you. Some things you can do to make your life more positive include: [13] X Research source Surrounding yourself with positive people and minimizing interactions with negative people Using more positive language in your daily life Curating your social media feed to get rid of toxic people or messages Keeping a gratitude journal Conjuring up positive images and emotions before going into a difficult situation"
