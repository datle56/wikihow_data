      "content": "Feed your teacup chihuahua sparingly. It's easy to overfeed teacup chihuahuas because they are so small. Therefore, many chihuahuas are at risk for being overweight. Limit the amount of food you feed your chihuahua each day, including treats. Since most teacup chihuahuas are under 5 pounds, 1/2 a cup of dog food or less each day is enough. [2] X Research source If you notice your dog is gaining weight, try reducing it's food intake."

      "content": "Reduce stress. Small dogs like teacup chihuahuas are more prone to stress. Because they are so small, you may be want to carry them around with you, which can cause more stress. Learning ways to reduce your pet's stress is important for its health and well-being. [3] X Research source Give the dog a place to retreat to that is a low-stress environment, such as a room that is relatively quiet. You can also have a crate with bedding in it. Try not to make loud noises around your chihuahua. In addition, don't hand your chihuahua over to someone to hold if your dog doesn't already know the person. Being handed to an unknown person can stress the dog out."

      "content": "Be vigilant about bathroom breaks. Small dogs like chihuahuas mean small bladders. You need to let them go to the bathroom more often, or you'll end up with a puddle on the floor. One way to remind yourself is to set a timer at regular intervals during the day to remind yourself to let your dog out, once you figure out your dog's bathroom needs. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure your chihuahua gets enough exercise.",
      "content": "Make sure your chihuahua gets enough exercise. Adult chihuahuas should get about 30 minutes of exercise every day, usually in the form of a walk. Swimming is also good exercise, as long as you are supervising the chihuahua during the exercise. [5] X Research source On hot days, think about the heat of the pavement. If you wouldn't walk on it barefoot, your chihuahua shouldn't either. Also, try to go outside when it's cooler out on hot days. Use a harness instead of a collar, as it is less likely to cause injury and makes it more difficult for your chihuahua to slip out of it."

      "content": "Watch out for small dog syndrome. Small dogs, including teacup chihuahuas, have a reputation for being snappy and somewhat aggressive. However, this behavior isn't more innate to small dogs than it is to large dogs. Rather, it's just more tolerated in small dogs because it's seen as cute or less dangerous. [6] X Research source In other words, you need treat this behavior in your dog the same way you would in a large dog. If you saw a large dog growling and snapping at someone, would you let that behavior continue? No, you'd put a stop to it. You need to employ the same techniques with your small dog, even if it seems \"cute\" at the time."

If you'd like, you can wash it several times a week to keep your furniture cleaner and the shedding down. [9] X Research source While bathing your chihuahua, use a massaging motion, and speak gently to it to calm it down. Make sure to use a shampoo made for dogs. Look for one that says \"gentle.\" Because chihuahuas are prone to being cold anyway, make sure you don't leave the dog damp."

      "content": "Trim your chihuahua's nails regularly. Most teacup chihuahuas do not get enough exercise to keep their nails worn down, so you need to trim them when you notice them getting long. It's important to start when your dog is young so it gets used to it over time. Pick trimmers meant for dogs, as they are quieter and more effective. Tuck your chihuahua under one arm and use one hand to hold one paw out at a time. Always look for the quick of the nail when getting ready to trim your dog's nails. The quick is the vein that runs through the nail. It should end about halfway to the tip. You don't want to cut the quick because it hurts the dog. The first few times try just cutting a couple of nails each time. Make sure to reward your dog afterward with petting and treats."

In addition, because they are tiny, they are more difficult to see, and they are more likely to be stepped on or hit with a car. You have to take extra care to make sure your chihuahua isn't injured. [12] X Research source One thing that can help is to choose a brightly colored harness or collar for your dog so that the chihuahua stands out more. In addition, make sure to supervise your dog around heights, even couches. If you suspect your dog may have a broken bone, which you can recognize from swelling and pain in the area, take it to the vet. [13] X Research source"

In addition, it's important to watch for the signs of hypoglycemia in your dog. [14] X Research source Watch for extreme sleepiness, weakness, or dizziness. You may also notice seizures, restlessness, and increased hunger. [15] X Research source If you notice these symptoms, rub honey on the dog's gums, then go to a vet or veterinarian hospital.
