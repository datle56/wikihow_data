      "content": "Pull the leash close to your body. The most important aspect of learning how to walk your dog is maintaining control so that your pet doesn’t dictate the walk. You are the boss and this should be reflected in your walking relationship as well. [3] X Research source Wrap your traditional leash around your hand until there is very little give between you and your pet. Pull the leash close to your body but allow enough give to allow your dog to walk naturally. Your dog will feel the resistance of the leash and realize that getting ahead of you is unacceptable."

      "content": "Talk to your dog. Your dog understands the tone in your voice. Don’t get frustrated. Encourage your dog with a “good job” or “way to go” when it does something right.

      "title": "Buy the proper collar and leash for your pet.",
      "content": "Buy the proper collar and leash for your pet. There is a wide variety of collars and leashes available on the market, but not all of them are suitable for your animal. For example, a traditional buckle collar and hook leash are typically used when there is little issue with walking your dog. For those that have more difficulty with a non-cooperative pet there is a variety of more restrictive collars and leashes available. Slip collars help keep the easily distracted dog in line. Pack leader collars are used on dogs that like to pull. Harnesses are useful on dogs with elongated necks. Special-use collars include shock collars, vibrating collars, and GPS collars. Glow in the dark collars make sure you are visible to others. Use retractable leads if you live near a large park or in the countryside so you can enable your dog to explore."

      "content": "Know when it is too hot to walk your dog. The temperature will often determine the best time to take your dog walking. Earlier in the day or later in the evening are suitable times of day to walk your dog. Avoid high noon as the pavement may be too hot for your dog’s feet. The best way to test if it is too hot is to place your bare hand on the pavement. If after only five seconds you have to remove your hand then chances are it is too hot."
