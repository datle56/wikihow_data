      "content": "They’re concentrating. Sometimes, people stick out their tongues without thinking about it if they’re lost in a thought or task.

      "content": "Babies stick out their tongues when they’re mostly hungry or playful. When you see a baby sticking out their tongue, it’s no cause to panic—this is a natural occurrence. More often than not, a baby will show you their tongue for one of these reasons: [5] X Research source They’re imitating you. If a baby’s feeling playful or curious, they’ll stick out their tongue if they see you sticking out yours. They might be trying to mimic you through sound or motion. They’re hungry. When babies stick out their tongues or open and close their mouths repeatedly, they might be hungry. Check for other signs of hunger, such as putting their hands to their mouth or reaching for a bottle or breast. They’re teething. A baby showing you their tongue may be a sign that they’re growing teeth. They likely don’t mean to stick out their tongue; they’re just trying to feel what’s happening in their gums. Look for other signs of teething, like crankiness. They’re breathing. If a baby can’t breathe through their nose, they might stick out their tongue as they breathe through their mouth. This could be a sign of congestion, large tonsils, or a blocked nasal passage. Contact your doctor if your baby has trouble breathing. They have a tongue-tie. Constant tongue protrusion may be a sign that your baby has a tongue-tie (ankyloglossia), where the skin beneath the baby’s tongue is shorter than usual.
