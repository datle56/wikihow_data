      "content": "Verify that you have the right cuff size. A standard size blood pressure cuff purchased from a drugstore will fit around the arm of most adults. However, if you have an especially narrow or wide arm, or if you plan to take the blood pressure of a child, you may need a different size. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The cuff should be wide enough to cover 40-80% of the distance from your elbow to shoulder and long enough to cover 75-100% of the distance around your arm. Check the size of a cuff before buying it. Look at the \"index\" line. This is the range line on the cuff that tells you if it fits. Once it is on the patient's arm it will tell you whether or not the circumference of your arm fits within the \"range\" area of the cuff. [2] X Research source If you do not use the proper cuff size, you may end up with an inaccurate measurement."

A quiet room is also a calm room, so someone who rests in a quiet room while checking their blood pressure is more likely to feel relaxed, rather than stressed. Therefore, you are more likely to get an accurate reading.
