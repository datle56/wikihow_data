You can often find them online, too, just be aware that long shipping times could affect the flavor and vibrancy of the leaves. Avoid leaves that are browning or discolored, as they will probably have a bitter flavor that won’t taste good. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the curry leaves from the stems and rinse them in cool water. To remove the leaves from the stem, simply pluck them off with your thumb and forefinger. Run the leaves under a gentle stream of water and pat them dry with a paper towel. Most dishes call for about 8 to 10 curry leaves, though always follow the recipe to ensure your dish will be flavored properly. [3] X Research source Wrap unused leaves in a damp paper towel and keep them in the fridge. They won’t last for more than a week, so try to use them before they go bad."

      "content": "Heat 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of cooking oil over medium-high heat. Use whichever cooking oil or alternative you prefer: avocado oil, olive oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, ghee, and other options will all work to cook the curry leaves. Heat up your choice of oil for 30 to 60 seconds until it’s hot. [4] X Research source To test if the oil is hot, get some water on your fingertips and flick a few drops into the pan. If the water sizzles, the oil is hot. If the water doesn’t sizzle, it needs more time."

Cook them for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they’ve softened and start to crisp at the edges. Stir them with a wooden spoon from time to time to keep them from burning.

Pour them and the oil over top of a finished dish, or add them to the base of a dish and keep cooking from that point with the leaves incorporated. If you want the entire dish to be infused with the flavor of the curry leaves, just add your other ingredients right to the pan and keep cooking. [6] X Research source If you need to transfer your leaves to a bigger dish, use a hot pad or dishtowel to handle the hot pan so you don’t burn yourself."

If you’d rather use the curry leaves as an accompaniment to your dish rather than tasting the flavor throughout the entire thing, simply remove the pan from the heat and set it to the side once the leaves are sautéd. Make the rest of your dish as you normally would; once it’s done, add the leaves and oil to the dish and enjoy. [7] X Research source Soups, rice dishes, curries, slices of bread, yogurts, and other dishes are all great options to top with sautéd curry leaves."

Add 1 teaspoon (2 grams) of mustard seeds and heat them until they start to sizzle. Then, add 6 to 8 curry leaves to the dish. Cook the leaves and seeds for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the leaves have softened. Turn the heat to low and add 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of coconut milk to the pan; cover the pan with a lid and let the ingredients simmer for 4 to 5 minutes. Spoon the mixture over top of soups, rice dishes, or vegetables to infuse them with an aromatic flavor. [8] X Research source You can modify the measurements and cooking style depending on what you’re making and how much you need. Just keep in mind that coconut, mustard seeds, and curry leaves mix well together and can be used to amp up the flavor of any dish."

Potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, eggplant, onions, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes are great vegetable options to pair with curry leaves. [10] X Research source If you decide to use several different kinds of vegetables, plan out the timing so that you don’t accidentally undercook or overcook anything. For example, spinach needs a lot less time to cook than potatoes do."

Sprinkle the chutney over rice, soup, vegetables, bread, or salted yogurt. [13] X Research source Store this chutney in the fridge in an airtight container.
