      "content": "Turn off the sewing machine. Locate the power switch on the side of your sewing machine, and switch it to the off position. Do this before you try to thread your sewing machine. [1] X Research source You will be inserting the thread through moving parts of the sewing machine. If the machine remains on and you accidentally apply pressure while trying to thread the machine, you could seriously injure your fingers."

      "content": "Raise the needle using the hand wheel on the side of the machine. Since the power is switched off, you will need to adjust the moving parts manually. Turn the wheel on the right side of your sewing machine in clockwise to move the needle upwards. Stop turning when the needle is at its highest point. [2] X Research source If you keep turning the wheel, the needle will move back down again, so make sure to stop turning when it reaches its highest point."

      "content": "Lift the presser foot with the lever. Locate the lever next to the needle base on your machine. Push this lever upwards to raise the presser foot. [3] X Research source Having the presser foot in this position will make it easier to thread the machine because it will be out of the way."

      "title": "Wind the bobbin",
      "content": "Wind the bobbin before you thread the top part of your machine. If you don’t have a pre-wound bobbin already, wind a bobbin now. Place a spool of thread onto the spool pin and move the bobbin winder pin to the far left. Insert the end of the thread through the hole in the rim of the bobbin and place the bobbin onto the winder pin. Push the bobbin pin back to the right. Then, apply gentle pressure to the pedal to begin winding the bobbin. [4] X Research source Continue to apply pressure to the pedal until the bobbin is wound and thread is nearly even with the rim of the bobbin."

      "title": "Place a spool of thread onto the spool pin.",
      "content": "Place a spool of thread onto the spool pin. The spool pin should be located on the top of your sewing machine. Place a full spool of thread onto the pin until it locks in place. You should hear or feel it click. [5] X Research source If your sewing machine has a horizontal spool pin, then you will also need to place a cap on top of the pin to hold the spool in place. It does not matter what direction the thread is going when you place it onto the spool pin."

If you have the manual to your machine, look at the chart that indicates the function of each of the parts to locate this guide. [6] X Expert Source Andrea Beaulieu Professional Tailor & Fashion Designer Expert Interview. 8 May 2020. Grasp the end of the thread on the spool and pull it across the top of the sewing machine to the first thread guide. Bring the thread through the slot under the thread guide. Wrap the end over the top of the thread guide and then wrap it around to the right side of the guide. [7] X Research source As long as the thread is going through the guide and out on the right side, it should be fine."

Go into the guide from the right underside of it. Then, bring the end of the thread over the top of the guide. After you do this, grasp the thread on either side of the thread guide and move the thread to the end of the guide. [8] X Research source Make sure the thread is completely through the guide. If you're ever unsure of what to do, read through the instruction manual.

Next, pull the end of the thread and wrap it around the tension mechanism, which is directly at the bottom of the threading canal. The threading canal is a grooved area on the side of your sewing machine. Bring the thread through the canal and around the bottom of the canal to go through the tension mechanism. [10] X Research source Make sure that the thread is straight and taut in the threading canal. Be patient with yourself as you try to thread your machine. It may take a few tries.

Then, insert the end of the thread through the eye of the needle and pull the end through by about 6 inches (15 cm) past the eye of the needle. [14] X Research source If the end of the thread is frayed, cut about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the end. This should make it easier to thread the needle. You can also stiffen the end of the thread using water, saliva, or beeswax to make it easier to thread your needle."

The needle needs to be up and out of the way to load the bobbin case, so turn the wheel until it is at its highest position. This should only take about a half a turn.

Press the button or lift the tab to open the case. [16] X Research source The case should be empty, but if there is an empty bobbin inside you can remove it. If you do not have a front loading bobbin machine, there will be a case that you will have to remove and open."

Then, place the bobbin into the case so that you can move the thread in this direction. [17] X Research source For example, if the arrows indicate that the thread should go along the left side of the bobbin and then up, then place the bobbin into the case with the thread going in this direction. If the machine does not have a front-loading case, you will need to put the bobbin into the open case after you have taken it out of the machine and then close it back up."

      "title": "Pull the thread through the slot until 6 inches (15 cm) are through.",
      "content": "Pull the thread through the slot until 6 inches (15 cm) are through. This will be enough slack for the bobbin thread to catch and connect with the top thread. If there is not enough thread, you won’t be able to make stitches. [18] X Research source You don’t have to measure the thread. You can just estimate 6 inches (15 cm). It’s okay if there is a little more or less thread. For a case that you remove and load outside of the machine, inspect the case for a hole to bring the thread through before you close the case. Pull out 6 inches (15 cm) of thread."

      "content": "Turn the hand crank clockwise a few times to catch the thread. With the bobbin lid secured, turn the wheel on the side of the machine to catch the bobbin thread. This will connect the top and bottom threads and pull up some of the bobbin thread so that it is visible. Gently tug at the 2 threads when they come up. They will appear as a loop, which you can push to the back of the machine to move them out of the way. [20] X Research source If the thread does not come up, repeat the process. If your thread looks knotted or gets too loose on the bottom of your fabric, then adjust the upper tension. If it's knotting at the top, then adjust the bobbin.
