You may have been wanting to free yourself from this friendship for a while, but when you meet with your friend, you'll need to be clear on the reasons why you're ending the friendship . If you need to tell them what they've done that's contributed to your decision, think about how you can phrase this as kindly and gently as possible. You might not want them to know why you're ending things, and that's fine. It's okay to be vague, or to use phrases like, \"Things have changed for me...\" Don't feel like you have to justify your decision or defend it."

      "content": "Practice what you’re going to say. Thinking about what to say to end the friendship can be the hardest part. You probably don’t want to hurt the person, but you also no longer want them in your life, which can be a tough pill to swallow for your soon-to-be former friend. Ideally, you’d like to let them down gently, but firmly, politely, but assertively, and hopefully, creating no bad blood between you two. Here are some ways to address the situation: [1] X Research source “I appreciate all the good times we’ve shared, but I think it’s time for me to refocus my energies toward personal growth. It’s been fun!” “Although I know you meant no harm, I didn’t like that comment you made about [x] and it made me reconsider my own boundaries in friendships. I’d like to take a break from ours.” “None of us are perfect and we both have things we could improve on, so I’m going to take a break from this friendship and do my part.” “You haven’t done anything wrong, but I don’t think our values or lifestyles really align anymore.”"

      "content": "Schedule a time to meet in person. Send them a text or an email to ask them to meet you in a neutral location. If you live in the same town, this is the best way to have the conversation about not being friends. [2] X Research source If they ask you what you want to talk about, say something vague. For example, you might say, \"I just want to share some recent decisions with you.\" If they persist, remind them that you'd rather talk about it in person. If your friend lives out of town, send an email or text to schedule a time to talk on the phone. Obviously, in person is best, but if you live in different parts of the country this may not be an option. Be aware that written words can easily be misinterpreted. This is one reason why talking directly to the other person, even though it's hard, is best."

      "content": "Remember that your decision may surprise your friend. They may be upset or angry when they hear your news. Or, they may want to try to repair the friendship. You should decide ahead of time whether you'll be open to working on the friendship, or whether your decision is final. [3] X Research source If they get angry, you'll need to be prepared to take care of yourself. You don't need to make a scene - it's fine to simply walk away. Unless you've decided that you're open to repairing the friendship, keep it short. You don't have to help take care of them until they feel better. Simply state what you've decided, and tell them it's time for you both to move on. Don't get involved in debating whether or not you're right or wrong."

These friends may be forced to \"choose sides\" between you and your former friend. [4] X Research source Avoid the temptation to tell all your friends what your ex-friend did that caused you to end the friendship. Try not to feel like you have to defend your decision to your friends, because it will only further the bad situation. George reminds us, “It’s extremely hard to end friendships gracefully. There are too many emotions involved.” [5] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022. However, she still encourages that you take the high road, saying, “It’s fine to [end the friendship] without saying anything derogatory about the person.

Don't try to turn anyone against your ex-friend. If you lose friends because of your decision, they probably weren't good friends anyway. According to George, “If you see [your ex-friend] in social situations, simply smile, say hello, but do not engage. Friend groups always have people in them that do not like one another… it’s perfectly okay to be this person.” [8] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022."

It might feel strange to not have your friend in your life anymore, but you will survive. Make sure to spend time with other friends. Try doing new things, and going to new places with your other friends."

If you find yourself falling into negative thoughts, practice turning your thoughts to something more positive. After a fallout with a friend, you might be feeling all sorts of emotions. George explains that ending friendships is “hard at any age” but does mark “a natural progression in life.” [10] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022. George suggests the following: “Feel your pain, talk about it with a professional, and eventually time will heal it. Be good to yourself. Don’t ruminate too much or speculate and be certain that you do not speak ill of them in your social settings. Count your blessings and have gratitude for the love and friendships that you do have.” [11] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022."

      "content": "Use the \"fade out\" method. Gradually seeing the person less often might be happening naturally, or you might need to consciously apply these steps. This is a good way to let someone know you don't want to be friends without verbally explaining it to them. [12] X Research source This method is appropriate for casual friends who you don't really know very well. If the person is a new friend, this method is less leaving a friendship than it's simply an acknowledgment that you never really became friends. It might take a longer time to leave a friendship this way. George is an advocate for this method, especially if the other person has done something to truly hurt you. She says, “If something terrible has happened that warrants you having to end the relationship, you can quietly slip out and stop contacting or connecting with them.” [13] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022."

[14] X Research source For example, if the person asks if you want to go see a movie sometime over the weekend, then you might say something like “That sounds cool, but I already have a ton going on this weekend, so I really can’t.” George adds that you can “be kind” and still “not stick around” if you no longer want this person in your life.

You may bump into the person while you are trying to build distance between the two of you, so you will need to know how to deal with those situations. Ignoring the person could lead to hurt feelings and awkwardness, so instead try to give polite excuses for why you can’t stay and talk. For example, you could politely say hello to the person and then say something like, “Sorry I can’t stay and chat. I am already running late. Maybe some other time!” Try to be as polite and considerate as possible. Even if you do not want to be friends with the person anymore, you never know when you might bump into each other again and keeping things civil will reduce the chance of an awkward run-in. [16] X Research source George provides another good example of how to do this: “If you are at a party, acknowledge their presence and then find a polite way to leave the conversation,” she begins. “Get busy with other people and try to enjoy yourself the best you can. Don’t give your power to that other person.” [17] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February, 2022."

      "content": "Take a more active approach to ending the friendship. If your attempts to politely and gradually end the friendship do not help, then you can also try telling the person that you don't want to be friends anymore. You may just have to be direct and say something like, “You are a great person, but we are just too different. I wish you all the best, but I think we should stop spending so much time together.” You can also try saying something like, “We’ve had lots of fun times, but I think we don’t have a ton in common anymore. I wish you well but I’m going to keep more to myself from now on.” Alternatively, you can say, “I think you’re a really cool person but I’m trying to focus more on myself, my family, and my career, so I don’t think we should hang out as much.” Try to avoid the strategy called “ghosting.” Ghosting is when you cut off all contact with the person. For example, you would need to ignore the person’s texts and emails, stop returning phone calls, and unfriend the person on social media. Ghosting can lead to hurt feelings, anger, and concerns about your well-being, so it is not ideal."

Or maybe they were just your party friend and you’re no longer into that scene. Or maybe you two have known each other since kindergarten and don’t have much in common anymore. Whatever your reasons and how valid they are, ending a friendship involves processing a lot of complicated emotions for you and the other person, including pain, shame, doubt, and rejection. No matter what, try to be kind, respectful, and don’t spread gossip about why your friendship ended. You’re way classier than that!"
