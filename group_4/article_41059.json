If you frequently have problems with buffering and a slow internet connection, upgrade your internet router or internet plan with your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If your Wi-Fi has been slow or isn’t working, there are a few things you can try to fix your internet connection and increase your internet speed . Restarting your streaming device and router is a good place to start. You can test your internet speed using an online speed test like https://www.speedtest.net/ . This will show you the speeds you’re getting on your device. If the speed is lower than you’d expect from your internet plan, you can try calling your ISP’s custom support line to correct the issue. Try using a dual-band router that offers a 5GHz network with extra bandwidth. This router type is often most suitable for online streaming and is known to reduce buffering. 5GHz can transfer information more quickly, but it has a smaller range than the 2.4GHz band. This means 5GHz will be especially useful if your router is close to your streaming device."
