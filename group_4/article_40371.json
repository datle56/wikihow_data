Lift the line up to open the bail, and lift it down to close the bail. If there’s any line left on the reel, unwrap it and throw it away. Baitcasters don’t have a bail, so you won’t need to do this step."

Bring the end of the line back towards you and tie the line together in a secure knot. [2] X Research source Any knot will work, but an arbor knot is a popular choice. To make an arbor knot, wrap the line around the spool, then secure it with an overhand knot . Tie a second overhand knot at the free end of the line, then pull the strings to tighten both knots against the spool. Use scissors or nail clippers to trim any excess off the free end of the line so it doesn’t tangle as you load the spool."

Then, hold the spool of new line with the label facing up and pull a little of the string off of the line to see which direction it comes off. If they’re both going the same direction, you’re ready to start spooling. [3] X Research source If the bail rotates the opposite direction that the line unwinds, flip the spool upside-down so the label is facing the floor—the line and spool should now rotate in the same direction. For Baitcaster rods, it can be helpful to stick a pencil through the spool and have someone else hold it. You can also purchase a reel spooler or make one by placing the spool on a screwdriver pushed through a cardboard box. [4] X Research source"

[7] X Research source If the reel rotates clockwise, the line should be wrapped around it counterclockwise. If the line is unwinding in the opposite direction of the reel, flip the spool of line upside-down and try again. If you’re winding the line the wrong way, you’ll probably notice the line bunching up and tangling as you reel.

For a stronger line that catches more fish, invest in leader line and tippet. Backing line is the heaviest and cheapest type. Get some marked with a weight of 20 to 30 lb (9.1 to 13.6 kg). It’ll be about 20 ft (6.1 m) long. [10] X Research source Look on your rod to find a number signifying the weight of fly line you’ll need. These lines are typically around 80 to 90 ft (24 to 27 m) long. [11] X Research source Get tapered leader line made of monofilament or fluorocarbon. You’ll need a roll about 9 ft (2.7 m) long, although you can lengthen it for deeper waters and shorten it for shallow water or windy conditions. [12] X Research source Purchase 2 to 4 ft (0.61 to 1.22 m) of tippet line that’s thinner than the leader line. It’s rated on an X scale, where 01X to 08X are strong enough for large fish like striped bass and lines from 1X to 8X are for smaller fish like trout. [13] X Research source"

However, not everyone finds this helpful, so if you want to skip it, that’s okay. [22] X Research source"
