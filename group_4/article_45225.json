      "content": "Check what type of display connection your laptop supports. Different laptops require different display cables to connect to monitors. Check your laptop for the following display ports: [1] X Research source HDMI: HDMI is the most common display connection. HDMI cables have a metal plug on both ends. The plug is about 14mm x 4.5mm with two notches on the bottom corners. Mini-HDMI: Mini-HDMI plugs and ports are the same shape as HDMI plugs and ports but slightly smaller at 10.4mm x 2.4mm. If your laptop has a Mini-HDMI port and your monitor does not, you will need a Mini-HDMI-to-HDMI cable or a Mini-HDMI-to-HDMI adapter with an HDMI cable. Micro-HDMI: Micro-HDMI plugs and ports are the same shape as HDMI and mini-HDMI ports and plugs, except they are smaller at 6.4mm x 2.8mm. If your laptop has a micro-HDMI port and your monitor does not, you will need a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI cable or a micro-HDMI-to-HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable. USB-C: Many newer laptops have USB-C outputs instead of an HDMI output. USB-C ports are oval-shaped and measure about 8.4mm x 2.6mm. If your laptop has a USB-C port and your monitor does not, you will need a USB-C-to-HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable to connect your monitor to your computer. [2] X Research source Thunderbolt: Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 connections are commonly found on MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops. The port has a lightning bolt icon next to it. Thunderbolt 1 & 2 ports are rectangle-shaped with two notches on the bottom corners. Thunderbolt 3 & 4 ports are shaped like a USB-C port and have a lightning bolt next to them. If your MacBook has a Thunderbolt 1 or 2 port and your monitor does not, you will need a thunderbolt-to-HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable to connect your MacBook to your monitor. If your MacBook has a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 output, you can connect it to a monitor using a USB-C-to-HDMI adapter. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source Mini-Display Port: Mini-display ports are found on older MacBook and MacBook Pro models. Mini-display ports have the same shape as thunderbolt ports but are not the same. Mini-display ports have an icon that resembles a rectangle with two lines on both sides next to it. If your MacBook has a mini-display port and your monitor does not, you will need a mini-display-port-to-HDMI adapter and HDMI cable to connect your MacBook to your monitor. DVI: DVI ports are used on older laptops and computers. They are about an inch wide with 24 holes for the 24 pins on the connector. DVI ports are video-only outputs. You will need to connect your computer speakers using a separate audio connection. If your laptop has a DVI port and your monitor does not, you will need a DVI-to-HDMI adapter to connect your computer to your monitor. [5] X Research source VGA: VGA connections are used on older computer models. A VGA port has 15 holes for the 15 pins on a VGA connector. VGA connections are video-only. You will need a separate audio connection to connect your computer speakers. These are typically used on older, low-resolution monitors. You will need a VGA-to-HDMI adapter to connect a VGA port to a modern computer monitor."

      "content": "Check what kind of audio connection your laptop supports. In addition to a display connection, you'll probably want to connect external speakers for a better audio listening experience. The following are some audio connections your laptop may support: HDMI: In addition to transmitting video signals, HDMI cables can also transmit audio signals. This will work best if you have a monitor that has built-in speakers. You can also connect an HDMI cable to a stereo or surround sound receiver and then to a monitor or television screen. 3mm Headphone Jack: Most laptops have a 3mm headphone jack that you can use to connect a set of desktop speakers. It's a small hole with an icon that resembles headphones next to it. USB: Many audio devices, such as wireless headphones, connect to your computer using a wireless USB dongle. If your laptop doesn't have a 3mm headphone jack, you can purchase a USB adapter to connect speakers to your computer."

      "content": "Check how many USB ports your laptop has. To use your laptop as a desktop computer, you will need to connect several devices to it. If your laptop doesn't have enough ports to connect a monitor, keyboard, and other devices at the same time, you can connect a USB hub to a [Tell-if-Your-USB-Cable-Supports-High-Speed|USB 3.0 or higher USB port]]. A USB 3.0 or higher port often has a USB logo next to it with the letters \"SS\" in the logo for Super Speed."

      "content": "Gather your hardware. Some of the things you will need to turn your laptop into a desktop computer include: A charger: To use your desktop as a laptop, it must stay powered on indefinitely. A monitor: Most laptops have small screens. Any size monitor will do. A keyboard: When you use your laptop as a desktop computer, you will operate it with the lid closed. You'll need an external keyboard to operate the computer. Plus, you can generally find a better quality external keyboard than your laptop's built-in keyboard. A mouse: While the lid is closed on your laptop, you cannot access the trackpad. A display cable (and adapter if needed): You will need a cable to connect an external monitor to your laptop. Make sure you get the appropriate cable that fits your laptop and monitor. If your monitor does not take the same type of video cable as your laptop, you can get an adapter. A USB hub or docking station: Since your laptop probably has a minimum number of USB ports, you will most likely need a USB hub to connect all your external devices. A surge protector: You will need a power source to plug in your laptop, monitor, and external speakers. A surge protector will allow you to plug everything in and protect your devices from power surges and lightning strikes."
