      "title": "Keep fresh mozzarella in its container of liquid if it has one.",
      "content": "Keep fresh mozzarella in its container of liquid if it has one. If you bought your fresh mozzarella from the store, it may have come in an airtight container with liquid at the bottom. Keep your mozzarella in this container to keep it moist. [1] X Research source The liquid is actually whey, a byproduct of when mozzarella is made. You can replace it with water if it gets low."

    {
      "title": "Transfer your mozzarella to a bowl of cold water if it was vacuum packed.",
      "content": "Transfer your mozzarella to a bowl of cold water if it was vacuum packed. Take your mozzarella out of the vacuum package and place it in a large bowl filled with cold water. Change out the water each day you keep your cheese in the fridge. This will mimic the whey that the mozzarella would be sitting in and stop the cheese from drying out. [2] X Research source Fresh mozzarella usually looks like a round ball of cheese rather than a block or a loaf."

    {
      "title": "Store mozzarella in the fridge for up to 5 days.",
      "content": "Store mozzarella in the fridge for up to 5 days. Place your fresh mozzarella on the middle shelf of your fridge. Try to eat your mozzarella as soon as you can for the best taste and freshness. [3] X Research source Never freeze fresh mozzarella. The texture and flavor won’t be the same. Keep your fridge between 34 and 40 °F (1 and 4 °C)."

    {
      "title": "Take your mozzarella out of the fridge 1 hour before you serve it.",
      "content": "Take your mozzarella out of the fridge 1 hour before you serve it. Mozzarella tastes the best when it is room temperature. Pull your cheese out of the fridge about 1 hour to warm it up before you use it for the best flavor. [5] X Research source You can use fresh mozzarella on salads, pizzas, and pasta."

      "title": "Wrap your loaf mozzarella in plastic wrap after you open it.",
      "content": "Wrap your loaf mozzarella in plastic wrap after you open it. Loaf mozzarella usually comes vacuum packed. After you open up your cheese, wrap it back up with plastic wrap to make sure it doesn’t come into contact with air and keep it from getting hard. [6] X Research source Loaf mozzarella usually looks like rectangular bricks of cheese. Cheese is alive and breathing, so never store it in tightly wrapped plastic wrap. Wrap wedges and rounds like a present in cheese, parchment, or wax paper and store in a plastic bag. Store your cheese in the \"warmest\" spot in the fridge. You can also use a big Tupperware or bin to keep all your cheeses. Always label and date."

      "title": "Seal shredded mozzarella in its packaging.",
      "content": "Seal shredded mozzarella in its packaging. Shredded mozzarella often comes in a resealable bag or tub. As soon as you open your mozzarella, seal the rest up in the packaging it came in. [7] X Research source If your shredded mozzarella didn't come in resealable packaging, put it in an airtight bag or container."

      "title": "Keep your mozzarella in the crisper drawer of your fridge.",
      "content": "Keep your mozzarella in the crisper drawer of your fridge. The crisper drawer of your fridge has a different level of humidity than the rest of your fridge. Use this drawer to keep your cheese from drying out as you store it. [8] X Research source The crisper drawers are usually at the bottom of your fridge. You may be using them to store vegetables or leafy greens."

      "content": "Store unopened packages of mozzarella in the freezer for 3 months. If you haven’t punctured the vacuum seal of your cheese, store it in the freezer before you eat it. Thaw it in the fridge for 1 day before you use it. [10] X Research source Don’t store opened mozzarella in the freezer. This could cause the cheese to get moist and might change the taste or texture."
