      "content": "\"Turning 19 in Poland\" is slang describing someone who looks really good. More specifically, it means that person is \"serving\" with their appearance. Someone \"serves\" when they're dressed or performing in a way other people think is fashionable or impressive. Some people also describe men who dress femininely or flamboyantly as \"serving.\" In that context, it can be perceived as a compliment or mocking, depending on the intentions of the person who said it. [1] X Research source So when someone posts on social media about someone and says, \"They're turning 19 in Poland,\" they're either complimenting them for \"serving\" a great outfit or mocking them for looking too feminine. \"She must have just turned 19 in Poland because she is serving in that prom dress!\" \"He's celebrating his 19th birthday in Poland with that makeup and that wig.\""
