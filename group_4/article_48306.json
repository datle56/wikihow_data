      "content": "AI files are native Adobe Illustrator files. When you save a file in Adobe Illustrator, it is saved as a \".ai\" file by default. Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editing program. Vector graphics are made up of points of data that determine shapes, colors, lines, curves, and more. [1] X Research source Vector vs. Raster: Most digital images are raster images. These images are made up of a series of colored pixels. When you zoom in or enlarge a raster image, you start to see the pixels. This makes the images look fuzzy and jagged. Because vector graphics are made up of points of data instead of pixels, they retain their clarity no matter how much you zoom in or enlarge the image. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Yes, but there are limitations.",
      "content": "Yes, but there are limitations. While other vector graphics programs can open and edit AI files, they may not look the way they're supposed to. This is because some features that are native to Adobe Illustrator may not be supported by other programs. Also, different programs handle files differently. For example, the way Adobe Illustrator processes transparencies and gradients may not be the same as how CorelDRAW processes these features. Some aspects of the image may need to be rasterized when opened in another program. [3] X Research source Saving files in SVG format will ensure the best compatibility with other vector graphics programs, like Adobe Illustrator."

      "content": "Adobe Illustrator is the best program for editing AI files. AI is the native file format for Adobe Illustrator. It is the software that is best equipped to edit AI files and save files in AI format. Adobe Illustrator supports all features needed to open and edit AI files accurately.

[4] X Research source It is one of the few third-party programs that can export files in AI format. However, AI files may not look the same in CorelDRAW as they do in Adobe illustrators. CorelDRAW also requires a subscription fee. You can start a free 15-day trial of CorelDRAW at https://www.coreldraw.com/en/product/coreldraw/ . You can open AI files the same way you would open any other vector file in CorelDRAW. To export the file in AI format, click File followed by Export . Select \" AI - Adobe Illustrator \" next to \"Save as Type.\" Then click Export ."

However, they may not look entirely accurate when imported into Gravit Designer. Also, Gravit Designer cannot save files in AI format. So you will need to save the files in a different format. The Pro version of Gravit Designer requires a subscription fee, but it's cheaper than Illustrator or CorelDRAW. You can subscribe to Gravit Designer at https://www.designer.io/en/pricing/ .

However, Inkscape does not have the ability to save or export files in AI format. So you will need to save the file in an alternate format, such as SVG, or EPS. You can download the latest version of Inkscape for free at https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.1.1/ . AI files may not be 100% accurate in Inkscape as certain features supported by one program may not be supported by the other."

      "title": "Yes, but only in raster format.",
      "content": "Yes, but only in raster format. You can open AI files in raster graphics editor programs like Photoshop or GIMP, but they will be converted to a raster image. You can then use the tools to edit the image in raster format and save the files as a raster image. Also, AI files that have multiple layers will only have one layer when imported into Photoshop or GIMP. Photoshop is best equipped to handle AI files. While it's not a vector graphics program, AI files imported or placed in Photoshop will look more accurate than AI files imported into non-Adobe programs, like GIMP. In Photoshop, you can place an AI file as a smart object in a new Photoshop layer. This allows the file to retain the clarity of a vector graphics image inside the layer."
