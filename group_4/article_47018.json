    {
      "title": "The card is not registered to you.",
      "content": "The card is not registered to you. Venmo accepts prepaid cards , but only if they are registered to your name. This means that Visa, Discover, MasterCard, or American Express gift cards likely would not work unless the gift card is registered under your name. [1] X Research source If the card says \"A Gift For You\", \"Gift Card Recipient\", or something other than your name on it, it isn't registered to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "There is no ZIP code associated with the card.",
      "content": "There is no ZIP code associated with the card. Venmo says it may require a ZIP code for certain payment methods, so if your card does not have a registered ZIP code, that could be the reason it is declined. Most gift cards won't have an associated ZIP code."
    },
    {
      "title": "The card is being declined for fraud prevention.",
      "content": "The card is being declined for fraud prevention. If this is the first time you've used Venmo on a card, the card issuer may flag the transaction as fraudulent. To fix this issue, you'll need to contact your card issuer for help."
    },
    {
      "title": "The card is being declined for funds availability.",
      "content": "The card is being declined for funds availability. If your card does not have enough money to complete the transaction, it will be declined. You must add more money to your prepaid card for the transaction to go through, but if you're still getting declined, you may want to contact your card issuer or Venmo for assistance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the card and add it again.",
      "content": "Remove the card and add it again. If your card is giving you issues, removing it and adding it again may resolve those issues. Simply tap on the card and select Remove , following the on-screen prompts to delete it from the app. Then you can add the card back and try the transaction again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try a different card.",
      "content": "Try a different card. While this is the easiest solution, it may not always work, especially if you only have one prepaid card. Most users report that prepaid cards notoriously don't work with Venmo, but some have reported that the Green Dot prepaid card has worked in the past."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a different P2P payment app.",
      "content": "Use a different P2P payment app. Other P2P (peer-to-peer) payment apps like PayPal [2] X Research source www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/template-management/prepaid-gift-cards and Cash App [3] X Research source cash.app/help/us/en-us/5588-supported-cards accept prepaid cards, which may work better for your situation."
