      "title": "Keep your wrists straight.",
      "content": "Keep your wrists straight. Position your hands so that they extend straight out from your arm. When you bend your wrists while you sleep, the nerves running through the wrists can't function as well as they should, causing numbness. Keeping your wrists straight will allow the nerves to work as they should. [1] X Research source Bending your wrists either way, backwards or forwards, is bad for your circulation."

      "content": "Avoid folding your wrists under your body. Keep your hands out from under the pressure of your body. Many people fold their hands in under themselves while they sleep if they sleep on their stomachs. Instead, work on keeping your wrists straight while you sleep, even if you are on your stomach. [2] X Research source This both cuts off the circulation at the wrists and it reduces overall circulation in the hands because of the pressure of the body."

      "content": "Put on wrist splints while you sleep. If you cannot keep your wrist straight while you sleep by simply repositioning it, you may need some mechanical assistance. Put on a wrist splint, also called a wrist brace, to force yourself to keep your wrist straight. While wearing a splint while you sleep may be irritating at first, most people tend to get used to it over time. Wrist splints are available at most pharmacies, big box stores, and from online retailers."

      "title": "Avoid sleeping with your arms over your head.",
      "content": "Avoid sleeping with your arms over your head. Keep your arms down at your sides so that the circulation in your arms is not impacted. When you lift your arms above your head, it can cut off the circulation down your arms because the nerves in the shoulder are cut off. [3] X Research source Whether you sleep on your stomach or your back, having your arms down by your side will help you avoid numbness in your hands."

      "title": "Don't sleep in the fetal position.",
      "content": "Don't sleep in the fetal position. Keeping your body curled up and your arms tucked in tight to your body can reduce your circulation because your arms are bent. In this position the pressure of your body weight also reduces your circulation and blood flow. [4] X Research source If you sleep on your stomach, keep your arms straight and off to your sides."

      "title": "Wrap your elbows in a towel to help keep your arms straight.",
      "content": "Wrap your elbows in a towel to help keep your arms straight. If you are having problems keeping your arms straight while you sleep, you can use a towel and an ace bandage to force yourself to do it. Wrap the towel around your elbow, from the forearm to the bicep, and then hold it in place with the bandage. The bulk of this wrap will not allow you to fold your arm while you sleep. [5] X Research source You don't want to wrap the ace bandage too tightly or it could reduce the circulation in your arm. Aim for a wrap that holds the towel in place but doesn't squeeze the arm. You will know the wrap is too tight if you hands become numb or tingle."
