      "content": "The recipient’s name goes on the first line of the envelope or package. You know the drill—write out the first and last name of the person you’re sending the parcel to. [1] X Research source Make sure to include the person’s legal name (especially if you’re sending something internationally). [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The building address goes first, followed by the apartment number.",
      "content": "The building address goes first, followed by the apartment number. Write out the address of the apartment building or complex before listing any specific apartment, building, or room numbers. [3] X Research source Feel free to use abbreviations like ST (street), RD (road), BLVD (boulevard), DR (drive), and CIR (circle) to make the address a little bit shorter. [4] X Research source Then, include the apartment number right after the building address—just make sure that there’s a clear space between the two. [5] X Research source Antonia Moore 45 Jackson Ave Apt 30 Want to save a little space on your envelope or package? Here are a few USPS-approved abbreviations you can use on your mail: APT (apartment), BLDG (building), DEPT (department), STE (suite), RM (room), and FL (floor). [6] X Research source Split up the building address and apartment number If there’s not enough space to include them both on the same line. Put the apartment, room, and building info on the line above the building address. [7] X Research source Mail machines process addresses from bottom to top (starting with the city/state/zip code), so it makes logistical sense to put the main address below the specific apartment info.

      "content": "The recipient’s city, state, and zip code all go on the third line. Start with the name of the recipient’s town or city, followed by a comma. Then, write the recipient’s state abbreviation. Include a space, followed by the recipient’s 5-digit zip code. Click here if you’d like to look up the recipient’s full, 9-digit zip code. [9] X Research source Kira Hastings 10 Almshouse Ave Apt 75 Chicago, IL 12345 If you’re sending mail internationally, include the city and province rather than the city and state. In some countries, you may not have to include a state or province at all."

      "content": "The destination country can go on a separate line. Write out the full name of the country beneath the completed address, like “USA” or “Canada.” [10] X Research source Skip this step if you aren’t sending your letter or package out of the country."

Along the top left corner of the envelope or package, write out your legal name and address, as well as your city, state, and postal code. Should an error or mix-up occur, including a return address makes it much easier for the postal service to return the parcel to you. [11] X Research source Return addresses are required for certain types of packages, like official mail or mail sent with precanceled stamps. [12] X Research source"
