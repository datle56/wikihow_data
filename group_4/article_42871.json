      "content": "Recognize the meow. Cats can make as many as 16 different meows. Paying attention to the different sounds can help you better communicate with your cat. A short meow is typically a greeting. Multiple meows signal excitement A mid-pitch meow is a request, likely for food. A deep “Mrow” is usually a complaint. A high pitch “Rroww!” is an indication of anger or pain. A long drawn out “mrrroww” is usually a demand."

      "title": "Understand what the meow is about.",
      "content": "Understand what the meow is about. In nature, cats only meow as kittens to get attention for their mothers. When they realize you do not respond to their other signals, they learn to meow. Often the meow is a way to communicate something the cat wants, but it can have other meanings as well. Most frequently your cat’s meow is trying to articulate a request. A meow often means that they want food, attention, or to be allowed into a room. A meow can also signal distress. Cats vocalize when they are in heat, lonely, stressed, angry, or in pain. They also become more vocal when they get older. Other times a meow is a simple greeting similar to a “hello.” [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to nonverbal cues.",
      "content": "Pay attention to nonverbal cues. Some of the most important ways that cats communicate are through body language. Cats, for example, have a complex language of signals that they make with their tails. When a cat looks you in the eyes and makes a long, slow blink, they are showing affection. This is sometimes compared to a kiss. A cat approaching you with their tail in the air is a greeting that suggests your cat is happy to see you. This has been compared to a handshake. [4] X Research source If the fur on your cats hair is standing up, this is a sign that they are angry or afraid. When your cat's tail is low, or between their legs, they are insecure or anxious. A tail thrashing back and forth is a sign that your cat is angry. The faster they move it back and forth, the angrier they are."
