      "content": "Qualify for an H-1B visa. This type of visa is much sought after as it can be issued for full time or part time employment for individuals who possess a “specialty occupation”. A specialty occupation is a role that requires the skills of a professional. You should have at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. In addition, the process can be complicated and you may need an attorney to navigate the process. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Citizenship and Immigration Services U.S. government agency in charge of the naturalization and immigration systems Go to source Accountants, computer analysts, web programmers, web designers, and engineers can all quality for an H-1B visa. U.S. Congress allots 65,000 H-1B visas a year for specialty professionals who receive job offers from U.S. companies or organizations. There are also 20,000 H-1B visas for individuals with advanced degrees, such as M.D., J.D., MBA, and Ph.D. If you are a Canadian with a medical degree, a law degree, or another graduate degree, you may be eligible for one of the 20,000 H-1B visas. This gives you a leg up, as you will not be put into the general pool of applicants, competing for one of 65,000 visas. If you are a Canadian fashion model, you can also work in the U.S. on an H-1B visa. As a fashion model, you do not need to have a bachelor’s degree, but you need to demonstrate “distinguished merit or ability”. You will need to be nationally or internationally known and have achieved a high level of recognition or achievement in the fashion modeling industry. If you are a Canadian owner of a U.S. company, you can sponsor yourself for a H-1B visa if you have a bachelor’s degree or higher in a specialized field. For example, a Canadian with a law degree who founded a U.S. specialty law firm can then sponsor herself for an H-1B and work as a lawyer at her own company."

The earliest start date for an employee with an H-1B visa is October 1st of that fiscal year, or six months from the start of the fiscal year.

The application period for a TN1 visa can also be fast tracked by applying for the visa at the US border. But TN1 visas also have several potential disadvantages, including: This visa is given to individuals with specialized skills and you may not qualify for the visa because your profession is not recognized by NAFTA as “specialized”. Under this visa, you must demonstrate your intention to return to Canada once the TN1 visa expires. For your first TN1 visa, you likely do not have to demonstrate your intention to return when you reapply. But if you have been on the TN1 visa for six to nine years, and are seeking another three year visa, you may be required to show you still intend to return to Canada at some point. You will need to provide documents showing you still maintain ties to Canada, such as bank account statements, a provincial driver’s license, real estate ownership, or having a spouse or other family living in Canada. With a TN1 visa, it is also more difficult to apply for an employment-based green card. There is no “dual intent” allowed with this visa and you must always demonstrate an “intent to return”. If you apply for a U.S. green card while you have a TN1 visa, this could be seen as a violation of your visa agreement and you may lose your visa."
