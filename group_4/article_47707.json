      "title": "Select a warping thread.",
      "content": "Select a warping thread. The warp consists of strands of yarn or thread strung lengthwise, under tension, across the loom. The ideal warping thread has a slight spring to it. Choose wool yarn, strong cotton thread, or a non-traditional warping material, like grape vine."

    {
      "title": "Begin the warp.",
      "content": "Begin the warp. When warping a standard frame loom, start in the bottom left corner of your loom. Double-knot the end of your thread or yarn to the bottom cross-bar of your loom frame. Pull the piece of thread or yarn under and over the top cross-bar. Bring it down to the bottom cross-bar and loop it under and over. While the thread or yarn should be pulled tight, you must be able to lift the warp with one finger. When warping a cardboard loom, begin in the top left corner. Secure the warp thread to the back of your cardboard loom with a piece of masking tape—the tail should reach the middle of the board. Insert the thread into the first slit in the top left corner. Pull the warp thread to the bottom left corner and insert it into the first slit. Wrap the thread around the back of the cardboard loom and insert it into the next available top slit. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Continue looping the thread or yarn. Loop the thread or yarn around the top cross-bar followed by the bottom cross-bar in a figure-eight pattern. As you move from left to right, evenly space the loops across the cross-bars. Continue to wrap the warp thread around the cardboard loom. Insert the warp thread into the next available top slit, pull it down to the bottom, slide it into the next available bottom slit. Repeat. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Complete the warp.",
      "content": "Complete the warp. Create approximately 20 loops. When the thread or yarn reaches the top right corner of the loom frame, loop it around the top cross-bar and double-knot it. Cut the thread or yarn from the spool or ball if you have not done so already. After you have inserted the warp thread into each slit, pull the warp thread to the back of the cardboard. Cut the warp thread so that the tail hits the middle of the cardboard loom. Secure the tail to the board with masking tape. To maintain the warp’s tension, secure each piece of warp thread to the back of the cardboard with masking tape. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Collect your materials.",
      "content": "Collect your materials. After warping your loom, gather your weaving materials. When weaving on a simple frame loom, you will need a small wooden dowel or a chopstick, a fork or another item with strong tines, such as an Afro pick, a shed stick, an assortment of springy wool, scissors, and a ruler When weaving on a cardboard loom, you will need an assortment of springy wool, a tapestry needle, masking tape, and scissors.

      "content": "Cut the weft yarn. The weft consists of the threads that go through the warp from side to side. Select a ball of wool. Measure out a 4’ piece of yarn and cut it. The weft yarn must be long enough to make several passes through the warp."

      "title": "Create a natural shed.",
      "content": "Create a natural shed. Insert the dowel into the warp threads—it should be parallel to the top cross-bar. Position the dowel just above the point where the warp threads cross in the middle of the loom. Pull the dowel to the bottom of the loom, creating tension in the warp threads. The gap created between the front and back warp threads is called a natural shed. When weaving on a cardboard loom, you do not need to insert a dowel or create a shed."

When weaving on a cardboard loom, insert the warp thread with a needle. Thread the needle with the precut warp thread. Begin at the top right corner. Leave a 3” tail at the start of the first row. Weave under the first warp thread, over the second, under the third, over the fourth. Continue weaving the thread under and over the warp until you reach the end of the line.

Grab each end of the shed stick and turn it 90° to create a new shed. When the shed stick is inserted into the warp, the gap between the top and bottom warp threads is called a shed. When weaving on a cardboard loom, you do not have to insert a shed stick."

      "content": "Weave the second row. Loosely pull the weft thread through the shed from left to right. Allow it to lay across the warp threads in an arc. Do not pull the weft thread too tight—it will cause the sides to cinch towards each other! Lay the shed stick flat and remove it from the loom. Use the fork or pick to move the second row of weft thread down towards the dowel. When weaving the next line on a cardboard loom, turn the needle and go under the first warp thread and over the second. Be careful not to pull too tight! Continue to the end of the line—end the line with an over. Push the second row snug against the first row with your fingertips.

Pass the weft thread from left to right through the shed. Remove the shed stick and use the fork to push the weft threads together. Repeat this process until your 4’ piece of weft thread runs out. When weaving on a cardboard loom, continue to create new lines. Turn the needle, go under the first warp, and over the last warp. Keep the lines snug. [6] X Research source"

Insert the new piece of weft thread and pull the end through the back, creating a second tail. Continue weaving as before. When you run out of thread while weaving on a cardboard loom, complete the current line and leave a 3” tail that will be woven back into the weave at the end. Thread the tapestry needle with a new piece of weft thread. Leave a 3” tail at the start of the next row. Pull the tapestry needle under the first warp, over the second, under the third. Continue to the end of the row. [7] X Research source You do not need to tie the two tails together. Use this method when changing colors or materials too!"

Tie the warp threads together in pairs close to the weaving. Retrieve your scissors and trim the fringe in an even line. [10] X Research source If you would like to create thicker fringe, use the tapestry needle to thread a length of wool between each section of warp thread.
