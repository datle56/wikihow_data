Wrap a towel around the thigh of the leg that's bent, holding one end of the towel in each hand. Straighten the leg as much as you can until you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh. Hold this position for as long as you can without causing pain, up to 60 seconds. Repeat this stretch with the other leg. [16] X Research source"

[17] X Research source To stretch your hip flexors: Take a big step forward so that one knee is bent in front of you and one leg is extended behind you. Make sure your front foot is forward of your front knee so that there is no pressure on your kneecaps. Keep your spine straight. Drop your pelvic weight forward. You will feel a stretch in the hips on the side of your back leg. Hold this position as long as it is comfortable, up to 60 seconds. Repeat, stretching the opposite side."
