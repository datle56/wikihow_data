      "content": "Choose a starting position (\"ready\"). In general, you will want to begin a sprint crouched behind the starting line with your fingers on the ground and your legs positioned one behind the other. There are three types of starting positions: bullet or bunch starts, medium starts, and elongated starts. The type of start you choose depends on how far apart you want your legs to be when you begin your sprint. The best way to determine which starting position works best for you is to try each one several times. Regardless of your leg position, your arms should be about shoulder-width apart. In a bunch start, the toes of your back foot are almost even with the heel of your front foot. Your legs will be very close together, making you look bunched up - hence the name, \"bunch start.\" In a medium start, the knee of your back leg is even with the heel of your front foot, putting more space between your legs. In an elongated start, your back leg is stretched back considerably further than the heel of your front foot."

It helps to have a timer close by or a friend to shout out an audible starting command; this is why they use a starting gun in competitive sprinting."

      "content": "Do dynamic stretches. Dynamic stretches are exercises that loosen your muscles while boosting your heart rate. [3] X Research source You may have heard that stretching prior to exercising can be harmful; this piece of advice applies to static stretching, which involves elongating the muscle for an extended period of time. By choosing to do dynamic stretches, you lower the risk of inadvertently hurting yourself or decreasing your performance. [4] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview. 12 February 2021. Some examples of dynamic stretches are: Hip circles. Standing with your hands on your hips and your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart, rotate your hips clockwise. After a few repetitions, rotate your hips counter-clockwise. Leg swings. Stand next to a wall or fence for balance. With your right hand on the wall, swing your right leg backward and then forward for a few repetitions. Turn around and repeat with your left leg. Half-squats. Stand up straight, then slowly bend at the knee until your thighs are parallel with the floor. You might want to stretch your arms out in front of you for balance. When your thighs are parallel to the floor (about \"halfway\" down), slowly press back up, keeping your back straight."

Since sprinting is often used as a last-minute boost of speed at the end of a long race, it can be helpful to practice sprinting after your muscles have warmed up considerably. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the right shoes before you hit the track. There are seemingly endless options when it comes to fitness footwear. For competitive sprinting, the most useful type of shoe is known as a “spike.” It looks like a regular running shoe with pins under the toe which help you gain traction and improve your speed. These shoes are lightweight so that you can sprint faster. [6] X Research source If you're not planning on sprinting competitively you can safely wear other shoes for sprinting, such as: Other types of running \"spikes.\" There are spikes for long distance, middle distance, field events, and even cross-country running. If you already own a pair of these, they will do fine for recreational sprinting. Lightweight training shoes or running shoes. Sometimes these are advertised as \"spikeless\" sprinting shoes. The important thing is that they are streamlined, with less bulk that will slow down your sprint time. Regular running shoes. These tend to be a bit bulky. They won't hurt you, but they might slow down your sprint time. If you're just starting out, these shoes will do in a pinch."
