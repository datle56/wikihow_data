      "content": "Choose a romper that fits loosely and that has the right length. Depending on how long your torso or legs are, you may need to look for petite or extended sizes so that the crotch isn’t too high or too low. If you can, try on a romper before purchasing it to make sure the arms, body, and legs aren’t too constricting. If you’re getting a romper with shorts, the shorts should fall on your mid- to upper-thigh area. If you’re getting pants, the hem should fall right near your ankle. Part of the joy of wearing a romper is that they’re comfortable and stylish, so you want to avoid styles or sizes that are skin-tight. If you get a romper with pants or shorts that are too long, you could always have it hemmed ."

      "content": "Pick a solid-colored jumper to have lots of accessorizing options. Black is classic, but reds, blues, and whites are all great options for a jumper. Having a basic piece will allow you to change up your accessories for different events, meaning that you can easily dress it up or dress it down. A single-tone romper also lets you transition it from summer to autumn more easily because there won’t be a seasonally-specific pattern on it. Don’t be afraid to get a really bright color, too! If something catches your eye, go for it."

      "content": "Wear a romper with pants in the fall and winter to enjoy the style all year. Look for a romper with wider legs for a more bohemian style, or get a romper with tapered legs for a more upscale style. Make sure you try on the romper ahead of time to make sure the pants are long enough for your legs. Rompers with pants also make it easier for you to transition the style to an office job."

      "content": "Wear heels to dress up your romper for a fun event or night on the town. You can take a romper from casual to glam by simply changing your shoes. Wear wedges or high heels along with your romper, whether it is a romper with shorts or a romper with pants. [1] X Research source Choose a color of heels that’ll complement your romper nicely. For example, if the romper is black, try pairing it with a bright yellow or red heel for a fun accent and eye-catching style."

If you’re going to be walking around a festival, zoo, museum, or park, pairing a romper with sneakers is a great way to be fashionable while enabling you to keep up without getting sore feet. A classic pair of white sneakers will pair with just about any style of romper. [2] X Research source If you’re going from the office or class to an outing, pack a pair of sneakers in your bag so you can change quickly without having to stop at home first."

      "content": "Fasten a belt around your waist for a fun accent piece. A lot of rompers have elastic waists, and while they can be cute, it can also be fun to add a belt to dress up the romper a little bit. You could choose a really thin belt or a wide one, just depending on what you have in your closet. Fasten the belt loosely to maintain a carefree style, or make it tighter to accentuate your waist."

      "content": "Don a blazer or cardigan to transition your romper to fall and winter. It’s easy to wear rompers all year long if you just add a jacket or sweater of some kind. Denim jackets are great for the fall, blazers make rompers acceptable in the office, and cardigans provide cozy warmth that is great for a weekend spent with friends. [3] X Research source Depending on your personal style, you could wear a baggy cardigan or something that is more fitted. Try to coordinate the colors of your pieces so that they complement each other. For example, if you have a forest green romper, a denim jacket or fawn colored cardigan would pair really well with it."

You could even try styling your hair so it is wavy and tousled to make that bohemian vibe even stronger. Regular flip-flips work, as do gladiator sandals, Birkenstocks, or strappy sandals."
