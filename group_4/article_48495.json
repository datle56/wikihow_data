      "content": "Most Targets typically restock on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Unfortunately, there’s no specific time or day that all Target stores restock. When a store restocks or places new items on shelves depends on the individual store’s location, size, inventory needs, and management. Even so, many have uncovered that most Targets get shipments on weekdays, with Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays being the most common restock days. You likely won’t see employees restocking shelves during store hours—it usually happens overnight between 10 PM and 10 AM.

You can purchase items that may not be currently available in-store and have them shipped to your home or store. Target.com fulfills and ships orders out of various warehouses and stores. Because of this, unlike in-person stores, inventory doesn’t have to be restocked regularly. Target’s website usually updates around 9 AM each day with new sales, advertisements, and seasonal items. [6] X Research source Online stores typically restock on a rotating basis as items sell out or are in high demand. Being a larger company, Target.com has the resources to maintain its online inventory (with the exception of discontinued items)."
