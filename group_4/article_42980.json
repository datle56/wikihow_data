      "content": "Find the right time and place to tell the person. If you want to tell someone who means well to leave you alone, then it’s important to find a nice, quiet place to do it. Whether the person is someone who has a crush on you or just an annoying classmate, if you feel comfortable around the person, then you should try to tell him or her in a quiet place where you can be alone without the threat of someone coming in and asking what’s happening. You should also find a time when the person you want to talk to isn’t distracted, busy, or stressed out, so the conversation goes as well as it can. Though it’s important to find a good place and time if you care about the person you’re talking to, you also shouldn’t wait around forever for the perfect time to come along. It’s important to get the message across so you can both move on with your lives. If you feel more comfortable having a friend there for support, then that’s fine too. Don’t put yourself in an uncomfortable situation if you’d rather not be alone with the person."

      "content": "Explain why you want to be left alone. Once you get the person alone, it’s important to be open and honest about the fact that you want to be left alone. If the person has a crush on you and you don’t return those feelings, then say so. If the person is your neighbor or classmate who always wants to hang out and you’re just not interested, then get the point across. [1] X Research source Say it loud and clear so there can be no mistake that you just don’t want to see the person. [2] X Expert Source Frank Blaney Certified Tai Chi & Qigong Instructor Expert Interview. 28 September 2021. For example, if the person is a girl who has a crush on you, you can say, “I’m sorry that I don’t return your feelings. I’m flattered, but I’d like to be on my own.” If the person is an annoying person who keeps trying to hang out with you, just say, “I’m sorry, but I’m just not interested in spending time with you. I thought you should know.” If the person has actually done things to annoy you or make your life difficult or if you’ve already given him or her a few chances, then you can say this to get the message across. If you’re nervous about what to say here, then practice in advance."

      "title": "Remain calm.",
      "content": "Remain calm. It’s natural to be a little bit, or very, upset when you have this kind of conversation. However, if you want to get the message across, then the best thing you can do is try to remain calm and keep your wits about you. If you feel yourself getting emotional, take a deep breath, and give yourself some time to return to your senses. If you keep your cool, then the person will see that he can’t mess with you and that he should take you seriously. You want to look like you have it together. If need to take deep breaths or even need to excuse yourself for a minute to get the message across, then don’t be afraid to do so. If the other person gets mad and says things to taunt you or make you upset, don’t let it get to you. Don’t stoop to that person’s level and fight back and take the high road instead."

Though you may think it’s better to make excuses to soften the blow, if you say things like, “Now is not a good time for me” or “I’m just not ready to date, but I really like you,” then you’ll just be giving the person false hope. Instead of doing this, telling the person that you’re honestly not interested will make it much more likely that the person will get the message and will leave you alone. And what’s more, you won’t be hurting the person’s feelings as much. [3] X Research source Of course it’ll be easier to make an excuse in the moment than to be direct. But if you do that, then you won’t be getting the message across and the person will come right back to you. If someone is just plain mean to you, you can say so. Say, “I don’t want to hang out with you anymore because you always end up making fun of me. I really don’t appreciate it and would like to be left alone.”"

      "content": "Be honest but not hurtful. If the person is genuinely nice, then you shouldn’t try to hurt his or her feelings more than you need to. It can be tricky to find a balance between getting your point across and being sensitive, but you should work to make it clear you don’t want to spend time with the person without name-calling or being insulting. You want to be better than that. Besides, you want to end the relationship, whatever it may be, not fuel the fire and lead the person to keep bothering you for even longer. [4] X Research source If a girl likes you and you don’t return her feelings, you can be honest about the fact that you don’t feel the same way without explaining that she’s just not your type and that you like girls who are taller, or saying that you think she’s annoying. If the person is a younger sibling, while you can’t get him or her to leave you alone forever, you can say something like, “I’d really like some privacy while I hang out with my friends. You’re getting in the way right now.”"

As long as the person is emotionally stable and just genuinely likes you a lot, he or she may want you to listen for a little while. If you want to be nice, then give the person this allowance, taking the time to really pay attention. Though you shouldn’t make this last more than a few minutes, if you care about the person even a little bit, then can take this time to listen. Don’t interrupt or offer your own opinions. Wait for the person to say what he or she has to say, respond as kindly as you can, and get ready to end the conversation."

You can even see if the person will repeat that he’ll leave you alone so he sees that you’re serious and that you weren’t just having the conversation for fun.

This conversation was likely pretty difficult for both of you, and you should try to wrap it up positively, given the context. Of course, it can’t be too positive if you’re asking to be left alone, but you can try to be as nice as possible.

If the person has really been bothering you and you don’t want to be alone with him or her, then you should get a few friends, an older sibling, or even a parent or teacher to go with you when you ask to be left alone. If you’re genuinely afraid for your own well-being, then you should make sure not to be left alone with the person when you have this difficult conversation so you can feel safe and confident. [5] X Research source If the person is a bully, then having your friends there with you can make a big impact on your confidence. Though you may try to settle it yourself first, if that hasn't worked, having your friends around can make a difference.

Though it won’t feel great to say these words, it’ll be far better than being wishy washy and making the person think you’d be up to seeing him or her again. If you’re struggling with being direct, have the friends with you help get the message across. [11] X Research source It should take more than a minute to say what you have to say. Just a few clear sentences on wanting to be left alone will do the trick.

It’s important that the person knows that this can't drag on any longer and that you mean business. [12] X Research source The more specific you are, the better. If you can name specific teachers or administrators you will tell, then that will scare the person off much more effectively. If you plan on telling your parents, you can say that you can pick up the phone and call your dad at work, right now.

They can make you feel safer and can even take further action to limit your contact with the person. [13] X Research source Your parents will know what to do and you’ll be safe in their hands. They’ll appreciate the fact that you went to them with your problem and will feel responsible for you. You shouldn’t look for the perfect time to tell them.

[14] X Research source Your true friends will be there for you through thick and thin and will understand that you’re in a tricky situation. They’ll make sure to spend more time with you and will see to it that you’re never alone if you’re feeling unsafe. If your friends are always with you, then the person will lose interest, whether he has a crush on you or wants to taunt you. Your friends can also help you see what the best course of action is.

If you really want to make it seem like you want to be left alone, then you should just drop the subject as much as you can.

Having an adult involved can sometimes change the person’s mind and will help him take your threats seriously. [15] X Research source Don’t be nervous about it, especially if you’re dealing with a bully. You should talk to these authority figures as soon as possible so measures can be taken. If the person is a bully, then he’ll threaten you and will say that you’ll be in trouble if you tell your teachers or administrators. However, these are empty threats.

This can mean hanging out in a new part of the park, going to a different movie theatre, or discovering a new restaurant with your friends. As the person loses interest, you can go back to your old life. [16] X Research source You don’t have to change absolutely everything you do.

If that person walks by and says something mean to you or smiles at you, act like he or she doesn’t exist. If that person somehow makes it into a group conversation you’re having, casually walk away. If you end up in the same coffee shop, get out of there without causing a scene. Though this may not feel great, it can help to get the message across. If the person sees that his words or presence don’t affect you or make you upset and that you couldn’t really care about what he or she says, then he’ll lose interest.

While you shouldn’t stay at home all day for fear of running into the person, you should make sure that you’ve taken measures to protect yourself from this person, even if this means contacting the authorities. It’s not worth it to risk your safety just for your pride. If you genuinely feel like you’re in danger, you should absolutely say something as soon as you can."
