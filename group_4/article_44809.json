Foods: A typical American diet increases the chances of a person developing penile yeast infection. Wheat, barley, oats, peanuts, red apples, and corn encourage yeast growth in the body because of their high glucose content, which is food for yeast. Nonoxynol-9: This is a sperm-killing drug contained in condom lubricants. This substance has been linked to causing yeast infections in people with penises."
