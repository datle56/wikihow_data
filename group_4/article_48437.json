      "content": "Stay cool and tell them that you appreciate the heads up. Give them the benefit of the doubt, and say something along the lines of “Thanks for letting me know.” It doesn’t feel good when someone flakes on you, but when you keep your tone positive and polite you’ll come off as strong and confident.

A habit of last-minute cancellations can mean the other person isn't invested in your relationship. [3] X Research source Before you decide to reschedule, check the balance of effort in your relationship: How often do they flake? If they repeatedly flake and don’t make an effort to reschedule, that’s not a great sign. How’s their texting game? Do they make an effort to start conversations with you or do they send short replies and take forever to respond? Who initiates plans? Did they ask to hang out and then cancel? Do they ever ask to hang out? Are they going through a tough time? Stress or anxiety from school, work, and family life can cause otherwise great people to seem flaky."

[7] X Research source “I’m down to reschedule, but can you confirm that you’ll be there? Weekend nights are so valuable, so it’s important to me that we don’t cancel again.” “Hey, I’m not a fan of last-minute cancellations. I really value my free time, and I’d like to spend it with you when I can. I don’t want to plan something unless it’s 100% going to happen.” “I try to prioritize our time together because I know we’re both busy. I’d appreciate at least 2 hours notice next time you cancel.”"

A voice call can go a long way to remind the other person that you’re a living, breathing, incredible human they once shared something with. Since flakiness can come from a lack of consideration for other peoples’ thoughts and feelings, a voice call can help remind a flaky person that they should show up for you—you’re worth it.

I don’t think you and I are a match, but I’m wishing you the best.” “To be totally honest, I’d rather sit this one out. I know you’re really busy, but I don’t like getting flaked on.” “You seem like a really nice guy, but I’m looking for someone who’ll stick to his commitments. I don’t think we’re right for each other, but I hope you find what you’re looking for!”"
