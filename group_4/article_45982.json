      "title": "Choose curry powders without turmeric as the main ingredient for the best flavor.",
      "content": "Choose curry powders without turmeric as the main ingredient for the best flavor. Check the ingredients list to see if turmeric is listed first. If turmeric is listed as the first ingredient, this means that it’s very turmeric-heavy. Turmeric tends to have a bland taste, and it’s usually used in such a large amount for its color. If you want curry powder that’s going to be super flavorful, look for brands that don't have turmeric listed as the first ingredient. If your curry powder does have turmeric listed first, you can still use it, just don't depend on it for your main source of flavor. McCormick makes a good regular curry powder that can be found in most grocery stores. Opt for a specialty curry powder like Spiceology's Thai Peanut Sweet and Spicy Curry Blend, or Mountain Rose Herbs' Curry Powder Blend that's organic."

      "content": "Use curry powder for slower cooking dishes if possible. Curry powder has the best flavor when it’s allowed to set for a while with other ingredients while cooking for at least 20 minutes. This includes dishes that simmer for a while on the stove or that are cooked using a crockpot. If you’re trying to whip up a meal quickly, maybe save the curry powder for later. [1] X Research source An exception to this would be if you’re using curry powder as a dry rub. Try using curry powder in dishes like butter chicken with curry powder used as part of a marinade, or pasta where the curry powder is infused into the boiling water. If you made a dish that contains curry powder and have leftovers, let them sit in the fridge and the food will be even more flavorful."

      "content": "Avoid relying on curry powder to be the main flavor. If you use curry powder as your main spice, or especially your only spice, you might be a little disappointed by the flavor of your dish. Curry powder works best when it’s mixed with other flavorful spices and foods so that it’s not the main flavor. Use curry powder with onions and garlic for a great flavor. Other spices often used with curry powder include ginger, coriander, cumin, and crushed red pepper flakes."
