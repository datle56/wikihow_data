Reflect on the negative feelings and problems porn has brought into your life and remember that you don’t have to watch porn every single day or have an addiction for it to be an issue. Pornography problems are more about how and why you use it than how often. [1] X Research source It can feel embarrassing to admit you’ve got an issue with pornography, but it’s the first step toward improving your habits and making positive change!"

Maybe you’re trying to improve how you’re seen by others, or your porn consumption is taking too much time away from achieving your personal or professional goals. [2] X Research source If you’re religious, you might see using porn as going against the teachings of your faith. When you feel stuck or like giving up, remember what inspired you to stop looking at porn in the first place."

Delete any saved images or videos on your computer, phone, and other devices, and cancel your subscriptions to any pornographic websites you use. Throw out any physical magazines, photos, or even DVDs you might have as well. [3] X Research source Shred magazines and scratch or break DVDs before you toss them so you’re not tempted to dig them out of the trash bin later. Consider moving desktop or shared computers to common areas in your home so you’re less tempted to look up explicit material."

      "content": "Install a porn filter on your devices to monitor your Internet use. Choose a filter that is hard to remove or bypass so it becomes extremely difficult to visit pornographic websites, or try using a browser extension to block off certain sites. Consider having a trusted friend install the filter with you so they can create a strong password that you won’t know. [4] X Research source Consider turning off your internet when you know you won’t need it for work or other tasks to further remove the temptation. Filters or blockers are especially helpful at the beginning of your journey when resisting pornography feels the hardest. Some easy-to-use blockers include: Free or premium versions of Qustodio , which is compatible with any operating system except Linux. Microsoft Family Safety on Windows computers. Free or premium versions of Norton Family Online for Windows, iOS, and Android. The Christian site Covenant Eyes , which costs $10 per month and prevents the subscriber from bypassing the site blockages."

      "content": "Combat your triggers with mindfulness, distractions, or avoidance. When you’re triggered, try meditating or using mindfulness techniques to focus on the present moment and not the urge to use porn. Try to reframe your thoughts—instead of feeling challenged, imagine yourself leaping over an obstacle with ease. [9] X Research source Use positive distractions when mindfulness doesn’t work. Try alternate activities or carry an interesting book or game with you when you’re on the go. Avoid triggers you're unable to cope with.

When you feel ready to interact sexually, focus on the 7 dimensions of healthy sexuality: [10] X Research source Self-nurturing: Practice self-care and focus on activities and environments that facilitate healthy interactions with other people. Sensuousness: Stimulate all of your senses and indulge in behaviors and environments that make you notice colors, sounds, feelings, tastes, and smells. General relationship intimacy: Simply enjoy hanging out with others without being sexual. Partner intimacy: Spend time with your significant other (if you have one) without any sexual activity. Non-genital physical touch: Make you and your partner feel good without sexual stimulation, like snuggling, hand holding, kissing, or back rubs. Genital sexuality: Enrich and sustain sexual contact and emotional intimacy during sex (for example, holding eye contact while making love). Spiritual intimacy: Start thinking of sex as an expression of your feelings and your connection to your partner."

Announce your intention to stop using porn to someone of the same gender that you trust and who doesn’t struggle with the same behavior. If you suspect that they might undermine your attempts to reach your goal in any way, consider asking a different person for help. [11] X Research source Avoid using your spouse or partner as an accountability buddy since they likely have a deeper emotional interest in your progress than a friend. Look for someone who listens to you when you struggle, gives you encouragement, holds you accountable, and problem-solves with you. Check in with your accountability partner regularly and honestly, open up when you backtrack, and celebrate your successes with them. Remember that you are ultimately responsible for breaking your porn habits, even if you have a wonderful support system to help you. [12] X Research source"

Everyday tasks or deadlines fall by the wayside because they don’t seem as important. [18] X Research source Porn users might feel depression or exhaustion as they struggle to keep up with their regular routine because of their porn habits.

      "content": "Sex becomes less satisfying Real-world sex might feel less fulfilling than scenarios in pornography. Your expectations of what sexual encounters are like become unrealistic, leading to riskier sexual practices (like suffocation, strangulation, or sex with multiple partners at once) in an attempt to chase the on-screen fantasies you’ve watched. [23] X Research source Some people engage in these behaviors safely and consensually without a porn problem, and these behaviors aren’t problematic by themselves.

      "title": "Distorted beliefs about sexuality and relationships",
      "content": "Distorted beliefs about sexuality and relationships Since porn is highly scripted, edited, and produced, it can lead to misguided views on how healthy and intimate sexual relationships work in the real world. [27] X Research source Excessive porn watchers may begin to objectify others, behave promiscuously, and behave or think erotically in inappropriate scenarios. [28] X Research source Men who watch too much porn are more likely to subconsciously develop misogynistic attitudes than men who abstain or watch in moderation. All of these skewed beliefs and behaviors lead to insecure attachments to other people, romantically and sexually. Remember that there’s nearly always a director or videographer on the other side of the camera (typically a man) controlling what happens on-screen."

When they do have the urge, they may have little patience and want to have sex immediately. [30] X Research source The lack of patience can also lead to fantasizing or obsessing about sex with random strangers they encounter throughout their day."

      "content": "Loneliness Studies have shown that porn use is significantly associated with feelings of loneliness. The relationship is cyclical—watching porn can make you feel lonely, which then makes you want to watch even more to get a false sense of intimacy. When porn is used to alleviate loneliness, your chances of becoming addicted increase. [31] X Research source Too much porn use might lead to feelings of isolation, a disruption of normal attachment behavior, and trouble forming stable, satisfying relationships."
