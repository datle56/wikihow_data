      "title": "Clean and dry the area surrounding the corn.",
      "content": "Clean and dry the area surrounding the corn. Thoroughly washing and drying the area helps to ensure firm adhesion. Without a solid connection there is a chance the corn cap strip will slip out of place and lose effectiveness, or potentially come in contact with healthy skin."

    {
      "title": "Remove the corn cap from the backing.",
      "content": "Remove the corn cap from the backing. Just like a Band-aid, the adhesive section is pressed against a rubber backing that ensures nothing sticks to it before being applied. Discard the backing once it has been fully separated from the adhesive portion."

      "title": "Place the circle directly over the corn.",
      "content": "Place the circle directly over the corn. Press it down firmly, adhesive side facing the skin. [3] X Research source The cap contains silicone gel that will protect the corn, eliminating the friction that caused the corn in the first place. [4] X Expert Source Miguel Cunha, DPM Board Certified Podiatrist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. If you're using a medicated cap, the gel needs to penetrate the skin directly on the corn, and if possible, the edges as well, as there may be portions of the corn that have grown laterally along the skin. Use separate adhesive strips on the edges to keep the corn cap in place. If using the corn cap on a toe, wrap the adhesive portion all the way around the toe."

      "title": "Reapply corn caps as necessary.",
      "content": "Reapply corn caps as necessary. In general, the corn caps should be reapplied every two days. It is possible, however, for some corn plasters to be reapplied daily until the corn is removed, or for a maximum of two weeks, whichever comes first. [5] X Research source Apply the corn cap precisely as the instructions direct. Unnecessarily high absorption through the skin may occur if overused or improperly used.

      "content": "Monitor for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions may include, but are not limited to skin redness, itchiness, or a rash. Soreness and discomfort, both mild and severe, are common. If the irritation persists or becomes severe, you may be experiencing some form of salicylic acid toxicity.

      "content": "Consult with a physician if corn caps are ineffective. You should consult with a general physician, podiatrist, or dermatologist if your corn is painful, recurrent and not responding to corn paint. They might order an X-ray of your feet to rule out underlying bony abnormality and refer to an orthopedics if needed.

[10] X Expert Source Miguel Cunha, DPM Board Certified Podiatrist Expert Interview. 22 April 2020. If you have a condition like hammer toes that cause your feet to rub against the inside of your shoe, you're more likely to have corns develop. If you need to, wear an orthotic or custom orthotic inside your shoe to evenly distribute your weight across your feet, which can help prevent hammertoe from forming in the first place.

      "title": "Keep out of reach of children.",
      "content": "Keep out of reach of children. While the product is fairly benign when used properly, the salicylic can be dangerous in the hands of a child. Application to facial skin could result in a chemical burn, and ingestion could cause nausea, vomiting, and even problems with the ear."

      "title": "Store at temperatures below 30˚C/86˚F.",
      "content": "Store at temperatures below 30˚C/86˚F. Storage above these temperatures will likely cause the product to lose some effectiveness. The adhesive on the ring will probably slip, and the salicylic acid will not be concentrated directly over the corn. Also ensure the product is stored away from direct sunlight or severe humidity."

    {
      "title": "Refrain from using the product after the expiration date.",
      "content": "Refrain from using the product after the expiration date. Similar to heat-based degradation, age-based degradation will limit product efficacy. Aside from the adhesive inadequacy, the foam ring often included for comfort may lose its soft, spongy texture that protects against rubbing and helps alleviate some of the pain associated with corns."
