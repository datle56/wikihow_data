When you subscribe to someone, their stories will continue to show up in your feed—even if the two of you aren’t friends. Many people subscribe to popular influencers, brands, and celebrities they like."

If the profile is public, there will be a yellow “Subscribe” button under their bitmoji. Tap that and you’re subscribed! You can find profiles to follow in the Discovery Spotlight tab, which will show you popular random posts from users you don’t know. If there is no subscription button, it means that their profile isn’t public. [1] X Research source"

They’re okay with you still subscribing and watching their stories, though. If you’re okay with that, go ahead and subscribe, although you may want to unfriend them if you don’t appreciate them unfriending you."

The content from a public account appears as a subscription, so all you can do is hit the “subscribe” button to get your friend’s stories to show up in your feed. While you can message and communicate directly with a friend, you can only view a subscription’s content. Ask your friend to add you the next time you see them IRL so you two can communicate over Snapchat."
