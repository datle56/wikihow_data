[2] X Research source Use a SIM card eject tool and push it into the corresponding-sized hole on the left side on top of the phone. This will eject the card tray with the phone's SIM and microSD card slots."

    {
      "title": "Apply heat to the back of the Samsung Galaxy.",
      "content": "Apply heat to the back of the Samsung Galaxy. You'll need to do this for about two minutes. The best way to do this is by using a hair drier or a heat gun, though you must avoid heating one specific spot for more than a second at a time. This loosens the adhesive glue that binds the back of the Samsung Galaxy's housing to the phone's internal frame. [3] X Research source To avoid damaging your phone, keep the heat gun aimed at the phone's back cover and quickly move it up and down in a zig-zag fashion. Alternatively, you can use a microwavable heating pad made specifically for this task. Or you can heat up a prying tool instead of your phone."

      "title": "Insert a spudger into the housing junction seam.",
      "content": "Insert a spudger into the housing junction seam. There should be a crack where the front and the back parts of the Galaxy's housing meet; this is where you'll insert a spudger, a flathead screwdriver, a credit card, or a similar flat object. [4] X Research source If you can't find the seam, apply a suction cup to the very edge of your back case, then pull on it gently until you see an opening. If you pull too hard, the glass on your back case could shatter. Your goal here is to leverage the back of the housing away from the front, but not to pry it off altogether yet."

      "title": "Run a thin, flat tool up the left or right side of the phone.",
      "content": "Run a thin, flat tool up the left or right side of the phone. For example, you might use a guitar pick or a credit card. As you do so, the back of the phone should come away from the front of the housing a bit. [5] X Research source Make sure the item you use here isn't metal, as a metal object may scratch or otherwise damage the phone."

      "content": "Run your prying tool up the opposite side of the phone. This will result in the bottom of the back of the phone's housing, as well as both the left and right sides, being disconnected from the front of the phone's housing. [6] X Research source You may apply more heat as needed."

      "title": "Pry the back of the phone up, then pull it away.",
      "content": "Pry the back of the phone up, then pull it away. The last of the adhesive should give way when you do this since only the adhesive at the top of the phone will be holding the back of the phone in place. You can apply more heat and/or slide your prying tool along the top of the phone to make this process easier. Set the back of your phone aside in a warm, dry place so that you don't damage the phone's internals when you put it back on. To reattach the back, all you need to do is press the front and back casings to each other. You may need to add glue if your adhesive isn't working to hold your phone together anymore."
