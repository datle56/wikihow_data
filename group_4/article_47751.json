The exact amount of time spent wrapping depends on the length of your hair. The whole process, including the drying, could take three or more hours. The drying process alone can take up to an hour on its own!"

      "content": "Apply setting lotion. Setting lotion is actually kind of foam. It helps your hair stay in position as it being wrapped. Use a generous amount of setting lotion and massage it through your hair from root to tip. Any type of setting lotion will work as long as the label states that it is meant for styling and moisturizing/conditioning. [2] X Research source If you didn’t use a leave-in conditioner after your shampoo, apply some leave-in conditioner before you apply the setting lotion."

      "content": "Comb through your hair. Once you have used the setting lotion, use a wide-toothed comb to work out any tangles or kinks. Using a comb will also distribute the styling lotion evenly throughout your hair. Part your hair in the center and comb through your hair again. Bend forward and comb if you are having trouble detangling. [3] X Research source Use the comb gently to avoid breakage."

Comb your hair in a circular motion away from the part. Smooth your hair down around your head and continue wrapping until you have flattened all the hair around your head. [4] X Research source You can use a small amount of styling lotion to help direct your hair during the wrapping process."

      "content": "Use a brush to secure loose ends. You may have trouble keeping the ends down while you’re using your hands to wrap your hair. Use a plastic styling tool when you have finished wrapping to help keep the ends down. Brush to finish smoothing your hair around your head until all ends are in place. [5] X Research source Plastic styling brushes can be found at most beauty supply shops. Do not use clips to pin sections of your hair in place. They’ll put indentations in your hair, which will cause it to dry unevenly. The setting lotion will keep your hair in place."

Turn the dryer to medium and sit under it until your hair is dry. You may want to check your hair a few times. If you do not have a hood dryer, use a hand-held dryer with a dryer cap. To use a hand-held dryer, put it on the highest heat setting and blow dry over the entirety of the cap. It may take a couple of hours to fully dry your hair.
