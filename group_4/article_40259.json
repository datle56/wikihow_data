      "title": "Expand long vowels into multiple vowel sounds.",
      "content": "Expand long vowels into multiple vowel sounds. When Australians are speaking, they have the tendency to really draw out vowels, often bending them into 2 or more vowel sounds as they do so. The key here is to really lean into a vowel rather than saying it in a short, clipped way. [2] X Research source For example, the word \"nice\" sounds more like \"noice.\" With a long \"a,\" such as in the word \"mate,\" you'll hear the long \"i\" as well, so it sounds a bit more like \"might.\" Sometimes this is referred to as \"chewing\" your vowels, perhaps because of the way sound tends to move all around your mouth."

      "title": "Add a soft \"r\" to the end of a long \"o\" sound.",
      "content": "Add a soft \"r\" to the end of a long \"o\" sound. The Aussie long \"o\" is so, so hard for non-Australians to get right—but if you do, you'll sound Australian for sure. There's definitely the English long \"o\" sound that you're familiar with, but it's blended with the \"ah\" of an \"a\" and the \"uh\" of a short \"u,\" with a bit of an \"r\" (as in \"oar\") at the end. [3] X Research source For example, an Aussie pronounces \"no\" a bit more like \"naur.\" This only happens when the \"o\" isn't followed by a consonant sound. That means you'll also hear it in words such as \"window\" (\"wehn-daur\")."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pronounce all unstressed vowels as \"uh\" or \"eh.\"",
      "content": "Pronounce all unstressed vowels as \"uh\" or \"eh.\" Generally, any unstressed vowel is going to flatten out to a \"schwa\" sound, like an \"uh\" or \"eh,\" in an Australian accent. In most cases, the vowel is also short, so the effect is that the short vowels in unstressed syllables lose their distinctive sounds and all sound about the same—\"Rosa's\" sounds the same as the word \"roses.\" [4] X Research source You do have to be careful here, because if you flatten out all short vowels into \"eh,\" you'll end up sounding more like a Kiwi (New Zealander) than an Aussie. Only the vowels in unstressed syllables get the \"schwa\" treatment."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw out all vowel sounds more than you usually would.",
      "content": "Draw out all vowel sounds more than you usually would. Aussies draw out their vowels more than any other English speakers. A short vowel in an unstressed syllable is still going to be about 60% as long as a long vowel—not that you have to be that technical about it. [5] X Research source The important thing to notice here is how long and stretched-out Australian vowels are compared to other English speakers. [6] X Research source You'll hear this pretty easily if you pull up videos side by side and compare an Aussie speaking to a Brit speaking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a hard \"y\" sound when pronouncing the letter \"u.\"",
      "content": "Add a hard \"y\" sound when pronouncing the letter \"u.\" Think about how you normally pronounce the word \"music.\" When speaking with an Australian accent, you almost always pronounce a \"u\" that way. [7] X Research source For example, \"tune\" is pronounced like \"tyoon\" rather than \"toon.\" Pronouncing the letter \"u\" without the \"y\" sound is known as \"yod-dropping.\" In Australian English, there is very little yod-dropping."

    {
      "title": "Soften a \"t\" to a \"d\" in the middle of words.",
      "content": "Soften a \"t\" to a \"d\" in the middle of words. At the beginning of a word, you get the same \"t\" as any other English speaker, but as the letter moves toward the middle of the word, Aussies soften it until it almost disappears towards the end. This means a word such as \"matter\" sounds more like \"madder\" when spoken by an Aussie. [8] X Research source At the end of a word, such as in the word \"right,\" the \"t\" is pronounced as a glottal stop. If you think about how you'd say the phrase \"uh-uh,\" the sound between the syllables is a glottal stop. Pronouncing \"t\" as a glottal stop is common in other English dialects as well, but happens more when there's a double \"t\" in the middle of a word, as in \"matter,\" rather than at the end. So this is one way you can distinguish Aussies from many British speakers."

    {
      "title": "Drop the \"r\" sound at the end of words or before consonants.",
      "content": "Drop the \"r\" sound at the end of words or before consonants. Australian English is non-rhotic , which means the \"r\" sound isn't pronounced at the end of words as a general rule. [9] X Research source But at the same time, most Aussies will pronounce an \"r\" at the end of a word that's followed by a word that starts with a vowel or vowel sound—even if there wasn't an \"r\" in the word to begin with. This is called an intrusive \"r,\" and it's also a feature of British Received Pronunciation (RP). For example, take the phrase \"matter of fact.\" Said with an Aussie accent, it sounds more like \"madda rof fac-.\" You typically won't hear an \"r\" before consonants in the middle of words either. Instead, the vowel sound is more rounded. So in \"word,\" you don't get that \"urr\" sound, it's more like \"wuhd.\" The intrusive \"r\" can also be heard within a single word if you have 2 syllables that both end in a vowel or vowel sound. For example, \"drawing\" would be pronounced more like \"draw-ring.\" [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Drop the \"g\" on words that end with \"-ing.\"",
      "content": "Drop the \"g\" on words that end with \"-ing.\" This is also pretty common with casual American English, so it might be one of the easiest things for you to do right off the bat. This \"rule\" only applies to words of at least 2 syllables—no Aussie pronounces \"ring\" as \"rin.\" [11] X Research source For example, you might say, \"I reckon I'll go surfin' this arvo\" (I think/guess/figure I'll go surfing this afternoon)."

      "title": "Relax your mouth and loosen your jaw.",
      "content": "Relax your mouth and loosen your jaw. When you're speaking Australian English, you have to move your mouth a lot—more than you would with any American or British accent. You can only do this if your mouth and jaw are relaxed and open. As you speak, keep your lips wide across your face (never pursed or pinched together) and your mouth slightly open. You already sound a little Aussie! [12] X Research source Watch videos of Aussies talking and pay close attention to how they move their mouths when they speak, as well as how their faces look when they're not speaking. Mimic Aussie facial expressions and movements as well as the sound of their voice and your accent will sound (and feel) more authentic."

      "title": "Blend your words together when you're talking rather than pausing between them.",
      "content": "Blend your words together when you're talking rather than pausing between them. The phrase \"G'day\" is perhaps the most well-known example of the Aussie tendency to blend their words together when they speak. [13] X Research source You can imitate this simply by speaking a little more quickly—you'll find that words naturally tend to blend together. There are other examples: \"got to\" or \"you've got to\" becomes \"gotta,\" \"ought to\" becomes \"oughta\"—really any phrase with the word \"to\" is gonna be blended like this. If you want your accent to sound really good, listen to native speakers as often as possible and mimic their speech patterns."

      "content": "Speak with more of a nasal twang. You can add a little twang by smiling when you practice the accent. Smiling will make your vowels sound much more nasally. Then, raise the pitch of your voice towards the ends of words. [20] X Research source Munoz, Patrick. Personal interview. 12 November 2019. Remember that Aussies are very friendly! If you speak with a broad smile , you'll automatically sound just a little more Australian—even if you don't change anything else about the way you talk."

You already know what it sounds like? Even if you don't associate it with Australians?

One Australian linguist took on the massive task of tabulating all these abbreviations and found the following endings were the ones most used: [17] X Research source -ie/y : barbie (barbecue), lappy (laptop), footy (Australian rules football), brekkie (breakfast), selfie (self-portrait), mozzie (mosquito) -o : doggo (dog), arvo (afternoon), servo (service station), rego (registration), aggro (aggressive), weirdo (weird person), avo (avocado) -s : totes (totally), probs (probably), dins (dinner) -ers/as : preggers (pregnant), Maccas (McDonald's), champers (champagne) -z/za : soz (sorry), appaz (apparently), biz (business), coz (because)"

Aussies use \"mate\" the way Americans might use \"man\" or \"dude.\" In a sense, it's as though you're addressing the person you're talking to, but it's also just a filler at the end of a sentence. Pretty much everyone is \"mate\" in a casual situation. [18] X Research source For example, you might say, \"We're headed to the beach, mate. Wanna come?\""

For sentences without question inflection, though, Aussies will often throw on a \"but\" at the end—even if there's nothing else to add to the sentence or the word doesn't really suit what they're saying. [20] X Research source For example, you might say, \"We spent the day at the beach? It was right hot, but.\" Sometimes, \"but\" keeps its usual meaning, it's just put at the end of the sentence rather than at the beginning. For example, if someone says they want to go to the shops, you might say, \"We haven't got enough time, but.\""
