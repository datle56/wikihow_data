      "content": "A stocky build refers to a shorter stature with broad shoulders. Someone with a stocky build is typically shorter than average height and has wide shoulders, a broad chest, and a fairly straight frame. Due to their short but wide physique, people with a stocky build often appear strong and sturdy. They might carry more weight in their upper body or be slightly overweight but appear naturally muscular. [1] X Research source Celebrity examples : Don Lee, Sean Astin, Manuel Andrade, James Roday, Matt Berry, Florence Pugh, Mindy Kaling, Camila Cabello, Hilary Duff “Stocky” usually refers to men, but women can have a stocky build, too. Wrestlers, bodybuilders, and linebackers often have a stocky build. A stocky build is often related to the endomorph body type , which describes someone who has a rounder frame, shorter limbs, and a balanced distribution of muscle and body fat. In slang terms, you might call someone with a stocky build “ thicc .” This usually describes men who are heavy-set and muscular and women who are full-figured and curvy."

      "content": "“Stocky” is usually seen as a neutral term to describe a short, broad body. However, some people might see “stocky” as a compliment, while others find it rude or offensive. Many people who have a stocky build love their bodies, and others want this build or find it attractive. There are also people who might be sensitive about their body or insecure about having this build, so they might view “stocky” as an insult. If you’re not sure how someone feels about their body, avoid calling them “stocky.” In general, it’s best to avoid commenting on someone’s body or appearance even if you think you’re complimenting them. If you want to give them a compliment, stick to praising their personality, skills, or accomplishments.

      "content": "Focus on working out your shoulders, arms, and chest. To help get a broader upper body , build up your shoulder, arm, and chest muscles. Make these exercises a priority in your workout routine , and work them out once or twice per week. Aim to do 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions for each exercise. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Example exercises : Shoulders : Shoulder press, lateral raises, face pull , Arnold press Chest : Push-ups, bench presses, flys Biceps : Dumbbell curls, inclined dumbbell curls, pull-ups Triceps : Tricep dips, tricep extension, skull crushers, cable pull-downs Make sure you rest at least 24 hours before you work out the same muscle group again. Rest gives your muscles time to repair themselves and helps prevent injury. [4] X Research source Choose weights that are challenging to lift as you get to the end of your set. This can help you build muscle faster and move up to heavier weights more quickly. Note : Having a stocky build is largely due to your genetics and bone structure.
