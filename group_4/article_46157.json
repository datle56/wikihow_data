      "title": "Smoke kief by itself for the most intense effect.",
      "content": "Smoke kief by itself for the most intense effect. Kief is more potent than buds of marijuana, so take that into consideration when determining the amount to use. [1] X Research source Also keep in mind that kief burns quickly and stays lit until it’s completely gone—meaning that if you get distracted, the kief will burn up on its own. Start with just a pinch of kief—don’t load up your joint or pipe with as much material as you’d usually smoke, if you’re not sure how hard it’ll hit. You can always take another toke, but you can’t untoke!"

      "content": "Top a packed bowl with kief to increase its potency. Pack a bowl of bud into your pipe, bong, or other smoking rig like a vape with a dry compartment. Then, simply sprinkle a pinch of kief on top of the bowl. [2] X Research source Try to “corner” the bowl, or light just 1 corner at a time rather than the entire surface, so the kief doesn’t burn up as quickly. For a more consistent bowl, alternate packing layers of flower and kief until the bowl is full, so that you hit the kief throughout the session, rather than just at the start."

      "title": "Line a joint with kief for a smoother burn.",
      "content": "Line a joint with kief for a smoother burn. Sprinkle a little kief in a thin line down a rolling paper. Add ground marijuana on top and roll it up into a joint . [3] X Research source An even distribution of kief guarantees a smooth burn. Remember, though: this is much stronger than a typical joint, so start with only a couple of pulls and see where that gets you. Or, for a flashier joint, wet the outside of the rolling paper on a completed joint, then roll the wet paper in kief for a blunt that looks a bit like rock candy. It doesn’t offer a different smoking experience than just rolling the kief in, but it’s a fun trick that’ll impress your friends."

      "content": "Put it in a spliff if you enjoy tobacco. If you smoke tobacco in addition to marijuana, you can use kief in a spliff. Smoking weed and tobacco together is said to lead to a more euphoric high. [4] X Research source Simply combine a pinch of kief with ground tobacco and roll it into a joint."

      "title": "Make “moon rocks” for a more potent high.",
      "content": "Make “moon rocks” for a more potent high. Moon rocks are a mixture of 3 different kinds of cannabis that, when combined, make for a potent and long-burning grind. To make them, use tweezers to hold a nug by the stem and roll it in a cannabis concentrate or oil, then roll the coated nug in kief and let it dry for about an hour. [5] X Research source Smoke moon rocks like any other bud, but be sure to grind it with your fingers, since it’ll clog up your grinder."

      "content": "Make kief butter to use in edibles or other foods. Making cannabutter with your kief is a great way to craft potent and tasty edibles. First, “decarboxylate” the kief to activate the THC by baking it in a covered oven-safe dish for 30 minutes in an oven preheated to 230 °F (110 °C). [6] X Research source Allow it to cool for about 30 minutes with the cover on. Then: Melt 2 sticks (½ lb) of high-fat butter in a saucepan on medium-high heat. Add 1 gram of decarboxylated kief and stir until it is completely dissolved. Use a spatula to transfer the butter to a heat-safe dish. Once it cools, cover it and store it in the fridge for up to 2 months. Substitute it for regular butter in your baked goods."

      "content": "Sprinkle kief into your morning coffee or tea. A popular way to use kief is to make cannabis tea or coffee by adding a small amount, like a pinch or ¼ gram, to your drink. The heat may activate the cannabinoids, producing a strong and long-lasting effect about 15-30 minutes after consumption. Remember that the potency depends on the strain of marijuana and your personal tolerance level. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Sprinkle kief over your favorite dishes after cooking. Kief has a very subtle flavor, so it won’t change the taste of your dishes when you add it after the dish is cooked. Sprinkle it over pasta or pizza, or put a dash of it in a soup or stew. To activate the THC for a better high, first bake it in the oven at 230 °F (110 °C) for 20 minutes in a covered dish.

      "content": "Spread 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of kief between folded parchment paper. Carefully sprinkle kief onto the bottom layer of a length of folded parchment paper. Keep it toward the fold rather than the edge, and make sure it’s no more than 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) thick. Fold the top half of the parchment paper over the kief to make something like a kief envelope. [9] X Research source Don’t substitute wax paper for parchment paper, since the kief will stick to the wax. “Hash” is a dense form of cannabis made by heating and compressing cannabis flower. Making it out of kief makes for a much more potent hash, also called “rosin.”"

      "content": "Heat an iron to the lowest setting and cover the parchment with a buffer. Plug in a clothes iron and turn it on to the lowest setting. You won’t need a “steam” function for this. Alternatively, use a hair straightener on the lowest setting. Then drape a thin buffer like a newspaper or a T-shirt over the parchment to keep the parchment and kief from burning.

      "content": "Iron the kief in 3-second intervals, until the kief is solid. Swipe your iron, set on low, over the buffer about 20 times, applying heat for no more than 3 seconds at a time. Flip the parchment paper over carefully every 5 swipes, placing the buffer back between the parchment paper and iron. [11] X Research source The hash is done when it is compact and no longer sticky. Crumble it with your fingers and smoke it however you like, or use it in tea or as a food seasoning."

      "content": "Use a 3-piece grinder to collect kief from flower grounds. A 3-piece grinder , or a grinder with an added screen beneath the main chamber, is the easiest way to gather that precious kief. [12] X Research source Simply grind your standard flower as usual. As you do, the kief gets knocked off the flower and sifts through the bottom screen, collecting in the bottom chamber for you to use at your leisure. To more quickly collect kief, simply scrape a bud back and forth across the fine screen on your 3-piece grinder."

      "content": "Sift kief from the flower by hand using a silkscreen. Grind your buds as usual, then drape a silkscreen over a bowl. Dump the ground buds onto the silkscreen and shake the screen to sift the kief through the screen and into the bowl, separating it from the larger particles of the flower. [13] X Research source Use your fingers or the bottom of a glass to press the flower against the screen, more effectively sifting the kief."

      "content": "Get kief from a dispensary. Many dispensaries sell kief as its own independent product, separate from flower or other types of cannabis. [14] X Research source Dispensaries often have equipment that allows them to extract kief using dry ice, which lets them get a higher concentration of kief more efficiently."
