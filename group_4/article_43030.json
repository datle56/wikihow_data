      "content": "Relax about the conversation. You may feel nervous opening up to your mom about a crush. It can feel weird to talk about something so private with a parent. You may also worry that your mom will be upset about you growing up. Try to relax going into the conversation. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source It’s natural to be nervous about approaching this subject with your parents. It can feel strange to bring this subject up. Your mother has lived an entire life up until the moment you were born, so she most likely has some great advice for you. Parents generally like it when their kids seek advice from them, so you could be opening up a chance to feel closer with your mom. Your mom probably had crushes herself growing up. She probably remembers what it's like to be your age. She understands you need an adult's guidance sometimes, so don't be shy about talking. Remember, your mom may look concerned or worried while you're talking to her. She may have a lot of questions or concerns. Don't take this as a sign of disapproval. Your mom is simply trying to make sure you're safe and happy."

[3] X Research source You can talk in a public place, if you feel comfortable, but it may be easier to talk in private. You can talk in your bedroom, for example, or in a quiet room in your home. Keep your mom's schedule in mind when deciding when to talk. If your mom is always busy Wednesday and Thursday nights, do not talk during these times. Instead, pick a weeknight when she's usually home."

      "content": "Think about what you want to say. Brainstorming a little beforehand can help you manage your stress about the conversation. Take some time before approaching your mom to plan what to say. [4] X Research source It can help to make lists. Write a long list of everything you want to discuss, as well as the feelings you're having. You can also compose your feelings in a letter or in your journal. If you feel extra nervous, practice talking in front of the mirror, or practice saying what you want to say out loud by yourself. It may feel silly, but it can help you prepare."

[5] X Research source Starting the conversation does not have to be complicated. You can begin by letting your mom know you want to talk.

      "content": "Be honest. Do not withhold information. You want to build a relationship based around trust, especially if you're hoping to gain permission to date. Being honest will make your mom more likely to trust and believe you. [6] X Research source Tell her about the boy you have a crush on. Let her know how you know him and what he's like. If there's anything you worry she may not like about him, let her know anyway. It's better she finds out from you than discovering down the road. Keep in mind, your mom may have reservations about the boy for a variety of reasons. While this can be frustrating, it's always best to be honest. You could end up damaging your relationship later if you lie now. If there's something you're nervous about telling her, say something like, \"I know you might not like this, but Mason is two grades ahead of me.\""

I think I have feelings for him.\" The conversation will run smoothly if you don't make your mom do guess work. Do not beat around the bush. Simply state you like the guy."

Even if your mom does not tell you exactly what you want to hear, listen to what she has to say. [8] X Research source If you disagree, try to see your mom's side. For example, maybe you're a freshmen and the boy is a senior. Your mom may have reservations as the boy may be older and more experienced. She also may worry about your feelings. If the boy goes away to college next year, for example, you may end up heartbroken. Try to listen as much as you talk. Avoid interrupting, even if your mom is saying something you do not like."

Pay attention to what your mom says so there are no misunderstandings between the two of you. If you're still in middle school, your mom may not want you dating at all. If she does allow dating, there may be strict rules. For example, you may be allowed to go to school events, like dances and sports games, with the boy. You may not be able to go on one-on-one dates with him. If you're still in elementary school, your mom may not want you dating at all. While this can be frustrating, keep in mind your mom has your best interest at heart. You are still very young, and still have a lot of growing up to do."

For example, maybe he could come hang out at your home. Maybe you could go to public places with him, where others are around. You could also ask if you could pursue a friendship with this guy. Maybe your parents would be open to allowing you to make new friends, as long as you hold off on dating for now."

Your mother will likely be able to answer your questions and may even be impressed by your willingness to ask her about it. Try saying something like, “I am considering becoming sexually active, but I have questions. Would you mind if I asked you some of them?” or, “I am not planning to become sexually active, but I have questions about it. Would you mind if I ask you some questions about sex?”"

[10] X Research source Avoid getting defensive. Don't say, \"But you let Mark date. Why can't I?\" This may make you come off as argumentative, which can frustrate your mom. Try to leave siblings out of the discussion as much as possible. Focus on your relationship with your mother, and leave brothers and sisters out of it."

Even if you feel your mom's rule are unfair, baiting her into an argument will not help her see your side. If anything, she may become more frustrated. She may think you lack maturity, which could result in harsher rules. Instead of arguing, try to be mature. Say something like, \"Okay. I don't agree, but I respect that you feel that way.\" In the future, you can try raising the subject again. Your mom may change her mind down the road."

If your parents are very religious and do not allow dating at all, for example, you can't expect them to abandon that rule completely. However, there may be a more realistic ways to work things out. Be mature. Try saying something like, \"We're definitely not seeing eye to eye on this. How do you think we should proceed?\" See if there's a way to change rules slightly. Say you're 13 and your mom does not want you dating until you're 16. You can request that she maybe allow you to start dating at 14 or 15 instead."

She comes from a different time than you, and has different values as a result. If she criticizes your crush, do not criticize her viewpoint. Avoid taking a side. It's okay if you like someone your parents do not like. Relationships, especially when you're young, may be somewhat fleeting. There's no need to take a firm side in the situation.
