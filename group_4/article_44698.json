      "content": "Let your doctor examine your genital area. You should get an official diagnosis for vaginal thrush, even if you plan to use home remedies. Your doctor will examine your genital area and likely perform a speculum exam and collect a sample of any vaginal discharge, which will be examined under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for and ask about the symptoms of thrush, which include: [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source An abnormal vaginal discharge. The discharge may appear like cottage cheese, with whitish lumps that do not have an odor. Swelling on and around the genital area Soreness, itchiness, or a burning sensation in the genital area Your doctor may also ask you if you feel any pain or discomfort during sex or when you urinate."

      "content": "Receive a prescription for oral or vaginally-applied antifungal drugs. Your doctor may prescribe oral antifungal drugs, like fluconazole or itraconazole, or antifungal drugs that you apply directly to your vagina, like miconazole or clotrimazole. These antifungal drugs only work exclusively on vaginal thrush. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may experience more intense burning and itching in your genital area during the first few days of treatment but your symptoms should clear up within seven to 14 days. These medications have a “cure rate” of around 80-90%."

      "content": "Get over-the-counter medication if you have had vaginal thrush before. If you have experienced a vaginal fungal infection before and your doctor confirms that you have vaginal thrush, you can take OTC antifungal drugs, which have a lower concentration of the antifungal agents found in prescription antifungal medications. [5] X Research source Most OTC medications have a one-day to seven-day dose. Take a single dose, as it is usually the most effective for occasional vaginal thrush. If you get repeat infections, take the longer dose medications. Do not take OTC medications if you believe you have any other infection besides vaginal thrush. Some patients experience more burning from the one-day treatment. If this is the case, you should switch to one of the longer treatments. If you experience a lot of irritation or burning on the outside of your vagina, apply A&D ointment liberally to the area (but not inside the vagina) to help relieve symptoms. OTC medications are also recommended if your symptoms are relatively mild, you experience no fever or pelvic pain and you are not pregnant. If you think you may be pregnant or are pregnant and develop vaginal thrush, you should speak to your doctor."
