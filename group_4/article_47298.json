      "content": "Soak up as much of the spill as possible with a bath towel. Press the towel over the wet memory foam and hold until the towel is saturated. Repeat the process until there isn't any more liquid to be soaked up. A bath towel is best for high absorbency, but you can also use paper towels. If the spill can stain, make sure to use a towel that you don't mind getting stained and dirty. Never twist or fold memory foam to wring out liquid--this can damage the foam's structure. Always press gently to soak up any liquid instead."

      "content": "Use an enzyme-based cleaner for blood stains, food stains, or beverage spills. Enzyme-based cleaners organically dissolve and remove these more stubborn spills. They're also safe to use with memory foam and won't damage the foam's structure. Follow the instructions that come with your cleaner and soak up any excess liquid when you're finished. [1] X Research source Generally, you should pour some enzyme-based cleaner on the spill, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then blot up as much cleaner as possible. [2] X Research source Although some suggest using hydrogen peroxide to break down bloodstains, this is inadvisable. Hydrogen peroxide will damage the memory foam's surface. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Set the memory foam product out to dry. Leave the memory foam in a bright area with good air circulation. [4] X Research source In order to avoid mildew and mold, let it dry completely before using it. Do a touch test to determine if the foam is fully dried. Your mattress should also feel much lighter when it's dry. If it still feels heavy around the washed area, it probably still contains some trapped water."

      "content": "Vacuum first to remove dust, hair, and lint. Use a soft brush extension and a low power setting when running the vacuum over memory foam. Clean as much extra debris as possible to keep it from getting ground into the mattress when you clean. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Spray the stained area with a laundry detergent and water solution, then blot.",
      "content": "Spray the stained area with a laundry detergent and water solution, then blot. In a spray bottle, combine 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of laundry detergent and 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of cool water. Shake well and make sure that the two ingredients are fully mixed before spraying. [6] X Research source Spray the stain and gently soak up the liquid with a towel. Keep repeating this until the stain disappears. [7] X Research source Since you may not be able to completely remove all of the detergent, make sure to use a gentler, unscented formula. Look for detergents labeled “hypoallergenic.”"

      "content": "Soak stubborn stains with a baking soda solution. Mix together 1 part baking soda and 2 parts water until it forms a milky white liquid. Work the solution into the stain using circular hand movements and leave it to soak for half an hour. Use a slightly damp cloth to remove the solution. Soak up any remaining liquid with a bath towel.

      "content": "Let the memory foam dry completely. Set the memory foam product in a bright, open space to dry before using it. Make sure it is completely dry to reduce the risk of mold and mildew. Direct sunlight will help dry the foam more quickly and dispel odors."

Using covers and cases helps protect your memory foam and reduce the need for washing it directly. [9] X Research source Make sure to wash your covers and cases regularly. [10] X Research source"
