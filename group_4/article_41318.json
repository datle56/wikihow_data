      "title": "Drink more water during the day.",
      "content": "Drink more water during the day. Under normal circumstances, your body produces more saliva when you’re not properly hydrated. So, by taking more frequent, small sips of water during the day, you’ll end up with less saliva. [1] X Research source Drink a small glass of water before bedtime as well. To stay hydrated, drink a glass of warm water when you wake up and before and during meals, and take sips throughout the day before your mouth feels dry or you feel thirsty. In general, aim to drink 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day for men or 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for women.

      "content": "Avoid very sweet or very sour foods and drinks. When you put a sour candy or a sweet treat in your mouth, you may produce extra saliva in order to dilute the strong taste sensation. [3] X Research source Cutting back on really sour or sweet things may help reduce the amount of saliva in your mouth. This is why people suck on sweet or sour candies in order to keep their mouth moistened."

      "title": "Talk to your doctor about medical and medication causes.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor about medical and medication causes. If your body produces too much saliva for unknown reasons, your doctor may be able to diagnose a medical condition that is causing it. If a known medical condition or treatment is the culprit, your doctor may be able to change your medication or make other treatment adjustments. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A range of medical conditions, including various infections, viruses, and gastric issues (especially GERD), can trigger excess saliva production and drooling. Likewise, some medications—such as the antipsychotic drug Clozapine—can trigger extra saliva."

      "content": "Take any prescribed medications to treat hypersecretion. Hypersecretion is the medical term for overproduction of saliva, and there are several medications approved for treating this condition. They sometimes cause side effects like sleepiness, dizziness, difficulty urinating, or a racing heartbeat, however, so discuss the pros and cons of the various options with your doctor. Common hypersecretion medications include: [5] X Research source Glycopyrrolate (Robinul). Propantheline (Pro-Banthine). Amitriptyline (Elavil). Nortriptyline HCL (Pamelor). Scopolamine (Transderm Scop)."

      "content": "Note when you experience the “lump in your throat” feeling. If you frequently feel like there is a literal lump that’s making it hard for you to swallow—especially when swallowing saliva—you may have a globus. A globus isn’t an actual lump, but it is a very real condition that creates the sensation of a lump. [6] X Research source Some people notice a globus only when they swallow saliva, while others feel it anytime they swallow. Having a globus may cause you to want to swallow very frequently—even if just small amounts of saliva—in order to “test” the feeling. If it feels like there is a lump in your throat all the time, and especially if you can feel or see an actual lump, contact your doctor. While uncommon, you may have a tumor or some other condition other than a globus."

      "content": "Visit your doctor to check for GERD and get treatment. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common cause for a globus. The backflow of stomach acid damages your esophageal tract and can create the lump sensation, especially when swallowing your own saliva.

      "content": "Focus on swallowing forcefully and only when necessary. It’s sometimes easier said than done, but making bigger swallows less frequently may help you to overcome the “lump in your throat” feeling. [8] X Research source See if you can go 1 or even 2 minutes between swallows during the day (while not eating), for instance. Set a timer if that helps. The average adult swallows around 600 times per day, or about 35 times per hour while awake and roughly 6 times per hour while asleep. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Try hot liquids, cold liquids, and frozen treats. Try some of your favorite sore throat relievers that have stood the test of generations—things like chicken soup, hot tea, ice chips, and frozen ice treats. Cold things can help numb the pain receptors in your throat, while hot things can soothe some of the pain and help clear away mucus. [10] X Research source Having a sore throat can make you feel like swallowing repeatedly in order to temporarily soothe the pain with a coating of saliva. In turn, this can give you a dry mouth and even cause an upset stomach."

Place a throat lozenge on your tongue and let it dissolve. Repeat every 2 hours to manage sore throat pain. [11] X Research source Don't give a throat lozenge to a child that's under the age of 5 as it may be a choking hazard."

Spritz your throat 1-2 times, then wait 15 seconds before spitting and rinsing out your mouth thoroughly. Use the spray as needed to help manage your throat irritation for up to 2 days. [12] X Research source If you’re using an oral rinse Chloraseptic, swish it around in your mouth for 15 seconds, then spit and rinse. Try not to swallow the Chloraseptic. You may notice mouth tingling while using Chloraseptic."

      "content": "Use warm salt water or throat spray to briefly dull the pain. [13] X Research source Stir ¼ to ½ teaspoon of salt (1.3 to 2.5 g) into 4 to 8 ounces (120 to 240 mL) of warm water. Take a big sip, gargle it in the back of your mouth, spit it out, and repeat until you’ve finished the glass. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Gargle as often as once per hour if needed. [15] X Research source Salt water gargling is safe for children 6 and older. Alternatively, pump 1 spritz of a throat numbing spray into the back of your throat; wait 15 seconds, then spit it out. Do this as often as every 2 hours for up to 2 days. Do your best not to swallow the salt water or throat numbing spray. Swallowing a small amount won’t cause any harm, though."

      "content": "Use a humidifier at night to keep the air moist. Dry air dries out your throat as you breathe, causing your body to produce extra saliva to coat your throat when you swallow. [16] X Research source When you have a sore throat, you’ll probably feel most comfortable with a humidity level between 30% and 50%. [17] X Research source A humidifier can help during the day and especially at night, when your throat can really dry out and cause you to swallow saliva repeatedly. A high humidity level—above 60% and especially 70%—can also cause problems. It may cause additional congestion and increase the number of allergens in your home. [18] X Research source So, in some cases, you may be better off using a dehumidifier instead of a humidifier."

      "content": "Talk to your doctor if swallowing causes you anxiety. Even if you don’t have a physical issue like hypersecretion, a globus, or a sore throat, swallowing can be stressful. Swallowing is a common sensorimotor disorder —a greatly increased awareness of an unconscious bodily function that causes tremendous anxiety. If this sounds like your experience with swallowing, give your doctor a call. [22] X Research source Sensorimotor disorders fall within the OCD spectrum. You might experience great anxiety when swallowing anything, or be particularly anxious about swallowing saliva. Your anxiety about swallowing may cause you to repeatedly “test” yourself to make sure you can do it, with the result being that you’re constantly swallowing your saliva."

      "content": "Reassure yourself that it’s okay to swallow and your attention will shift. Your doctor may refer you to an OCD spectrum expert, who in turn will work with you to devise treatments and techniques to handle your unique condition. One common technique is to frequently remind yourself that swallowing is perfectly normal, that you are perfectly capable of swallowing, and that it’s okay to swallow saliva when needed. Once you allow yourself to be aware of the swallowing, your focus will eventually move on. [23] X Research source For example, you might tell yourself things like the following: “It’s time to swallow now, swallowing is normal, and I can swallow without any problems.”"

      "content": "Use “body scan” and mindfulness techniques as needed. These techniques help you to spread your awareness to your entire body, rather than focusing so much on swallowing. Body scanning involves drawing your focus to individual body parts in a sequential process. Similarly, mindfulness involves bringing your attention to all the sensory experiences you are having in the present moment. [24] X Research source You can work on these techniques yourself, but you may have greater success under the guidance of a trained mental health professional."
