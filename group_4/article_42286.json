They manage a “Taco Bell Cares” account specifically for complaints, compliments, and other customer service issues. Based on their replies, it appears Taco Bell is very responsive on this account, so you shouldn’t be waiting long. Taco Bell also manages another account, @tacobell , but they almost exclusively use that account for memes and arguing with whoever runs Wendy’s Twitter account."
