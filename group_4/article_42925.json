      "content": "Shampoo your hair as you normally would. Before you start teasing your hair, wet your hair in the shower or underneath a bath or sink faucet until it’s completely saturated.

      "content": "Skip the conditioner after you shampoo. Because conditioner softens hair and makes it smooth, it may keep your teased hair from holding its texture. Wash your hair with shampoo and don’t follow up with a conditioner. [3] X Research source If you have especially dry hair, apply some conditioner to only the ends of your hair. This should help to keep it from looking dry while also not interfering with the teased areas."

Apply a volumizing product, such as mousse, after you wash your hair and before you dry it to create some more lift."

Pull the section straight up away from your head and hold it taut to get the best results. [5] X Research source While teasing the crown is the most common method, you may want a bolder look for a Halloween costume or to get an 80’s hairstyle. If you’re going for a more extreme look, section all of your hair, not just the hair at your crown."

Tease the back of the new section and then clip it to the front of your head on top of the first section. Do this for all of your sections.
