      "content": "Call emergency services if you notice poisoning symptoms. If you know or suspect that you or someone else has been poisoned and you/they are showing symptoms, it’s important to get medical help immediately. Call your local emergency number as soon as possible if you notice symptoms such as: [2] X Research source Difficulty breathing. Drowsiness. Slurred speech, as if the person has had too much to drink. Loss of consciousness. Shaking or trembling hands. Seizures or convulsions. Unsteady gait when the person is walking. Extreme restlessness or agitation."

      "content": "Get immediate help if you think someone poisoned themself intentionally. If you suspect that a person has deliberately taken medication, drugs, or poison to hurt themself, call emergency services immediately. Even if you’re not sure whether it was deliberate, any overdose of medication or recreational drugs is a medical emergency. [3] X Research source If the person is still conscious, ask them lots of questions, such as what they took, whether it was by mouth or injection, and who their next of kin is. The more information you can get, the easier it will be for the emergency medical technicians to help them. Deliberate or accidental poisoning with large doses of medication or drugs is often accompanied by alcohol use, but they might also be using harder drugs. Check for track marks on their arms if you suspect drug use."

      "content": "Provide as much information as you can to the medical professionals. Once you get in touch with emergency medical personnel or a poison help hotline, tell them as much as you can about both the poison and the poisoning victim. Different poisons require different treatments, so the more information you can give, the more they can do to help. Be prepared to tell them: [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Any symptoms the person is having. The person’s age and approximate weight. Any medications or dietary supplements the person is taking. How much of the poison the person ingested, inhaled, or came into contact with (if you know). How long it has been since you found the person. If you are the person who’s been poisoned, let them know how long ago you came into contact with the poison. What kind of poison the person was exposed to (if you know). If the poison came from a package or container, keep it on hand so that you can give information from the label. This is also important if the poison was due to fumes from a chemical. If the poison seems to have been from berries or mushrooms, take a sample to bring along."

The doctor or emergency technicians may need to: [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Perform imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans. Provide breathing support, such as an oxygen mask, a breathing tube, or a ventilator. Do tests on the person’s blood and urine.
