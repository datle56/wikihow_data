Imagine the other loose end of the string, which you're holding in your right hand, is the \"rabbit\". The rabbit comes up the hole, runs around the tree, and goes back down the hole. Another way to remember how to make this knot is with a rhyme: \"Lay the bight to make a hole Then under the back and around the pole Over the top and through the eye Clinch it tight and let it lie\" [2] X Research source"

This loop is the ‘hole’ the rabbit comes out of.
