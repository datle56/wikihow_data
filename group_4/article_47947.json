[9] X Research source To help your cat feel less stressed in your home, give them spaces that they feel secure in, like a cat tower or cat cave .

      "content": "Teach your cat to stop licking by ignoring their behavior. If your cat’s licks are getting to be too much, stand up and move away when they lick you.

Over time, your cat will learn that they get affection when they don’t lick you, but you leave when they do. Do not yell or use punishments like spray bottles when you’re teaching your cat not to lick. This can damage your relationship with your cat because they’ll associate their discomfort with you."
