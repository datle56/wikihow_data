For those that don't, know that the ending indicates whether the verb goes with I, you, he/she/it, we, you, or they as the subject. \"Ar\" verbs, like comprar, conjugate like -o, -as, -a, -amos, -ais, -am. So that's \"compro,\" \"compras,\" \"compra,\" \"compramos,\" \"comprais,\" \"compram.\" \"Er\" verbs, like comer, conjugate like -o, -es, -e, -emos, -eis, -em.

Ê/ê is used for stressing and is just pronounced like /e/. The accent grave (`) is only used in the letter \"A\" and it's just for contractions. For example, the feminine pronoun for \"the\" and \"to\" are both \"a.\" If you go \"to the city,\" it's \"à cidade.\" The \"á\" in Portuguese is just used to denote stress and only written when it's abnormal."

      "title": "Know the rules and exceptions.",
      "content": "Know the rules and exceptions. Unlike Spanish, Portuguese has quite a few not-so-tried-and-true pronunciation rules. A lot of how a letter sounds depends on its placement within the word . And sometimes what you're used to and what it actually sounds like are quite different. Here are some examples: Nasalize (that is, say through your nose) every \"m\" and \"n\" at the end of every syllable (but not between vowels) so they sound like \"ng.\" \"Bem\" (well) then is pronounced like \"beng.\" [4] X Research source The sound \"-ão\" sounds a lot like \"ow,\" but that tilde on top of the \"a\" means it must be said entirely through your nose. \"S\" sounds like \"z\" when it is between two vowels, and like \"s\" otherwise. So \"casa\" is pronounced \"caa-za\", \"absinto\" is pronounced \"abi-ssin-too\", and \"suave\" is \"ssu-aa-ve\". \"D\" and \"t\" become \"j\" and \"ch\" sounds before \"e\" or \"i.\" So \"saudades\" is pronounced sa-oo-DA-jeez . Speaking of \"saudades,\" unstressed \"e\" at the end of words turns to an \"ee\" sound. It's tempting to want to say \"sa-oo-da- jayz ,\" but that \"jayz\" becomes \"jeez.\" Unstressed \"o\" does something similar -- it turns to \"oo.\" \"Como\" then is pronounced more like \"co-moo.\" Sometimes, it's not pronounced at all. \"Cohm\" would be how it's said, depending on the dialect. \"L\" turns to \"oo,\" too, when not between vowels and at the end of a syllable. \"Brazil\" then is pronounced \"bra-ZEE-oo.\" That trilled \"r\" we all know so well in Spanish turns into an \"h\" sound. So using what we know, how would you pronounce \"morro?\" It's a very strange \"MO-hoo.\" Yep. Really."

      "title": "If you are familiar with Spanish, know the differences.",
      "content": "If you are familiar with Spanish, know the differences. In general, European Spanish is much different from Brazilian Portuguese than South American Spanish, which you probably could've guessed. But even though South American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese are very similar, they have a few stark differences: Always use the \"ustedes\" conjugation for the second person plural and third person plural; that is, \"they\" and \"you guys\" are the same -- even with regard to formality. Whether you're giving a speech or talking to friends, it's \"ustedes\" all the way. The vocabulary can be quite different -- even with the most basic of words. Red in Spanish is \"rojo\"; in BP, it's \"vermelho.\" Never make any assumptions; there are a ton of false cognates out there! There are only three person-conjugations. Yay! But they do use an entirely new tense, the future subjunctive. So it's a give and take when it comes to difficulty."

      "content": "Know that the accents in Brazil can change significantly when you go to a different state. If you're traveling or moving to Rio de Janeiro, it's good to know that they've developed their own sort of accent and way of speech. Most of it lies in the expressions they use and the casual, emotive interjections they favor. But there's some pronunciation differences, too. Things like \"OK\" to confirm an offer are instead \"Demorou!\" \"Bacana\" means \"cool,\" and \"inteligente\" becomes \"cabeçudo.\" And that's just three examples! Cursing is frowned upon in more formal situations, obviously, but if you're blending in at the local bar watching the football game, it's gonna come up. \"Porra\" is a good word to start with for expressing general frustration. As for sounds, the starkest contrast is with the \"r\" and it should be a bit more guttural (remember how it's pronounced like an \"h?\") Think something closer to \"loch.\" This goes for all \"r\" sounds that are at the beginning or end of a word, those that have been doubled, or those preceded by an \"n\" or \"l.\" \"S\" at the end of words or syllables that are followed by an unvoiced consonant (t, c, f, p) gets turned to \"sh\" here. So \"meus pais\" becomes \"mih-oosh pah-eesh.\""

Say that three times fast. And then there are words like hip-hop -- can you guess? -- It's like \"hippee hoppee!\" Loan words are actually a lot more common in Brazilian Portuguese than European Portuguese and European Spanish. For example, it's \"mouse\" for a computer mouse in all of South America but \"ratón\" across the pond. Kinda makes sense -- the majority of them are from America -- it's harder to make a jump across the Atlantic."
