Many sources Google Scholar finds have restricted access, but if you have access to a library or other institution that subscribes to the right services, you may be able to reach these. Use the following steps to sign in to your academic institution or library: Click the icon with three lines ( ☰ ) in the upper-right corner. Click Settings . Click Library Links . Enter the name of your library or academic institution. Click the Magnifying Glass icon. Click the checkbox next to your library (you can select up to 5). Click Save ."

Then, click the search button (to the right of the search bar, with a magnifying glass icon) to pull up results. For instance, if you are interested in Vietnamese culture, you could type in ‘the culture of the Vietnamese people.’ Using as few search terms as possible will return broader results. For instance, you could search for ‘Vietnamese people’ or ‘Vietnamese culture.’ Use keywords instead of full sentences. If you have trouble finding relevant results, try an additional or different search term. For instance, if you are interested in the everyday life of Vietnamese people, and ‘Vietnamese people’ isn’t returning useful results, try searching for ‘Vietnamese people customs.’"

      "title": "Get citation information.",
      "content": "Get citation information. A search in Google Scholar may yield various results: academic articles, books, dissertations, and theses, etc. Pay attention to titles, author names, publication dates, and other information that Google Scholar will supply. Keep an eye out for results that seem interesting or relevant to your topic. For example, if you search for ‘Vietnamese Culture,’ you might see a result for the article “Culture Shock: A Review of Vietnamese Culture and its Concepts of Health and Disease,” and see that it is by M.D. Nguyen, and was published in the Western Journal of Medicine in 1985. You might be interested in the specific topic (Vietnamese culture and health), the author, or the fact that it was published in 1985. You might also see a brief abstract or snippet of text from the result, which can help you determine if it is relevant to your search."

Some results found via Google Scholar will be full text, meaning you can click on the title of the result and go directly to read the full article, book, or other sources via your web browser. Many academic sources, however, have restricted access and do not allow the general public to see the full text. [2] X Research source Clicking on a search result might take you to the full text, an abstract, a snippet, or a limited preview. If you see \"PDF\" to the right of the article title, click this link to download the text as a PDF. If you are logged into your institutional account, Google Scholar may provide links for full-text access. For instance, if you are logged into your Harvard account, look for “Availability at Harvard” and/or “FindIt@Harvard” for more information about whether or not you can access the full text of particular sources. If you don’t have an institutional or library account, some restricted sources may have the option of paying a fee to view them. If a source you want to view is restricted, click “All Versions” at the bottom of the citation information. If the source is accessible via other databases, you might be able to find one that is non-restricted."

      "title": "Use boolean search connectors.",
      "content": "Use boolean search connectors. You can run a more precise search by coupling your search terms with boolean connectors. For instance: By typing \"OR\" (must be capitalized) between search terms, Google Scholar will retrieve results containing either term. If you are interested in the culture of both Vietnam and Thailand, you can search for ‘Vietnam OR Thailand culture’. Typing \"AND\" (capitalized) between search terms will search for articles containing both search terms. Enter \"NOT\" (capitalized) before a search term will eliminate it from the results. For instance, if you are researching Vietnamese culture but do not want to find results related to the Vietnam War, searching for ‘Vietnamese culture NOT war’ will stop Google Scholar from giving results that use the key term “war.”"

It can be useful for running initial searches and for general research. However, you may need to consider some of its limitations when researching. For example: Many of its search results are restricted. You cannot limit it to the type of source you want to find (e.g., books only or articles only). You cannot know which databases Google Scholar uses to find its search results. There are sometimes errors in the way Google Scholar records data (e.g., journal names may mistakenly be listed as authors) Some results that Google Scholar retrieves (such as personal web pages, non-peer-reviewed articles, etc.) may not be traditionally-defined scholarship. Some sources may not be included in a Google Scholar search that you may find at your local library. For example, Google Scholar does not return sources like podcasts, videos, statistics, or special collections."
