      "content": "Note your address and the date (optional). In the upper left-hand corner of a clean sheet of paper or new word processor document, put down your current location in one or two lines. Directly under that, record the day's date, making sure to mention at least the month and year. [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source You can either spell out the full date (\"Wednesday, February 12th, 2018\") or use the abbreviated numeral form (\"2/12/18\") to keep things simple. While including these details is optional for an informal letter (it’s most typically used in formal letters), it’s still a good way to let your recipient know when and where the letter was written, which can be useful if you're in different parts of the world."

      "title": "Write your recipient's name at the top of the letter.",
      "content": "Write your recipient's name at the top of the letter. Begin your letter by addressing the letter to the person it's intended for by name. Traditionally, the opening address goes in the upper left-hand side of the page, but you can put it anywhere you want as long as you have enough room to include your message beneath it. [2] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source If you want, you can add a salutation before your recipient's name, such as “Dear,” “My darling,” or even just “Hey.” If you're composing an open letter and don't know the name of the person who will be reading it, start with a general address, like “To whom it may concern” or “To whoever reads this letter.” [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fill out the body of the letter with your message. Use the space underneath your recipient's name to say whatever you want to say. The body of your letter can be as long or short as you want it to be—there are no rules! [4] X Research source If you run out of room on the first page, start a new one or flip your paper over and continue writing on the back. Picking out a lined type of paper, like notebook or journal paper, can help you keep your handwriting neat and organized."

      "title": "Write a short closing to wrap up the letter.",
      "content": "Write a short closing to wrap up the letter. Once you've gotten your message across in the body of your letter, leave a little room (about the space of a single typed line) below your last sentence to include a brief sign-off. Your closing line might say something like, “Sincerely,” “Yours truly,” “Best,” “Thanks,” or “Love.” The closing essentially signals to your recipient that they've reached the end of the letter. Since you're not sending a formal letter, there's no need to add a closing if you don't want to—you can always just sign off with your name."

    {
      "title": "Sign your name at the bottom of the letter.",
      "content": "Sign your name at the bottom of the letter. Put your name right under your closing line (if you included one) so that the closing acts as a lead-in for your signature. You can sign your name in cursive or formal script if you like, but it's also okay to simply print or type it instead. [5] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source You might use your full name, first name, or a nickname depending on your level of familiarity with the person you're writing to."

      "title": "Keep your language conversational for a more personable feel.",
      "content": "Keep your language conversational for a more personable feel. Informal letters are meant to be read in a relaxed, casual way. Feel free to use contractions, hypothetical questions, inside jokes, and other figures of speech. This will help your natural voice come through to your reader. [6] X Research source If you're not sure what to say, it can be helpful to imagine that you're having a conversation with a friend and simply write the way you would talk."

    {
      "title": "Write to your reader for a more conversational tone.",
      "content": "Write to your reader for a more conversational tone. The fun thing about informal letters is that they can be totally personal! Use words like “we,” “you,” and “our” to make your letter feel like a conversation. Simply write to your reader as you would text a pal. Now, remember to keep the reader in mind. For instance, you wouldn’t use lingo only your best friend would know if you’re writing to your grandma."

    {
      "title": "Use colored ink or fonts to liven up your correspondence.",
      "content": "Use colored ink or fonts to liven up your correspondence. Black ink is for newspapers and dull, rigid formal letters. Grab your most vibrant pens or change the default text color in your word processor and put a little personality on the page. Blue, green, red, and other funky shades can all be fun attention grabbers, especially if you're writing to a close friend. [7] X Research source Mixing up your use of colors is a great way to break up the monotony and emphasize keywords or phrases. Make sure the color you choose contrasts your letter paper enough to be plainly visible. Otherwise, your message may be hard to read."

      "title": "Draw in the margins of handwritten letters to lend a little visual flair.",
      "content": "Draw in the margins of handwritten letters to lend a little visual flair. Take advantage of the extra space on either side of the page by filling it with doodles, symbols, or quirky notes. Elements like these will allow you to express yourself creatively and give your reader something else to look at. You might spice up your description of that time you spotted Bigfoot at the mall by including an artist's rendering of what he looked like. Similarly, if you happen to catch a typo while reading back over your letter, you could turn it into a joke by crossing it out and scribbling, “I promise I know how to spell!” next to it."

      "title": "An informal letter is a personal letter you write to someone you're close with.",
      "content": "An informal letter is a personal letter you write to someone you're close with. Informal letters are great ways to stay in contact with friends, family members, or a significant other, especially if you live far apart. Handwritten notes are more personal than a text or email. Plus, you can get more creative with them! What makes an informal letter “informal” is that it’s not strictly structured and rather casual. [8] X Research source If you want to write a letter to a business, institution, or someone of great importance, be sure to adhere to the guidelines of formal letter writing . Unlike informal letters, formal letters have strict formatting and style guidelines to make them more official and professional."

      "title": "You can write about anything you want in an informal letter!",
      "content": "You can write about anything you want in an informal letter! The fun thing about informal letters is there are no rules! You can write whatever your heart wants—if you think it, you can write it. Think of it like a regular conversation with a friend. Maybe you write a long-distance friend about a trip you recently went on and include photos you took, or perhaps you send a grandparent a detailed update about how you’re doing in school."

      "title": "Fold your letter twice vertically so it will fit in an envelope.",
      "content": "Fold your letter twice vertically so it will fit in an envelope. Take the bottom two corners of your letter paper and fold them about ⅓ of the way up the sheet. Then, fold the doubled section over one more time to create a neat that will fold in any business envelope. [9] X Research source This method works best with standard 8.5 inches (22 cm) x 11 inches (28 cm) printer paper, but it can be used to fold papers of other sizes, too."

      "title": "Place your letter in an envelope and seal it up.",
      "content": "Place your letter in an envelope and seal it up. Slip your letter into the envelope widthwise to make sure it will fit. To seal the envelope, lick the glue strip lining the inner edge of the flap to moisten it. Then, lower the flap and apply gentle pressure for a few seconds until the adhesive sticks. Keep in mind that envelopes come in various shapes and sizes. If you're having trouble cramming your letter into a standard business envelope, try shopping around for one that's a better fit. Add a bit more pizzazz to an informal letter by sealing the envelope with stickers or decorative tape."

      "title": "Print your recipient's mailing information on the face of the envelope.",
      "content": "Print your recipient's mailing information on the face of the envelope. As Claytor explains, somewhere near the center of the envelope, write the person's first and last name, their full address, and the city, state or province, and postal code where they live. Don't forget to specify an apartment number after the street address if your recipient doesn't live in a house."

      "title": "Put your name and mailing address in the upper left-hand corner.",
      "content": "Put your name and mailing address in the upper left-hand corner. To mail a letter, you must put your address and name on the top left of the front of the envelope. This is called the return address and helps the postal service know where to send the letter if something goes wrong. Plus, the receiver will know who the letter’s from before they open it. [10] X Research source First, write your first and last name, then your full address, and your city, state, and postal code—with each element having its own line. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Stick a stamp in the upper right-hand corner of the envelope.",
      "content": "Stick a stamp in the upper right-hand corner of the envelope. Position your stamp directly across from the return address, where it can easily be seen by your mail handler. Once you've applied the proper postage to your letter, you'll be ready to drop it in the mailbox and send it off to your recipient! [12] X Research source Most letters up to 1 oz require one stamp, unless they are an odd shape or not uniform in thickness. Putting the stamp somewhere other than the upper right-hand corner of the envelope could confuse the sorting machine at the post office. In some cases, your letter may even be sent back to you. Buy stamps at your local post office or order them online. [13] X Research source"
