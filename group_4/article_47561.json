      "content": "Opt for tighter-fitting jeans to keep your outfit from looking frumpy. For both masculine and feminine styles, jeans that are slim fit or skinny will look better with suspenders than loose or wide-legged jeans would. Suspenders make your outfit look intentional, so you want to match the rest of your outfit to that look.

      "content": "Wear cropped jeans and a lightweight blouse for a bohemian look. This look is pretty different from the classic tight-pants with button-up-shirt style, but it can be really fun, stylish, and comfy to wear when you’re out and about. Pick a pair of capris or cropped jeans (they can be slim-fit or a little looser, just depending on what you’d like), tuck in a loose button-up blouse (long- or short-sleeved), and add a pair of leather or light-colored suspenders to create a bohemian outfit. Let the blouse hang out a little so it looks flowy when it’s tucked in, rather than pulling it down tight. If you don’t have a button-up blouse, you can wear a normal one, too. Just make sure to tuck it in."

Choose your favorite pair of jean shorts and tuck in a light sweater or blouse. Add a pair of suspenders to complete your look. Add a floppy hat to this ensemble if you’ll be out in the sun.

      "content": "Pick dark jeans for a more modern aesthetic. Dark indigo, grey, black, and other darker shades of denim are classic when it comes to the jeans and suspenders combo. They give you a lot of flexibility when it comes to picking a top and a correlating color of suspenders. Wear lighter shirts to really create a strong contrast between your top and bottoms, and then pair that outfit with suspenders that pop. [2] X Research source Keep things on the shadier side by pairing your dark jeans with a more muted or dark top, like forest green or deep brown. If you do this, pick a light-colored pair of suspenders to create a nice contrast."

This is great because there are so many styles and colors available for you to choose from. [4] X Research source A casual button-down shirt like an Oxford button-down (which has buttons on the collar and lapels) in a more casual fabric like chambray would be perfect. This, paired with dark jeans, is a stylish and bold look. [5] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020.

This is a look that is great for a dinner out during spring or summer, and it could also be acceptable in an office, just depending on what you do for a living. Remember to pair a patterned shirt with solid-toned suspenders, and vice versa. [6] X Research source Try rolling up the sleeves one or two times for a more laid-back look. Avoid wearing sleeveless shirts with suspenders. That look usually resembles a firefighter’s outfit more than a fun, cool aesthetic."

      "content": "Wear a soft cotton top for a casual, laid-back look. This look is less conventional, but you can make it work if you’re really intentional about your style. Pick either long or short sleeves and choose a neckline that comes up at least to your collar bones. Make sure to wear slim pants rather than baggy ones, otherwise your outfit will look frumpy.

This is a great option if you’re working in the office and want to dress up your jeans a little more, and it’s a good look for a fun evening out, too. Pick a darker blazer, but one that doesn’t too closely match the shade of your jeans. When you walk around, put your hands in your pockets to hold the blazer back to show off your suspenders. [8] X Research source Leave the blazer unbuttoned so your suspenders can still be seen."

      "content": "Let the suspenders hang down for a punk-rock look. This is a really specific look that can be super fun for concerts, music festivals, or just a night out with friends. The goal is to look casual rather than modern or put-together. Let the suspenders hang off of just one shoulder, and let the entire thing hang down. [9] X Research source Be careful to not get caught on things if you do this. The last thing you want is to have your suspenders hook on something like a doorknob and snap you or somebody else. You can wear this look with both regular-length jeans or with jean shorts or capris. It just depends on the look you’re going for."

      "content": "Pick button-suspenders for a more clean-cut and refined look. Button-suspenders do just that—button into your jeans directly rather than clipping the waistband. This look is great if you prefer a more classic style and if you dislike the shiny metal that comes on the clip-suspenders. [10] X Research source If your jeans don’t come with buttons already in them, you’ll need to attach them yourself. This requires a little more effort, but your outfit will look really nice in the end."

These are pretty popular, as they’re easy to wear and you don’t need to worry about sewing any suspender buttons into place. Most clips are silver, though you can special order gold-toned ones online.

      "content": "Wear solid-colored suspenders if you’re sporting a patterned shirt. Avoid overwhelming your outfit with two contrasting patterns. Choose a bright color, like red, pink, green, or blue, or opt for something more muted if you’re worried about being too flashy.

      "content": "Opt for patterned suspenders against a single-toned shirt. This gives your outfit a great pop of color and a dash of style. It’s also a great way to show off some cool suspenders and to create a signature look. [13] X Research source This is similar to how you would pick which tie to wear with a dress shirt. You want the colors and tones to complement each other, but not to visually overwhelm."

      "content": "Go with suspenders that match your bow tie if you'll be wearing one. Try to pick a color or design that complements but doesn’t exactly match the suspenders. Matching too closely can make your outfit look less stylish and nerdier (but if that’s the vibe you want, go for it!). For example, if you are wearing navy blue suspenders with white polka dots, try pairing them with a pink, yellow, or green bow-tie. [14] X Research source Use your best fashion judgment to mix and match colors and styles. As long as you like what you’re wearing, you should look good!"

      "content": "Wear suspenders that match your shoes if they’re both made of leather. If just one item (the shoes or the suspenders) are leather, you can style them how you’d like. But if they’re both leather, match the shades so that your outfit looks neat and fashionable. [15] X Research source The suspenders don't have to match your shoes exactly. If you have a chocolate brown suspender, just look for a shoe in the brown family so it's not too matchy.

Different shades of leather in an outfit can look shabby, so try to buy matching colors when you shop."
