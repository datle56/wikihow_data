      "title": "Dreaming of spiders may indicate you’re anxious or stressed.",
      "content": "Dreaming of spiders may indicate you’re anxious or stressed. Real-life worries can manifest as spiders in your dreams. If spiders give you the creeps when you’re awake, they probably frighten you in your dreams, too. Some researchers believe dreaming helps the brain process difficult emotions. [1] X Research source Therefore, being a symbol of fear for many people, spiders may enter your dreams as an embodiment of anxiety. Responding to This Dream Meaning: Write down all the things that are making you anxious or stressed. Then, make a plan to tackle the things you can control. For example, if you’re worried about an upcoming trip, make a list of everything you need to pack and map out your daily agenda so you feel more prepared."

      "title": "Spiders may symbolize creativity and wisdom.",
      "content": "Spiders may symbolize creativity and wisdom. In mythologies around the world, like the Greek myth of Arachne, spiders have been associated with creative jobs like weaving, basket making, and sewing. If your dream is positive, it may mean you’re feeling particularly creative or that you should invest your energy into your creative interests. [2] X Research source Responding to This Dream Meaning: If you’ve been considering taking up a creative hobby, like painting, music, or writing, now may be the time to take that leap. In Greek mythology, Arachne was a skilled weaver whom the goddess Athena turned into a spider because Arachne beat her in a weaving contest."

      "title": "Spiders can symbolize manipulation and lying.",
      "content": "Spiders can symbolize manipulation and lying. The presence of bugs in dreams can literally mean “something’s bugging you,” especially if bugs creep you out in real life. Because spiders are generally associated with lies and deceit—think of the phrase “a web of lies”—you may dream about spiders when you feel misguided or deceived. [3] X Research source Responding to This Dream Meaning: Take time to reflect on your dream by thinking of context. For example, maybe a friend recently told you they weren’t free to hang out even though you have a hunch they were. You may dream of a spider crawling on or near this friend because of your suspicion. In this example, talking to your friend about your suspicions can help you dream peacefully, as confronting the lie can ease the subconscious feeling of being caught in a web of lies. Dishonesty doesn’t have to come from a friend or family member. You might be dreaming about spiders because you’ve been dishonest with yourself."

      "content": "Dreaming of spiders may mean you’re spiritually protected. With eight legs, spiders mirror the world’s energy and life cycle, making them symbols of a higher power. Seeing a spider may suggest that your destiny is being woven and your spirit is protected. [4] X Research source Responding to This Dream Meaning: Say a prayer or do a chant before you fall asleep to invite positive renewing energy into your dreams. In Chinese culture, a spider appearing in a dream is sometimes seen as a divine visitation from the creator."

      "title": "Spiders can represent mother figures or feminine energy.",
      "content": "Spiders can represent mother figures or feminine energy. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud associated spiders with protective or angry mother figures or a fear of one’s own femininity. If you have a complicated relationship with your mother or recently had a negative interaction with her, there’s a chance the spider in your dreams could symbolize that relationship or your mother herself. [5] X Research source Freud may have associated spiders with angry mothers because spiders prey on smaller insects, which could represent children."

      "title": "Spider crawling on you",
      "content": "Spider crawling on you According to psychoanalyst Carl Jung, spiders crawling on you in a dream can represent your shadow self, or the darker, unknown side of your unconscious. This dream scenario could indicate that you’re afraid of the unknown parts of yourself or that you’re facing some adversity that’s negatively affecting your life. [6] X Research source Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung theorized that personalities are divided into the persona and the shadow. The persona represents the person at the forefront of our personalities, otherwise known as consciousness. The shadow represents the darker, unknown parts of our unconscious. Jung believed we could not move forward in life without encountering and acknowledging our shadows. It’s perfectly normal to fear things, especially when it comes to the unknown. What’s important is acknowledging these fears as they are. They do not define you, and you can overcome them ."

      "title": "Killing a spider",
      "content": "Killing a spider If you kill a spider in your dream, it can symbolize facing your fears . One dream theory suggests that we dream about upsetting and frightening situations to practice our fight-or-flight instincts. A spider can symbolize an obstacle in your life—a disloyal partner, upcoming test, etc. When given the opportunity to kill the spider in your dream, your fight or flight response is challenged, and it often signifies that you’re ready to face your problems in real life. [7] X Research source It takes very little effort to kill a spider in real life. Yes, it may jump or scurry away, but you can catch it. Think of how this represents your daily fears. You can conquer whatever you set your mind to if you just take that first step toward the fight. If you kill multiple spiders in your dream, it may mean you have such an extreme need for security and protection that you’re isolating yourself from others. Remember, it’s okay to be vulnerable, and others can often offer you the support you’re searching for."

      "title": "Spider biting you",
      "content": "Spider biting you Spiders are often known for their venomous bites, and dreaming of being bitten might mean you’ve felt the “sting” of betrayal. You may have recently been criticized or betrayed by someone close to you, like a friend, relative, or coworker, or you’re having difficulty trusting someone because you’re afraid they’re going to hurt you. [8] X Research source If you feel betrayed, try surrounding yourself with people who care about you. Lean on them as you heal rather than isolating yourself."

      "title": "Multiple spiders surrounding you",
      "content": "Multiple spiders surrounding you If spiders surround you in your dream, you’re likely afraid of something. Maybe you have a big test coming up or are worried about the future. Either way, something is scaring you. [9] X Research source Your mind uses your dreams to practice problem-solving, so this may be your brain's way of facing your fears. This can also be true if you dream of one large spider. Large spiders or multiple spiders often mean you’re feeling overwhelmed by anxiety or problems in your life. Make a list of all the things you're proud of. These can be as big or small victories as you like. Then, if you wake from a dream or nightmare full of spiders, pull out your list. The list will help you remember that you are capable of so many great things. Your fears don’t have to hold you back.
