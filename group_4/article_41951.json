      "content": "Emphasize and highlight your layers for a fully stacked, sleek bob. Inverted bobs have stacked layers that can actually make your hair look thicker and fuller by covering up spots where only one layer of hair would normally sit. Try pulling the back ones forward and resting them under the front ones. [1] X Research source For the sleekest look possible, focus on styling your bob in ways that keep layers stacked the way your stylist cut them."

      "title": "Use a wide-toothed comb while your hair is wet rather than a brush.",
      "content": "Use a wide-toothed comb while your hair is wet rather than a brush. The straighter and smoother your hair is, the sleeker the bob will look. Run a comb through your hair, combing each side your scalp toward your ears, going all the way down the length of your hair. If you have fine or sensitive hair, using heat while it’s short could do a lot of damage. Using a comb is a much safer bet for your hair, if this is the case."

      "title": "Blow dry with a round brush to help your hair dry smoother.",
      "content": "Blow dry with a round brush to help your hair dry smoother. Dry each layer one at a time, clipping up layers as needed. Set the brush in front of each layer and roll the round bristle brush toward your head to move all the way down the layer. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a blow dry lotion as a styling product to smooth out edges.",
      "content": "Choose a blow dry lotion as a styling product to smooth out edges. This will allow you to style the ends and the top of the cut, as it will both maximize volume and create a sleek look. If fly-aways are a problem, run the lotion through all of your hair, not just the ends, as well as around the crown of your head. [3] X Research source Try not to get the lotion on your scalp, as it can block pores."

      "title": "Use a flat iron straightener to smooth down your bob.",
      "content": "Use a flat iron straightener to smooth down your bob. If your hair needs more straightening, like if you have naturally curly or wavy hair, for example, grasp each layer between the two flat irons and pull away from your head to straighten out each individual layer. Set the heat to a temperature below 200 °F (93 °C) to prevent heat damage. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray on light- to medium-hold hairspray from 12 inches (30 cm) away to set your look. Bobs are prone to bouncing around and ending up out of shape after a long day. You can help keep your styling fresh for a few more hours by using a gentle hairspray. Always spray your hair with just a little bit of product and from 12 inches (30 cm). [5] X Research source You can spray once above your head, once on the left, and once on the right for full coverage without too much product. Hairspray is important for keeping layers from bouncing out."

      "content": "Get straight bangs for an edgier bob. Straight bangs are certainly a fashion statement, but they can give you an edgy, vintage look that builds on the classic appearance of a sleek inverted bob. This will add another straight line to your bob, emphasizing the sleekness of the cut. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Boost your bob’s volume with curls.",
      "content": "Boost your bob’s volume with curls . If you have naturally curly hair or hair long enough to use curlers or a curling iron, use waves and curls to your advantage for a light, volumizing appearance. You can use a curling iron on a 200-300 degree setting, wrapping the strands of your bob around the iron and twirling the iron away from your face. [7] X Research source Always wear hand protection when using a curling iron. Bobs can make your curls look fuller than they are, and the curls can help give the bob more texture than straight layers would."

      "title": "Style with mousse if you want an airy, tousled look.",
      "content": "Style with mousse if you want an airy, tousled look. Just take a small dollop of mousse and massage it through your hair away from the roots. Any mousse will do, but curl-boosting mousses are a good choice for making waves cooperate more easily. [8] X Research source You don’t need to worry about the lack of smoothness mousse provides, since getting a sleek look isn’t on the agenda. If you have delicate curls, you can squeeze the mousse in instead of massaging."

      "title": "Use your fingers to style and let your hair air-dry for a relaxed look.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to style and let your hair air-dry for a relaxed look. Short hair won’t tangle as much as long hair, so your fingers are usually enough to move your hair around and style it, especially if you want a natural, lightly tousled look. Your fingers will also allow you to break up hairs that have gotten flat and add volume by breaking up areas lumped by product. [9] X Research source On days where you need to fix especially messy hair, you can use a bristle brush to straighten it up. Air-drying is better than blow-drying for these looks, ensuring you get soft waves without frizz."

      "content": "Use wispy bangs to soften up the hairstyle even more. If you are worried about not looking feminine enough with a short, edgy look like an inverted bob you can get your bangs cut to help soften the edges around your face. [10] X Research source Avoid straight bangs if you are trying to create a soft style. Get a light fringe that brings your hair over the sides of your forehead if you want to soften the bob without committing to bangs."

      "content": "Try a jagged cut at the ends of your hair for a more textured bob. One way to make your bob look looser and a bit shaggier is to get staggered ends, as they can make straight hair look more tousled. This is a good option if your hair doesn’t take well to texturizers or mousse but you want a carefree, hardly-styled look. [11] X Research source Apply a little pomade to the ends of your hair to add some extra volume and texture."
