      "content": "Know when to use your coupons. To really get the best deal you need to determine the best time to use your coupons. This could mean a particular time of year for seasonal goods, or when there is already a sale on. The benefits of using a coupon are compounded if you use them when something has already been discounted. Wait for a sale, especially if you are buying an expensive one-off purchase. [4] X Research source Follow sales cycles so you know when the prices of particular goods are likely to be reduced. [5] X Research source If you are buying something seasonal, buying off-season can mean a cheaper price. For example, a warm woollen jumper will often be on sale in the Spring."

      "content": "Know how to use your coupons. Being familiar with the fine print can save you some hassle at the register, as well as allowing you to budget accordingly. Start by determining whether it is a \"manufacturer's\" or \"store\" coupon. Manufacturer's coupons come from the company or manufacturer of the specific product and are accepted in any store. Store coupons are only accepted in the specifically listed store(s). Ensure the barcode on the coupon is not ripped or damaged as this might prevent the cashier scanning it, and render it invalid."

      "content": "Determine the limits on the use of coupons. Often there will be clear limits and restrictions on how you use specific coupons. Check the detail and find out if you are limited to one coupon per specific item, or perhaps one coupon per transaction. If your coupon is not limited, you may be able to use a number of coupons in the same transaction to increase your discount. If your coupon says \"Limit one coupon per specified item(s),\" you may only use one coupon when you buy the product. If your coupon says \"Limit one coupon per transaction,\" you will only be able to use that specific coupon in the transaction. Be sure to check the expiration date so you know at what point the coupon will become invalid."

Sometimes you can use a manufacturer's coupon in addition to a store coupon to double your savings. [6] X Research source Stacking coupons like this can really make a dent in the price of a product. For example, if you buying a new TV you can use a coupon from the company that made the TV together with a coupon from the store you are buying it in. You can also stack coupons for smaller everyday items such as groceries. Be sure to check the eligibility criteria and fine print on the coupons before you try to use them. [7] X Research source It's also a good idea to go online and read the coupon policy for the store you want to use them in. [8] X Research source"

Stockpiling coupons and keeping an organised collection will help you get the absolute most out of them. Get a binder and keep all you coupons together. You can organise them by type of product, or by store. You could also organize them by expiry date so you have a clear picture of which coupons are due to expire soon. If you want to increase your stockpile you could tell friends and neighbours that you are collecting coupons. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a coupon in store.",
      "content": "Use a coupon in store. Search for the specific item in the store. For instance, some coupons will say, \"on any flavor or variety,\" while others will provide a specific list of items you can redeem the coupon with. Make sure that you give your coupons in the right order. Some coupons may render other coupons void, so make sure you've stacked them correctly. If you have a coupon that has a required purchase amount, such as $5 off when you spend $50, give that one first. That way, any discounts you receive with additional coupons will not penalize you in reaching the necessary amount. [10] X Research source Be sure to read the fine print. Some coupons may only be used after all coupons have been deducted. If in doubt, ask your cashier for deals. He may have a value guide at the register or know of specific discounts on items you are about to purchase."

If you avoid using coupons on full price items, are happy to switch brands according to what coupons you have, and don't just pick up anything that is on sale, you will set yourself up for the best savings. [11] X Research source Know what you are going to buy before you go in store and try to stick to your plan. If you have an opportunity to buy large quantities of non-perishable goods, make the most of it."

      "content": "Pay with an online discount code. If you are buying something online and have a discount code that you can apply to the purchase, be sure to have the code written down or saved somewhere accessible. Using the code is fairly straightforward, but can vary from website to website. In most instances you will be prompted to enter any discount code you have when you fill in your payment details. Pay close attention as the discount code box might be small or not immediately visible on screen. Before you complete the purchase, be sure to check that the discount has been applied to the amount you are being charged."
