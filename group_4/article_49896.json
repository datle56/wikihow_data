      "content": "Research how to write to your local Councillor or MP. The concept of writing to someone who you may have never met or even heard of may be quite daunting, but don't panic. You are allowed your say so there must and will be a way of communicating with the people who can make a change. Websites are available where you can find a representative to write to and ask about your query. [1] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source You could also look to see where the local office is of your MP or Councillor and drop in a letter, or even send a fax if you're fancy enough. Remember though, different Councillors are responsible for overseeing different aspects of the town. There's not much point writing to a representative who deals with schools and education when what you want to know is about Waitrose Supermarkets and when they will get a new cash machine built outside! So, research who you want to write to and who will deal with your query the most effectively according to their role, and you're ready to start your letter or e-mail."

      "content": "Write your preferred choice of communication, whether that's a letter, e-mail, fax, or in person if you happen to see your MP down the street buying an ice-cream. Do remember to be polite, formal, and as informed as you can be about the issue you're addressing. If you're asking about a road to be altered near you for whatever reason, give the representative names of roads and towns so they can visualize where you're talking about, or maybe even photos or a map outlining where the road is. [2] X Trustworthy Source Kansas University Center for Community Health and Development Community-based research center focused on supporting public health development and education Go to source Give the representative as much detail as possible so they can understand more about what it is that you want to see happen or change in your town. Being informed gives you an image of confidence and intelligence to someone who has that much power and say in the changes of your community."

      "content": "Remember your English skills when writing your letter! Some websites help you to write out an email with your query and then in the preview change the format and make your email look like a formal, typed letter, which looks professional and shows the representative that you mean business. [3] X Research source If you're really not comfortable with writing such a formal letter, practice first and get others to oversee your work before you send it, or even hand-write it, but make sure it is as neat as possible and your issues are still clearly established. [4] X Research source Also remember, the people who you are writing to are there to hear your questions and will try to answer them as best as they can. They are available to write to because they want the same as you; to change your town for the better! So don't feel intimidated or nervous, because: They are normal, ordinary people, and... If anything, they'll be extremely happy you brought the subject up and may want to discuss the matter further. So, go for it!"

      "title": "Don't worry if they don't reply straight away.",
      "content": "Don't worry if they don't reply straight away. All representatives of your town are very busy, so don't take it to heart if they are taking a while to respond. If your message is being sent through a system where they check the letter first, or if it's all online through a system, the chances are the people running these systems will have another system to make sure your letters are being answered, they're that efficient! If they don't reply at all, politely send another letter after a considerable amount of time asking if your first letter was received, or maybe leave a message at the local office and hopefully someone should get back to you. Pestering them won't get you anywhere, but a genuine concern about your town deserves to be addressed by someone who has a lot more authority and who can certainly do something about it."

      "content": "Ask others about the issue too. If you feel strongly about change in your town over a particular issue, such as rubbish needing to be collected more efficiently, or perhaps you need to discuss issues involving transport or housing, talk to family and friends and explain how you think things should be improved, or even write a petition if you think that's the route you want to go down. [5] X Research source Having people agree with you and thinking the same as you makes your case look a lot stronger and you can have confidence that if they think it's a good idea or subject to bring up, then it really must be! Be courageous and stand up for what you believe in, because if you don't say anything about it, then who will? Be the first to 'set a trend' and to get people talking and considering how your town can be made better for you and everyone else who lives there."
