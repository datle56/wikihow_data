      "content": "Go first for an advantage when playing Mancala . Mancala is a game where the leading player drives the action. Moving first gives you an opportunity to control the board. Right away, you have a chance to score points and force your opponent to be on the defensive. Winning Mancala requires continual planning and calculating, so going second isn’t an instant loss. Capitalize on your opponent’s mistakes to overcome an early disadvantage."

      "title": "Get a free turn on the first move by starting at the third cup on the left.",
      "content": "Get a free turn on the first move by starting at the third cup on the left. In a standard game of Mancala, you have 4 stones in each of the small cups on your side of the board. That means you can land in your Mancala by moving stones forward exactly 4 spaces. You then get another turn to move more stones forward. [1] X Research source This move is considered to be the ideal opening. There are many other ways you can start a game, but the free turn makes this the most common opening."

      "content": "Use your free turn to move stones in your far right cup. You will have 5 stones in this cup next to your Mancala after your opening move. Begin “seeding” your opponent’s side by moving these stones forward. Place 1 of the stones in your Mancala as you pass it, followed by each of the opponent’s cups you pass. The final stone will end up in the third cup from the left on your opponent’s side. [2] X Research source Your opponent will have 5 stones in their cup, so they won’t be able to move them straight into the Mancala like you did."

      "title": "Play the second cup from the left if you go second.",
      "content": "Play the second cup from the left if you go second. If your opponent makes the ideal opening move, you’re on the defensive right away. Note that the second cup on the left side of the board has exactly 5 stones. Move towards your Mancala, landing your final stone in it to get a free turn. Defending against the ideal opening move is tough. Look for the opportunity to get a free turn, since you need it to distribute some stones across your side of the board."

      "title": "Use the stones on the far left side of the board if you’re on defense.",
      "content": "Use the stones on the far left side of the board if you’re on defense. After getting your free turn, move the stones from the first cup on your left. You will have 5 stones in this cup. This isn’t enough to reach your Mancala, so moving these stones allows you to distribute them across your side of the board. Spreading the stones out opens up your possibilities a little. You won’t have a bunch of stones on the left side of the board waiting to be captured and have more ways of dealing with your opponent’s next move. Watch for your opponent to gather stones to your left. Many opponents do this to reduce your options and prevent you from capturing stones."

      "title": "Play defensively to minimize your opponent’s scores.",
      "content": "Play defensively to minimize your opponent’s scores. No matter who went first, the game opens up after the opening move. Think about the game from the opponent’s perspective. Ask yourself what they are most likely to do next turn and the turn after that. Adjust your strategy to put yourself in a stronger position for the middle part of the game. [3] X Research source The more you play Mancala, the easier anticipating your opponent’s strategy gets. Practice a lot to learn how to stay ahead. Not all opponents go for the optimal moves. Monitor the situation and adapt your strategy to take advantage of mistakes."

      "title": "Move your stones to keep more than 3 of them in each cup.",
      "content": "Move your stones to keep more than 3 of them in each cup. Having a small number of stones in a cup makes it vulnerable. With a small number of stones, you can’t move far during your turn. This also means your opponent is able to plan out their turn to avoid capture. With more stones in a cup, you have a much wider range of movement. The exception to this is the rightmost cup next to the Mancala. Keeping this cup empty is often a good idea, since you can easily move single stones forward to get free turns."

      "title": "Force your opponent to have less than 3 stones per cup.",
      "content": "Force your opponent to have less than 3 stones per cup. When your opponent starts collecting stones in a cup, keep the opposite cup on your side of the board clear. Plan out your movements so the final stone you play in a turn ends up in the empty cup. If you get a chance to make this move, you score a bunch of points through capturing. If not, your opponent will move the stones, spreading them out and reducing their movement options on subsequent turns. Spreading out your opponent’s stones leaves them with no empty cups. Without an empty cup, they can’t score points by capturing your stones. Remember that small numbers of stones can’t move far. These movements are far easier to anticipate. Use this to your advantage to prevent your opponent from capturing your stones."

      "content": "Collect a large number of seeds in a single cup, if possible. The best spot to do this is the rightmost cup, the one next to your Mancala on your side of the board. Getting a lot of stones there is tricky and requires careful movement every turn. Accumulating 12 or more stones enables you to move all the way around the board. [4] X Research source When you move the large pile of stones, you seed the opponent’s side to prevent them from capturing your stones. You also limit their options because you have most of the stones on your side of the board. Be vigilant against capture. If you’re not careful, your opponent will score big off of your hard work. The rightmost cup is hardest for your opponent to reach."

      "content": "Move small quantities of stones to the opponent’s side to evade capture. Move your stones when they are under threat of capture or when your opponent’s side of the board looks empty. “Sowing” stones this way strategically narrows down your opponent’s possible moves. When done correctly, you force your opponent to make moves that harm their position. [5] X Research source Mancala is a balancing act. Giving your opponent more stones enables them to move further, but this also helps bring stones back around to your side. Select your movements carefully for the best chance of success."

Most captures net you small amounts of points, but sometimes your opponent slips up and leaves lots of stones vulnerable. Keep the pressure on to force your opponent into making more mistakes. [6] X Research source Don’t take unnecessary risks to force a capture. Focus on controlling the board first and the captures will follow."

The oval-shaped Mancala to the player’s right is a storage space for scored points. During your turn, you pick up all the stones in 1 of the smaller cups and move them along the board. [7] X Research source Most ordinary games of Mancala begin with 24 stones per player. Some versions start with 3 or 5 stones in each cup."

      "content": "Move your stones counterclockwise during your turn. The Mancala cup to your right is your scoring cup. If you forget how to move your stones, remember your Mancala. You always move towards it. Think of the board as a racetrack where the Mancala is the finish line. [8] X Research source When you pass stones onto your opponent’s side of the board, continue moving them counterclockwise. This is called sowing, an important part of strategizing to win."

Move counterclockwise around the board, dropping a stone into each of your cups you pass, including your Mancala. [9] X Research source For example, if you have 3 stones in a cup, drop a stone in the 3 cups ahead of it. The final stone will end up 3 cups ahead of your starting point. Don’t put a stone in your opponent’s Mancala if you reach it. You only reach your opponent’s Mancala when you have a lot of stones in a cup on your side, enough to move around the entire board. Pass over the Mancala without putting a stone in it. Some rulesets forgo using the Mancalas. Instead, you score only by capturing your opponent’s stones."

In order to capture your opponent’s pieces, the last stone you move needs to end up in an empty cup on your side of the board. Take the stones in the opposing cup on your opponent’s side of the board , along with your stone, and put them in your Mancala. [10] X Research source To capture stones on the far right side of the board, for example, you have to move to the cup right before your Mancala. If you have only 1 stone in the cup next to it, move it forward to capture the space."

You don’t get a free turn if you pass over to your opponent’s side of the board. Count your stones carefully to ensure you have the exact number needed to get the free turn. [11] X Research source Getting a free turn is an effective way to score lots of points. It gives you a chance to score again or move your stones out of harm’s way. The use of free turns depends on the rule set you use. For a standard game with 24 stones, plan on using the free turns as a point of strategy."

[12] X Research source The game ends when a player can no longer move any stones. This happens when their side of the board is empty."
