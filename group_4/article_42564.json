      "title": "Get a chaser.",
      "content": "Get a chaser. A chaser is a drink that you can use to decrease the taste of the shot. Get a soda, juice, or beer to take with your shot. You will take a sip of the chaser right after you down the shot to remove the taste of the liquor from your tongue. Make sure you have your chaser ready before you take your shot. You can also take a small sip of the chaser before you take your shot and hold it in your mouth. Drink the shot, and then swallow the chaser and the shot at the same time. Once you have swallowed, take another sip of the chaser. Depending on the shot (i.e. tequila ) you are taking, you may need to get your lemon, lime, or salt ready before you take the shot. Beer is the most commonly used chaser. Tequila can be chased with a light lager such as Tecate, Corona, or Pacifico. Bourbon pairs well with an imperial stout beer. [1] X Research source Chase with any beer that you like or ask the bartender for a suggestion. If you are drinking whiskey, try using pickle juice as a chaser. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Tilt your head back.",
      "content": "Tilt your head back. Slightly tilt your head as you raise the shot glass to your mouth. Continue tilting your head and the shot glass at the same time as you drink the liquor. The shot glass should be upside-down when you are finished taking the shot. This motion will make it easier for you to get the shot down your throat. Be careful not to tilt your head too far back. You do not want to choke on the liquor. Make sure you tilt both your head and the shot glass. Titling only one of these can result in a mess. For example, if you tilt the glass but do not tilt your head back, you may spill the shot on your clothes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Breathe through your mouth.",
      "content": "Breathe through your mouth. Inhale right before you open your mouth to take the shot. Do not exhale before you drink the liquor. Exhaling before you take the shot may cause you to gag on the shot. Once you have finished the shot, exhale out of your mouth again. Avoid breathing through your nose during the shot taking process. Breathing through your nose intensifies the taste of the shot. Remember to inhale before you take the shot. Inhaling while you take the shot will cause you to inhale fumes and cough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swallow the shot immediately.",
      "content": "Swallow the shot immediately. Shots are not meant to be sipped. Holding the liquor in your mouth will make it more difficult for you to swallow the shot or activate your gag reflex. You will also taste the liquor much more if you do not swallow it immediately. Prolonging the shot can also cause the liquor to go down the wrong pipe. Keep your jaw and your throat relaxed as you swallow."

    {
      "title": "Choose your liquor.",
      "content": "Choose your liquor. You have many different options for taking a shot. Most shots are taken with an 80 proof (40% alcohol content) liquor such as rum, whiskey, tequila, vodka, or gin. [3] X Research source If you are trying to avoid having a hangover the next day, choose a clear liquor like vodka, gin, or some tequilas. [4] X Research source Higher quality spirits not only taste better, but they also decrease your risk of a hangover. Opt for premium liquor when possible. Dark liquors (e.g. rum, whiskey, bourbon) contain larger amounts of congeners. The increased amount of these congeners can make you have a more severe hangover. [5] X Research source Dark liquors tend to have a stronger flavor compared to light liquors. If you do not have a preference, you may want to take a shot of a clear liquor."

      "title": "Measure your shot.",
      "content": "Measure your shot. A typical shot in the United States is 1.5 fl oz (44 mL), but shot glasses come in various sizes. If you are ordering your drink at a bar, ask for a single shot. A double shot at a bar is typically 2 fl oz (59 mL). If you are preparing the shot yourself, use measuring spoons : 3 tablespoons or 9 teaspoons is equivalent to a 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) shot. [6] X Research source If you do not have measuring spoons, you can use a Solo brand cup. The bottom line of the Solo cup is 1 fl oz (30 mL). A small medicine cup that comes with a bottle of cough syrup can also be used. These cups are usually 1–2 fl oz (30–59 mL) and have measurement lines on them."

      "title": "Make it a social experience.",
      "content": "Make it a social experience. Taking a shot is more enjoyable when you do it with other people. If you are taking a shot with your friends, order all of the shots at once and wait until everyone has their shot before you take it. Make a toast and have everyone raise their glasses. If you are drinking with other people, do not feel pressure to drink as much as they do or pressure others to drink more."

    {
      "title": "Eat before you drink.",
      "content": "Eat before you drink. Eating a meal before you begin to drink will cause your body to absorb the alcohol more slowly. Be sure you eat some real food and not just snacks (e.g., chips, dip, pretzels, etc.). [7] X Research source High protein foods (e.g., meat, cheese, peanuts) are particularly good to eat when you are drinking. Alcohol causes you to become dehydrated. Avoid eating salty food while drinking. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Have a designated driver.",
      "content": "Have a designated driver. Before you leave your house, make sure you have a designated driver for the evening. If you do not have a driver, call a taxi or use a service like Uber or Lyft to get home safely. If you are drinking with friends, spend the night at your friend's house instead of driving home. If you notice that someone else has had too much to drink, figure out a way for the person to get home safely. Alcohol slows down your reaction time, changes your vision, and makes it more difficult for you to process information. This increases your chances of getting into a wreck when you are driving. If you plan to drive home, have a drink with your meal and do not consume more than 1 glass of wine, beer, mixed drink, or shot in an hour. Again, it is best not to drink if you plan to drive."

      "title": "Pace yourself.",
      "content": "Pace yourself. Your body does not immediately respond to alcohol. When you drink too fast, your body does not have a chance to catch up. [9] X Research source For example, if you take 3 shots back to back, you may feel fine initially and then become lightheaded when you walk to the bathroom 30 minutes later. Try not to have more than 1 drink (i.e. 5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine, 12 fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 1 mixed drink, or 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) of hard liquor) per hour. Alternating drinks is another method you can use to pace yourself. Drink 1 cup of water or another non-alcoholic beverage for every alcoholic drink that you have."

      "title": "Do not exceed the daily limits.",
      "content": "Do not exceed the daily limits. Women should not drink more than 1 drink per day and men should not drink more than 2 drinks per day. A single drink is 12 fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 8 fl oz (240 mL) of malt liquor, 5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine, or 1.5 fl oz (44 mL) of liquor. You should also avoid binge drinking. Binge drinking is drinking 5 or more drinks on a single occasion if you are a man and drinking 4 or more drinks on a single occasion if you are a woman. [10] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you or anyone you know has a drinking problem call 1-800-662-HELP to get some help. Excessive drinking is associated with many health problems including cancer, high blood pressure, and unintentional injuries. If you are pregnant, do not drink. Alcohol can be harmful to your fetus."
