      "content": "Mix up a daily oatmeal face mask to provide soothing relief . For allergic reactions on the body, many people claim to find relief by soaking in baths sprinkled with finely-ground oatmeal. While you can try holding your breath and dunking your face in an oatmeal bath, consider an oatmeal face mask instead: Grind old-fashioned oats into a fine powder in a spice grinder or food processor, or buy colloidal oatmeal (which is already finely-ground for baths and masks) Stir together 1 tbsp (15 g) of the ground oatmeal, 1 tsp (5 g) of honey, and 1 tsp (5 g) of plain yogurt. Gently massage the mask onto your face right after washing and drying it. Rinse away the mask with clean water after 15-20 minutes. Repeat the process once daily as needed."

Take these measures even when it's cloudy outside. You're still being exposed to sunlight! Talk to your doctor or pharmacist for sunscreen recommendations."
