When you tap the Save to Files option on a file, you're prompted to choose a saving location. Depending on your settings, you'll have the option to save to On My iPhone , iCloud Drive , and possibly other cloud drives. If you downloaded a file this way, you'll find it in the Files app. If you're looking for a photo you saved from the web, an app, or a message, you'll probably find it in the Photos app, not the Files app. This is because when you save a photo, you're prompted to Add to Photos . The only way your photo will not show up in the Photos app is if you selected the Save to Files option instead of adding it to your photos."
