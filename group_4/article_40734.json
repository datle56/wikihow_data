Or, if you are starting a new life because you want a challenge and some excitement, then you might consider placing yourself in an unusual circumstance, such as living in a foreign country."

For example, if you are trying to rebuild your finances and you have a relative who has a tendency to be a bad financial influence, then you will need to determine if you should continue to interact with them moving forward."
