      "content": "Acknowledging her thoughts and feelings can help you figure out how to talk with her. Before you talk to her, ask yourself why she said what she said. Take a moment to consider how your mom is feeling or thinking. This can make your conversation easier. For example, you might think about your mother's childhood or how she was raised. Maybe she's dealing with trauma and doesn't know how to work through it. This might help you realize that her hurtful comments are more about her inability to cope than anything you actually did."

      "content": "Express yourself so your mom knows that you're hurt. It can be scary or overwhelming to approach your mom and discuss what she said, but it's a big step. Keep your calm and use a respectful tone of voice, so she's more likely to listen to you. Make sure you tell her why you're upset and what you'd like to see change. Use \"I\" statements when you talk to your mom, so she doesn't get defensive. For example, say, \"When you said you're disappointed in me, I felt worthless,\" or, \"I felt really stressed out when you said I don't help out enough.\" This can feel really hard or scary, but taking small steps—even just saying something short like, \"I feel terrible when you call me names,\"—tells her that her behavior is harmful. With practice, you can build up to longer, deeper conversations."

      "content": "Put emotional space between the two of you to protect your feelings. If your mom repeatedly hurts your feelings and says harmful, insensitive things, it might be time to put some emotional space between the two of you. Practice detaching —where you emotionally distance from what she says.

      "content": "Identify behaviors you want her to stop to give her consequences. You may not feel like you're in control of your relationship, but you can establish boundaries . Boundaries are for you—you're standing up for yourself and telling your mom that her behavior is unacceptable. You might say, \"If you can't talk to me without calling me names, then I can't interact with you,\" \"You can't verbally abuse me,\" or, \"You're not allowed to call me names.\" Your consequences could include refusing to respond to her or leaving the house. If you're setting boundaries to assert your independence, it's really important that you follow through on commitments that you make to your mom. For instance, if you tell her that you need free time to do stuff after school, but that you'll be home for dinner, make a point of showing up on time. This demonstrates your maturity."
