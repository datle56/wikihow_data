      "content": "Match the tie clip to the outfit. A metal tie clip in plain silver or gold is generally a safe, stylish choice. You may opt for a colored, textured, or embellished clip to add a little panache to your look. Consider how the clip could influence your outfit and show off your personality: a patterned clip can make a plain outfit more interesting, while a simple metal clip may tone down a busy-looking tie. Try to match the clip to the metal details of your outfit—a watch, jacket buttons, cufflinks, belt buckle. [1] X Research source If you don't have any metal to match (maybe you are skipping the jacket, so no buttons or cufflinks), go with silver. It compliments just about every outfit and complexion. [2] X Research source Keep the occasion in mind as well. A loud tie clip probably isn't appropriate for a sombre event like a funeral. Tie clips should not be worn with a vest, waistcoat, or buttoned cardigan. These items of clothing already hold your tie in place, making a clip redundant. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the type of clip (slide clasp or pinch clasp) based on the weight and width of the tie. A pinch clasp will ensure everything stays securely in place, but may cause a skinny or lightweight tie to wrinkle, and it may not lie flat against your shirt. Instead, opt for a slide clasp to keep your skinny tie smooth and flat. With wider and heavier ties, a pinch clasp will work best."

      "title": "Select a clip that is between 1/2 - 3/4 the width of your tie.",
      "content": "Select a clip that is between 1/2 - 3/4 the width of your tie. Never wear a tie clip that is longer than the width of your tie. It's considered a major fashion faux pas. [4] X Research source This is one of the only real \"rules\" when it comes to accessorizing with a tie clip. A traditional tie is about 3-3 1/2 inches at its widest point. Look for a tie clip that is about 1 3/4 inches long. [5] X Research source A classic skinny tie is usually between 2-2 1/2 inches wide. Your tie clip should be between 1 1/2 -1 3/4 inches. Super skinny ties are between 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 inches wide. Choose a clip no longer than 1 1/4 inches long. Try holding the clip against your tie where it falls at the third or fourth button of your shirt. If it looks too long, you'll need a different clip. [6] X Research source For a retro look, you can get away with a tie clip that is the exact width of your tie, but no longer. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Open the clip (if it's a pinch tie clip) and slide both the front and back of your tie, plus the placket of your shirt into the clip. (The placket is the strip of fabric that you button through). [8] X Research source All three should be sandwiched together in the clip. Make sure the tie is actually clipped to your shirt. The purpose of the tie clip is to keep your tie securely in place, so if you just slide the tie through the clip and don't anchor it to anything, your tie will still flap freely and get in your way."

      "content": "Clip the tie between the third and fourth buttons of your shirt, or around the middle or bottom of your sternum. Placement is the other \"rule\" of wearing a tie clip—too high makes the tie clip useless (your tie will still flop around or fall in your soup when you lean forward), too low looks awkward or hides the clip behind your jacket. [9] X Research source When adjusting the tie clip, make sure that it is un-clipped, so as not to stretch and damage the material of the tie and the dress shirt. Check that the tie clip is perpendicular to your tie. It should always be straight across, not angled up or down. [10] X Research source If necessary, adjust your tie so that it lies flat against your shirt with no bunching or puckering."

      "content": "Add a little flair by blousing the top of your tie. Take the top half of your tie and pull it up slightly, so that it's not pulled tight against your chest. It should puff up and forward slightly. This adds some depth and personality to your look, and may make the tie feel less constricting."
