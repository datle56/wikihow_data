      "content": "Mix together soft, liquid, and powdered ingredients to make the base. Choose your base ingredients and add them all to a bowl, then mix until everything is combined. Keep in mind that the Ninja Creami isn’t a regular blender, so it can't blend up big solid chunks. You’ll need to choose ingredients that are already liquid, blended, or mashed up so that your base has a smooth texture with no hard elements. [1] X Research source Here are some examples of ingredients you can use: Liquids: Milk, heavy cream, non-dairy milk, juice Soft or blended ingredients: Yogurt, softened cream cheese, pre-blended fruit Sweeteners: Agave syrup, maple syrup, sugar, stevia Powders and Flavors: Vanilla extract, cocoa powder, protein powder Hold off on adding any solid elements, like chocolate chips, cookie crumbles, nuts, or chunks of fruit at this point. Once the base is made, there’s a “Mix In” option you can use for these types of add-ins. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Pour your base into the pint, making sure it doesn’t go past the “MAX FILL” line marked on the side, then pop it into your freezer for 24 hours. Place the pint on a level surface in your freezer so that it freezes evenly. [4] X Research source If your base freezes unevenly or a bump forms on the top, don’t move on to the next step yet. Allow it to melt a bit, then smooth out the top and scrape off any big humps with a spoon. [5] X Research source"

Remove the lid from your frozen mixture and place the pint into the “outer bowl,” which is a larger container with a handle. Find the outer bowl lid, then hold the paddle latch on the top of the lid while inserting the Creamerizer Paddle (the blade) into the bottom of the lid, and release the latch to secure it. [6] X Research source Place this lid onto the outer bowl, making sure the lines on the lid and handle align, then rotate the lid clockwise to lock it. Finally, place the outer bowl onto the motor base, with the handle centered below the control buttons, then twist the handle to the right to lock into place (you’ll hear a click to let you know it’s installed properly).

At this point, all you need to do is press the button for the setting you want to use, and the machine will start. It’ll also stop automatically when it’s done. [8] X Research source Here’s a breakdown of some of the settings: Ice Cream: Best for traditional creamy ice cream recipes, including dairy and non-dairy variations. Lite Ice Cream: Good for health-conscious ice cream recipes that are lower in sugars or fats (such as keto or paleo ice cream). Sorbet: Designed to turn fruit-based recipes with higher water and sugar content into creamy sorbet. Smoothie Bowl: Works best with recipes that include blended fruits or vegetables mixed in with milk, milk alternatives, or juice. Milkshake: Designed to create a classic milkshake. To use this setting, all you need to do is add some milk to your favorite ice cream and then let the machine process it. [9] X Research source"

To do this, remove the outer bowl from the machine and remove the lid. Use a spoon to create a 1 ½ inch (3.8 cm) wide hole in the middle of the mixture, going all the way to the bottom of the pint. Add your mix-ins into this hole, then replace the lid and put the container back in the machine. Select the “MIX-IN” option and let the machine mix everything up. [10] X Research source For the best results, chop your mix-ins into smaller pieces before adding them to the mixture, or choose mix-ins that are already bite-sized. Possible mix-ins include: chopped nuts, chocolate chips, crumbled up cookies, cereal, frozen fruits, and a chocolate or caramel shell topping. [11] X Research source"

Just place the outer bowl back onto the machine, select “RE-SPIN,” and let the machine get back to work.

Some people have noticed that the edges of their frozen treat stay a bit icy after processing, sort of like a frozen crust around the pint. This happens because the blade doesn’t reach all the way to the container (if it did, you’d end up with plastic bits in your frozen treat!). To fix this, just run a spoon or a butter knife under hot water and use it to scrape the icy bits off the edge of the container. [20] X Research source Re-spin the ice cream one more time to mix it all in, and you should end up with a smooth mixture without that icy crust."

When you use your Ninja Creami, bits of your ingredients can easily get stuck in grooves and underneath the blade. It’s important to clean each of the attachable pieces of your machine thoroughly after each use to prevent build-up. Luckily, the parts are dishwasher safe, which makes clean-up pretty easy. [21] X Research source Make sure to remove the Creamerizer Paddle (blade) and the rubber lip seal from the outer bowl lid before cleaning since ingredients can get trapped under these parts. The container, lid, and paddle are all dishwasher-safe on the top rack only. Using the dishwasher is the best option to remove stuck-on ingredients. If you prefer to hand wash your components, use warm soapy water. Use a dishwashing utensil with a lid to wash the paddle to avoid hurting your hands. [22] X Research source"

Ultimately, if you’re a lover of homemade ice cream or other similar treats, the Ninja Creami could be a great purchase for you. We’ll go over a few pros and cons, though, in case you're still having trouble deciding. Pros: You can add whichever ingredients you want to make completely unique frozen treats You can easily make special recipes to accommodate allergies or special diets, such as dairy-free/vegan, paleo, or keto You can use the machine to make several different types of frozen treats (ice cream, sorbet, smoothie bowls, milkshakes, etc) The machine is convenient and easy to use once you get the hang of it The components are dishwasher safe, which makes clean-up pretty easy Cons: It’s a bit pricey ($219.95 for the deluxe model and $169.99 for the regular model) You’ll need to plan ahead to make your treat since the base needs to be frozen for 24 hours It can be a little intimidating to use the machine when you first get it, as there are a lot of rules/steps to follow The machine itself is pretty tall, heavy, and bulky, so you’ll probably need to store it on your kitchen counter, not inside a cabinet [23] X Research source"
