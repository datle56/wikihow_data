There are actually two different versions for mobile devices: Anki Pro and AnkiMobile Flashcards. The differences are as follows: Anki Pro: Anki Pro has a modern, user-friendly design. It has modern features, such as AI, text-to-speech, algorithm presets, advanced sharing options, online collaboration, and support. Anki Pro is free to download and use, but some features require a paid subscription. AnkiMobile Flashcards: AnkiMobile Flashcards has an older design because it is based on the original Anki source code. It's closer to the computer version of Anki and works great as a mobile companion app. It's not as user-friendly and doesn't have some of the modern features, like text-to-speech, advanced sharing and collaboration, and online support. You can only share by exporting your cards and sending them to someone. AnkiMobile may be more suited for experienced Anki users. AnkiMobile Flashcards is free to download on Android but has a one-time fee of $24.99 to download on iPhone."

The card types are as follows: [1] X Research source Basic: This creates a flash card with two fields for the front and back. Typically, you would put a question on the front and the answer on the back. Basic (and reversed card): This creates two separate cards with a front and back. This is useful for when you are studying a foreign language. You can create one card that has the English phrase and the translation on the back, then a separate card with the translation on the front and the English text on the back. Basic (optional reversed card): This is another way of creating a basic card and a reversed card. Instead of creating two separate cards with front and back answers, this will display a third \"Add reversed\" field where you can enter the text for your reversed field. The text you put in the \"Add reversed\" field will go on the front of the second card and the front text will go on the back of the second card. Basic (type in the answer): This creates another basic card with a front and back. However, when this card pops up, it will ask you to type in the answer. When the back is revealed, it will show you the actual answer compared to the text you entered. Cloze: Cloze cards allow you to enter a phrase and then select a part of the text that will be omitted when the card pops up. This is useful for studying historical dates or texts you need to memorize. For example, you could create a card that says \"The US Constitution was written in 1787\" and you could put \"1787\" in cloze text. When the card pops up, it would read \"The US Constitution was written in [...]\" and you would have to pick the correct date. Image Occlusion: This option allows you to upload an image and then use one of the draw tools to cover parts of the image you want to be quizzed on. This is useful if you are studying anatomy or various charts and graphs."
