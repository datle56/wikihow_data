      "content": "Dice one medium-sized apple to make a microwaved apple snack. Cut any variety of a washed, peeled, and cored apple into 6-8 bite-sized chunks of any shape to make a quick snack. You can chop the apples any way you like. If you want to eat them with a fork or mash them in a recipe, you can make them more square or irregularly shaped. If you want to serve them as finger foods, you'll want to chop them into longer slices for easier gripping."

      "content": "Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water to a microwave-safe dish with a cover. You don't want to add too much water when you steam in the microwave because the food sits directly in the water and can become mushy. 2 tablespoons (30 ml) is just enough to create steam for cooking the apples."

      "title": "Place the apples in the dish and microwave on high for 3 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the apples in the dish and microwave on high for 3 minutes. Make sure to cover the dish completely. This is important because the apples are cooked by the steam that gets sealed inside the dish. If you don't have a lid for your dish, you can place a microwave-safe plate on top as long it is about the same size and seals off the bowl. [1] X Research source Never use aluminum foil in the microwave because it will start a fire. Also, use only plastic wrap that carries a “microwave-safe” label on the packaging. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Check the apples every 30 seconds to see if they are tender.",
      "content": "Check the apples every 30 seconds to see if they are tender. If you leave the apples to cook for the full three minutes, they will be very soft. If you do not want them to be mushy, check them every 30 seconds by poking them with a fork to see how soft they are. For most uses, they are done when the fork pierces the apple easily. [3] X Research source If you are steaming the apples to soften them for serving to small children, don't cook them until they are very well done or they will be hard to hold and make a mess. For making a pie, leave the apples a little bit crisp since they are also going to baked inside the crust."

      "content": "Chop up 2-3 medium-sized apples into roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) chunks. To be able to steam the apples, you'll need the chunks to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and length. If they are much larger, they will not cook completely and if they are smaller, they might turn to mush in the basket. How you chop the apples depends on your recipe and what you want to do with them. To cut them for finger foods, cut them so they are a little elongated for gripping. For mashing or cooking in a recipe, you can chop them into rough shapes."

Make sure that the water does not reach the bottom of the steamer basket or your food will get watery and you will end up boiling it instead of steaming it.

Use a wooden or other heat safe spoon to spread them around and make sure they are evenly spaced throughout the basket. To cut cooking time, you can boil water first in an electric kettle .

Leave the cover in place to trap the steam and just let the apples cook. [6] X Research source If you do not hear the water bubbling, check to make sure the water has not evaporated.

      "content": "Slice 3 medium-sized apples of any variety and set aside. You'll want to roughly chop up about the apples into pieces that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. You can use more or less apples depending on your recipe and the size of your bamboo steamer. Choose how many apples based on the size of your steamer and how many tiers it has. You need to be able to spread the apples out in an even layer in each tier to cook them evenly and completely. How you chop them depends on your recipe and your preference. Smaller chucks of apples will be softer and easier to mash, while larger chunks will hold their shape better and remain a little crispy after being cooked."

Lining the inside of the basket will ensure that small pieces of apple do not fall through as well as make your clean up a breeze. If you don't have parchment paper you can also use aluminum foil.

If extra lining is hanging over the edge of the basket, fold it in over top of the apples, creating a packet. [11] X Research source Don't forget to secure the lid in place."

      "content": "Heat 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water over medium-high heat until it bubbles. You want enough water to create steam, but not too much so that it gets your food wet. For most bamboo steamers, 2 inches (5.1 cm) is perfect, but if you have a smaller steamer, just make sure the water is not high enough to reach the food in the steamer. [12] X Research source When choosing which pan to use, make sure the pan is wider than the bamboo steamer by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). This is because you do not want the bamboo steamer to touch the edges of the pan."

Also, make sure that your steamer does not touch the edge of the pan and that the entire bottom is in the water or it might burn or catch fire. [13] X Research source It's a good idea to use oven mitts whenever handling the steamer or working near boiling water to protect your skin from burns."

Just let it cook for about 30 minutes. They are steamed to perfection when pierced easily with a fork or knife. If you let them cook too long, they will turn to mush and won't be able to be lifted with a fork. You want the fork to pierce the apples easily, but not mash them."

When you have confirmed the apples are cooked, carefully remove the basket with covered hands and place on a cooling trivet. [14] X Research source You can leave the steamer in the pan and remove the pan from the heat if you are using a gas stove top. Then all you have to do is take the apples out of the steamer with tongs or a spoon and wait for the steamer to cool to remove it from the pan and clean it."

You can adjust how many apples you use based on the size of your pressure cooker. You can also leave the apples whole for steaming in the pressure cooker, but they will take a little longer to cook."

Double check that the water level is not higher than the cooker's steamer basket. [15] X Research source You can add more water, but it will take longer to come to pressure. If you have only added 1 cup (240 ml) of water but the water is still touching the basket, you need to lift the basket higher. Either use a stand or balls of aluminum foil to rest the basket on and keep it high enough."

      "content": "Arrange apples in a single layer in a steamer basket. It's important to make sure the apple pieces are evenly distributed in the basket so that they cook evenly. Use a spoon or spatula to stir them around until they are all in one layer. If your pressure cooker is big enough, you can stack two steamer baskets and put larger slices in the bottom and smaller ones in the top tier for even cooking."

[16] X Research source Depending on whether or not your steamer basket has legs, you might also need to put a stand below the basket to keep the apples out of the water. If you don't have a stand, you can use balls of aluminum foil to lift the basket out of the water."

Once the pot is sealed, plug it in, press the manual button on the control panel of the pressure cooker and set the timer for 6 minutes. [17] X Research source It will take a few minutes for the pressure to build. You will hear a hissing sound when the water starts to boil and when it goes quiet, that's when pressure has been reached and the timer will begin. If you opted to leave the apples whole instead of dicing them, cook for 8 minutes instead of 6 minutes."

      "content": "Release the pressure manually and check for doneness. After the timer goes off, stand back from the pressure cooker and give the release valve a quick flick with your thumb to either side to release the steam. The steam is very hot, so avoid any contact with your skin. To check for doneness, pierce gently with a fork. If the fork goes in easily, the apples are done. [18] X Research source It will take 10-15 seconds until all the steam has escaped and you can safely turn the lid and open the cooker. Electric pressure cookers have safety mechanisms built in so that they will not open until the pressure has been reduced inside to a safe level."
