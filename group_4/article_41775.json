Do a total of 2 to 4 finger threading stretches to relieve stiffness in your toe joints, balls of your feet, and fronts of your arches. Daily stretching is often beneficial and, for plantar fasciitis and other bone and joint issues, necessary. Try, for instance, threading your toes, rotating your ankles, and stretching your heels for 3 to 5 minutes before getting out of bed to get your feet ready for the day. While light, daily stretching is usually fine, ask your doctor or physical therapist how often you should stretch your feet, especially if you have bone, joint, or any other health issues."
