Studies have shown that when you have low self-esteem, you might inaccurately expect rejection from your partner, and decide to lash out first to defend yourself. This can cause major hurdles. With low self-esteem, you can also feel unlovable, which makes it difficult to feel secure with your partner.

They can help both you and your partner explain your feelings in the most constructive way possible, as well as find strategies to rebuild security in your relationship. [38] X Research source"
