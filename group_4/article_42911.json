If he gets excited and springs back up because of the treat, step back again and get him back into the sit position before continuing. Once he’s steady in the sit position, kneel or squat down to get closer to his level. [1] X Research source To get your dog to sit, hold a treat above their nose. As soon as their butt touches the ground, give them the treat. Once they can do this reliably, start saying the word \"Sit\" to help them associate it with the action.

He should follow the treat to the floor with his nose. Once his nose is to the floor, bring the treat back out along the floor toward you. If the dog pops up while luring him down, quickly snatch the treat away. Then immediately ask him to sit again, and start the luring process over again."

      "content": "Try this trick if he’s reluctant. Sit down in front of him with him on either your left or right side. Put your legs out along the floor, then raise them up so they look like a tent. Slowly move the treat down to the floor and then under your legs as he’s sniffing it. Move it out under your legs so he has to crouch down under them to get to it.

      "content": "”Catch” him in the behavior. If your dog is particularly resistant to the luring technique, you can reward “catching” him lying down on his own. Simply stand with your dog in a room and wait for him to lie down. The instant his body hits the floor, say “down,” use your clicker and throw a treat a few feet in front of him. He’ll have to stand up to go get the treat, so then you just wait for him to lie down again. Repeat the sequence until he seems to start connecting “down” with what you want him to do.

      "content": "Start using an empty hand but still giving a treat. This teaches your dog to know what he’s expected to do without having to actually see the treat. Practice saying “down” and luring him down to the floor, using the same “L” motion, but without a treat in your hand. Keep the treats nearby and give him one as soon as he lies down and stays, and be sure to give praise. If he refuses to lie down without seeing a treat, you can try this “fake out” trick: lure him into the lying down position with a treat just like in the first section quickly 4 times in a row. The last time, quickly do it without the treat. He will probably lie down, thinking you have a treat. As soon as he does, say your praise (“Yes!” or “Good dog!”) and open your hand to show him there’s no treat. Then give him 3 surprise treats. Start again practicing without the treats and only using the hand signal.

[16] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. For instance, if you sometimes pet your dog when he jumps up, but sometimes you yell at him, he’s bound to get confused about how you feel about the behavior. Don’t bury words like “sit” and “down” in complex sentences. When training, decide what word you will use for the action that you want, and use it clearly and consistently every time. Negative reinforcement doesn’t work! [17] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. If you hit your dog or yank his leash when he does something you don’t like, he may simply learn that you are scary and not connect his behavior with how he got hurt. It’s much easier to focus on what you want your dog to do (if he starts doing something you don’t like, you tell him to sit) than on what you don’t want him to do.

So if you only practice a new skill in the kitchen, you’ll have a wonderfully kitchen-trained dog. While you may want to start a new skill in a quiet room of your house, move to different locations as soon as he starts getting it.

This means that you should have patience with dog training, and accept that your dog has certain traits and behaviors (chewing, mouthing, roughhousing) that are just part of being a dog. You can deter some behaviors by not rewarding them, but this takes time and patience. If you are trying to prevent certain undesirable behaviors in your dog (like digging through the trash can), consider what you can do to prevent the behavior (like putting the can in a place where the dog can’t get to it) instead of setting unrealistic expectations on him.
