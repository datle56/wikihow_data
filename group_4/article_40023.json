      "content": "Stop drinking alcohol. If you need to sober up, the first thing to do, if you haven’t done it already, is to stop drinking. Each drink will take your body about an hour to metabolize, so until you stop putting more alcohol in your system, you have no chance of sobering up. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Simply put, the sooner you stop drinking, the sooner you will be able to sober up. If you are still out, but you decide you want to try and sober up, switch to water to help rehydrate yourself. If you start drinking water while you are still out, you may also lessen the effects of your forthcoming hangover."

      "content": "Eat something. Eating that kebab on the way home will not have a significant effect on your attempts to sober up. Research has shown, however, that drinking alcohol when you have an empty stomach does result in the body taking up to 45% longer to clear alcohol from your system, than if you had eaten a meal beforehand. Some researchers think that the liver is helped in its task to digest and clear alcohol after eating, because more blood flows to the liver when you have eaten. [2] X Research source Keep in mind that eating before drinking will only delay the alcohol getting into your bloodstream, not actually stop it."

      "content": "Have some fructose. Bats who eat fermented fruit can get drunk from the alcohol that is present in their food. Scientists, who study these bats, noted that the bats that ingest fructose after eating fermented fruit sober up faster than those that ingest glucose or sucrose-rich foods. While this doesn’t translate directly to humans, you can try to put together your own fructose snack to help you sober up. [3] X Research source Good sources of fructose are honey and fruits. Fresh fruit and dried fruit are both rich in fructose. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take some vitamins. When you drink alcohol you deplete the levels of vital vitamins in your body. In particular your levels of magnesium, vitamin C, and vitamin B-12 are depleted by alcohol consumption. One way to tackle this, and attempt to sober up, is to replace those lost vitamins. The most effective way to do this would be through an IV drip, with the relevant cocktail of vitamins, although of course this is not a possibility for most people. [5] X Research source More simply, you could take some vitamin tablets. You could consume food high in vitamins. For example, if you want to replenish your depleted vitamin C, you could eat a kiwi fruit or a grapefruit."

Some of these are based on replenishing depleted vitamins, and giving you a boost of fructose. For example, fructose-rich honey is one of the key in these products. The effectiveness of these products is open to question, but you might find they help you sober up faster. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Recognize that sobering up takes time. Although there are a number of methods cited to help sober up you, for the most part it is simply a matter of waiting for your body to process the alcohol. The human body needs an hour to metabolize the alcohol in one drink. One drink is equivalent to: [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A 12 oz beer. An 8-9 oz malt liquor drink. A 5 oz glass of wine. A 1.5 oz drink of hard liquor. If you are mixing drinks, they may be stronger than one serving of alcohol."

Some of these you will have some influence over, others you won’t. The rate at which you process alcohol will vary depending on: Your health. Your size. Whether you drank on a full or empty stomach. The speed at which you drank. Your tolerance level. Whether you are also taking any drugs, including prescription or over-the-counter medications.

These actions might wake you up and give you the feeling that you are more alert, but they won’t contribute to the rate at which your body processes the alcohol. Your body does not regulate temperature as well when you are drunk, so if you have a cold shower you may feel cold afterwards. A cold shower is a considerable shock to your body, especially when you have been drinking heavily. The shock of the cold water can cause you to lose consciousness, which is very dangerous in the shower.

You may feel more awake or more composed, but your body will still be processing the alcohol at the same speed. If you go for a long walk and feel more sober afterwards, it has more to do with the time that has passed than the activity of walking itself.

      "content": "Know that forcing yourself to vomit will not make you sober. If you are drunk and you think you can vomit out the alcohol and thus sober up quicker, think again. Once the alcohol has reached your small intestine, vomiting will not expel it. It might reduce the amount of alcohol in your stomach, but it won’t change the amount you have already absorbed. The amount you have absorbed is what you are trying to sober up from. Vomiting will not lower your blood alcohol level faster. Do not encourage somebody who is semi-conscious to vomit, as this could be dangerous. Vomit can cause choking and/or asphyxiation."

If being around certain people makes you want to drink, then you may need to limit your time with these people or try to avoid them for a while. For example, if you have a friend who drinks heavily and encourages you to do the same, then you might want to cut down on the time you spend with this friend. If you find it hard to go to a bar and not have a drink, then you may want to avoid bars for a while. Try asking your friends and family to meet you for dinner somewhere that does not serve alcohol, or arrange to meet them for coffee or breakfast for a while. If you find that your desire to drink is stronger when you are feeling stressed, then you may benefit from learning some relaxation techniques , such as deep breathing , meditation , or progressive muscle relaxation ."
