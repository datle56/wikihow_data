This experience can be pretty embarrassing, but try not to beat yourself up about it. It can be hard to keep track of names , especially if you’re in a situation where you’re meeting a lot of new people! For a minor faux pas like this, a simple, sincere apology is usually all that’s needed to smooth things over. [3] X Research source If you know you’ve forgotten someone’s name, simply apologize and ask them to remind you of it sooner rather than later. This helps avoid any awkward encounters in the future.

Shaking hands and introducing yourself are common social norms when meeting someone for the first time, and failing to do so would be an example of a faux pas. [5] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source For example, if you arrive at a dinner party and fail to introduce yourself to the attendees you’ve never met before, this would be considered a social blunder.

[6] X Research source Many people view this behavior as an indication that you aren’t paying attention to what they’re saying, which can come across as disrespectful or rude. Put your phone on silent or vibrate when you’re having a conversation with someone, and avoid checking or scrolling through it while they’re talking."

      "content": "Oversharing when you’ve just met someone. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of someone oversharing, you know it can be an awkward experience. Sharing too many personal details too early on in a relationship is a common faux pas that can make others feel pretty uncomfortable. To avoid this social blunder, ask yourself whether or not something is TMI before sharing it with a new acquaintance. [7] X Research source An example of oversharing would be relating all the details of a recent break up with someone you’re meeting for the first time. Usually, this type of openness would be more appropriate once you’ve gotten to know the person better."

Examples of engaged body language include facing the other person and making eye contact. Other active listening skills include asking the other person thoughtful questions, and making sure you take equal turns talking.

If you’re at a gathering and happen to know one of the attendees better than the others, don't spend too much time talking about things only this person would understand. Monopolizing the conversation with inside jokes or references to past experiences will likely make the other members of the group feel left out. This social faux pas can hurt the group dynamic and create an awkward energy. Research shows that, when group connection is the goal, it’s important to tell jokes that everyone can understand, rather than inside jokes.

[12] X Research source For example, a humble-brag could be something like, “Getting that big raise at work has been stressful—I have more money than I know what to do with!” Humble-bragging will likely leave others rolling their eyes, so it’s best to avoid this faux pas. If you’re proud of something you’ve achieved recently, simply share the news with others and invite them to celebrate with you. Research shows that regular bragging comes across as more genuine than humble-bragging, so it ends up being more positively received by others. [13] X Research source"

In these situations, someone usually offers to put down their card for the whole table and asks everyone to send money for their portion. Letting these unpaid debts linger is a major social faux pas. Try not to wait so long to pay your friend back that they have to chase you down and ask you multiple times for the money—this tends to be awkward for all involved."

In this situation, you’re likely inconveniencing the host, who may still be busy setting up the decor, cooking the food, or getting dressed for the party. When you’re invited to an event, try to show up no earlier than 15 minutes before the start time (and no later than 15 minutes after the start time). [15] X Research source"

[16] X Research source For example, if all the other guests of a dinner party have left, and the host is starting to take down the decor and wash the dishes, it’s probably time to make your exit. Try to pay attention to your host’s social cues to discern whether or not it’s time to go. If your host is making comments about how early they need to get up tomorrow morning, for example, this may be a hint that they’re ready for the night to come to an end."

Arriving at a birthday party without a gift is usually seen as a social faux pas (unless the person being celebrated has specified that they don’t want gifts). Don’t worry if you can’t spend a large amount on a gift—it’s the thought that counts, and the important thing is showing the other person you care! Flowers, a handmade craft, or a thoughtful, handwritten note are great, cost-efficient birthday gift options."

The most infamous social faux pas regarding dress code would probably be wearing white (or any color close to white) to a wedding if you’re not the bride. [17] X Research source Another example would be wearing a sweatshirt and sweatpants to a job interview or a formal dinner party. When in doubt about the dress code for an event, reach out to the host for guidance, or check the invitation. Wedding invitations, for example, will often contain dress code instructions regarding colors to avoid and the level of formality."

For example, if a serious world event has just occurred, a post about what you had for breakfast might be seen as insensitive. Or, if a friend lets you know that they don’t like the way they look in a photo you took together, it would be a faux pas to post it anyway. When you’re making a post to social media, think about how it might make others feel. Be sure to consider the emotions of friends and loved ones to avoid any unintentional misunderstandings or tensions."
