      "content": "Wait for a time when he feels happy and secure. If your guy is stressed out over work or school, dealing with family issues, or preoccupied with a personal crisis, he probably won't be all that receptive to a big new development in your relationship. There is no \"perfect moment,\" so don't wait for one. A low-key, quiet moment without stress is always a good opportunity. There are, however, bad times to talk about love: After sex. While intoxicated. Over text or the phone. During or after a fight or argument."

      "content": "Find a quiet, private location to talk. Is there a special place that brings up strong memories for the both of you? You may want to tell him at the place where you had your first date, or where you went out to dinner for your two-month or six-month anniversary. That said, all that really matters is that you have a place to talk without being interrupted constantly. Ask him to go for a walk with you, help with a basic chore, or simply \"come over to talk with me for a few minutes.\" You don't have to plan to be at a cheesy \"rom-com\" setting like an ocean cliff, but it shouldn't be in a dirty alleyway either."

      "content": "Keep it simple and from the heart. Don't try a big gesture or romantic setting -- this isn't the time and chances are good it will backfire. What matters are you and your feelings. So don't overthink things. Speak from the heart and have an open conversation, not some big production. Just start talking honestly about your relationship -- how happy he makes you, good memories you've shared, your own feelings -- to bring up the topic of love organically. [1] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 1174 wikiHow readers, and 57% of them agreed that the memory they cherish the most about their relationship is the moment they first met their partner or felt sparks fly . [Take Poll] So, this is a great memory to bring up when you tell him you love him!"

Say it any way you feel comfortable, since the words themselves are what really matter. Make eye contact, smile bravely, and be the astounding, honest, and loving person you already are. Remember-- simpler is sweeter. If you're shy and unsure what to do, try out these methods: \"I'm in love with you.\" \"Joe, I want you to know that these past eight months have been some of the happiest of my life. I feel like we've connected on a deep level and every day we spend together is better than the last. I love you.\" \"I've had something on my chest for a while, and it feels good to let it out. I love you.\" Lean in, and kiss him on the cheek, then whisper in his ear quickly, \"I love you.\""

      "content": "Tell him how your feel over distance with a thoughtful letter or phone call. If you can't meet in person, but still need to get your feelings off of your chest, there is nothing decreeing that you can't say \"I love you\" anyway. The reason face-to-face is nicer is that it is much more personal -- but you can make long-distance conversations personal. Instead of a text message, or signing off with an ambiguous \"I love you,\" take the time to write a letter or email that has the only purpose of expressing your love. It doesn't have to be long, just from the heart. Let them know that you'd rather talk to them in person, but couldn't keep your feelings secret any longer. Elaborate a bit on a story, event, or emotion that lead you to your feelings of love. Let him know that you don't need an immediate response; you just wanted to let him know how you felt.

If you make an effort to show you love once a day, whether with a good-night \"I love you\" or by simply putting his toothpaste on his brush for him, you'll keep the relationship strong for a long time. If you're worried about showing your affection, just think about finding one time a day where you can. Even an extra-long, passionate kiss is a great way to slow down time with your man for a half-second. [3] X Research source"

If you're someone who struggles a bit with showing affection, try these little techniques to let someone know you care: Hold or squeezing hands Make plans together for the future, even just future dates Introduce your friends and/or family Surprise him with kisses, hugs, and affection Give compliments, encouragement, and admiration.

Remember -- you fell in love as separate people with separate lives -- you need to preserve some of this independence to stay happy and in love. Don't feel like you need to talk or check in constantly to show how much you care. Sometimes giving each other some free time is the best way to show you know and love someone. [4] X Research source"

The most in-love couples have arguments too, and you need to air them out openly and honestly to keep your love alive. So don't feel like you're destroying your love, or going back on your word, if you bring up a disagreement or issue -- you're just showing your love in another way. Don't ever let a partner get you to do something you don't want to to \"prove your love.\" Love doesn't need to be proven. [5] X Research source"

Everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to saying \"I love you.\" There are those that say it after every phone call and those that only save it for special moments, and there is everything in between. So don't worry about how often you should say \"I love you,\" or how often you hear it -- people are different, and show their love in different ways. [6] X Research source These words mean much more when you mean them. If you only say \"I love you\" when you're feeling full of love, you'll both be much happier."

You can pause, smile, and start talking about something else, indicate that the moment is over by saying “Just thought you should know.\" You can even tell him you don't need to hear anything back, letting him know he should take some time to think things over. The less you come across like you're trying to extract a particular response from him the likelier he'll be to give you the one you want – if not immediately, eventually, when he realizes what a lucky guy he is. When talking, try to phrase everything personally -- \"I realized I love you,\" \"I fell for you, etc.-- instead of using language like \"we\" and \"us.\""

Because guys aren't always encouraged to communicate their thoughts and feelings, it's extra important to make them feel like they have someone to confide in. Be an active listener by reading between the lines, waiting for him to finish before you respond, and digging in with further questions. Avoid tying whatever he says back to yourself. You've told him you love him, now be patient as he works through his own emotions. Some silence, though it may feel awkward, is not a bad thing. He may be a bit shocked and need time to digest the news -- don't feel like one of you must always be talking."

Telling someone you love them in just another step in your relationship, not the end of the line. The important thing is treating him like you love him, not just saying the words. Keep talking regularly, having open and honest conversations about your relationship. Don't feel the need to tell him you love him every day now -- actions speak louder than words."

But it is also a powerful word, and you shouldn't throw it around with your man unless you're sure you mean it. This doesn't mean you need to write a thesis on your feelings. But you do need to ask yourself what you hope to gain by telling him you love him. If he's already said \"I love you,\" and you know you feel the same, feel free to come out and say it. If your relationship is strong, and you know him and yourself well, it might be time to say \"I love you.\" If you're convinced you're in love, and need to tell him so, then trust your instincts and say it. If you want to tell him just to see if he'll say \"I love you\" back, or because you feel pressured to say it, don't. Love is something you give to others, it doesn't expect or need someone else's response. If you're just friends, but want more, you should consider asking him out before saying you love him."

This will also give you a great chance to gauge his own feelings towards you. More likely than not, if you love him then he will feel some attraction back towards you. Just focus on letting go and having fun -- love is not about forcing your feelings -- so take your time and build a relationship. At the end of the day, this is about you confidently telling him how you feel. If you're not sure if he likes you back, that is okay! That's why you want to tell him your own feelings.

A big reason many people won't say \"I love you\" is that they're afraid the partner doesn't feel the same way. At the end of the day, it comes down to speaking your mind and feelings honestly. However, if you're a little worried: Ask a mutual, trusted friend if they can see you two dating. Talk to one of his friends and see if he is interested in anyone right now.

Imagine yourself in a similar situation -- you have a friend you like who suddenly tells you they are in love. You'd be at a loss for words, to say the least. So don't jump right to love -- take your time exploring your feelings together.

If you feel overwhelmed with affection, feel your stomach flip every time you see him, and want to blurt out \"I love you!\" at every turn, chances are good you're head over heels in love. But, as strong as the feeling is, avoid the temptation to immediately tell anyone. Instead, sit back and enjoy the rush of love for a few days. Show yourself that this isn't just a crush, this is the real thing. If you still feel like you love him, then get ready to make your move. If you don't still feel attached to him after the a few days, then you had a crush, not love. Love stays around for a long while."

The reasons are fuzzy (\"evolutionary advantage for men who create commitment early on\") or made up (\"women who say it first seem overly needy\"), but there is something to be said for tradition. Like it or not, some men are weirded out when a woman says \"I love you\" first. This shouldn't keep you from expressing your feelings, but it is worth considering. [9] X Research source"
