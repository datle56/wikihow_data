[8] X Research source If you don’t have insurance or a membership, most states have emergency highway response systems that provide assistance for free–find their phone number on your local department of traffic (DOT) website. [9] X Research source If you don’t have cell service, flag down someone on the road. Ask them to bring you gas or make a phone call for you. Use your best judgment when approaching strangers, and be cautious if someone insists on giving you a free ride! Alternatively, have a friend or family member bring you gas or call roadside assistance on your behalf. If all else fails, walk to a nearby gas station and bring gas back to your car."

Gas acts as a lubricant and cooling agent for the fuel pump, so your fuel pump overheats when your gas tank is empty (and only air is passing through). [12] X Research source If you’re low on fuel, avoid driving at high speed. You increase the likelihood of your fuel pump being unable to deliver enough fuel to your engine. [13] X Research source Consistently running your car low on fuel increases the likelihood of burning out your fuel pump and leading to engine failure.

      "content": "If the vehicle is powered by diesel, the fuel system will need to be bled in order for the engine to restart. All diesel engines have two fuel pumps: the low-pressure lift pump draws fuel from the tank and brings it to the high-pressure injector pump. If the lift pump pushes air into the injector pump, the system will become air-locked, preventing fuel from getting to the injectors. To bleed the system, start by cracking open a bleed screw atop the fuel filter. Run the fuel pump (either with the key on the on position or by cranking) until fuel sprays out of the screw. Then close it. Next, back off all the fittings on the lines connected to the fuel injectors. Crank the engine until fuel sprays out of each injector, then tighten the fittings back down. Pulling a decompression valve, if present, will save battery power during this process by making the engine easier to turn over."
