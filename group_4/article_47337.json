      "content": "Decide how to prepare the rice water. You can make rice water by boiling rice, soaking rice, or fermenting soaked rice water. Which type you pick will depend on how much time you have and how you want to use the rice water. Boiling your rice will create a concentrated batch of rice water, so it’s stronger. You will need to mix it with clean water when you use it. [2] X Research source Soaking your rice is the simplest method because you have fewer steps and don’t need to attend your rice water while it’s soaking. Because it’s not concentrated, you may run out faster. Fermenting your rice water takes the most time, but the fermentation process brings out more vitamins and nutrients."

Bring the water to a boil. Pour in your rice, cover the container, and then cook it on medium-low heat for 15-20 minutes. Allow your boiled rice to cool before handling it."

You will also not need to dilute your rice water if you soak your rice. Be sure to cover the container while the rice is soaking. If you plan to ferment your rice water, soaking the rice is the best way to prepare the rice water before fermentation."

Allow your rice water to sit for 1-2 days uncovered. When it begins to smell sour, place it into the refrigerator to stop the fermentation process. Dilute fermented rice water with 1–2 cups (240–470 ml) of clean water because it is very potent. [5] X Research source"
