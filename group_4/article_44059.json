      "content": "Let your profile stand out by crafting a unique bio. Want to make potential matches stop in their tracks (or their swipes)?

      "content": "Tell potential matches what you’re here for with a saucy bio. Are you on Tinder for a hookup , not necessarily a relationship? A suggestive bio will certainly let your matches know. Go for a funny, flirty, and simple line to tell your matches what you’re looking for. “Last night, I spooned myself some ice cream. Tonight I’d rather spoon you.” “Not into casual hookups, only into competitively ranked hookups.” “I’ll be Burger King, you be McDonald’s. I’ll have it my way, and you’ll be lovin’ it.” “Happy to Netflix and chill, Hulu and feel you… or whatever app you prefer.” “When I was little, I wanted to be a pirate. To this day, I’m obsessed with finding good booty.”"

      "title": "Keep your bio short and sweet.",
      "content": "Keep your bio short and sweet. People swiping through Tinder see dozens (if not hundreds) of bios per day, and they probably don’t want to stop and read a novel. When you’re writing your bio, keep it between 1 to 2 lines. If someone wants to learn more, they’ll message you! [5] X Research source Tinder gives you a 500 character limit for your bio, but you should aim to use way fewer than that."

    {
      "title": "Showcase your lifestyle and hobbies.",
      "content": "Showcase your lifestyle and hobbies. Your Tinder profile is all about the star of the show: you! Make a good Tinder profile by picking photos and writing a bio that shows off who you are and what you like to do. The more you can let your personality shine through in your profile, the better. If you’re outdoorsy, you might put up a few pics of you hiking or backpacking. If you love animals, post a few photos of you and your favorite furry friend."

    {
      "title": "Use clear photos that make you feel confident.",
      "content": "Use clear photos that make you feel confident. As your potential matches swipe through your profile, they’re basing their right swipe on the pics and the bio that you’ve chosen. To get more matches , choose clear, non-blurry photos that show you in your best light. Include a couple selfies , a couple pics of you alone, and a pic or two of you and your friends. [6] X Research source Group photos are okay too, but make sure your first picture is just you and you alone. That way, people swiping can tell who you are."

    {
      "title": "Be transparent about why you’re on the app.",
      "content": "Be transparent about why you’re on the app. Are you looking for a hookup? A long-term relationship? A FWB situation? Let people on Tinder know what you’re looking for to weed people out fast. You don’t have to put it in your bio, but as you chat and message people, it’s good to mention what you’re looking for so you’re both on the same page. While Tinder is generally known as a hookup app, you can totally find a long-term partner there if that’s what you’re looking for."
