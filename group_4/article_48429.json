      "title": "What you share with your boss is entirely up to you.",
      "content": "What you share with your boss is entirely up to you. Some people feel comfortable sharing why they’re missing work, while others prefer to keep their reasons private. 33,000 cisgender women were asked in a survey if they’ve told their bosses they’ve called in sick because of their period. Only 20% of those women said they had.

Would it be possible to work from home today?” “I can’t come into the office due to a menstrual cycle issue.

I'll make sure I get to work early tomorrow to catch up on what I've missed.” “Can’t make today’s meeting. Had to schedule a doctor's appointment since I'm feeling under the weather.
