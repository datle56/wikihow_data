      "content": "Use gentle hair products. When you notice your hair is thinning, making the switch to all-natural, gentle hair products is a good idea. Many shampoos, conditioners, hair sprays and other products contain chemicals that are hard on the scalp and hair and can speed up hair loss and damage the hair that's left. Use shampoo that doesn't contain sulfates or any type of alcohol. These ingredients are very drying and damaging to hair. Look for conditioner that doesn't contain silicones. These weigh down the hair and require sulfate shampoos to rinse out. Look in health food stores for hair styling products made with natural ingredients."
