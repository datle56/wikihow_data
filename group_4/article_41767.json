Bend your knees and rest your feet so they’re flat against the floor. Squeeze your glutes as tightly as possible and hold that position for about 45 seconds. Repeat this stretch 5 times.

      "content": "Ice the area to relieve soreness and reduce inflammation after a workout. Get an icepack and put it over the most irritated area. Make sure there’s a layer between your skin and the ice pack, whether that’s clothing or a washcloth wrapped around the pack. Either sit on the icepack or lay on your stomach and rest it on your upper hamstrings—whichever is most comfortable for you! Ice the area for 10-15 minutes at a time for relief. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your hamstrings have several tendons that attach the muscles to the bottom of your pelvis. Some activities, like running and jumping, really strain the area where the muscle connects to bone. Your hamstrings may also be irritated if you sit or drive for long periods of time."

      "content": "Lessen irritation by sitting on soft cushions rather than hard surfaces. It may be uncomfortable to sit on a hard seat while your upper hamstrings are healing from overuse. Choose a softer seat whenever possible; if you need to, put down a chair cushion on a harder surface to make it more comfortable. If you work in an office, try switching between sitting and standing throughout the day. This can help manage your discomfort while helping you move around a little more so your muscles don’t get stiff."

      "content": "Stay active with workouts that don’t stress your upper hamstrings. While you’re recovering from a sore hamstring-gluteal situation, don’t give up on exercising. Avoid targeted movements that cause pain, as well as the activity that caused the soreness to begin with. Upper-body strength training, swimming, walking, rowing, and other similar exercises should be safe for you to do. Keeping active helps your hamstrings and glutes from getting too stiff."

However, overusing these muscles when they’re sore or painful will make your recovery time that much longer. [5] X Research source Most often, this type of upper hamstring pain is caused by running, kicking, or jumping. It’s often experienced by people who run long distances or on uneven terrain. Soccer players also experience it more often than other athletes because of all the kicking and jumping they do. If you’re a runner, you may still be able to run while you’re recovering. Try slowing down your pace and jogging on flat terrain. Just pay attention to your body and stop if your upper hamstrings start aching or throbbing."
