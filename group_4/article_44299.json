      "content": "Know who you’re transferring to. Western Union is a popular way for scam artists to receive money from their victims, so be absolutely sure that you know the person that you are sending the money to, and that you trust what the money is for. [1] X Research source Western Union has the following guidelines on when not to send money: Never send money to a grandchild, family member, or friend for an emergency situation that you haven’t personally confirmed through a reliable source. Never send money to someone you just met online. Never use Western Union for internet purchases (there is no guarantee that the person will send the purchased goods to you). Never send money through Western Union for an employment opportunity or to claim \"lottery winnings\". You will often be prompted via email to send money to West African countries, such as Nigeria or Ghana in these situations. Remember that unsolicited emails are often scams - you did not win a lottery and you weren't selected by a \"prince\" to receive millions of dollars. [2] X Research source Never send Western Union transfers for purchases or sales on sites like Craigslist.com. Sometimes, a buyer will claim to purchase something you have put up for sale and send a check for more than the price. They will then ask you to send a Western Union transfer for the difference. This is a common scam. [3] X Research source"
