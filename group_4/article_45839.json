If you're using an older version of Adobe Photoshop that doesn't open to a Welcome screen, click the File menu and select New to create a new image. If you want to open an existing image from your computer, select Open instead to browse for the file."

      "title": "Choose your canvas dimensions.",
      "content": "Choose your canvas dimensions. The canvas is your working area, and you can make it any size you'd like. It can be helpful to start with a blank document preset, which you can browse using tabs at the top of the window. These presets are organized by image type, and contain options for the most common sizes and resolutions for different types of projects. For example, if you're creating an A5-sized image to print, click the Print tab and select A5 . You can also manually adjust the dimensions and resolution using the \"Preset Details\" panel on the right side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change the resolution.",
      "content": "Change the resolution. Resolution determines how many pixels will be in one square inch of the image. The more pixels in an inch, the more detailed the image will be. If you chose a blank document preset, just keep the resolution the same unless you know you need to specify it exactly. If you plan to print your image and didn't choose one of the Print presets, you'll want to increase the resolution to at least 220 ppi (or 300 ppi for best results). [1] X Research source 300 ppi is Adobe's default print resolution. A higher number of pixels per inch (ppi) will also result in a larger file. Larger files require more processing power from your computer and take longer to download, so avoid 300 ppi unless you'll just be printing the image. Standard web resolution is 72 ppi. When creating for the web, focus on dimensions (height and width) rather than ppi—increasing the ppi beyond 72 for a web-based image will not make it look any different in a web browser. Choose a resolution you'll want to keep—you can't increase the resolution later without degrading the image's quality."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose your color mode.",
      "content": "Choose your color mode. The color mode determines how the colors will be calculated and displayed. Choosing a preset also automatically selects your color mode, but you may need to change it depending on what you're creating. This is one setting which can be changed after the image has been created without too much consequence. RGB Color is the standard color mode. This is appropriate for images which will be viewed on a computer, as well as most printed documents. CMYK Color is another common color mode, but usually only used for printing. It will probably be best to create your image in RGB first and then convert it to CMYK before printing, since your computer will automatically display RGB colors. Grayscale is another common option and is pretty much exactly what it sounds like—instead of working with colors, you'll be working with shades of gray. With any color mode, the higher the number of bits, the more colors will be able to be displayed. Increasing the bits will also increase the file size, so only use a higher number if absolutely necessary."

      "title": "Select your background.",
      "content": "Select your background. This will mainly determine if your starting canvas is a solid color or transparent. A white canvas, which is the default for most projects, will make it easier to see what you are doing. A transparent canvas can make it easier to apply effects and produce backgroundless web images. You may want to start with a transparent background, which you can then color white. You can then create every other image element on their own separate layers above the background—when you erase the white background later, you'll have a transparent background, and the best of both worlds."

Layers allows you to separate aspects of your image, including filters and color changes, into pieces that can be edited separately. Edits on one layer will only affect that layer (though layer modes can affect how the layers interact). Layers are stacked on top of each other to form the final image, and you can rearrange, combine, and adjust the layers as needed. When you create or open a new image, you start with one layer—the Background layer. Note the layer called \"Background\" in the Layers panel."

When you create a layer this way, you'll be asked to name the layer and choose some parameters, which will be helpful once you learn more about Photoshop. A third way to create a new layer is to press Shift + Command + N on a Mac, or Shift + Control + N on a PC.

These tools allow you to select parts or all of your image. Once you've selected something, you can copy, edit, or remove it as needed. You can see when something is selected largely by the “marching ants” which enclose it. To deselect and get rid of the marching ants, press Control + D (PC) or Command + D (Mac). Be aware that the selection is dependent on the active layer. The marquee tools allow you to make selections with a set shape. Rectangular marquee is the default, but you can also choose Elliptical marquee for a round selection. This tool is used in much the same way that you select files on your computer, by clicking and dragging.

You'll need try to stay as close to the border of the object as possible, as everything you trace around will become part of the selection. The polygon lasso is similar but requires you to click to create anchor points rather than clicking and dragging. The third option is the magnetic lasso, which helps you follow the edge of an object. Click and drag around the object you want to select like using the regular (main) lasso tool—when you're finished, double-click the starting point to make the selection magically cling to the edges of the object. All three lasso tools require you to close the selection after tracing around it. Do this by clicking at the starting point (you will see a little circle appear next to your cursor).

[4] X Research source Clicking the tool on the selection will select like-pixels (pixels which are similar in color). You can change how picky it is about the color by increasing or decreasing the tolerance. This will allow you to select only particular areas or entire objects. Object Selection: Choose this selection tool to easily select an object. You can then click the rectangular marquee or lasso in the toolbar that runs along the top of the screen to choose a selection shape, and then trace around the object using that shape. When you lift your finger from the mouse, Photoshop will automatically select the object inside. Quick Selection: The quick selection is probably the most common and most useful selection tool for editing areas of an image. It is a combination of the magic wand and magnetic lasso tools.

Brushes are highly adjustable through the brush menu and come in a variety of preset shapes. You can download more brush presets for free or at a cost from a variety of sources on the web. Adjust the size, hardness, and opacity of your brush using the tools at the top of the workspace. A bigger brush will fill a larger area, a harder brush will give cleaner lines, and lowering the opacity will allow you to layer colors to gain more control.

Blur: This loosens and diffuses pixels, making everything you touch with the tool more blurry. How much more blurry will depend on the strength that you have chosen in the menu at the top. Sharpen: This does the opposite of blur, tightening and consolidating pixels. Use sparingly, as it can be a rather crude tool.

With these, you will brighten highlights and darken lowlights directly on the image. Since this affects the actual pixels of the image, try duplicating the layer and locking the original layer. This makes it so you avoid damaging the original image. To duplicate a layer, right-click it and select Duplicate Layer . You can change which type of tones your dodge or burn tools are changing, as well as what your sponge tool does, using the options on the top menu.
