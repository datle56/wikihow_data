      "content": "Massage the twitch with light pressure. Relax the twitching muscle as much as possible and use your fingers to gently push and rub circles over the center of the twitch. Target any other stiff or tender areas, too. This will help release tension, provide relief from the twitching, and return range of motion. [1] X Research source Massaging also increases blood flow and oxygen to your muscles which helps them relax and stop spasming."

      "title": "Stretch",
      "content": "Stretch twitching muscles in the opposite direction of their contraction. Hold stretches for 10-30 seconds at a time, giving yourself breaks in between if more than one is needed. Only stretch as far as is comfortable—pushing past your limit might result in injury (and won’t stop the twitch).

Slowly curl them into a loose fist, hold for a few seconds, then open them again (repeat 5-10 times). [3] X Research source Thumbs: Make a “thumbs up” position and rotate your thumb in circles for a few seconds, then switch directions (repeat 3-4 times). Arms and shoulders: Pull the twitching arm across your chest and hold it in place with your opposite hand. Repeat 3 times for 30 seconds each.

If you’re in bed, sit up, loop a blanket around your toes, and pull. [5] X Research source Shins and front ankle tendon: Stand up, put your weight on your toes, and lift your heels. Hamstrings: Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you. Slide your hands down your legs until you feel tension in the muscle. Hold for 30 seconds. [6] X Research source Back: Perform Child’s Pose —kneel and sit on your knees, then lean forward so your buttocks are resting on your heels and your forehead’s on the floor. Neck: Tilt one ear downwards towards your shoulder until you feel a stretch in the side of your neck. Rest with your head upright and repeat as needed. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Drink 2 ⁄ 3 cup (160 mL) of pickle juice . Down the juice and let it hit the back of your throat. The acetic acid stimulates a throat reflex that decreases activity in the alpha motor neurons, which causes muscle relaxation. If you hate pickle juice, you don’t even have to swallow it! [8] X Research source Twitches, cramps, or spasms will probably stop 3-4 minutes after drinking the juice. Pickle juice also improves your electrolyte balance, which can help prevent twitches in the future. No pickle juice on hand? Try eating a banana instead—the potassium will help stop twitching, especially in small muscles like your eyelids or lips.

      "content": "Apply ice or heat if the twitch is painful. Use cold therapy if the twitch includes acute pain—wrap the muscle in a towel and gently apply a cold compress or bag of ice. If the muscle is sore or tense, use heat—apply a heating pad on a low setting, or stand in the shower with a gentle stream of warm water spraying the twitching muscle. [10] X Research source Limit hot and cold treatments to 15-20 minutes at a time (repeating every 2 hours if needed). Never apply ice directly to your bare skin."

If your twitch is accompanied by inflammation or pain, try using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). Always read the warning label on NSAIDs or other medications if you’re on a prescription and not sure if you should mix medicines. [11] X Research source NSAIDs will treat pain if you have it, but may not stop the actual twitching or treat the underlying cause."

      "content": "Wait for the twitching to pass if nothing else works. Get in a comfortable position if you’re in pain—most of the time, twitches are more bizarre or uncomfortable than painful, but experiences range from small ticks to tight cramps. Most twitches only last for a few seconds or minutes before going away on their own. [12] X Research source A twitch or spasm might recur a few times before it goes away for good. Twitching after you work out is normal since your muscles are just trying to release tension. [13] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 12 January 2023."

Try to keep your schedule consistent by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. [16] X Research source Take time to rest during the day, too. If you need to nap, do it early so it doesn’t interfere with your sleep schedule. Restful sleep balances your cortisol and other hormone levels, which relaxes your nervous system and makes twitching less likely. [17] X Research source"

Exercise regularly, eat a diet with lots of produce and whole grains, and avoid excessive smoking or drinking to release physical stress. Try meditating or yoga to focus your breath and clear your mind. Schedule time to connect with your loved ones and make a point to laugh more—it’s the best medicine, after all! [18] X Research source Pursue some of your creative interests or hobbies to let off steam, like playing an instrument, gardening, or sewing. Try journaling or connecting with a counselor or therapist if you need help coping with your stress. Proper coping mechanisms keep your body relaxed, making accidental nerve firing less likely without some other cause, like too much caffeine."

If you’re on a prescription or have a condition that requires fluid pills or diuretics, corticosteroids, or oestrogens, talk to your doctor about alternative medications. These medicines can affect your body’s mineral balance and cause twitches. Research the side effects of new medications, like muscle twitching or spasms, before you start them. Ask your doctor about ways to balance out the side effects if switching meds isn’t possible. A vitamin B12 supplement may help, for example. Never change your medication or dosage without consulting your doctor first."
