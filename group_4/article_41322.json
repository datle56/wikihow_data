      "content": "While checking the speaker placement, check the structures that are holding your speakers or TV. If the speakers are placed on a shelf, make sure there aren't any nearby objects that the speakers are causing the vibration. Many wooden shelves use a cardboard back panel that can vibrate from noise. Pull the speakers away from the back of the shelf. If you are using a subwoofer, make sure neither the speaker nor the airflow vent is pointed at anything that can vibrate. Make sure your shelving, stands, or wall mounts are structurally sound. Make sure they are not wobbly, and that all screws, nuts, and bolts are securely fastened. If your shelving or stands are wobbly, you can try applying some blu-tack or felt pads under the legs to stabilize them and dampen the sound. [1] X Research source"
