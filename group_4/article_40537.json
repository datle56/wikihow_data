      "title": "Remove the jeans from the cornstarch water and hang them to dry.",
      "content": "Remove the jeans from the cornstarch water and hang them to dry. If you want to avoid making a mess of your floor, use a towel that can be washed later to wrap up the jeans and take them to hang on a clothesline outside or a drying rack to dry completely before wearing. [6] X Research source If you plan on ironing your jeans to really make those creases stand out and get rid of any offending wrinkles, do so when the jeans are still a bit damp. Avoid using the dryer to dry your jeans. There is a good chance your jeans will shrink in the dryer, so if you want to avoid that, it’s best to just let them air dry. Soaking your jeans in cornstarch water will result in very stiff fabric. Keep this in mind when deciding how stiff you want your jeans to be and what kind of look and feel you’re going for."

To make your own starch: [7] X Research source Add 2 tbsp (18.8 g) of cornstarch to 2 cups (473 mL) of cold water and mix well. If you’re looking to make your clothes even more stiff, add 1 tbsp (9.4 g) more of cornstarch and stir to combine."

[8] X Research source Make sure you’re not adding any other clothes to the load that you don’t intend on starching. You probably don’t want to starch your favorite hoodie or t-shirt."

      "content": "Add the starch during the last rinse cycle. Stop the washing machine when it’s on the last rinse cycle and add either the liquid starch or your homemade starch to the fabric softener compartment or pour it directly into the drum. [9] X Research source Shake or stir your starch before adding to make sure that the starch particles are evenly distributed. Do not add fabric softener. Fabric softener basically has the opposite intended effect as starch, so you should only be using one or the other. If you can’t manually select when you want your washer to stop, set a timer to make sure you catch when it’s entering the final rinse cycle. Make sure that the water level is high enough to cover your jeans completely so that the starch will get distributed evenly."

Your jeans should be left just a bit damp if you plan on following the next step and ironing your jeans."

The mixture should be cloudy even after the cornstarch is dissolved, so don’t worry if it’s not completely clear. Lastly, pour the mixture into a spray bottle."

Don’t totally abandon them to dry completely. 1 to 2 minutes should be long enough! [14] X Research source The amount of starch you apply will depend on how stiff you want your jeans. If you only want some light starching done, spray the jeans until they’re just damp. However, if you want heavily starched jeans that’ll stand up on their own, don’t be afraid to really let loose with the spray. [15] X Research source Give the spray bottle a couple good shakes before spraying the starch to make sure that the mixture hasn't settled."
