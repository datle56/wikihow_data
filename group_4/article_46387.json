Use this or that rather that these or those for collective nouns. For example: \" This milk has spilled all over the floor!\" British English differs from American English in using collective nouns. British English refers to some collective nouns such as crowd or data as plural, so it is appropriate to use these or those in British English. For example: \" These data don't match the graphs you gave me.\""
