      "title": "Sit or stand upright so your voice will be loud and clear.",
      "content": "Sit or stand upright so your voice will be loud and clear. Lift your head so you're looking straight ahead, roll your shoulders back, and keep your back straight. This will give your lungs more room to expand, and it will also help keep your diaphragm open so more air can flow through more quickly. This will naturally help your voice sound louder. [1] X Expert Source Amy Chapman, MA Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. Don't let your posture get stiff, though—you should still feel relaxed and comfortable. Also, release any tension that you might be holding in your chest and shoulders before you start speaking, since that tension could make your voice sound constricted. This might feel a little strange to do at first, especially in a regular conversation, but it's a really subtle trick that can actually help a lot!"

      "title": "Breathe from your diaphragm to make your voice louder.",
      "content": "Breathe from your diaphragm to make your voice louder. Inhale deeply through your nose so the air fills your belly—not just your chest. When you start talking, your voice will carry more clearly and evenly, so you'll sound louder without having to strain your voice. Use natural pauses in the conversation to continue breathing deeply as you speak. If you're feeling really nervous, exhale slowly through your mouth after your first deep breath, then breathe in again. This will help calm your nervous system, so you'll physically feel more relaxed and confident."

      "title": "Imagine that you're speaking to the person in the back of the room.",
      "content": "Imagine that you're speaking to the person in the back of the room. Don't just speak to the front row—breathe deeply and try to speak in a confident, powerful tone that will carry all the way to the person who's furthest away from you. This doesn't mean you have to yell—in fact, you should still speak to that person in a friendly, conversational voice. [2] X Research source Try speaking in a slightly lower pitch than you normally do. This will help your voice carry, and you may sound more confident while you're speaking. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use shorter phrases so your voice stays powerful.",
      "content": "Use shorter phrases so your voice stays powerful. When you're giving a presentation, it's harder to maintain a confident pitch over the course of a long, complicated sentence. Instead, stick to short, impactful sentences and phrases—you'll sound more authoritative, and it will be easier to project your voice. If you get long-winded, you'll also run the risk of losing your audience's attention, so sticking to simple phrases can actually make you seem more interesting!"

      "title": "Use a powerful tone as you rehearse what you're going to say.",
      "content": "Use a powerful tone as you rehearse what you're going to say. Sometimes, you might have a hard time speaking up because you feel self-conscious or unsure about what you're saying. Whether you're giving a speech or you just need to assert yourself, practice what you want to say out loud. As you're practicing, use a confident, loud tone—don't just mumble the words quietly to yourself. [4] X Research source It can help to record yourself while you do this. Then, listen back to it and see if there's anything you need to improve on. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "No, but do try varying your volume.",
      "content": "No, but do try varying your volume. Use a slightly louder tone to emphasize something important, then speak more quietly as you elaborate. Not only will you seem more confident, but if you're trying to convince someone of something, your argument will seem a lot more persuasive, too. [6] X Research source Alternately, if you have the other person's full attention, you might try quieting your voice a little when you say something important, almost as if it's something you don't want other people to hear."

    {
      "title": "Don't phrase questions as sentences.",
      "content": "Don't phrase questions as sentences. If you're making a statement, don't let your voice slide upward at the end the way you would if you were asking a question. This makes you sound like you're unsure of yourself, and it makes you seem less authoritative. If you have a hard time with that, practice dropping your tone just slightly at the end of a sentence, isntead. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Slow down, especially when you're saying something important.",
      "content": "Slow down, especially when you're saying something important. When you're trying to push your words out with more volume, don't rush through what you're saying—the words might sound jumbled, and other people might have a hard time making them out. If you notice that happening, pause, take a deep breath, and remind yourself to take your time. When you start talking again, speak more deliberately, articulating each word. You can even say something like, \"I'm excited about this so I'm talking quickly, but let me slow down for a minute. What I really want to say is...\" [8] X Research source It's normal to rush your speech when you're nervous or when you get caught up in your own thoughts. However, you'll sound more authoritative if you use a slower pace while you're speaking."

      "content": "No, you should rest your voice as much as possible. If you've been sick or you've lost your voice from yelling or singing loudly, you might notice your voice starts to get raspy. If that happens, it's important to rest your vocal cords so they can heal. [9] X Expert Source Amy Chapman, MA Vocal Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2019.
