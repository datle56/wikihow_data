      "content": "The Sunset Lesbian flag symbolizes lesbian pride. Created by non-binary lesbian Emily Gwen in 2018, the design features 7 horizontal stripes in a gradient from deep orange to dark pink. Gwen specifically created the flag to be more inclusive of trans and gender non-conforming lesbians, who had been excluded by older lesbian pride flag designs. Though there still isn’t an “official” lesbian pride flag, Gwen’s Sunset Lesbian flag has been widely accepted and embraced by the lesbian community thanks to its inclusive design.

      "title": "The first popular lesbian pride flag was the Labrys Pride Flag.",
      "content": "The first popular lesbian pride flag was the Labrys Pride Flag. Created by gay male graphic designer Sean Campbell in 1999, the flag featured a white double-headed axe inside a black triangle, all against a purple backdrop. The inverted triangle was a reference to the system Nazis used to identify “asocial” prisoners, which included lesbians and other LGBTQ+ people, and the double-headed axe (labrys) was a weapon linked to ancient matriarchal societies, like the Amazons from Greek mythology. [4] X Research source The Labrys Pride Flag was popular in the early 2000s, but many lesbians and sapphics eventually started to reject the design for several reasons. For example, some lesbians didn’t identify with the fact that the flag was created by a gay man, rather than a member of the lesbian community. Some also objected to the use of Holocaust imagery in the flag, even if it was meant in a subversive way. Beyond this, the Labrys Pride Flag eventually became popular among TERFS (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), so many lesbians distanced themselves from the design because they didn’t want to be associated with transphobia.

      "title": "The next popular iteration was the Lipstick Lesbian Pride Flag.",
      "content": "The next popular iteration was the Lipstick Lesbian Pride Flag. The design was created by blogger Natalie McCray in 2010, and it had 7 stripes in various shades of red and pink with a white stripe separating them in the middle. The original design also featured a lipstick kiss mark in the top left corner, but later variations sometimes left this mark off. [6] X Research source Like the Labrys flag, this design was met with criticism. Many felt that the term “lipstick lesbian” excluded butch, masc, non-binary, and trans members of the lesbian community, and they didn’t like that the flag was centered around a certain type of femininity. The flag became the subject of even more controversy when transphobic, racist, and biphobic posts were found on the designer Natalie McCray’s blog. As a result of all this, many lesbians stopped using the Lipstick Lesbian flag and distanced themselves from it. Eventually, Emily Gwen created the Sunset Lesbian flag as a more inclusive, updated version of the Lesbian Pride flag, and Gwen’s version became the widely accepted design. [7] X Research source"

These flags don’t have specific symbolic meanings aside from lesbian pride in general, and the change in design seems to simply be about aesthetics. The “sun” version of the flag has 7 stripes in a red and orange gradient, while the “moon” version of the flag has 7 stripes in a dark purple to dark pink gradient. [9] X Research source Some believe that the Moon Lesbian Flag is a symbol for closeted lesbians, but there’s no definitive evidence on this. [10] X Research source"

The flag was designed to be inclusive of gender-diverse lesbians, so it’s generally accepted and embraced by most members of the lesbian community. In fact, the Sunset Lesbian flag was created in response to problematic older lesbian pride flags (such as the Labrys Pride Flag and Lipstick Lesbian flag) because they weren’t inclusive of gender non-conforming and trans lesbians.

These flags have also been adopted by TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), so many lesbians have rejected them because they’re now associated with transphobia. [21] X Research source"
