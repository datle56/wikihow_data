      "content": "You have an anxious attachment style. If your parents weren’t emotionally available or your needs weren’t met as a child, you might get attached easily because you’re afraid of being abandoned. People with anxious attachment styles crave intimacy but worry that others don’t want to be with them. While their need for reassurance might seem clingy to some, it’s a soothing strategy to help them feel worthy and loved. To determine your attachment style, assess your personality and reflect on your childhood. If you constantly seek approval from others or struggle to fully trust your partner, you might have an anxious attachment style.

In this sense, relationships can be a rewarding experience, explaining why you get attached so easily—your partner makes you feel seen and accepted so they become your primary source of happiness. [2] X Research source If you have this mindset, you might believe your self-worth comes from being in a relationship (which isn’t true).

If you feel lonely when you’re single, it makes sense why you would jump into relationships quickly (and get attached too soon). You might prefer being around someone to avoid social loneliness. [4] X Research source While it’s natural to crave human connection, remember that everyone feels lonely sometimes (and there’s nothing wrong with being alone). Instead of viewing solitude as a negative state, think of it as an opportunity to make peace with yourself and strengthen your inner connection."

If you feel a deeper connection to someone right after you have sex with them, it might be the reason why you’re getting attached to them so quickly.

Emophiliacs view relationships as sources of excitement and pleasure. They crave the high that comes with falling in love, so they’re able to commit to their partners instantly (and rush into new relationships).

Try something you’ve always wanted to do to bring joy into your life. Read, write, draw, exercise, or learn a new skill—the possibilities are endless!
