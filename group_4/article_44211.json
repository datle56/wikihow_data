      "content": "Socialize your dog at a young age. Between the ages of 4 to 14 (or possibly up to 18) weeks old a puppy goes through a period of socialization. [2] X Research source You should expose your puppy to a wide variety of places and people during this period, so that it knows that new places and people are a normal part of life.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Walk or carry your puppy in public places, such as busy shopping streets and marketplaces, so it gets used to being around people. With this type of early exposure, it is less likely to feel threatened when it sees someone it doesn't know. Bring a wide variety of people to your home. Having strangers in your home will teach the dog that it is normal for new people to show up and they shouldn't feel threatened by this occurring in the future."

      "content": "Spend quality time with your dog. Play is essential in a dog's life and it can be very helpful in building a relationship with your dog. Malinois in particular are affectionate dogs that love spending time with their people. Thus, from a young age you should spend quality time with your dog every day. At least 30 minutes of play each day is a good amount for a small puppy, while an older dog can use more time to play and exercise with you. For example, you could give your Malinois a small rubber ball to play with. Throw the ball to the puppy and then practice fetching it."

      "content": "Be gentle with your dog. When creating a good foundation for training, you should make sure not to get angry or to be violent with the dog. Malinois do not generally respond to aggressive training techniques. Instead, avoid treating your puppy harshly while its still young so that it will trust you and will be enthusiastic about doing what you ask it to do.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source Manage your expectations for the dog's behavior and focus on creating a bond based in affection instead of fear. While it is important to stop negative behaviors, such as going to the bathroom in the house, redirection and showing the dog what it should do instead is much more effective than yelling or hitting the dog. Remember, when you are yelling at a dog it likely has no idea why you are yelling at it."

      "title": "Start training a puppy at 8 weeks old.",
      "content": "Start training a puppy at 8 weeks old. A young puppy is perfectly capable of learning how to follow your commands and beginning early will help them avoid learning bad habits. Tell the dog to \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come\" when you want it to do those things. While you shouldn't expect perfect behavior at such a young age, beginning to use verbal commands with the dog will set the foundation for obedience as it ages. For a Malinois, starting training this early can be key to helping it develop a pleasing and pleasant personality. For example, you should begin house training your puppy as soon as possible. Take it out on a regular schedule and take it to the same spot every time, so that it learns to go to the bathroom only outside."

      "title": "Use reward-based training techniques.",
      "content": "Use reward-based training techniques. Instead of punishing a dog for doing the wrong thing, give it praise and treats for doing positive things. When it sits, goes to the bathroom outside, or comes when called, give it a pat, tell it how smart it is in a nice voice, or give it a small treat right away. By starting this positive reinforcement early, the dog will strive to do things that please you in the future. [5] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source This positive reinforcement can start very early and using it when the dog is young will help you with more advanced training later."

      "title": "Consider using clicker training.",
      "content": "Consider using clicker training . Clicker training is a reward-based training style that incorporates a distinctive clicking noise as well. This noise is done when the dog does what you have asked it to do, which helps the dog understand when it has completed what it was asked to do. Clicker training is a helpful training method because it eliminates some of the confusion that can occur between trainer and dog. When the clicker is clicked right when the dog does what you asked it to do, there is no ambiguity about your commands. This can be very helpful when giving a dog extensive and skilled training, which is common with Malinois."

As the dog grows up, you can gradually extend each training session to 30 minutes to 1 hour.

      "content": "Teach the dog to sit . When you want to make the puppy sit, you need to wait for a moment when the dog is about to naturally sit, then say \"sit,\" and give the dog praise and a treat. If you do this repeatedly, the dog will begin to associate the action with the positive reinforcement. [7] X Research source Try practicing sitting when you are out on walks. When you pause at a corner, be prepared to give treats or praise, as the dog will likely naturally sit when it comes to a stop. The time it takes for the dog to learn to sit can vary drastically. It can take a lot of repetitions for your dog to understand your command and why it is getting treats."

      "content": "Introduce additional commands once the dog has mastered sitting. Sit is the starting point for a variety of other commands, such as stay and lay down . For instance, once the dog is sitting say the word \"down\" and signal that the dog should lay down. You may need to wait until the dog wants to lay down and give it a treat then, just as you did when teaching the dog to sit.

      "title": "Control your dog's prey drive.",
      "content": "Control your dog's prey drive. To minimize the dog's instinct to attack prey, socialization should be the first but not the only solution. Use the dog's training to instruct it to heel when walking outside. You can also teach a Malinois to \"leave it,\" meaning to leave something alone. Teaching this command with reward-based training can keep your dog's prey drive in check. [9] X Research source All Malinois have high prey drives, meaning they typically chase small animals like cats, small dogs, and potentially little children. So you need to watch out for this instinct and nip it in the bud. Also, when walking your Malinois make sure the leash is held tight, so that the dog doesn't get loose if it lurches at something."

      "content": "Reduce herding behavior. When a Malinois begins to herd you or other people, you should stop the behavior right away, as it can escalate to nipping quickly. The first line of defense is to give them something to do instead of herding, such as playing with a toy or going for a walk. However, you can also work on the command \"stay,\" which should stop them in their tracks.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show. Go to source The Malinois is a herding type of dog, so try not to get annoyed if yours tends to follow you all around the house as you move. Herding behavior can become especially problematic if your dog begins herding children or elderly people, who may not be stable enough to resist the dog's physical attention."
