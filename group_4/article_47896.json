      "content": "When a user comments \"bump,\" they are trying to boost a post's popularity. When posting in a Facebook Group , it's easy for a post to get buried by newer ones as the day goes on. New comments will push a post to the top of the Group's feed, so users will sometimes comment \"bump\" as a way to push (or \"bump\") their post to the top where more people can see it. \"Bump\" is also an acronym for \"bring up my post.\" Bumping originated on message boards and forums. Users would post \"bump\" in a thread to push it to the top of the topic list so more people could see it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "You don't have to type \"bump\" to actually bump your post. Any comment will push your post to the top of the feedâ€”if there's a conversation going on in the comments, every comment will bump the thread up to the top. \"Bump\" is useful if you want to push your post to the top of a group without including additional commentary. This is especially common in sales groups, where the comments are mostly reserved for discussing the sale of an item and not for chatter or conversation."
