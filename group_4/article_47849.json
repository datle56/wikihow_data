      "content": "Blue, green, and red lights make white light. Believe it or not, overlapping blue, green, and red light creates white light. This is because all light is a combination of these colors, which we discovered thanks to Sir Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate white light into visible colors. [1] X Research source You can see light thanks to electromagnetic waves. Each color has a different wavelength, and when blue, green, and red are mixed, they create a white light. Every type of light you see uses a combination of these colors, including your phone and computer screen. [2] X Research source Because of this, blue, green, and red are considered primary additive colors. [3] X Research source Blue, red, and yellow (the primary colors you likely learned about in school) are subtractive primary colors and create black when combined."

      "content": "Unfortunately, you can’t make white paint. Unlike mixing visible light, there’s no way to make white color out of other colors. This is because paint absorbs and reflects visible wavelengths rather than making them. White objects (like paint) appear white because they reflect all colors. When you combine paint, the colors and wavelengths mix and absorb light, making a black color. [4] X Research source Think of it like this: white is the starting point. With physical objects, there’s no way to create a pure white because it’s the base of every color. So, how do paint companies make white paint to sell? Well, it all boils down to white pigment, which is made with careful chemistry in a lab and can’t be replicated at home."

      "content": "While you may not be able to make pure white paint, you can mix plenty of colors with white to make different white shades or hues. Try mixing these paint colors to get a variation of white: [5] X Research source 4 parts white + 0.5 parts yellow ochre + 0.5 parts golden yellow = butter 4 parts white + 1 part raw sienna = almond 4 parts white + 1 part raw umber + 1 part raw sienna = khaki 4 parts white + 1 part raw umber = cement"

      "title": "White lightens colors rather than brightens them.",
      "content": "White lightens colors rather than brightens them. When mixing paint , pure white is added to make other colors lighter, not brighter. [6] X Research source For instance, mixing red and white makes pink rather than firetruck red. Why does this happen? It all has to do with color theory. Color theory is the study of how colors interact with one another and affect your mood. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "White is an achromatic color. Achromatic colors have lightness but no hue or saturation; they’re only a shade of color rather than a vibrant pigment. This includes white, gray, and black. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "White isn’t on the color wheel. Believe it or not, white is considered a non-color and, therefore, doesn’t appear on the traditional color wheel. This is because white is a mixture of visible wavelengths of light. [10] X Research source Black is also considered a non-color for the same reason."

      "title": "The color white represents pureness, cleanliness, and goodness.",
      "content": "The color white represents pureness, cleanliness, and goodness. Being the cleanest color in the color palette, white is considered the color of perfection. It symbolizes a pure, clean innocence that’s wholeheartedly good. The color is crisp and unstained. Because of these attributes, the color white can make you feel comforted, hygienic, and holy. [11] X Research source For example, think of the character Snow White. When her name comes to mind, you likely think of a child-like innocence or sweetness. Her gentle and soft-voiced nature is symbolic of her name. [12] X Research source Similarly, in fantasy, “good” characters are often given powers or magic that omits a white light. This is because white is a symbol of purity."
