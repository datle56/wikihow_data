If you’re likely to touch your face while you’re waiting for the bus, bored, or in class, give yourself a small fidget to keep your hands occupied. A stress ball, keychain, beaded bracelet, rubber band, or gemstone make great fidgets. [1] X Research source If you touch your face while you’re watching television, give yourself a hand massage instead. Knitting or doodling are great ways to keep your hands engaged (plus you’ll be doing something creative!). Identify your triggers to help you anticipate temptation and plan distractions. [2] X Expert Source Julia Yacoob, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 15 July 2021. Do you unconsciously touch your face while you’re reading, sitting in class, or watching television? Do you go the bathroom to brush your teeth and end up picking afterward? Or do you touch your face when you’re stressed, excited, angry, bored, or sad? You don't want to remove this habit completely if you're using it as a coping mechanism. Instead, try replacing the habit with something else.

Whether you’re sitting in class or at the dinner table, try sitting on your hands when you’re not using them to eat or take notes.

Place sticky notes that say \"NO TOUCHING OR PICKING\" on your bathroom mirror, the visor mirror in your car, the TV remote, or anywhere else where you’re likely to see it.

      "content": "Wear gloves around the house if you tend to pick while you’re at home. It may sound silly, but it will be impossible to pick your face while wearing gloves. You can wear them overnight, too, if you tend to sleep with your face on your hands. Just be sure to wash the gloves regularly so they don’t collect bacteria. Use 100% cotton gloves. Wool will irritate your face (should you try to touch it) and nylon might get a runner. If wearing gloves isn't an option, consider placing bandages or narrow strips of tape over your fingertips. This is a bit more discreet, and will make it very difficult to pick your skin."

      "content": "Ask a friend or family member to call you out whenever you touch your face. A close friend, parent, or roommate can be a very valuable ally when it comes to breaking the habit of touching or picking your face. Ask them to gently scold you if they see you touching your face. You can also create a collection jar, if necessary, to give you an incentive to avoid touching or picking. For instance, every time you do it, you have to put a dollar into the jar."

      "content": "Remind yourself of reasons to stop touching or picking your face. Try not to become discouraged and remind yourself of all the good reasons for breaking the habit. Alternatively, you can remind yourself of the damage of touching and picking your face. Do an image search for acne scars to see what you may be in for if you continue to pick your face. Most types of acne will not cause scars if left untouched—picking, gouging, and irritating the skin is more likely to cause scarring."

If you touch your face or pick when you’re feeling stressed, anxious, bored, or sad, take some time to clear and “reset” your mind. Meditation has been proven to help people manage their emotions and resist acting on body focused repetitive behaviors (like touching or picking).
