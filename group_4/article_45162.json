      "content": "Women want a partner they can talk openly and honestly with. Having strong opinions is great, but so is being open to hearing others. If you shut down opinions that aren’t yours or make harsh comments about other people, she may just walk the other way. Keep an open mind and have civil conversations instead of being insistent about your own opinion. It’s perfectly okay to be opinionated, but don’t forget to hear other sides.

      "content": "Bragging about your assets could turn a woman off. Being confident is one thing, but humblebragging is another.

[4] X Research source Aim to only bring up your achievements or skills when she asks about them. It’s okay to show off what you’ve got to offer, but tone it down a bit to appear less self-absorbed."

      "content": "Interrupting a woman while she’s talking is a big no-no. Women usually look for partners who help them feel included and wanted. They deserve respect, and talking over them can be a sign of disrespect. [5] X Research source When she’s talking to you, nod your head and avoid cutting her off mid-sentence.

      "title": "A woman wants a partner who’s confident in who they are.",
      "content": "A woman wants a partner who’s confident in who they are. Low self-esteem could be a major turn-off for many women, especially if they favor strong-willed individuals. She’s looking for someone who isn’t afraid to be themselves and is comfortable in their own skin. [6] X Research source If you struggle to feel confident , that’s okay! Start small and work your way up. For example, try wearing what you want to wear regardless of what others may think or share an idea at work."

      "content": "Women generally don’t want a “Negative Nelly” in their lives. If you complain a lot about little things or even trash talk your ex, she may turn the other way. She doesn’t have time for negative energy. She needs a partner who looks on the bright side. Complaining every once and a while is okay—we all need to vent sometimes—but try looking at the glass as half full rather than half empty to build a positive attitude ."

      "title": "Bad manners are a major turn-off for most women.",
      "content": "Bad manners are a major turn-off for most women. If you’re impolite or rude to her, her friends, or strangers, she may think the relationship isn’t worth pursuing.

      "title": "Women don’t want to “walk on eggshells” when they’re around you.",
      "content": "Women don’t want to “walk on eggshells” when they’re around you. Being assertive can be a positive trait, but being combative might be a major turn-off. A woman wants to be able to talk to her partner about anything, and if you’re automatically defensive, having conversations can be difficult. Work on controlling your anger if you’re a naturally defensive person. Remember, it’s okay if things don’t go as planned or if someone has a different opinion. Not everyone will always agree with you, and that’s alright."

      "content": "Women like men who can take care of themselves. Being well-groomed is a great way to capture a woman’s attention and leave her wanting more.

      "content": "If sex is the only thing you’re after, a woman might end the relationship. A major turn-off is not listening to what she wants. Being too pushy or always talking about sex might make her think you value her sexiness over her personality. [9] X Research source Try following her lead instead of putting your needs first. It’s okay to say what you want, but give her the chance to say “yes” or “no” and honor that."

      "title": "Women don’t want a partner who plays games.",
      "content": "Women don’t want a partner who plays games. Not knowing what you want in a relationship is okay, but stringing someone along isn’t. If you toy with her emotions and make her think you like her one minute and don’t the next, she may just walk away entirely. Tell her exactly how you feel about her. Do you want to pursue a relationship, or would you rather just stay friends? The truth could hurt, but you’ll both benefit from honesty in the long run."

      "title": "Not giving women independence could be a big turn-off.",
      "content": "Not giving women independence could be a big turn-off. Most people don’t want a clinging partner, and women are no different! Gluing yourself to her side could make her think you don’t trust her. Avoid texting or calling her all the time, and skip questioning her about why and who she hangs out with. Take a deep breath and trust her to combat your jealousy ."

      "title": "A woman needs to be able to trust you 100%.",
      "content": "A woman needs to be able to trust you 100%. How can she trust you if you’re constantly lying about little things? In her mind, if you’re lying about where you went to the store or if you did a specific chore, she may think you’re lying about more significant things, like being loyal. Be honest with her whenever you can. Remember, honesty is the best policy, especially when it comes to cultivating lasting relationships."

      "title": "Some women may not care for old-fashioned one-liners.",
      "content": "Some women may not care for old-fashioned one-liners. She’s more than her looks, and commenting just on her appearance or feminine qualities may turn her off. There’s nothing wrong with a compliment that’ll make her blush, but aim to make it more sincere rather than superficial. Give her a genuine compliment you wholeheartedly believe. For instance, instead of saying, “Do you have a map? I just got lost in your eyes,” try, “You have the bluest eyes I’ve ever seen. They're beautiful, and so are you.”"

      "title": "Sometimes, it’s best to leave the hard-hitting questions for later.",
      "content": "Sometimes, it’s best to leave the hard-hitting questions for later. If you’ve just started seeing her, consider skipping the more personal questions. Asking too many questions about her life right away or even during sex could raise a red flag. It’s more than okay to ask about her job, social life, and hobbies, but stick to surface-level questions. For example, “What do you do for a living?” is an appropriate question, whereas “You mentioned not getting along with your boss. Did you two ever date?” might be too personal."
