      "content": "Look into granting financial power of attorney for limited transactions. Most banks won't allow someone not listed on your account to make transactions in your name unless you have given explicit permission. In legal terms, this means granting the person financial power of attorney (FPOA) by signing a legal document stating what transactions the person is allowed to make. By giving someone FPOA, you can authorize them to make withdrawals, write checks for you, and take other actions in your absence. [1] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source A limited FPOA puts a limit on what the person can do with your account. You can authorize them to make a few specific transactions if that's all you want them to do. If you want the person to have longer-term access to your account, you can grant a durable FPOA. This enables the person to make decisions for you and handle your finances in the event that you become incapacitated."

Most major banks have a specific power of attorney form (sometimes called a third party authorization form) for you to fill out with the details of your situation.

Either visit your bank in person to speak to an agent, or visit your bank's website to obtain a power of attorney form online. Fill out and submit the form according to your bank's instructions."

If your bank doesn't have a specific power of attorney form, you can create your own listing exactly what transactions the person is allowed to make. In order for the document to be legally valid, you will need to follow your state's laws in order to draw it up using the correct language. Execute (sign) the power of attorney form with the person to whom you're giving FPOA. [3] X Trustworthy Source Victorian Government Official website for the Australian state of Victoria Go to source You may want to have a lawyer help you draw up the form to make sure it's legally sound. The execution of the document must also be done according to your state's laws. Some states require that you have a witness, and others require that you have the document notarized."

      "content": "Consider opening a convenience account. About half the states in the US provide the option of opening convenience accounts. The other person would have access to the account, but would only be authorized to use it on your behalf. In other words, the person could use it to pay your bills, but they couldn't withdraw cash to use for their own purposes. [4] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source This is not an option in every state. See if your state's laws permit convenience accounts. Contact your bank to find out whether a convenience account will meet your needs."

This person would have the exact same ability to make transactions as you do. Go online or talk to a bank representative in person to add another person to your account. [5] X Research source In order to add a co-owner, you'll need to fill out forms that are signed by both parties.

      "content": "Use caution when allowing someone else full access to your account. Opening a convenience account or a joint account are both risky options. Adding a co-owner gives that person free reign to use your account in whatever way they please. Even if you just open a convenience account, you have to trust the person to use your money wisely. In either situation, be sure you have full trust in the person who has access to your account. [6] X Trustworthy Source Official UK government website Official website for the public sector of the UK government Go to source You may want to meet with a lawyer to discuss which option is best for your situation. The lawyer may advise you against getting a joint account, and instead recommend getting a durable FPOA. It's a good idea to think it through with an expert before making a decision. This is especially true if you're considering adding your children to your bank account so they can take care of your bills. Unanticipated problems could arise at a later time, so make sure your finances are well protected. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Authorize someone to make a withdrawal. Giving someone your bank card or account information is a way to self-authorize them to make a withdrawal. However, banks advise against doing this, since you won't have control over how much the person withdraws from your account. Some banks have explicit policies in place to prevent non-account holders from making transactions, so using FPOA or listing the person as a co-signer may be a better bet."
