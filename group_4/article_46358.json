Just stick the note on the relevant page and maybe write a brief note or a few key words that indicate why you have marked this section. As well as the traditional square sticky notes, you can purchase slim and tall ones which work particularly well to mark pages in a book. [1] X Research source These slimmer notes will mark the page without covering over much of the actual text. You can also tear the regular square notes into thinner strips and use these as markers. Sticky notes are great as a representation of what's important, especially when you restructure that information in your own words. [2] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed.

You can then stick them up on the wall around where you are working. You can organise the notes and move them around to help you visualise the information you are trying to learn. If you are studying for a history exam and want to learn a chronology of events, you can stick the notes in order and separate them by year or month. You can also use sticky notes to condense important paragraphs into your own language, which helps you summarize important information but also reteach the information to yourself.

Try to have some restraint when it comes to labelling food. Labelling absolutely everything can seem somewhat over the top. Consider just labelling a few key things that could easily be mistaken for somebody else’s."
