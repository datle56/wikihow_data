      "content": "5150 is also a derogatory term that can mean someone’s “crazy.” “5150” (pronounced “fifty-one-fifty”) is usually used to describe someone in a derogatory or disrespectful way, like the word “crazy.” When someone says “5150,” it can mean that the other person has lost control or isn’t behaving in a safe or rational way. This term is also used in prisons to talk about someone who needs mental health treatment.

Van Halen made a record called “5150” in 1986. The term made it into pop culture when celebrities like Britney Spears were placed on 5150 holds in the early 2000s. [4] X Research source"

Luckily, she’s doing better now.” “Should we get our friend 5150’d? I think she might be dangerous to herself.”"
