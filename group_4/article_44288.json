      "content": "Go through the transfer process for all types of guns except long guns. While all hand guns (like revolvers and pistols) require a background check, long guns (like rifles and shot guns) can be sold or given away directly. It is still recommended to go through the transfer process so that you have a record of the sale or transfer."

      "content": "Do not purchase a gun for someone who cannot legally own it. There are 38 crimes that cause someone to lose the right to own guns. These include aggravated assault, murder, rape, stalking, and unlawful restraint. It is a felony to sell or give a gun to someone who is prohibited from owning one because of prior convictions. [1] X Research source You can find a full list of convictions here: http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/CT/HTM/18/00.061.005.000..HTM If you do not know whether someone has a conviction or not, you can wait until the dealership does a background check during the transfer. If they fail the check, do not give them the gun. People who have had 3 DUIs in a 5-year period may keep previously owned guns, but they not receive or buy new guns."

If you are a cousin, aunt, uncle, or unmarried partner, you must transfer the gun through a dealership. [3] X Research source If you knowingly give the gun to a family member who is legally ineligible to own guns, you could still be charged with a felony."
