      "content": "Choose a rose stem during the cooler months of the year. When you take your rose cuttings, look for stems about the thickness of a standard pencil that are long, strong, and healthy. Roses can be grown from cuttings at any time of the year, but home gardeners are more likely to see successful propagation if they take cuttings during the cooler months of November to February. Artemisia Nursery recommends taking your cutting from a younger part of the plant so it will have a better chance of taking root.

      "content": "Cut the stem above a set of leaves at a 45-degree angle. Once you’ve selected healthy rose stems, cut them so they’re 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) long. Use pruning shears or a sharp knife to cut at a 45-degree angle right above a set of leaves. [2] X Research source Take your rose cuttings in the morning so that they’re hydrated. Clean your tools well with rubbing alcohol before you use them. Roses have compound leaves, meaning smaller leaflets will grow from the stem of the main leaf. Artemisia Nursery recommends cutting above where the actual leaf attaches to the branch, not above a leaflet.

      "content": "Put the rose cuttings directly into water immediately. It’s very important for the rose cuttings to stay hydrated so they don’t dry out before you plant them. After you take the rose cuttings, put them in a cup of room-temperature water until you’re ready to transfer them. Ideally, you’ll be ready to put them into the soil right after you cut the stems."

      "content": "Remove the leaves and thorns from the bottom of your cutting. Keep only the top leaves. Cut off the rest of the leaves and thorns on the stem using the pruning shears or sharp scissors. This makes wounds in the stem where roots can grow. [4] X Research source Some gardeners prefer to remove all of the leaves. They believe it causes the cutting to put more energy into growing the root system instead of leaves. [5] X Research source Wash your tools with rubbing alcohol when you're done."

      "content": "Wet the end of the rose cutting and dip it into a rooting hormone. While this step is optional, most people who take rose cuttings use some type of rooting hormone powder to help the cuttings take root. Make sure the base of the rose cutting is damp before dipping it into the powder to help coat about 1 inch (2.5 cm) at the bottom of the stem. Gently tap off any excess. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pick a sunny spot to plant your rose cuttings. Where you place your cuttings is especially important if you plan to grow them outdoors. Choose a sunny spot that’s not in direct sunlight — you don’t want your roses to dry out. Putting the cuttings in a pot or special container for rose cuttings is also fine. Just make sure the container is deep and wide enough for your rose cuttings to grow. [7] X Research source If you have a sunny spot near a drain pipe or other water source, this is a great choice for ensuring the soil is always moist. The container you’re using should be at least 6 inches (15 cm) deep. An 18 in (46 cm) planter is a good choice for most roses."

      "title": "Prepare the soil bed or container for the rose cuttings.",
      "content": "Prepare the soil bed or container for the rose cuttings. For rose cuttings, use soil made of a mixture of sand and horticultural grit (or perlite) or a special plant propagation potting mix . Cultivate the soil to 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) deep to ensure it can drain before planting the rose cuttings. [8] X Research source Cultivating the soil requires using gardening tools , such as a mini spading fork or shovel, to break up the soil so it's loose. You can purchase sand and horticultural grit from your local home improvement store or online. A bag of horticultural grit costs $5-$15, while a bag of gardening sand will typically cost less but entirely depends on the size."

      "title": "Gently push the cutting down several inches into the soil.",
      "content": "Gently push the cutting down several inches into the soil. This is about half the length of the cutting. “Make sure that you're getting at least 1 or 2 – optimally 2 – nodes that are going to be above ground…and at least 2 nodes that are going to be below ground,” advises Artemisia Nursery. This leaves nodes above ground for new leaves to sprout from, as well as nodes below ground, where roots can grow. [9] X Expert Source Artemisia Nursery Plant Nursery & Garden Shop Expert Interview. 7 August 2020. Once the cutting is in place, pat down the soil around the stem. [10] X Research source For planting multiple cuttings, place them in rows 6–8 inches (15–20 cm) apart."

      "content": "Plant the rose cuttings at any point throughout the year. Some people like to plant them during the cool months, while others wait until the early summer, but rose cuttings grow during any season. Many recommend planting in the spring or fall, depending on the climate where you live. [11] X Research source Remember that newly transplanted roses need to be constantly watered. If you plant them during the summer or live in a hot climate, they may dry out faster without consistent watering. For this reason, the rainy season might be your best option for planting."

      "content": "Keep the rose cuttings well hydrated after planting. The best way to successfully grow rose cuttings is to prevent them from drying out. Water them several times a day if the weather is warm. Frequent watering helps the roots flourish and grow strong. [12] X Research source To ensure moisture remains in the soil, place a plastic bag around the cutting once you’ve watered it. This creates a mini greenhouse for the roses. When planting the cuttings in a pot, let them grow for an entire season before transplanting them into an outdoor flowerbed."

      "content": "Monitor the rose cuttings to ensure they’re hydrated and taking root. After a week or two, test to see if the roots are growing by gently tugging the cuttings. You should be able to feel a slight resistance, meaning the roots are growing well and taking hold of the soil. [13] X Research source Continue to care for the roses with regular weeding, pruning in winter , and proper watering . Add fertilizer to the soil in the early spring, after the first blooms appear, and then again in mid-summer."

      "title": "What are other ways to propagate roses?",
      "content": "What are other ways to propagate roses? While taking rose cuttings is the most effective type of propagation, new plants can also be grown from a seed, layering, or dividing. The species of rose and the preference of the gardener determine which type most people use. [14] X Research source Growing roses from seeds is rarely done by home gardeners because it requires stratifying or exposing them to 40°F (4.44°C) temperatures for 3 to 4 months. To layer roses, choose portions with long, flexible stems. Pin or bury a portion of one of the stems while still connected to the parent plant. Once new roots begin to grow, cut the stem from the parent plant. [15] X Research source Some types of roses can be propagated through division. Dig down between a plant’s offshoot and the rest of the parent plant in early spring while the plants are still dormant. Sever the root of the offshoot from the parent plant and then transplant it to a new growing location right away. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Can you grow roses from commercial cut flowers? Yes, it’s possible to take cuttings from a store-bought bouquet of roses. However, it’s a little trickier because they’re grown and handled as commercially cut flowers. Many commercially sold roses are originally grown in South America. This means they are used to warmer growing conditions and may be unable to adjust to different climates. [17] X Research source If you want to try taking cuttings from your next bouquet, use the following steps: Select a rose with a stem that is still green and slightly flexible. Make a cut at a 45-degree angle near the bottom of the stem below one of the leaf nodes. Cut the top of the stem below the bloom, leaving about 6–7 inches (15–18 cm) for your cutting. Leave two leaf clusters if possible, but don’t worry if the leaves have already been stripped. Proceed as you would with cuttings you take from your own rose bushes. Place a jar or plastic bag over the cuttings to hold in humidity, which may help cut roses grown in greenhouses propagate successfully."

      "content": "Can you grow roses from cuttings using potatoes? Yes, it’s possible to grow rose cuttings in a potato. While some feel this is a myth or an unnecessary step, potatoes can help keep your rose cutting hydrated and may help increase your chances of creating a successful root system. [19] X Research source Choose a potato that’s firm and healthy. Use a drill or corkscrew to carve a hole slightly smaller than the end of your cutting. Dip the end of your rose cutting in hormone powder and then fit it into the hole in the potato. Plant the potato and cutting into the ground or a pot with at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of soil covering it. Water regularly until roots begin to grow."

      "title": "Will rose cuttings root in water?",
      "content": "Will rose cuttings root in water? Yes! Once you have taken your cutting, remove any leaves at the bottom of the stem so they won’t be underwater. Then place the cutting in water with a generous length – about 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) – submerged. Use a clear container so you can monitor the root growth. [20] X Research source Place a clear bag over the cutting and container and seal it at the bottom to retain moisture. Generally, roots begin to form in 2-4 weeks, but it can take a little longer depending on your cutting and the growing conditions. Once the roots are a 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long, transfer the cutting to a pot and plant in a potting mix. Place the potted cutting in indirect sunlight and water it daily."

      "title": "What is the typical success rate of rose cuttings?",
      "content": "What is the typical success rate of rose cuttings? Success rates can range wildly due to the experience of the gardener, the growing conditions, and the type of rose. However, when following the best practices for the rose variety and local climate, gardeners can reasonably expect a 50%-70% success rate. If you experience a lower success rate, experiment with different methods for preparing the cuttings, for example, try removing all the leaves if you typically take cuttings with two leaf clusters."

      "content": "What is rose replant disease? This is a problem when an existing rose bush is removed and then replaced with another one. The new bush may fail to thrive or struggle to grow a good root system. Some believe it’s caused by fungal root diseases and nematodes that develop when the first bush is growing. [21] X Trustworthy Source Royal Horticultural Society Leading gardening charity in the U.K. providing resources for identifying, growing and caring for flowers and other plants Go to source A few techniques gardeners use to help avoid replant disease are: Swapping the soil with fresh soil from another part of your garden or a potting mix. Lining the hole where the new rose bush is planted with cardboard. Boosting growth with a fertilizer that’s high in nitrogen."
