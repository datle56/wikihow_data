      "content": "Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Try to use a pot that can hold at least 8 quarts of water. Your pot needs to be able to fit a steaming basket or colander, as these are used to hold the oysters themselves. Bring the water level to about halfway up the pot. Keep a transparent lid handy, as you’ll want to watch the oysters getting steamed. If you do not have a transparent lid, you will have to open the pot every few minutes to check the oysters’ progress when it comes time to steam them."

      "title": "Add seasoning to the boiling water before putting the oysters in the pot.",
      "content": "Add seasoning to the boiling water before putting the oysters in the pot. Putting the ingredients of your preference in the pot will help give the oysters their flavor and aroma. There is no set list of ingredients used for steaming oysters, but many recipes include various herbs and spices as well as olive oil and wine. Some herbs that work well with steamed oysters include parsley and cilantro, while spices such as cloves and paprika can also be found in these dishes. Steamed oysters can be cooked with either white wine or olive oil. They can also be made with both! Use 2-3 tablespoons of either wine or olive oil. If you are cooking with both, use a combined total of 2-3 tablespoons."

      "content": "Place oysters in a steaming basket or colander and let them sit in the pot. Remember to have that transparent lid with you to put on top of the pot, as this will speed up the steaming process. [1] X Research source Steaming oysters helps keep the moisture intact, whereas grilling them can dry them up. Cooking oysters for too long will lead to them shriveling and toughening. You want your oysters to be plump and hot when you take them out of the pot."

      "title": "Remove the oysters from the pot soon after they begin to open.",
      "content": "Remove the oysters from the pot soon after they begin to open. Depending on how many oysters you are cooking, this part of the job can take anywhere from 3 to 20 minutes. When the oysters begin to crack open, that’s when you know they are ready! [2] X Research source Keep a watchful eye over your oysters, as you do not want to overcook them. Since the amount of time needed to steam the oysters can vary, make sure to keep your focus solely on the stove during this period. Consider removing smaller oysters right after they open to avoid overcooking them."

      "title": "Let the oysters cool on the table.",
      "content": "Let the oysters cool on the table. Transfer the oysters onto a plate and let them cool there. This part doesn’t take very long, but it is important to wait a few minutes before moving on to the next step. [3] X Research source Oysters can be cooked even if they are closed, so don’t worry if only a few are open when you remove them from the pot. If some are open, that means all are cooked."

      "title": "Shuck the oysters with a butter knife.",
      "content": "Shuck the oysters with a butter knife. Shucking is the process of removing the oyster meat from the shell itself. Shucking oysters can be tricky, but fun. Use a specialized oyster-shucking knife if you have one, but the beauty of steaming oysters is that they are soft enough to shuck with a regular kitchen knife once you cook them. [4] X Research source There are a couple of ways you can serve the oysters, so keep this in mind while shucking. You can serve the oysters by themselves without any part of the shell, or you can keep them in the bottom shell and just get rid of the top part of the shell."

      "content": "Sprinkle seasoning on top of the oysters for a colorful presentation. Take some of the ingredients and use them to give the dish its finishing touches. For example, if you put some herbs like parsley and cilantro in the boiling water earlier, put more of them on top of the oysters. [5] X Research source Oysters are best eaten when they are fresh and warm, so serve them soon after adding those final touches."

      "title": "Serve your oysters with a white wine or champagne.",
      "content": "Serve your oysters with a white wine or champagne. Most seafood is best served with a light, crisp wine or a bubbly champagne, and oysters are no different. Many white wines go well with oysters. A sherry or Chablis always does the trick, but this dish pairs particularly well with the bubbles in a glass of champagne. [6] X Research source Champagne can get expensive, but you can find a good sherry or Chablis for around 20 to 30 dollars."
