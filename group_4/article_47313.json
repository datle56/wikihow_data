      "content": "Remove your insoles from the Rothys. To make sure your insoles get completely clean, it's best to take out the insoles and wash them separately. Luckily, the insoles in Rothys are designed to be easily removable. Simply grab the insole near the heel and pull outward, and it should slip right out. [1] X Research source Beneath the insoles, you’ll see printed tips for machine washing your shoes in case you forget any of the steps."

      "content": "Place your insoles and base flats in the washer. It's best to wash your shoes either alone or with a very small load of clothes. That's because you have to wash Rothys with cold water, and laundry detergent doesn't clean as well in lower temperatures. If you overcrowd the washing machine, your shoes and clothes might not get as clean as you'd like them to be. Adding a towel or a couple of T-shirts to the load could help cushion the shoes during the spin cycle, but don't add much more than that."

      "title": "Use a mild detergent.",
      "content": "Use a mild detergent. Regular liquid detergents contain chemical additives that can harm the plastic fibers in your Rothys. A mild detergent won't have these additives and will provide a gentler clean for your shoes. [2] X Research source Look for detergents designed for delicate clothing, baby clothes, or people with skin sensitivities. You could also choose a detergent made from all-natural materials.

      "title": "Run the washer on a cold, delicate cycle.",
      "content": "Run the washer on a cold, delicate cycle. A delicate wash uses a slow spin cycle and less agitation to extract water from the laundry, so your shoes won't get tossed around as much inside the washing machine. In addition, the cold water will help protect the plastic fibers making up your shoes. [4] X Research source Do not use warm or hot water to wash your Rothys. They will shrink and lose their shape if they are exposed to heat. Your Rothys may be damaged if you wash them on a regular or heavy-duty cycle. [5] X Research source The delicate, or gentle, cycle strips away dirt and odor, but it may not have the same deep cleaning power as a normal wash. If your shoes are still dirty after the first cycle, wash your shoes again, using the same settings."

      "title": "Schedule your wash to account for the drying time.",
      "content": "Schedule your wash to account for the drying time. If you're planning to wear your Rothys within the next few hours, it's best to wait to wash them until you have time to let them dry. It usually takes about 8 hours for a pair of Rothys to air dry, although if you live in an area with very low humidity, they may dry sooner. [6] X Research source During the week, it’s best to schedule overnight drying, so they’re ready in the morning. If you plan to wash for evening wear, throw them in the washer in the morning and let them sit out during the day, so they'll be ready when you put them on again."

      "title": "Let your Rothys air dry overnight.",
      "content": "Let your Rothys air dry overnight. Thanks to Rothys’ unique knit material, they're designed to dry quickly. However, Rothys does recommend allowing your shoes to dry completely overnight before you wear them again. You can leave the shoes indoors or outdoors to dry. [7] X Research source If you have a clothesline, you can hang your shoes and insoles to dry, or you can lay them flat."

      "title": "Do not put your Rothys in the dryer.",
      "content": "Do not put your Rothys in the dryer. Rothys are made from recycled plastic, and while they're very durable shoes, they will be destroyed in the dryer. The heat will melt the plastic fibers, causing them to shrink and lose their shape. [8] X Research source Even on no heat, the dryer's tumbling action will probably ruin your Rothys. If you want your shoes to dry more quickly, point a fan at them."

      "title": "Keep your insoles separate for drying.",
      "content": "Keep your insoles separate for drying. If you put your insoles back into the shoes while they're still wet, they may not dry evenly, or they will take longer to dry. Leaving them separate will allow both the shoes and the insoles to dry more quickly. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Replace the insoles when the shoes are dry.",
      "content": "Replace the insoles when the shoes are dry. To put the insoles back into your Rothys, hold each one in the center near the arch, and fold it slightly into a U-shape. Push the insole into the shoe toe-side first, then push the heel into place. Folding the insole as you insert it will make it easier to slide into the shoe. It is better to buy good quality shoes. They last longer. Wear the shoes and see if they fit you properly. Buy shoes towards the end of the day when you have walked for some time."
