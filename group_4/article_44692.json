      "content": "Place the affected finger in an aluminum flexion finger splint. These finger splints use a stiff aluminum frame to hold the finger in place as it heals. Place the splint on the palm side of the finger with the foam against the skin. It should conform to the shape of your finger. [1] X Research source Aluminum flexion splints (or similar splints) can be purchased at nearly any pharmacy for relatively cheap."

      "title": "Curve the aluminum so that the finger is slightly bent.",
      "content": "Curve the aluminum so that the finger is slightly bent. Gently press the splint into a slightly curved shape that's comfortable for your finger. If it's too painful or difficult to to do this with the affected finger, don't be afraid to use your other hand. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source When your splint is comfortably bent, secure it to your finger with the provided straps or metal arms. If none are provided, use medical tape."

      "title": "Leave in place for 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Leave in place for 2 weeks. The nodule should begin to regress with enforced lack of movement. Over time, you should experience a reduction in pain and inflammation and the return of your full range of motion. [3] X Research source You may want to take your splint off to bathe and clean yourself. However, when you do so, try to avoid flexing your finger or doing anything else that may aggravate your condition."

      "title": "Protect your finger.",
      "content": "Protect your finger. With rest, most cases of trigger finger will self-resolve. However, this requires patience and care to ensure the finger isn't disturbed while it's in the splint. Avoid strenuous physical activities that require the use of your hands, especially sports like basketball, football, and baseball where you may have to catch a fast-moving object. If possible, also avoid using your splinted finger to lift heavy objects or support your weight. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove the splint and test your finger's motion.",
      "content": "Remove the splint and test your finger's motion. After a few weeks, take your finger out of its splint and try flexing it. You should be able to move your finger with less pain and difficulty. If your condition is better but you still experience some pain, you may want to wear the splint for a little longer or see a doctor for other options. If your condition doesn't seem any better or seems to have worsened, you should definitely make a doctor appointment. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Use over-the-counter NSAIDs.",
      "content": "Use over-the-counter NSAIDs. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are common, easily-available drugs sold without a prescription. These drugs, including the well-known painkillers ibuprofen and naproxen sodium, ease mild pain as well as reducing inflammation and swelling. For an inflammatory condition like trigger finger, NSAIDs are a perfect \"first line of defense\", providing quick relief from pain and reducing troublesome symptoms. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source However, NSAIDs are relatively mild drugs and won't help especially bad cases of trigger finger. Simply increasing the dosage of NSAIDs is ill-advised, as NSAID overdose can damage the liver [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source and kidneys. If your trigger finger is persistent, don't rely on this treatment as a permanent fix. Long-term use of NSAIDs can also put you at risk for ulcers. Talk to your doctor before using them if you have a history of stomach ulcers. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "title": "Receive a cortisone injection.",
      "content": "Receive a cortisone injection. Cortisone is a natural hormone released by the body belonging to a class of molecules called steroids (note: these are not the same as the steroids that are sometimes used as illegal athletic aids). Cortisone has potent anti-inflammatory properties, making it useful for treating trigger finger and other inflammatory disorders. Talk to your doctor about a cortisone injection if your trigger finger won't subside with rest and over-the-counter medication. [9] X Research source Cortisone is given in the form of an injection directly into the affected area - in this case, the tendon sheath. Though this can be done in the doctor's office in a matter of minutes, you may need to return for a second injection if the first provides only partial relief. [10] X Research source Finally, cortisone injections aren't as effective for people who have certain medical conditions (like diabetes). [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider surgery for especially bad cases.",
      "content": "Consider surgery for especially bad cases. If your trigger finger still persists after lengthy rest, NSAID treatment, and multiple cortisone injections, surgery may be necessary. The surgical procedure that fixes trigger finger involves cutting the tendon sheath. When the sheath heals, it's looser and better-able to accommodate the nodule on the tendon. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This surgery is usually done on an outpatient basis - in other words, you won't need to spend the night at the hospital. Usually, local, rather than general anesthesia is used for this surgery. This means that your hand will be numbed so that you don't feel any pain, but you'll stay awake."
