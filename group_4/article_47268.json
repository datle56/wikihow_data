      "content": "Check the care label to confirm the shirt is machine-washable. Most dress shirts are cotton, linen, or polyester. These materials are all machine-washable, but double check the care label to confirm that it’s okay to put the shirt in the washing machine. If the label says “Machine Wash” or has a symbol with a bucket filled with water, go ahead with putting it in the machine. [1] X Research source If you see a bucket with an X over it, or the words “Dry Clean Only” or “Do Not Wash,” then bring the shirt to the dry cleaners. Usually, wool and silk aren’t machine-washable. You might also see “Hand Wash Only” on the label. In this case, hand wash the shirt instead of putting it in the machine."

      "content": "Divide the white and colored shirts to prevent staining. If you’re washing multiple shirts, separate out the white ones. This prevents the colors from bleeding together and staining the white ones. [2] X Research source If a white shirt has thin colored stripes, wash it with the whites. If a colored shirt has white stripes, wash it with the colors."

      "content": "Separate shirts made of silk, wool, cashmere, or other delicate materials. Fragile materials like these need a different wash cycle than other more durable materials. If any of your dress shirts are made of delicate material, separate them from the other shirts and run them in a different load. [3] X Research source If you aren't sure what your shirt is made of, check the care label. If it says \"Delicate,\" then separate it out."

      "content": "Pretreat any stains on the shirt. Check the shirt for any stains. If you find any, wet them with cold water. Then, rub a spoonful of detergent onto each stain. Let the detergent soak in for 5 minutes before washing the shirt. You can also buy stain-removing pens or sprays to pretreat the shirt. Also check the other side of the fabric for stains. It may have soaked through."

      "content": "Set the machine to cold water. Warm water can make colors bleed and stain your other clothes. Make sure your washing machine is on its cold setting before starting it. [4] X Research source Most modern washing machines use cold water as their standard setting. This may be your machine’s default as well. Both standard and delicate shirts require cold water, so don't adjust the temperature for different shirts."

Use the same amount and type you usually do, and pour it into the machine before loading the clothes. If you’re washing a plain white shirt, use detergent with bleach in it. Otherwise, make sure the detergent is bleach-free. [5] X Research source"

It allows the water and detergent to clean the shirts while protecting them from getting caught on anything. Load your shirts made of silk, wool, cashmere, or other delicate materials into a bag before putting them in the machine. [6] X Research source Don't overload the bags.

      "content": "Shake the shirt out immediately after you remove it. As soon as the cycle is finished, take the dress shirt out. Hold it firmly by the collar and gently shake it a few times. This gets out all the crumples and avoids wrinkling when the shirt dries. [8] X Research source Don’t leave your clothes in the washing machine after the cycle is done. They’ll get wrinkled and musty. Take them out right away."

      "content": "Press the shirt while it’s still wet. Lay the shirt down flat on an ironing board. For the crispest results, use a hot iron on a low steam setting. Move the iron quickly to avoid damaging the shirt. [9] X Research source If you’re not experienced with ironing, set the iron to a high steam setting. This won’t give you the crispest result, but it avoids damaging the shirt. If you don’t have time to iron the shirt right away while it’s still wet, use a spray bottle and lightly wet the shirt before you iron it for better results. Ironing is optional. If you prefer, you can skip it and just let the shirt airdry."
