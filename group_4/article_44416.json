This puts excessive pressure on lower esophageal sphincter (the ring of muscle that controls the opening between your stomach and your esophagus). This allows acid and other stomach contents to enter your esophagus. Aim to eat smaller portions, and give yourself 10-15 minutes after finishing a dish to see if you really need a second serving.
