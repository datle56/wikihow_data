      "content": "Buy 1-2 E-Z Mender brackets, depending on how crooked your post is. An E-Z Mender bracket is a metal bracket specifically designed for fixing leaning fence posts. Purchase 1 bracket per post if the post just has a minor lean and 2 if it is leaning drastically or has a crack or other structural damage. These brackets are available at a home improvement center, garden center, hardware store, or online. [1] X Research source Note that this method will only work for 4 in (10 cm) by 4 in (10 cm) wooden fence posts that are driven directly into the soil. It won’t work for fence posts encased in concrete or posts that are bigger, since the brackets are designed to fit around the wood. An alternative to the E-Z Mender bracket is a Post Buddy stake, which works best if the post is rotted and broken at ground level because the tip is designed to sink into the wood itself. The steps for installation are essentially the same, though a Post Buddy can also work on rotten fence posts that are set in concrete."

      "content": "Push the tip of an E-Z Mender bracket into the ground at the base of the post. Place the pointy end of the bracket right up against the base of the leaning post. Ensure that the bracket is straight. [2] X Research source It’s very important to get the tip as close as possible to the base of the post in order to stabilize and support it below ground as well as above ground."

      "content": "Hit the bump on the side of the bracket with a mallet to drive it into the ground. E-Z Mender brackets have a bump called a nailing lug jutting out from the side, which has a flat surface approximately the size of a mallet. Use a mallet to hit this nailing lug, driving it into the earth, until it is even with the ground or won’t go any deeper. [3] X Research source You could use a mini sledgehammer to drive the bracket into the ground if you don’t have a mallet."

      "content": "Screw the bracket to the post using 1 in (2.5 cm) coated structural screws. Have someone push the leaning post up straight and support it so it sits flush in the bracket while you secure it in place. Use a power drill to drive 1 in (2.5 cm) coated structural screws through the screw holes in the sides of the bracket. [4] X Research source If you don’t have structural screws, you could use hot-dipped galvanized nails instead."

      "content": "Install another bracket on the other side of the post if you want more stability. Drive an additional E-Z Mender bracket into the ground on the other side of the post and screw it to the post if your post was leaning drastically or damaged. Skip this if the post is straight and stable after installing just 1 bracket. [5] X Research source If you used a Post Buddy stake as an alternative, you must install a second stake opposite the first one for optimal stability. They come in sets of 2 for this reason."

      "content": "Purchase 1 Fix-a-Fence post brace per leaning post. A Fix-a-Fence brace is a metal brace that is meant to be set in concrete and then screwed to a leaning fence post to straighten and stabilize it. Buy 1 per post you want to fix at a home improvement center, garden center, hardware store, or online. [6] X Research source This method works for wooden fence posts of any size that are set into concrete footings. You could also use it to straighten wooden posts set directly into the ground if you want the added stability of a brace set into concrete."

Dig it 8 in (20 cm) away from the post and 18 in (46 cm) deep. [7] X Research source The part of the Fix-a-Fence brace that goes in the ground is 18 in (46 cm) long, so that’s why you have to dig the hole 18 in (46 cm) deep. If you don’t have a clam-shell post digger, you can use a regular spade. Try to make the sides of the hole as vertical as possible and make the hole at least 3 times wider than the pole part of the Fix-a-Fence brace."

Screw the pole-shaped section into the hole underneath the short arm of the rectangular brace section.

You can use a pole or stick to press the concrete around the base of the brace if there are any air pockets or uneven spots."

Leave the brace alone for the full duration of time to allow it to cure solidly in place before attaching it to the fence post. [12] X Research source After the concrete is cured, you can cover it up with top soil to give it a more natural, landscaped look if you want."
