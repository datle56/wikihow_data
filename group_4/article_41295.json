      "content": "Follow a routine sleep schedule. For some people, snoring is the result of a frequently-changing or irregular sleep schedule. Working very long hours before sleeping, skipping a night's rest, or failing to sleep enough over long periods of time can leave the body extremely fatigued. When the body does get a chance to sleep, it \"crashes,\" sleeping especially long and hard. During this intense sleep, the muscles at the back of the throat relax more than they normally would, which makes snoring more likely. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source To avoid this state, try to get a full night's sleep starting at about the same time every night. Though everyone's sleep needs are different, most adults do best with about 7-9 hours of sleep. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Children and teens usually require somewhat more. Wait until bedtime to sleep. Naps are a great way to recharge your batteries when you have a stable sleep schedule, but they are counter-productive when trying to change sleeping habits. Do not nap at all during the day so that you can fall asleep at the appropriate time later."

      "content": "Avoid stimulation before bed. Use the bed only for sleep and sexual activity. Do not watch TV or look at your phone. About an hour before bed, turn off all of your electronics and dim the lights of your phone and computer, since your eyes are sensitive to the bluish light emitted by electronic screens. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Avoid stimulants after mid-day. Depending on the size of your body, the amount you ingest, and your general health, the effects of caffeine can remain active in your body for up to 5 to 10 hours after initial consumption. Avoid coffee and caffeinated teas and sodas. Avoid eating within 3 hours of going to bed. Avoid alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down your body. While this will help you fall asleep, alcohol also slows down your metabolism and interferes with your brain during its sleep cycles. You're likely to wake up more often if you've consumed alcohol before bed. Avoid heavy exercise 1-2 hours before bed. Doctors advise that you avoid a heavy cardio workout a few hours before you plan to go to bed; this can unsettle your circadian rhythm and make your sleep less restful. That said, light stretching and exercising, such as an evening walk, are probably useful in getting you ready to go sleep.

      "content": "Create an environment that helps you fall asleep. Keep your room dark at night. Sleep specialists note that your circadian rhythm is influenced by light and darkness. This means that many people have a hard time falling asleep when it's still light out, which happens in the summer thanks to daylight savings. At night, shut your blinds and curtains. Turn off bright overhead lights. Consider getting a blackout curtain that keeps any light from shining through. If it's still too bright or too much light is getting in, consider wearing a sleep mask. Keep your room cool—between 60 and 67 °F (16 and 19 °C) is ideal. [6] X Research source If you live in a dry climate, you may want to try running a humidifier in your bedroom as you sleep. Sensitive throats can sometimes be irritated by breathing in the dry air throughout the night. Turn on white noise. You can listen to some light music or put a fan on for some background noise."

The membranes of the throat and soft palate, the tissue at the back of the roof of the mouth, can be irritated by breathing in dust, pollen, dander, and other airborne particles—especially if you have allergies to these things. This irritation can lead to swelling of the throat membranes, narrowing the airway and making snoring more likely. Luckily, eliminating these irritants is usually a simple matter of keeping the bedroom and the bed itself as clean as possible. Here are a few pointers: [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Wash sheets and pillowcases every week. If you have pollen allergies, dry them in a dryer and not on the clothesline, or at least inside where there is less pollen. Replace old pillows every 6 months. Vacuum the room and clean surfaces (including ceiling fixtures) regularly. Keep animals out of the bed."

      "content": "Sleep on your side. In adults, snoring usually occurs when the soft palate and upper throat collapse during sleep, restricting airflow to the lungs and causing the characteristic \"rattling\" noise of snoring with each breath. When you sleep on your back, the positioning of your head and neck make it much easier for the soft palate to collapse on the tongue and upper throat. To start fighting a bad case of snoring, try sleeping on your side. This simple change is sometimes enough to drastically improve a bad case of snoring.

Propping your head by just a few inches during sleep can reposition your tongue and jaw, opening your airway and making snoring less likely. Try using more than one pillow, buying a thicker pillow, or simply folding your current pillow over on itself to give your head the extra elevation you need to stay snore-free.

If your sinuses are blocked when you go to sleep, your body may rely entirely on mouth-breathing (which is much more likely to cause snoring) while it's asleep. To prevent this, try to make a habit of clearing your sinuses before sleeping. One easy way to do this is simply to take a hot shower a few minutes before you get into bed; the hot water and warm, moist, air stimulate your sinuses to open.

In some cases, extra weight can make your throat and neck tissue bulkier, especially if you’re a man. Over time, you’re also at risk for developing a sleep disorder. [11] X Research source Talk to your doctor about a healthy weight for you. If you need to lose weight , eat a healthy diet of fresh produce and lean proteins and exercise for 30 minutes daily. However, talk to your doctor before changing your diet or exercise habits. Some helpful tips include: Increase the fiber in your diet. More fiber increases bowel regularity and helps you feel “full” longer. In other words, fiber can help decrease the amount of food you eat because you don’t get hungry as often. Good sources of fiber include brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgar wheat, kasha (buckwheat), and oatmeal. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Get more leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard greens, spinach, lettuces, beet greens into your diet. These are full of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and are low in calories. Fruits are also great sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other essential nutrients and make a great snack. Limit the amounts of fatty or red meats in your diet. Increase the amounts of fish and skinless poultry you eat. Avoid foods that are “white” like white bread and white rice. These foods have been processed and have lost a significant amount of their nutritional value. In general, try to avoid pre-packaged or prepared foods as well as most “fast foods.” These tend to have higher amounts of sugars, salts and fats added to “improve” their taste.

      "content": "Keep hydrated so your airway is less likely to get obstructed. When people are dehydrated, the secretions in their nose and throat naturally become thicker and sticker. In some cases, this can translate to a more obstructed airway and increased snoring. Drink at least 90–125 fluid ounces (2.7–3.7 L) of water daily. Staying hydrated can keep the tissues inside your mouth and nose moistened, which can help control breathing difficulties. [15] X Research source Different people's daily water needs can vary greatly based on their sex, size, and level of activity. In general, you'll know if you're getting enough water if you rarely feel thirsty and your urine is colorless or a light yellow. If you have trouble getting more water in your diet, try drinking a glass of water with each meal and then between each meal. Be sure as well to drink water before, during and after any exercise you may do."

The same sorts of chemicals that make it easier to get to sleep also usually relax the body's muscles, including those in the throat.
