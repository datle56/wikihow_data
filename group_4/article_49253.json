      "content": "Type a simple statement into Notepad. A section of PHP code begins and ends with bracketed PHP tags (“<?php” “?>”). “Echo” is a very basic statement (an instruction to the computer) in the PHP language that will output text to the screen. The text you want to echo must be enclosed in quotation marks and end in a semi-colon. The code should look something like <?php echo “Hello World!”; ?>."

      "title": "Save the file with name “hello world” and the extension .php.",
      "content": "Save the file with name “hello world” and the extension .php. This is done by navigating to File > Save As... In Notepad, add .php to the end of the filename and enclose in double quotations. This ensures the file will not be converted into a basic text file by Notepad. Without the quotation marks, the file will become hello world.php.txt. Alternatively, you can select the drop down menu under Save as type and change it to \"All Files (*.*)\" which will leave the name exactly how you type it and the quotes will not be needed. In TextEdit, no quotations marks are necessary, but a popup will appear asking you to verify that you want the file saved as .php. Make sure you save the file to your “server’s” document root directory. Typically this is the folder named “htdocs” in your Apache folder on Windows, or /Library/Webserver/Documents on Mac, but can be set by the user manually."

Also make sure that your file is saved into the correct directory."

Everything outside the two tags is treated as HTML and ignored by the PHP engine and sent to your browser the same as any other HTML.

In the case of an echo statement, you are telling the engine to print what is inside the quotes. The PHP engine itself never actually prints anything to your screen. Any output generated by the engine is sent to your browser as HTML. Your browser does not know that it's getting PHP output. As far as the browser is concerned, it's getting plain HTML."

The syntax for declaring a variable is “$myVariable = “Hello World!”;” The dollar sign ($) at the beginning tells PHP that $myVariable is a variable. All variables must start with the dollar sign, but the name of the variable can be anything. In the above example, the value is \"Hello World!\", and the variable is $myVariable. You're telling PHP to store the value at the right of the equal sign, into the variable at the left of the equal sign. A variable containing a text value is known as a string."

This is only the beginning of what can be accomplished with these variables. The two variables, $mySmallNumber, and $myLargeNumber are each assigned an integer value. The third variable, $myTotal, stores the added values of $mySmallNumber and $myLargeNumber. Since $mySmallNumber holds one numeric value, and $myLargeNumber holds a second numeric value, this means $myTotal holds the value of the first number added to the second number. This value can change with alterations to either of the included variables."
