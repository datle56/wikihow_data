Downloads: Videos you download from TikTok are saved to your phone. This includes video downloads, effects, and filters, as well as stickers and emojis. Your Drafts: If you save a lot of videos as drafts and do not post them, those videos are saved to your phone. Some users can rack up tens or hundreds of drafts.
