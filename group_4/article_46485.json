      "content": "Zote is an economical alternative to regular detergents. Grate a bar of pink or white Zote soap with a cheese grater, or grind it in a food processor. Mix it with a box of Borax (a laundry booster) and a box of baking soda to make your own detergent powder! [1] X Research source Use 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) for a light load and 2 tablespoons (28.6 grams) for a larger load of laundry. The iconic pink Zote soap has more gentle ingredients (less citronella oil), so it’s better for those with sensitive skin and to use on colored clothing. The white Zote soap has more whitening power and a stronger citronella scent. Choose the color that works better! [2] X Research source If you’re not interested in making your own detergent, Zote also has laundry flakes that can be directly added to the washer. If you’re handwashing your clothes, dissolve roughly 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of homemade detergent or the flakes in warm water. Once dissolved, soak the clothing in the water, rubbing out any stains with your fingers. Rinse and dry clothes as normal."

      "content": "The citronella and tallow in Zote soften fabrics. Cut a small, golf-ball-sized chunk from a bar of pink or white Zote soap.

      "content": "The high-fat content in Zote cleans brushes without drying them out. This works great for both paint brushes and make-up brushes! Cut a pink Zote bar into small chunks and set them in a pot. Fill the pot with water until it’s slightly above the soap. Allow it to boil, then wait until the soap becomes soft enough to squish into a paste. Pour out the excess liquid, mixing the resulting paste with 1 tablespoon (14.3 grams) of safflower oil. Smush the paste into a plastic or metal container. Swirl your dirty brushes on the soap and rinse with water to rid them of grime! [3] X Research source (Optional) Add two or three drops of essential oil to the paste to mimic other brush cleaners and leave a nice scent behind! Instead of pouring it out, save the excess liquid from the paste in a squirt or pump bottle to use as a counter or dish cleaner."

While it’s not going to get the absolutely toughest stains out like a regular dish soap, it’s great for everyday washing. Either wet a sponge on a bar of Zote, or dissolved Zote flakes in warm water to make a liquid dish soap. Boil grated Zote soap in hot water. Add a cup of vinegar and add stove burners or dishes with heavy grease. Let it sit off heat for three minutes and rinse. [5] X Research source"
