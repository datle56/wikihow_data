      "content": "Closed water inlet valve The inlet valve supplies water to your toilet tank. Professional plumber David Balkan notes that the water valve for a toilet is usually on the wall near the floor. If you accidentally turn the valve and shut off the water supply, your toilet tank won’t fill up and you won’t be able to flush your toilet. Other Symptoms: Empty toilet tank and no water running after you flush your toilet The Fix: Turn the valve to the left by a quarter-turn to open it completely, and listen for water refilling your tank. If the supply line is leaking , then replace it. If the inlet valve is turned on and there’s still no water, test another faucet in your bathroom. If your sink or tub also doesn’t work, then there may be an issue with your home’s main water supply line."

If the lever doesn’t move properly, then it won’t be able to lift up the flapper to flush your toilet. [1] X Research source Other Symptoms: Loose nut on the flush handle, loose or tight handle, or a broken flush arm inside the toilet tank The Fix: Take the lid off your toilet and turn the nut on the back of the flush handle counterclockwise to tighten it. If the lever arm assembly is cracked or broken, replace the handle assembly with parts that match the size of your toilet."

      "title": "Damaged float",
      "content": "Damaged float The float is part of your toilet’s fill valve, and it normally stops the water level before it gets too high in the tank. If the float is bent, obstructed, or broken, then it may stop filling the tank before it reaches the proper fill line and result in a weak flush. [2] X Research source Other Symptoms: Low water levels in your tank or toilet bowl or loose toilet handle The Fix: Take the lid off of your toilet and check the float, which either looks like a rubber balloon or a plastic cylinder on the fill valve. Bend the arm or use the adjustment screw to raise the float and increase the water level. If there’s damage, then replace the float or fill valve."

Patrick Johns, a home improvement specialist, says that if there’s an obstruction or if the chain has too much slack, the flapper won’t lift up all the way and could prevent your toilet from flushing. Other Symptoms: Loose toilet handle or holding down the handle for a long time to flush your toilet The Fix: Take the lid off your toilet tank and locate the chain running from the handle to the flapper. Hook the chain to a different hole on the flush handle arm, or attach it to a lower chain link. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Old or broken flapper The flapper is the round rubber piece at the bottom of your toilet tank. When the flapper starts to wear away or gets coated in residue, then it may not stay up when you flush your toilet. If the flapper drops back down too quickly, then it won’t let enough water into the toilet bowl to flush properly. [4] X Research source Other Symptoms: Having to hold down the toilet handle to flush completely or hearing water constantly running into the bowl [5] X Research source The Fix: Take the lid off your toilet and inspect the flapper for damage. If the flapper is cracked or covered in residue, then replace it with a new one that matches the size of your toilet."

Other Symptoms: Low water levels in your toilet bowl, or a damaged float or fill valve The Fix: Take the lid off of your toilet tank and look for a mark on the side of the tank or on the toilet’s fill valve. Adjust the fill valve to raise the water to the proper fill line. If you notice water leaking from the tank , then there may be an issue with one of the tank’s rubber seals. Drain your toilet tank and replace any damaged seals you find."

Schuelke notes that if residue and calcification builds up around these ports, then it can restrict the water flow and prevent your toilet from flushing fully. Other Symptoms: White buildup around the edge of your toilet bowl or water flowing straight down instead of at an angle The Fix: Put on a rubber glove and try to clean the ports with your fingers or a small cleaning brush. [6] X Research source Schuelke also mentions that adding dish soap to the toilet tank and flushing your toilet is a good hands-free approach to cleaning the ports."

Place the plunger in your toilet bowl so the cup fits completely around the hole in the bottom. Quickly move the handle straight up and down for about 20 seconds to help move the clog. Lift your plunger and let the water drain before trying to flush your toilet again. [7] X Research source If your toilet bowl is already filled with water, use a bucket to bail about half of the water out so it doesn’t overflow while you’re plunging."

The soap will help break apart the clog so it slips through your pipes easier. After that, pour a pot of hot water down the drain and try flushing your toilet. [8] X Research source Any liquid dish soap will work, but try using ones that are labeled extra strength for extra grease-fighting power. Avoid using boiling water because it could cause your toilet bowl to crack."

Slowly add 1–2 cups (240–470 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the bowl so it doesn’t overflow. Leave the baking soda and vinegar for about 30 minutes. Then, pour a pot or bucket of hot water directly into the toilet bowl to push the clog out from the pipes. [9] X Research source If you start pouring hot water but the water level keeps rising, then stop and try another method for removing the clog."

      "content": "Snake the toilet drain for removing deeper clogs . When you can’t reach a clog with other techniques, push the end of a drain snake into the bottom of your toilet bowl. Slowly extend the snake further into the drain until you hit a blockage. Once you feel it, turn the snake’s handle and gently push it further to break apart the clog. Once it’s clear, pull the end of the snake back out and slowly remove it from your toilet. [10] X Research source Avoid pulling out the snake while it’s extended because you could scratch or damage your toilet bowl. If you don’t have a drain snake, then unbend an old wire hanger and wrap the end with an old dishcloth so you don’t scratch your toilet bowl."

Your toilet may not fill with water if the inlet valve on the wall is turned off, so try turning it counter-clockwise to put it back on. If the toilet still doesn’t fill, then there may be an issue with the flush valve or float inside the tank. If your toilet tank doesn’t fill with water but you hear water running, then the issue may be a loose or damaged flapper at the bottom of the toilet tank."
