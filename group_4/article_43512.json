      "content": "Understand the blood test and the reasons to undergo testing. This test is called the Serotonin Test or the 5-HT level test and it measures the amount of serotonin in your blood. There are two main reasons a doctor would order this test. Serotonin Syndrome can be a side effect of taking two or more medications that increase the body’s level of serotonin. The symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome will come on soon after taking the affecting drugs, anywhere from minutes to a few hours. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Your doctor could also order the 5-HT level to rule out Carcinoid Syndrome. When carcinoid tumors are present, they begin to release large amounts of serotonin into the blood and you develop Carcinoid Syndrome as a result. This is a rare condition and generally effects people that are 60 years of age and older.

This test measures the amount of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the urine. 5-HIAA is a breakdown product of serotonin and indicates raised levels of serotonin in the body.

As they grow, carcinoid tumors secrete serotonin into the body and that excess generates a group of symptoms known as Carcinoid Syndrome.
