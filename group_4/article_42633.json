If you need to be with someone and they won't let you call, try to get someone else to call. If someone is on a bridge, holding a weapon, or otherwise threatening their own life, your first move needs to be to call emergency services . You should never try and handle this on your own. Mental health professionals, such as therapists or counselors, should be notified as soon as possible. If someone is adamant that you don't call the police, call or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (in the USA) at 988."

You do not have the skills or knowledge needed to \"fix\" someone with suicidal tendencies, so don't try. Just let them talk about their feelings, their desire to kill themselves, and their issues. Ask simple, kind questions: \"What's wrong?\" \"What is causing you to feel like this?\" \"How long have you been thinking about this?\" \"Tell me about your thoughts.\" [3] X Research source Never argue with someone or try and convince them not to kill themselves. You just need to listen and validate their distress . Don't tell someone, \"You have so much to live for.\" Someone contemplating suicide has already rejected this idea, deciding they don't have much to live for, and this will only reinforce the thought. [4] X Research source Instead, try asking them, “What has kept you fighting against ending your life so far?” and help them focus on what they value in life."

Let them know that you know \"things must be really awful right now,\" and that you are there to support them. You can admit that you don't have any answers, but still be there for them to rely on.
