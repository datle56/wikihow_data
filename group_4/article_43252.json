      "content": "Check your dog’s fur to spot adult fleas. Use your fingers to part your dog's fur so that you can see its skin, looking for signs of adult fleas. Fleas tend to prefer the base of the tail, the abdomen, and behind the ears, but they can be found anywhere on the dog. Adult fleas are about the size of a pencil lead. They are small, flat-bodied insects, and they range in color from reddish-brown to black. Keep in mind that fleas will move away from your fingers as you search your dog's fur, making them hard to spot. Most fleas live in the environment around the dog, so they may be hard to find in your dog's fur if it only has a mild infestation."

Flea dirt, or flea droppings, look like small black flecks, but they actually contain dried blood. If you dip the flea comb into a bowl of soapy water, you should see the flecks slowly change back to red. [7] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 31 March 2021. If the flecks remain black after being added to water, it’s probably regular dirt. You can also place the flecks on a damp cotton pad and monitor them to see if they change color. If a rusty red halo forms around the flecks, it's a sign that the flecks are flea dirt."

These chemicals are extremely dangerous, so they should only be used if you can’t get rid of the fleas any other way. Some flea killers come in the form of aerosol sprays, while bug bombs or foggers release on their own once you have activated them. This gives you time to leave the area so you’re not exposed to the chemicals. Wear a face mask to protect yourself while you’re using these chemicals, or have a professional exterminator come to your home. You will need to temporarily evacuate your home during this process, so have a plan for what you will do with your dog and other animals. This evacuation is usually about 3-6 hours, but be sure to read the label carefully to be sure."
