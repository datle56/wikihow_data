      "content": "Look for the word “STUDLESS” on the sidewall. Some snow tires have studs, while others don’t. If your tires say STUDLESS on the side in all capitals, it means that they’re studless snow tires. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for metal studs in your tires.",
      "content": "Check for metal studs in your tires. Just like the name suggests, studded snow tires use metal studs to give you the extra grip you need on the ground. Studded snow tires are common in areas that get snow and ice for long periods of time. [3] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Keep in mind that most studded snow tires are only legal during the winter months. Using studded tires in dry conditions can tear up the road, and you may get a fine if you use studded tires during the non-winter seasons."

      "title": "Snow tires have deep, square treads.",
      "content": "Snow tires have deep, square treads. A winter tire tread is the deepest of all tire treads. Usually, the tires will have square treads with small, zig-zagging sipes, or slits, on them. [4] X Research source Most snow tires are siped tires, but not all of them are. However, siped tires handle better in the snow, because the small slits give them more traction. When your snow tires have a tread of about 4/32 inches, it’s time to replace them. You can measure your tread depth with a tread depth measurement tool ."

      "content": "Winter tires stay flexible below 40 °F (4 °C). All-season tires and summer tires are made for warmer weather, so they’re flexible in the heat. However, as temperatures start dropping, they tend to harden up and have less grip on the road. Winter tires are built to stay flexible, even in colder temperatures. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Winter tires have more stopping power in the snow.",
      "content": "Winter tires have more stopping power in the snow. A winter tire’s deep tread gives it the braking power you need to stop in icy conditions. Since the deep treads allow for more traction, your car will stop faster and slip less in the winter.

      "content": "All season tires are not designed for deep snow or ice. The name “all season” is actually a bit of a misnomer—in fact, they should actually be called “3-season tires.” All season tires are great for wet and rainy conditions, but they tend to falter when it comes to the winter. Winter tires give you more grip in the ice and snow, and they’ll be more flexible during the colder months.

      "content": "The tires have deep grooves down the center. All season tires are a combination of winter tires and summer tires. When you look at the treads of an all-season tire, you’ll notice the same square, zig zagging tread pattern as a winter tire. However, you’ll also see 3 to 4 deep grooves down the center of the tire. These grooves help give the tire traction during dry conditions, which is how you know it’s rated for all seasons, not just winter. [11] X Research source Seeing “M + S” on your sidewall? This acronym stands for “mud and snow.” An “M + S” symbol usually means that the tire is an all season tire, not a snow tire."
