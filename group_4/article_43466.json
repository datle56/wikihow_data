      "content": "The original carrier has given your package to a partner for delivery. “Tendered to Delivery Service Provider” is a general tracking status that shipping carriers like DHL, FedEx, UPS, and 4PX use to show they’ve given your package to another carrier – usually the United States Postal Service (USPS) – to deliver to your address. [1] X Research source This carrier is often called the “last-mile” delivery service. Original carriers hand your package over to a delivery partner when they’re experiencing delays, need more resources, or don’t cover the package’s destination. [2] X Research source It’s common for shippers to rely on the USPS to make the final delivery of ground packages especially in rural areas. The USPS also occasionally relies on UPS and FedEx to transport packages by air. [3] X Research source"
