      "content": "Clear quartz amplifies other crystals, increasing energy in the bedroom.

Alternative: Rose quartz and smoky quartz are complementary crystals for a peaceful night’s sleep. At night, place either stone close to your chest to rid the body of repressed emotions and bring love into your life. [2] X Research source"
