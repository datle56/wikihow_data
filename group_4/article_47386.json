      "content": "Turn off the power and water to the washing machine. If you haven’t already, turn off the power to your washing machine at the breaker box to avoid the risk of electrocution. Then, find the red and white valves behind the washing machine—these are the water valves. Close them by turning them tightly clockwise. [1] X Research source Your washing machine will usually have its own circuit, so it shouldn’t affect the lights or anything else in the room. [2] X Research source Carefully slide the washing machine away from the wall as far as you can without pulling hard on the hoses so you'll be able to see the pipes and hoses. While you’re getting set up, it’s also a good idea to grab some extra towels and a bucket, as it’s likely more water will spill while you’re investigating the problem."

      "content": "Inspect the drain hose for damage and replace it if needed. Check the drain hose coming out of the washing machine. If you feel any water coming from the connection where the hose enters the washing machine, you may need to tighten the hose clamps or replace the hose. Also, check whether the hose is pulled out of the drain pipe—if it is, just replace it to fix the problem. [3] X Research source If the hose is in place, check whether it looks cracked, twisted, kinked, or crushed. If so, remove the old hose from the washing machine by using pliers to squeeze the clamps holding the hose in place. [4] X Research source Shimmy the hose off of the washing machine, then pull the free end out of the standpipe, or the tall pipe running vertically behind the washing machine. To install the new hose , push the washing machine end into place and secure the clamp, then slide the other end down into the standpipe as far as it will go without straining the hose. After replacing the hose, skip to the step on running a test cycle to see if the problem is fixed."

      "content": "Remove clogs from the drain hose. If you didn't see any damage to the hose, remove it from the washing machine, then shine a light down the hose. If you see a clog, use a straightened clothes hanger or a plumber’s snake to clear the blockage. [5] X Research source If there was no damage to the hose and you didn't see a clog, move to the next step. If you cleared a clog, jump to running a test cycle."

      "title": "Check for clogs in the drain pipe with a plumber’s snake.",
      "content": "Check for clogs in the drain pipe with a plumber’s snake. Clogs are the most common reason for washing machine drain overflows. [6] X Research source Push the cable on the plumber’s snake by hand into the standpipe behind your washer. Flip the locking latch at the end of the drain snake, then turn the handle with one hand, using the other hand to keep the snake firmly in place. [7] X Research source There will likely be a turn in the pipe, so you may have to back the cable up by about 6 in (15 cm) and push again a few times to get past it. [8] X Research source Keep going until you feel the clog break free or until you’ve extended the entire length of the snake cable. Then, turn the handle the opposite direction to pull the snake back in. If you hit a clog, it will probably feel squishy or spongy. If you hit a turn in the pipe, it will feel very solid."

      "content": "Replace the drain hose and run a test cycle. Slide the end of the drain hose back into the standpipe as far as it can go without straining the hose. Then, turn on the breaker to the washing machine. Without adding clothes, start a cycle on the smallest load you have available. After a little water fills the washing machine, hit the “Stop” or “Cancel” button and let the water drain out. [9] X Research source Have a large trash can nearby or direct the hose to a laundry sink if it does start to overflow. If this happens, you probably need a plumber. If it doesn’t overflow, try again, but let the water run a little longer this time."

      "content": "Call a plumber if the problem isn’t fixed. Unfortunately, this isn’t always a problem you can DIY. Sometimes, the clog will be too far underground for a regular snake to reach. Other times, the issue will be plumbing related, like you have the wrong size drain pipe or your standpipe is the wrong height. In those cases, it’s best to have a professional come out and take a look. Modern washing machines tend to drain more quickly than older ones, so they require at least a 2 in (5.1 cm) drain pipe. These are standard now, but if you have an older home with 1 1 ⁄ 2 in (3.8 cm) pipes, you’ll probably need to get them replaced to stop the overflow problem. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Turn off the power to the washer, then clean up the water. If your washing machine is overflowing, go to the circuit box and turn off the power—you don’t want to deal with a flood around active electricity. Use towels, a mop, or a wet-dry vac to clean up as much of the water as possible. Then, use fans and humidifiers to dry the area thoroughly. [11] X Research source Turning off the power should stop the flow of water, since the water is pushed out of the washing machine by a pump. But if you want, you can turn off the water for extra peace of mind."

The pipe could be corroded or clogged deep underground, or tree roots could be growing into the pipe. The problem could also be that your pipes aren’t the right size and need to be replaced. [12] X Research source It’s best to have the problem evaluated by a licensed plumbing professional early on—otherwise, repeated flooding could make your home more susceptible to mold or water damage."

      "title": "Drain overflows are a common issue with newer washers.",
      "content": "Drain overflows are a common issue with newer washers. They tend to drain at a higher volume than older machines, which can overwhelm the pipes. Often, the problem is that years of buildup have clogged the pipes, and you didn’t notice because your old machine drained slowly enough for the pipes to handle it. If your drain pipe is less than 2 in (5.1 cm), you’ll probably need to have it replaced by a professional so it can handle the volume from the washer."

      "content": "Maybe, but only with caution. Drain cleaner may help remove small clogs from your washing machine drain. [13] X Research source However, if the clog doesn’t break up, that drain cleaner will still be sitting in the pipe. Not only can that damage the pipe, but it could be dangerous if you or a plumber needs to snake out the drain. It’s safer to stick to the approach described above. Do not pour drain cleaner directly into your washing machine as it could damage the interior, including rubber gaskets and plastic hoses. Afterward, run a cycle the washing machine on a cycle without clothes to make sure any drain cleaner that might have backed up into the machine is fully rinsed away—otherwise, it could stain your clothes."

      "content": "Clean the filter inside of your washing machine every 3 months. Grigorian says, “Most washers have a filter on the pump motor, which you should clean out every 3 months.” He recommends putting down a towel to prevent water spilling, then he says to “use the small hose beside the filter to empty every ounce of water before you take the filter out.” Once you’ve drained the filter, Gregorian says, “Turn the latch counterclockwise and remove the filter. Then, rinse out any debris, put the filter back in, and turn it clockwise to tighten it.”"

Each time you clean your washing machine filter, disconnect your drain hose from the back of the washing machine and check it for clogs. Lint and other debris can get trapped in there, increasing your risk of overflow issues.

If the washing machine is pushed too close to the wall, it could crush the drain pipes behind it, especially during a vigorous spin cycle. To prevent this, be sure to keep the machine pulled slightly away from the wall. [15] X Research source Be sure it’s not so far away from the wall that it strains the hoses, or they could pull away from the machine when it’s running."

      "content": "Reduce lint with garment bags and correct washer settings. If you’re washing an item that might produce a lot of lint, like a fuzzy scarf or a sweater, you can help cut down on how much lint goes into your drain line by putting the item in a mesh garment bag before you wash it. The bag will help hold the lint, and you can just rinse out the bag afterward. [16] X Research source Using the appropriate washer setting for each load can also help cut down on lint. For instance, if you’re using a heavy-duty wash on delicate objects, the items can be damaged, sending lint, threads, or even small pieces of fabric into the water lines."

      "content": "Don't use too much detergent. Storey says that most people use around 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 3 cup (59–79 ml) of laundry detergent, but you shouldn’t use more than about 2 US tbsp (30 ml) per load. He says, “Washing machines have enzymes that break down dirt, but if you use too much detergent, those enzymes will build up and create a residue.” In addition to leading to clogs, Storey says, “That enzyme residue becomes food for mold and bacteria, allowing them to grow inside your washing machine.”"
