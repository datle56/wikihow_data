      "content": "Use an old license plate to create an interesting decorative piece. It would be easy enough to just hang the old license plate up, which might be enough for you if it's something that brings up nice memories for you. But don't be afraid to get creative—especially if you've got several old license plates. [1] X Research source For example, you might cut several license plates and glue them together so that the letters spelled out a special word or message. You could also make a collage of pieces of several license plates that represented trips you've taken or places you've lived."

      "content": "Bend the end of the license plate to create an interesting bookend. Since this project doesn't require any cutting, it's something you can do with kids. All you need to do is measure about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from the end, then bend the license plate over the straight edge of a table or countertop. Stick the bent end under the books and the rest of the license plate will hold them upright in place on the shelf. [2] X Research source Use a ruler and a marker to draw a straight line where you want to bend so you can make sure it's even."

      "content": "Attach an old license plate to a handle for a unique dust pan. If you've got some scrap wood, plastic, or metal that you could use as a handle, you only have to bend the sides of the license plate up to make a unique dustpan that all of your friends will ask about. Just find some screws or other hardware that you can use to attach the bent license plate to the handle. [3] X Research source Use a wood block to easily bend the license plate. Decide where you want to bend it, set the wood block down at that spot, and bend the plate up along the block."

[4] X Research source You could also use actual clipboard hardware that you bolt onto the license plate if you want something sturdier. If you want to get really fancy, you could even add a pen holder to it ."

      "content": "Turn your old license plate into a musical addition to your yard or patio. Drill some holes into the bottom of the license plate to build a wind chime . Hang objects from the holes, such as old spoons or pieces of scrap metal or glass. Take care to find objects that make pleasing tones when they bump into each other. Use the pre-drilled top holes to attach a chain or some twine to hang your wind chime when you're done. [5] X Research source Pay attention to the distance of your holes. The further apart they are, the harder the wind will have to be blowing for your wind chime to make any noise."

Individual letters and numbers make great magnets—all you have to do is stick a magnet square on the back and you're all set. [6] X Research source Remember to sand down the edges after you cut—otherwise, they'll be dangerously sharp."

      "content": "Drill some hooks into the license plate and you'll never lose your keys again. All you need for this one is a few metal hooks, although you could also use plastic hooks with strong adhesive. Clean the license plate well and attach your hooks to the bottom. Hang it by the door and your keys will always be ready to go when you are. You could also mount the license plate on a piece of wood and use that for your hooks if you don't want to drill into the license plate itself."

If you have a spare scrap of wood, cut it in a circle, then bend your old license plate around it and voila —a pencil cup with a little personality and vintage flair. Just find some way to attach the license plate to the piece of wood. Strong glue might work, but you could also use nails or bolts. [7] X Research source If you've got the tools and you want your cup to look more polished, weld the two ends of the license plate together to seal the cup."

Bolt the license plate to the wood so it stays on securely. Drill a hole in the center of the wood for water to drain and add an old lid at the bottom for a water dish if you want to set the planter on a solid surface. [8] X Research source If the planter's going to be hanging outside, attach chains from the pre-drilled holes at the top of the license tag. If you have several license plates, you could even make several planters and hook them together to create a larger hanging basket."

This project is a little more complicated, but if you're already familiar with basic woodworking and know how to make a box , it's pretty easy. Instead of using wood for the long sides of the box, just use license plates instead. [9] X Research source You could also simply bolt the license plate onto the side of a wooden box you've already made to give it a vintage vibe."

Typically, you can't just drop a license plate in your curbside recycling bin—you've got to take it to a scrap metal yard. Scratch, bend, or break the plate before you do this so it can't be used again. [11] X Research source There are a few curbside recycling programs that take old license plates, so it's worth a call to make sure. If you can just pitch the plate in your recycling bin, you'll save a lot of time and effort. [12] X Research source Some motor vehicle departments are willing to take care of the recycling for you—all you have to worry about is postage. Call or check your local motor vehicle department's website to see if this is a service they offer. [13] X Research source"
