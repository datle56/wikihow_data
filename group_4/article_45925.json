      "content": "Make sure the gun is empty before locking it up. Take out the magazine if it has one, then double check that the chamber is empty. If your gun has a safety, put that on as well. To follow gun safety rules, always treat every gun like it’s loaded, even if you know it isn’t. Never point a gun at someone else, and keep your firearms away from children at all times."

      "content": "Push the cable through the gun so it can’t be fired accidentally. If you’re locking up a pistol, rack the slide to keep the chamber open. Then, slide the end of the cable through the ejection port of the gun. [1] X Research source For a shotgun or a rifle, thread the cable lock through the ejection port and out of the loading port. If you’re locking up a revolver, thread the cable through the barrel if possible. If not, thread the cable through 2 chambers in the cylinder instead. You can also thread the cable around the frame."

      "content": "Insert the cable into the lock mechanism to lock your gun. Grab the end of the cable lock that you pushed through your gun and connect it to the locking mechanism of the cable lock. Take the cable lock key and twist it clockwise to lock the cable lock to itself. Make sure that the cable lock is secure by tugging on the locking mechanism after you lock it. If the cable releases and opens up, try locking it again. Some cable locks have a 3-digit combo instead of a key. If yours has a combination lock, simply scramble the numbers to lock it."
