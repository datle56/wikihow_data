      "title": "Feeling too comfortable makes you more drowsy.",
      "content": "Feeling too comfortable makes you more drowsy. Study in a hard chair at a desk and sit up straight, rather than leaning up against some pillows in your bed or nestled up under a blanket on the couch. You don’t have to make yourself uncomfortable, but just avoid getting too cozy while you study. If you like to study at home, make yourself a dedicated study space . This could be a corner of your room with a desk and a chair or a kitchen table. Wherever you can concentrate without being too comfortable is great! Studying in a study hall or classroom? See what fellow readers recommend on the wikiHow forum post , \"I keep falling asleep in class!! How do you stay awake?\""

      "content": "This keeps you out of a single comfort zone that can make you tired. Rather than always studying in the same place, switch it up every time to improve your concentration and help your brain remember information better. For instance, one day, study at a coffee shop, then the next day, study at home in the kitchen. [1] X Research source Choose locations that fit your studying style and personality. For example, if you study best in silence, pick a library or quiet room, whereas if you prefer background noise, opt for a cafe or common area."

      "content": "The right lighting helps your brain focus on the data it’s absorbing. Rather than reading by a dim lamp or in a dark room, brighten up your study area to trick your brain into thinking it’s still daytime and making it feel more energized. Turn on as many lights as possible in the room, including overhead lights and lamps. [2] X Research source If your space doesn’t have much lighting, relocate to a brighter area, if possible."

      "title": "Things like noises and phones create external distractions.",
      "content": "Things like noises and phones create external distractions . Figure out what’s preventing you from being able to focus, whether it’s the Instagram alerts on your phone or the people talking at the table next to you. Then, eliminate those things so your brain isn’t distracted from studying. For instance, put your phone on silent or move to a quieter area. You can also turn your phone off, leave it in a different room, or put it on “Do Not Disturb” mode, so you don’t receive any texts or notifications. If you’re easily distracted by surfing the Internet, use an app or Internet browser extension that lets you set controls to block certain websites for a set period of time so you aren’t tempted."

      "title": "The right music can help your brain process and retain new info.",
      "content": "The right music can help your brain process and retain new info. Turn on the radio or play music from your phone or computer while you study to keep you alert. Choose songs that are fast-paced or lively, like pop or dance music, rather than slow, sad songs, which will bring down your mood and energy. [3] X Research source If you’re in a public place, use headphones to listen to the music of your choice. Look for upbeat playlists online or on a music app. You can also find premade playlists with music specifically for studying."

      "content": "You’re less likely to fall asleep if you listen to your own voice. It doesn’t matter whether you’re reading a chapter of a textbook or studying your notes. Read the material out loud to help yourself memorize it without getting drowsy. [4] X Research source If you don’t want to read everything out loud, you can also try talking to yourself when you study. For example, when you finish studying a topic, say out loud: “Okay, I finished studying for my history test, now I can study for the English exam!”"

      "content": "Mint is linked to enhanced cognitive function. Pick your favorite mint flavor like spearmint, peppermint, or wintermint. Pop a piece of gum in your mouth while you study to increase blood flow to your brain and increase your mental arousal. [5] X Research source Keep a pack of mint-flavored gum in your backpack or pencil case so you always have it with you when you’re studying."

      "title": "Protein gives you energy without making you sleepy like carbs do.",
      "content": "Protein gives you energy without making you sleepy like carbs do. Snack on foods that are primarily composed of protein, like nuts, meat, or cheese, which fuel your body longer because they aren’t as easily digested as carbs. For example, choose trail mix, beef jerky, or string cheese to eat while you work. [6] X Research source Avoid sugary foods or drinks, like cookies or soda, along with carb-heavy foods, like potato chips. These might give you a quick boost, but you’ll crash later on. Try to eat every 2 to 3 hours, even if it’s just something small, to avoid low blood sugar, which makes you feel sleepy."

      "title": "Stay hydrated",
      "content": "Stay hydrated to avoid feeling drowsy or sluggish. Aim to drink at least 2 L (2,000 mL) of water a day. Keep a full bottle of water with you and sip on it as you study. This helps the blood flow in your brain and makes you feel more alert. [7] X Research source Avoid alcohol, particularly on days when you're studying or the day before. Drinking alcohol regularly can negatively affect your brain function along with dehydrating you."

      "title": "Caffeine",
      "content": "Caffeine stimulates your central nervous system and makes you feel alert. Drink a mug of coffee to wake yourself up quickly, as caffeine prevents the cells that make you feel tired from reaching your brain. Have the equivalent of 200 mg of caffeine, which is 12 oz (.35 L) of coffee or 24 oz (.7 L) of tea, for example, over the course of 24 hours. Be aware that coffee and other caffeinated drinks can actually be dehydrating, so you should drink water with them, too. Avoid drinking coffee or consuming anything with caffeine, like chocolate, soda, or tea, within 6 hours of when you plan to go to bed or you may have trouble falling asleep. Don’t consume more than 200 mg of caffeine in a day. Too much caffeine can be very dangerous for your heart and can also worsen existing conditions, like anxiety or depression. Avoid energy drinks and pills that contain caffeine and/or chemicals. While quick fixes are tempting, they can have dangerous side effects, like increased anxiety or even heart problems.

      "content": "Try what’s known as the Pomodoro technique to keep yourself on track. Set a timer to work without any distractions for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat those intervals for however long you’d like to study. [9] X Research source Use your 5-minute breaks to relax and recharge your brain. Do something unrelated to what you’re studying, like stretching out your body or watching a funny YouTube video. Take a longer 30-minute break after you complete 4 intervals. Try to keep each total study session to no more than 5 hours long. If you study for longer than that, you’ll likely get burnt out."

      "title": "Short naps",
      "content": "Short naps boost your memory and alertness. Lay down on the couch or get into bed if you’re at home for a quick power nap. If you’re at the library or in a classroom, rest your head on the desk in a comfortable position to doze. Set your alarm for no more than 20 minutes later so you wake up feeling refreshed instead of drowsy. [10] X Research source If possible, choose a spot that’s quiet and dark to take your nap, which will help you get better quality sleep. Make sure you're getting at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night, too. Naps are a good boost but they aren't a substitute for uninterrupted sleep."

      "title": "This improves your concentration and mood.",
      "content": "This improves your concentration and mood. Go for a short walk or jog , do some bodyweight exercises, or take a quick yoga class, for example. Move your body to wake up all of your muscles and release proteins in your brain that improve your memory . [11] X Research source If you can, do your exercise outside for even more benefits. Fresh air is an instant energy boost. Instead, you can meditate for 10 minutes. You can also find ways to incorporate exercise into your studying. For instance, swap your chair for a stability ball to work your core while you sit, or do stretches at your desk while you read. If you’re studying in intervals, try taking an exercise break after each one. For example, after studying for 25 minutes, do 5 minutes of bodyweight exercises like pushups and jumping jacks."

      "title": "The variety helps your brain refocus on the new subject.",
      "content": "The variety helps your brain refocus on the new subject. Instead of doing a marathon study session of 1 topic, break your study time up and change the topic after each break so you don't burn out on 1 subject. For example, study calculus for the first hour, then switch to physics. If you’re studying in timed intervals, switch the topic you’re studying after each interval. If you're only studying for 1 class, like English, change the specific material you're reviewing if possible. For instance, start with Shakespeare, then move to Chaucer."

      "content": "This makes studying less boring and monotonous. Get some friends or classmates together to study as a group . Work on practice problems out loud, discuss different topics, or quiz each other to make studying more lively and engaging. [12] X Research source Keep your study group to 3 to 6 people. Too many people can become distracting or difficult to manage. Stay on task by setting group goals for each study session, like finishing 2 chapters of a textbook or covering 1 topic. Otherwise, it may be tempting to just waste time talking or goofing off.You can also do meditation for 10minutes"

      "content": "If you’re not sleeping well, it’s harder to stay awake while you study. Pick a bedtime that allows you to sleep for 7-8 hours every night . Stick to the same sleep schedule, so you’re brain is sleepy at the same time every night. [13] X Research source Note that this is how much sleep the average person needs. Some people need a few more hours to feel rested and others do fine with less. The most important thing is to be consistent with your sleep. If you feel good with 6 hours of sleep a night or need up to 9, that’s fine too."
