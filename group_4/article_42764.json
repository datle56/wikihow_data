However, you might prefer an oil if your skin tends to be dry because it's more moisturizing. Read and follow the directions on the label so you know you’re using your product correctly. Some tanning lotions have a low SPF, such as an SPF 8, that can help protect your skin as it tans. These are a great option because they’ll help you get the darker look you want with less skin damage. Using an indoor tanning lotion outdoors may increase your risk of skin cancer because these lotions are designed to enhance UV rays. Keep in mind that there are more UV rays outdoors than in a tanning bed even on a cloudy day. Additionally, don't use baby oil because it can tan your skin too quickly and cause damage."
