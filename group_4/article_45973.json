    {
      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. First, determine what size wire you have. Use an online chart to make sure you have the right size crimp beads for your wire. Take into consideration how many strands of wire or thread you will be crimping at once, as this will increase the size of bead you’ll need. [1] X Research source For example, if you are using one 0.020” (0.51 mm) piece of wire, you will need a bead with a diameter of 0.04” (1.02 mm). But, if you are using two strands of wire, you will need a bead with a diameter of 0.08”."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add an end piece to your wire.",
      "content": "Add an end piece to your wire. To secure one end of the wire so that your beads don’t fall off, you’ll need some sort of an end piece, such as a clasp. When you are ready to attach a clasp, first thread the end of your beading wire (jewelry cable) through a crimp bead and then through the eye of the clasp. Your design might call for other kinds of end pieces, such as a closed or solid jump ring or extender chain. The same methods apply for these as for clasps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Form a loop.",
      "content": "Form a loop. Form the loop through the clasp and crimp bead. After threading the crimp and clasp, feed the wire back through the crimp bead, forming a loop. It is a good idea to leave a tail of wire a couple of inches longer than you think you need so you will have some wire to work with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slide the crimp bead down the wire.",
      "content": "Slide the crimp bead down the wire. Move the crimp bead close to the end of the clasp or end piece. Check the crimp bead and make sure it is not too close to the clasp or end piece. You want to have a small loop around the clasp or end piece, but not so small that it holds the clasp so tightly that it cannot move freely. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Flatten the bead.",
      "content": "Flatten the bead. Use crimping pliers to flatten the bead. Squeeze the beads with the flatter back channel of the crimping pliers that is closest to the handle. Gently but firmly squeeze the pliers closed. This will both flatten and place a dent in the middle of the crimp bead so that it resembles the letter “C”."
    },
    {
      "title": "Round the bead.",
      "content": "Round the bead. Round it with crimping pliers. Place the dented crimp bead in the front, rounder channel of the crimping pliers, closest to the tip. Position the “C” upright so that when you close the pliers and squeeze, the bead will be folded closed right on the dent (closing the “C” into an “O”). Squeeze gently but firmly and until the crimp bead has closed tightly around the wire. [3] X Research source Tug gently to make sure the wire doesn't pull free. If necessary, use pliers to make it close tighter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use chain or needle nose pliers.",
      "content": "Use chain or needle nose pliers. If you don’t have a pair of crimping pliers, you can use regular pliers. They get the job done, but they won’t give you the same round, uniform crimps that crimping pliers will. To use these pliers, simply grasp the crimp bead with the flat section of the pliers and squeeze gently but tightly to smash the crimp bead flat onto the wire. Only use flat pliers or the flat section of pliers. The teeth in these pliers will also leave grooves on the surface of the crimp bead."

      "title": "String your decorative beads.",
      "content": "String your decorative beads. Use whatever beads you are designing your bracelet, necklace, or other piece of jewelry with. Thread your first bead onto the wire. Thread the extra tail of wire through the bead hole. Use your flush cutters to cut off the loose end of the cord as close as possible to the bead. Thread the rest of your beads according to your design until you reach the other end. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tighten your beads.",
      "content": "Tighten your beads. When you are ready to attach your final clasp to the end of your piece, thread the crimp bead and clasp just like before, but now you will want to tighten all of your beads by pulling on the tail end of the loose wire. This will snug all your beads up together, leaving no gaps in your design. [5] X Research source You will need to leave a small, finger-nail length gap between the beads if you have long tube beads in your design. You need to make sure the beads and wire make the small circumference around a wrist if you are making a bracelet. If you need more leverage to pull the wire tight, use your pliers; one to hold the clasp and the other to grasp and pull the wire."

      "title": "Add a crimp cover for a nice touch.",
      "content": "Add a crimp cover for a nice touch. If you want to hide your crimp beads, you can get crimp covers. A crimp cover looks like a larger, round bead that goes on top of the crimp bead or tube to give it a professional finish. To add a crimp cover, simply slide it over the crimp bead and squeeze it shut with a pair of pliers. [6] X Research source"
