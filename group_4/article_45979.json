[1] X Research source Don’t dry it completely, warns Kosakowski, or the curls may not form properly. [2] X Expert Source Sarah Kosakowski Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 September 2021. Leave your hair a little damp—about 90 percent dry. Flexi rods work best on wet or damp hair to create a stronger, lasting curl. If you aren’t going to wash your hair before using flexi rods, use a spray bottle of water to dampen it slightly."

Apply leave-in conditioner or moisturizing cream to hydrate your hair, which will help your heatless curls look more defined and control frizziness. After hydrating, apply a mousse for extra grip—especially if your hair is naturally straight. [3] X Research source For thick hair , apply moisture as you section your hair, not before."

      "title": "Use hair clips to divide your hair into 4-6 sections so it’s easier to curl.",
      "content": "Use hair clips to divide your hair into 4-6 sections so it’s easier to curl. Divide your hair evenly into at least four sections using a hairbrush or wide-toothed comb . Coil each section toward the scalp with your finger and hold it in place with a hair clip . Remember, this is just to keep the rest of your hair out of the way while you’re working with one section. [4] X Research source If you have natural hair, detangle each section and apply a moisturizing product as you go. Larger clips work well with longer or thicker hair."

      "title": "Start with smaller rods for small, tight curls and bigger rods for larger curls.",
      "content": "Start with smaller rods for small, tight curls and bigger rods for larger curls. The wider the rod, the looser the curl will be! The smallest flexi rod is typically 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) and larger rods can go all the way up to 7 ⁄ 8 inch (2.2 cm). For shorter hair, smaller rods are best. If you feel the rods you have are too long, instead of cutting them, fold them extra times after wrapping your hair around them. To maintain short, very tight coils, use cold-wave perm rods . They will allow you to clip in hair for a firmer hold."

      "content": "Separate a small lock from a back section and remove any tangles. If you have thick hair or want tighter coils, separate smaller locks of hair for each flexi rod. Use larger chunks of hair if you have thin hair or want looser coils, says Kosakowski. [5] X Expert Source Sarah Kosakowski Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 3 September 2021. Typically, a square inch of hair should work. [6] X Research source Apply a small amount of gel to each lock if you have naturally frizzy hair."

      "title": "Wrap the end of the lock around the flexi rod to secure it.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the lock around the flexi rod to secure it. Wind the end of the hair tightly around the end of the rod at least once around to secure it. The end of the hair must be tightly looped so that the flexi rod doesn’t come out as your hair dries and becomes more slippery. Make sure to begin at the end of the flexi rod so that you can use the rest of the length to spiral your hair."

      "title": "Roll the flexi rod in a spiral up the lock of hair until you reach the root.",
      "content": "Roll the flexi rod in a spiral up the lock of hair until you reach the root. Turn the rod vertically and twist to spiral your hair around it in the direction you want the curl to go. Make sure your hair stays smooth and secure as you twist. Do not roll the rod straight up the hair horizontally or let the hair wrap over itself, as this will increase drying time and produce weaker curls. Longer hair will require longer flexi rods."

      "title": "Bend the flexi rod at the root of your hair to secure the coil in place.",
      "content": "Bend the flexi rod at the root of your hair to secure the coil in place. Bend the top of the flexi rod in half to secure it in place. Bend in the opposite direction of the spiral of hair for a more secure hold. Depending on your hair’s length and thickness, you may be able to bend up the bottom of the flexi rod as well."

      "content": "Repeat this process throughout your hair. Continue twisting small pieces of hair from the section around flexi rods. When one section is complete, move on to the next one. Keep going until all sections are complete and all your hair is securely in flexi rods. [7] X Research source If you plan to keep your flexi rods in overnight, wrap your hair in a satin wrap, bonnet , or other soft cloth to prevent frizz."

If you’re not going to bed, sit under a hooded dryer for 30-45 minutes to speed up the process. Longer or thicker hair will take more time to dry. If you begin the process with dry hair and dampen it, the drying time will be shorter."

      "content": "Uncoil the rod in the opposite direction that you twisted it in. Use the same twisting movement as you did when putting the rods in, but twist away from the scalp. Gently unravel the hair from the rod completely before moving to another rod. Do not pull the rods straight out of your hair—you could tangle or lose your curl."

Once you have removed all the rods, run your fingers gently through your hair to break up the tight coils. Separate the curls gently and let them naturally come apart. [9] X Research source Only separate as much as you need to. If you brush your hair out too much, you’ll lose the curl shape you created with the heatless curling rods."
