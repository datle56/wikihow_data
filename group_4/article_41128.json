      "content": "Change up your routine. You may be most likely to fantasize when doing mindless tasks, like washing the dishes. Rather than sticking to the same routine or doing tasks in the same order each day, mix it up. This will add spice to your day, and help your brain gain more focus and attention. For example, if you usually wake up, workout, make brunch, then clean the house on Sunday, try something new. Go out to eat, exercise at night, or clean first thing in the morning."

      "title": "Avoid multitasking.",
      "content": "Avoid multitasking. In a fast-paced society, multitasking has become the norm as people try to accomplish and complete too many tasks in a short time frame. Brains are very fluid, and when you train your brain to function in such a way, you’ll lose your ability to focus. Lack of focus leads to distractions through daydreaming or thinking about other things. Eliminate the habit of multitasking from your life and start focusing on one task at a time. Turn off all of your distractions and commit your attention to one task at a time. The moment you feel your thoughts start to wander, stop what you're doing, take a five minute break, and come back to the same task."
