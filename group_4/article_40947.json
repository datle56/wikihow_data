Chances are, you've taken on too big of a project or started too quickly. Take your time and slow down. Try to take one step at a time and remind yourself that you are working towards your goal.

      "content": "Put in the time. You may need to put in more time every day or week, depending on your goals. Or, you may only need to meet a deadline or step every few months or years if it's a long-term goal. Decide in advance how much time you need to devote towards your goal and hold yourself accountable. For example, if you want to learn to play a certain song, you might give yourself a goal of playing an hour a day. After you've played the hour, track the time in a calendar, notebook, or tracker application on your phone. This will let you see not only what and how much you’ve done, but also when you did it or what was going on if you didn’t do it.

For example, if you want to put in an hour a day, but can't do it one particular day, simply hold yourself accountable for making it up. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Reward yourself through reinforcement. When you meet goals or deadlines, reinforce that successful behavior. There are two types of reinforcement, positive and negative. Both are rewards that should keep you motivated and dedicated to achieving your goals. With positive rewards, you add or earn something desirable. With negative rewards, you remove something unpleasant. For example, if you get a cookie every time you complete a task, you'll be more likely and willing to complete the task in the future. This is positive reinforcement. With negative reinforcement, if you don't have to do an unpleasant chore every time you complete a task, you'll also be willing and likely to do the task in the future."

With positive punishment, you add something unpleasant to prevent you from missing your deadlines or goals. With negative punishment, you remove something desirable. For example, if you didn't meet your goal of not eating dessert, you could punish yourself positively (by making yourself do 50 sit ups) or negatively (by not letting yourself watch your favorite television show)."

Don't worry about punctuation, complete sentences, or grammar. Instead, write whatever you feel like. This can reduce stress and help you come up with solutions to your problems. [6] X Research source Your journal is also useful for evaluating your goals. For example, maybe you're unsure why you have to accomplish a specific step or small project.

      "content": "Share your list of goals and objectives with a friend. Simply let your friend know what you're trying to accomplish and why. Studies have shown the positive effects of accountability and public commitment in goal achievement. People who share a written list of goals and weekly progress reports with others accomplish more than those with unwritten goals. Letting a friend or several friends know about your goals is an especially good idea if the goal is social in nature. For example, if your goal is to smoke 5 fewer cigarettes a day, let your friends know, especially if you usually smoke together."

For example, if you're trying to learn another language, you could download a language app and use it as a reminder to keep you on track. Physical space is important towards achieving your goals. For instance, if you want to improve your painting skills, you'll need to have a study that's already prepared for you to start painting. If it's already set up with the needed supplies, you'll be more likely to work towards any painting goals. [7] X Research source"

This is especially true if your goal is long-term and there's no immediate reward. Return to your goals and break them into smaller, manageable goals. This will keep you motivated. For example, if you're working on a book or an advanced degree, which can take years, break down the goals. You might try spending 6 months collecting research materials, then another 6 months interviewing people, and the following 6 months into combining the interviews and research.

Maybe you're feeling sick, have other things on your mind, or simply can't focus. These are understandable obstacles to sticking with your daily goal. Have alternatives to work on for when you're in these kind of moods. This way, you can keep working towards your goal. For example, if you're trying to learn a new language, but don't feel like putting in an hour towards vocabulary and translations, try an alternative. You might watch a documentary about the country where the language is spoken or watch a foreign movie in that language, with the subtitles."
