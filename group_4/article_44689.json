      "content": "Call for help immediately. If you experience any of the signs of testicular torsion, it is absolutely vital to call for help as soon as possible because you have a 4 to 6 hour window before damage begins to occur. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This can minimize your risk of losing your testicle or harming your ability to have children.

This can be a particular problem in the wilderness. Getting to the highest point visible may help you. If no one has phone reception, get to the nearest ranger station. Rangers often have satellite phones and medical equipment that may help comfort you while you wait for emergency medical personnel. Testicular torsion requires medical treatment and often surgery, so it’s vital that you contact medical personnel as soon as possible.

      "content": "Secure the testicle. Testicles that are not secured to the inside of the scrotum can cause torsion. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source While you can’t correct this in the wilderness, you can wear an athletic supporter (or make a makeshift support with a towel or bandana) to support your testicles against your body until you can get out of the wilderness to minimize pain and the risk of your testicle(s) rotating further. [7] X Research source Wrap a towel or other fabric around the affected testicle. You may need to secure this to your body in order to maintain stability. Keep the testicle secure and restrict your movements to alleviate some of the pain experienced when walking or sitting."

    {
      "title": "Rest as much as possible.",
      "content": "Rest as much as possible. While movement or vigorous activity do not cause testicular torsion (it can happen while sitting or even sleeping), excess moving may make the already painful condition more uncomfortable. [8] X Research source Keep still when you can to minimize the risk of further rotating your scrotum or increasing the pain. Although resting and stillness may alleviate some discomfort, remember that you must reach a hospital within 6 hours to save the affected testicle. Get to a ranger’s station as fast as possible, only resting for a moment when necessary."

      "title": "Decrease movement.",
      "content": "Decrease movement. If you have to move to get to a ranger station or more secure location, walk as slowly and smoothly as possible. This can minimize the possibility of further rotating your scrotum and may alleviate some discomfort. You may need to widen or adjust your gait to help with pain. [9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Walk on ground that is as level as possible and take care with each step. If you are with others, ask them to support you while you walk."

      "content": "Attempt manual detorsion as a last resort. If you cannot get to a doctor quickly because you are in an especially remote area, consider trying to rotate your testicle back into its proper position. Be aware that this can be quite painful and doesn’t come without risks. It also does not mean you will not require surgery later. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Only attempt this yourself if you’re in danger of passing the 6-hour window to save the testicle. Place your testicles in your hands as though you are holding a book. Turn your testicle from the midline of your body towards the outside, or from the medial to the lateral side. The motion is similar to opening a book. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source If manual detorsion is too painful or you experience symptoms such as vomiting or fainting, discontinue the procedure immediately. Manual detorsion doesn’t replace getting proper medical attention. Successful detorsion is marked by reduction in pain and lower position of the testes in the scrotum."

Although in some cases there is no clear cause or risk for testicular torsion, the following factors may make your more likely to have testicular torsion: [12] X Research source Age; torsion is most common in babies under 1 year old and at the onset of puberty.

[15] X Research source Wear an athletic cup whenever you play contact sports such as football or soccer.

      "title": "Avoid overly vigorous activity.",
      "content": "Avoid overly vigorous activity. Extreme exercise or other activities that are especially vigorous can cause testicular torsion. Stay away from any activity that may move your testicles in a manner that could promote torsion or trauma. Torsion from strenuous activity often does not occur until several hours have passed. [18] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you are a runner or play sports that involve a lot of running, consider wearing more supportive undergarments to minimize your risk. Be aware that general physical activity will not cause torsion, as it can occur when you are sitting, standing, sleeping, or doing exercise. [19] X Research source In fact, a typical presentation of torsion is to be awoken in the early morning or at night with scrotal pain."

[20] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keeping your body—and testicles—at their normal temperature may help minimize your risk for developing the condition. Try not to sit on cold surfaces, especially during the winter. You might want to avoid surfaces that don’t conduct much heat, such as rocks or stones. If you are out in the wilderness during the winter, make sure to wear proper clothing to keep your testicles from getting cold. Wear thermal pants and supportive underwear that keep your testicles close to your body."
