Place more valuable places toward the back, like the ammo cache, planning HQ or weapon stash. These are the most important places, so if the enemy took control of them, they could cripple your team."

Blasters such as the Vulcanator, Spectrum, MK3, Stryker/Nexus Pro, Perses, and Dictator are great choices. Have people in the base ready and armed. Two people using a Perses' will also do well as guards but should be outfitted with relatively cheap hopper extensions that are available on the internet and double or triple the capacity. You would also need a doorman, who would let in patrol teams of troops who are back from combat and should be armed with a lighter blaster, such as Stryfe, Spectrum, Aeon Pro, and Motoblitz."

      "content": "Choose a weapon for defending your base. If you are going to have a war in an outdoor field, use a weapon with bigger amount of range, but if you are going to have a war indoors, use a weapon with normal range. Your choice of weapon and how you use it is vital. For example, using a Stampede and keeping it on the whole time will give your base away in quieter areas. Also, the battery will run out halfway through the battle, leaving you with no suitable defense weapon. Suggestions include: Primary: Spectrum, Stryfe, Mk3, Rapidstrike, Nemesis, Perses, Hades, Hyperfire, Nexus Pro, Rampage, SMG Zesty, IR, or AR-E Secondary: Hammershot, Kronos, Strongarm, Reflex 6, Mk2, Disruptor, Fury 4, Roughcut, Takedown, Cobra, SP-E, 6-SH, SR, or Quadrot Tertiary: Jolt, Triad, Sharpfire, Secret Strike, Microshots, or Storm Squad."

Arm with flywheel blasters, walkie-talkies, and GPS. Snipers: For taking out with convenience shots. Arm with sniper rifles like the Jupiter XIX-1000, Nexus Pro, or Caliburn, possibly armed with walkie-talkie and GPS. Assasins/Scouts: For infiltration and scout operations. Arm with two pistols such as Blitzfires, Storm Squads, or Kronos', walkie-talkies, and GPS. They could have Nerf swords like the Zombie Strikeblade, Vendetta swords, or Marauder swords. Heavy gunners/Base gunners: For firing from a stationary post to protect the base from oncoming enemies. Arm with a V-Twin or Nemesis, or any fully automatic gun with a fast rate of fire. Note that the Rhinofire jams a lot and has a very slow rate of fire. Commando: For heavy mobile fire, Arm with a Spectrum, Scorpion Gatling Gun, Rebel Mech, as well as a pistol like a Storm Squad, Blitzfire, or Rival Kronos and a walkie-talkie."

The drawback to this strategy is that you will be using a lot of darts in a short amount of time. This strategy is best used when there is more than one base defender and they are equip with a motorized weapon. These weapons use a motorized system to continue to fire as long as the soldier continues to hold down the trigger, feeding either from a clip or pre-loaded darts. Examples are the V-Twin, Perses, Nemesis, Prometheus, Spectrum, Rebel Mech, Destructor, Matrixfire, or Commandfire. The second strategy is one of anti-intimidation where you don't shoot at all. Let the enemy get comfortable and approach then shoot them at the last moment. If you’re facing multiple enemies, use your cover wisely, as it is one of your biggest advantages over your enemy. If they charge all at once, the best way to counter this is either using a Perses or Nemesis."

If the offense is successful, the enemy team will have no choice but to try to overwhelm the defense in the center. When in position, the defense caves in the enemy still hold the area. This will result in the enemy team falling deeper into the now bowl-shaped defensive line. The offense then emerges behind the enemy team and takes defensive positions pointed towards the collected enemy team. If done correctly, this leaves the enemy team surrounded and without cover. If the plan fails, the entire team can recover quickly by rushing, taking advantage of their already forward position."

While not always as effective, it is easier to recover from and requires less communication. [9] X Research source Your team cuts in a diagonal line across the field. The most powerful members of the team should be on the edges, with the weakest parts of the line in the middle. This leaves the enemy no choice but to attack the line, often focusing on the middle. When the enemy is within the bounds of the line, collapse your team on top of them and redistribute your players. This leaves your enemy surrounded an all but one side.
