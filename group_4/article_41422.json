      "content": "Keep a diary of when your budgie bites. The first step to addressing biting is to keep track of when biting occurs. Budgies may bite for a variety of reasons. How to address the behavior depends on its root cause, and your first step is to find out. Write down each time your budgie bites you. Jot down the circumstances surrounding the bite. Was the budgie being handled at the time? Was in or out of their cage? Was the bite in response to being fed or given a treat? The more details you record regarding the incident the better. [1] X Research source Look for common themes and patterns regarding when your budgie bites. If your budgie tends to bite when they hear loud noises outside or when handled by unfamiliar people, they may be biting out of anxiety. If your budgie tends to bite around nighttime when they have been out of his cage for extended period, they may be biting because they’re tired and wants to go back in their cage.

      "content": "Keep a regular sleeping and feeding schedule. As budgies may bite due to dissatisfaction with their diet and sleep cycle, maintaining a schedule can help. Make sure your budgie gets variety in his diet and is fed regularly. Allow him to sleep at roughly the same times each day. Seed and pellets, the kind that you buy at pet stores, should be the staple of a budgie's diet. However, budgies will get bored eating the same meal day after day. Add variety to your budgie's diet by adding sprouts, veggies, fruits and grains to their regular bird food. [4] X Research source Keep track of what times your budgie seems to rest. Make a conscious effort to give him space during these times. A budgie might become frustrated and bite if they’re being handled when they’re tired.

This will keep him calm and relaxed and allow him to establish a bond with you. If you have just purchased a budgie, give them space for a few weeks before attempting contact. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Provide enough toys or tools. In the wild, budgies are constantly occupied with some task or another. Mental stimulation through appropriate toys is vital to a budgie's well being. If a budgie gets bored, they may resort to biting to get attention and stimulation. Shreddable toys, like old toilet paper rolls and scrap paper, are fun for budgies. As they forage in the wild to build nests, they'll enjoy tearing through paper in captivity. [9] X Research source Stop by a local pet store and look at what's available in terms of bird toys. Many budgies enjoy puzzle toys, which are contraptions where you can hide a treat. The budgie will have fun trying to dismantle the puzzle in order to get a reward.
