      "title": "Create a small loop with the lace on the left side of your boot.",
      "content": "Create a small loop with the lace on the left side of your boot. The base of the loop should be right up against the eyelet the lace is coming out of. Make the loop about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. If it’s any longer or shorter, you may not be able to tie the knot later on. Pinch the base of the loop between your index finger and thumb so it stays in place. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the lace around the base of the loop.",
      "content": "Wrap the lace around the base of the loop. Grab the end of the lace and bring it over and under the loop until it’s back where it started. Part of the lace should now be wrapped around the base of the loop, holding it in place. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep wrapping the lace around the loop until you’re near the end of the loop.",
      "content": "Keep wrapping the lace around the loop until you’re near the end of the loop. Each wrap around should be right up against the previous one. Stop wrapping the lace around the loop when you’re about .25 inches (0.64 cm) away from the end of the loop. When you stop, there should still be a tiny bit of the loop peeking out from the wrapped lace. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Push the end of the lace through the end of the loop.",
      "content": "Push the end of the lace through the end of the loop. Wrap the end of the lace over and under one side of the loop so that the end goes through the center of the loop. Once the end is through the center, pull it tight with your fingers. Once you pull it tight, the knot is finished on that side of the boot. Tie the same knot on the other side of your boot using the other end of the lace. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the knot by scrunching or loosening the wrapped lace.",
      "content": "Adjust the knot by scrunching or loosening the wrapped lace. To tighten the knot on your boot, scrunch the lace wrapped around the loop down toward the end of the lace until it's fully compacted. To loosen your boot, pull the wrapped lace up away from the end of the lace so that it's loosely wrapped around the lace coming out of the eyelet. [5] X Research source To easily slip your boot on and off, loosen the knots on each side of the boot. Then, once the boot is on your foot, tighten the knots again."

    {
      "title": "Feed the laces through the inside of the holes at the bottom of the boot.",
      "content": "Feed the laces through the inside of the holes at the bottom of the boot. Each end of the lace should be going through a different hole. You want them to be going up through the inside of the holes, not down through the outside. Once both ends are through, grab an end in each hand and pull the ends out so there’s an equal amount of lace on both sides of the boot. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put the left end of the lace through the next hole up on the right side.",
      "content": "Put the left end of the lace through the next hole up on the right side. Push the lace up through the inside of the hole, not down through the top. Once the end of the lace is through, pull the lace all the way through with your hand. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Put the right end of the lace through the next hole up on the left side.",
      "content": "Put the right end of the lace through the next hole up on the left side. Insert the end of the lace through the inside of the hole, just like you did with the other end of the lace. Pull the lace through once the end is through the whole. Now that you’ve crossed the two ends of the laces, you should see the beginning of a criss-cross pattern on your boot. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Continue crossing sides with the laces until you’ve laced up the whole boot.",
      "content": "Continue crossing sides with the laces until you’ve laced up the whole boot. For a looser fitting boot, stop lacing the boot at the second-to-last hole from the top. If you want your boot to be snug, lace all the way to the top, until you’ve gone through every hole. [9] X Research source"
