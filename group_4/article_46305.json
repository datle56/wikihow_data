      "title": "Check the fabric type you’re dyeing.",
      "content": "Check the fabric type you’re dyeing. Rit makes two kinds of dyes, one for natural fabrics and one for synthetic materials. If you’re dyeing cotton, linen, rayon, wool, silk, lamé, or nylon, get Rit All-Purpose Dye . If your fabric is more than 35% polyester, acrylic, or acetate, get Rit Synthetic Dye . [1] X Research source For the best results, use white or off-white fabric. If you want to use a colored fabric, either remove the color using a product like Rit color remover , or choose a dye that mixes well with the color (for example, if you want to dye a yellow shirt orange, choose a red dye). Even if you remove the color, the patterns and logos will often stay in the fabric."

    {
      "title": "Weigh and wash your fabric.",
      "content": "Weigh and wash your fabric. Before washing your fabric, weigh it on a kitchen scale. For every 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of fabric, use 1 bottle of liquid dye or 2 packets of powdered dye. Double the amount of dye if you want a darker color. Wash your fabric with a mild detergent, and remove any stains. [2] X Research source Don’t use fabric softener while prewashing fabrics. Never dye dirty clothing, or the color can come out splotchy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect your work area.",
      "content": "Protect your work area. Lay out a few sheets of newspaper or some old towels on the floors, countertops, and surfaces in your dyeing area. Rit dyes stain most materials, so by taking a few extra moments to prepare, you can spare yourself an extensive cleanup process. Wear gloves while handling dye to avoid staining your hands and to protect them from hot water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set out a container to do your dyeing in.",
      "content": "Set out a container to do your dyeing in. Get a container that can hold several gallons of water, plus whatever you’re dyeing. [3] X Research source A plastic bucket or dish pan that holds around 5 gallons (19 L) is often large enough for your fabric to move freely. You can also do your dyeing in a sink, provided that it’s stainless steel. Don’t use Rit Dye in white porcelain or fiberglass sinks, as it can leave permanent stains."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the container with hot water.",
      "content": "Fill the container with hot water. For effective dyeing, use water around 140 °F (60 °C) (hot enough to release steam). [4] X Research source The intense heat softens the fibers of the fabric and helps them accept the dye. If your tap doesn’t get hot enough, heat the water on the stove. Use 3 gallons (11 L) for each 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fabric."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the dye into the water.",
      "content": "Stir the dye into the water. Pour 1 bottle of liquid dye per 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of fabric. For powdered Rit Dye, mix 2 packages into 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water, then incorporate the mixture slowly until you achieve the desired depth of color. Stir the dye until it’s completely distributed. [5] X Research source Shake liquid dye before adding it to the water. Stir with a stainless steel spoon or similar utensil. If you’re dyeing a single t-shirt or a couple of pairs of underwear, you can use less dye, whereas you’ll likely need more for a heavy sweater or multiple pairs of jeans."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add salt or vinegar for even dyeing.",
      "content": "Add salt or vinegar for even dyeing. If the item you’re dyeing is cotton, dissolve 1 cup (300g) of salt into 2 cups (470 mL) of hot water and add it to the dye bath. For wools, silks, or nylons, use 1 cup (240 mL) of distilled white vinegar instead. [6] X Research source Stir the dye bath once again to disperse the additives. Some fabrics tend to resist dyes. The salt or vinegar will serve to condition the fabric and promote consistent coloration. Adding 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of dish soap also helps to evenly distribute the dye."

    {
      "title": "Perform a color test on an absorbent paper towel.",
      "content": "Perform a color test on an absorbent paper towel. Dip the corner of the paper towel into the solution and note the color. [7] X Research source If it’s too light, add more dye. If it’s too dark, add more water. Repeat your color test on another part of the paper towel as many times as necessary until you get the color just right."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wet your fabric and submerge it in the dye.",
      "content": "Wet your fabric and submerge it in the dye. Wetting your fabric beforehand helps the dye penetrate the fibers more easily. Wring out your fabric and slowly lower it into the bath. Make sure the entire piece sits below the surface of the dye. [8] X Research source Keep the fabric as unfurled as possible when you put it into the dye to prevent lines from forming in the color."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stir the dye bath for 10 minutes to 1 hour.",
      "content": "Stir the dye bath for 10 minutes to 1 hour. Stir the water with a spoon or drag the garment around with a pair of tongs. Keep the garment moving constantly so that every part of the fabric is exposed to the solution. The longer you leave it in the dye bath, the more intense the final color will be. [9] X Research source Stir diligently for the first 10 minutes, since they are the most important for allowing the dye to absorb. Nylon dyes very quickly, so take it out after 10 minutes. Cotton polyester blends take at least 30 minutes to fully dye. If you use tongs, switch up where you hold the fabric to allow every part to touch the dye. Colors appear darker when the garment is wet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the dyed garment and rinse it off.",
      "content": "Remove the dyed garment and rinse it off. When you're satisfied with the look of the item, take hold of one corner with your tongs and lift it out of the dye bath. Wring out as much dye as you can by hand, then rinse it with cool water. [10] X Research source To avoid leaving a colorful trail of drips all over your home, set up your dyeing station close to the area where you'll be doing your rinsing."

    {
      "title": "Lock the dye in or wash it on low heat.",
      "content": "Lock the dye in or wash it on low heat. Use Rit ColorStay Dye Fixative or use a DIY dye setting technique to lock in the dye, then wash the fabric on low heat with a mild detergent. [11] X Research source Dry the item on a high setting to further lock in the color. Some materials may fade a little following a few washings, so consider using color-preserving detergents and fabric softeners to maintain the appearance of your dyed clothing. Wash the fabric with like colors and old towels to prevent bleeding. Hand wash and dry delicates, like wool, silk, and lace in a sink full of clean, warm water. Press out the excess water gently, then hang each garment separately and allow them to air dry."

    {
      "title": "Heat a large pot of water on the stove.",
      "content": "Heat a large pot of water on the stove. Choose a stainless steel pot that’s large enough to hold at least 3 gallons (11 L) for each 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fabric you’re dying. Turn on your stove and get the water to 200 °F (93 °C), or to where it’s just simmering. [12] X Research source The stovetop method is great for getting more vibrant colors with natural fabrics, however, it is the only method you can use for synthetic fabrics. If you’re dyeing natural fabrics, you can have the temperature as low as 140 °F (60 °C). Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from the heat."

[13] X Research source If you’re dying cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen, add one cup (300 g) of salt to the water. If you’re dying nylon, silk, or wool, add 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar to the mix."

      "content": "Add the fabric and stir continuously for 10-60 minutes. Wet and wring out the fabrics you want to dye, then add them to the bath. Stir the fabric so all parts evenly come in contact with the dye. The first 10 minutes are crucial for letting the dye absorb into the fabric, so stir diligently! [15] X Research source Keep the water at a low simmer the entire time. Keep polyester cotton blends in the bath for at least 30 minutes, and take nylon out after 10 minutes."
