      "content": "Choose leg exercises that suit you. Some good exercises associated with tight thighs (and legs in general) include squats, lunges, deadlifts, kettlebell swings and several variations upon these exercises. Depending on what you're going for, and the resources available to you, it's good to pick some combination of strength training and isometric exercises, which only use your body weight as resistance. Consider joining a local gym, which may have several machines dedicated to exercising your legs."

To do a squat, place your feet shoulder-width apart, and flex your legs until your thighs are at a 90° angle with the floor. Keep your back straight and your butt back. Then, stand back up to straight. Repeat this 20-50 times, doing sets of 10-15. [1] X Research source The sumo squat is a great way to tone your inner and outer thighs. To do this, take the widest stance possible, then squat as low as you can. Do this 20-50 or more times a day to see fast results. Another great one is the plie squat. This is great for toning. To do this, put your arms above your head like a ballerina about to do a plie, while keeping your legs together. Then extend one leg from your right or left side, step into a wider stance and squat. Do 20-50 repetitions per day. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Do lunges. Lunges are a wonderful way to tone the lower body. To do lunges, stand with your hands on your hips and your feet together. Extend one leg and step forward and squat with your left leg still behind you. Repeat this as many times as you can on each leg. Lunges will target and tone your thigh areas if done correctly. The great thing about lunges is that if you do do them consistently and correctly, you will see amazing results, as it takes more effort than doing squats. If you have any sort of knee issues, lunges can be difficult. Squats are a bit easier on the knees."

Any activity or diet which burns fat from your body will burn that fat proportionately over your body, not specifically near the area or muscle group which has been worked.

If you want to strength train with added weight, it's important to focus on doing a high number of repetitions with a low amount of weight. This is how to tone muscles. If you want to build muscles, you should focus on doing fewer reps with a higher amount of weight.

Make sure that you are also constructing a workout for the rest of your body so that you don't end up with super-strong legs and a weak and poorly toned upper body.

You will also be able to work out more and burn more fat if you incorporate other major muscle groups and exercises into your workouts, so be sure to build a full workout routine."
