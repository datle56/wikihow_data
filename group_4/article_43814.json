      "content": "Guide the thread. Feed the thread through the thread guides and around the bobbin winder tension discs. Snap the thread into the small plastic thread guide lying directly to the left of the spool pin. With the thread held in place by the thread guide, wind the thread clockwise around the bobbin winder tension discs in front of the guide."

      "content": "Feed the thread through the bobbin eye. Insert the thread through the top hole of the empty bobbin spool. Feed the thread through from the inside so that the tail is still on the outside of the bobbin. If you're using a bobbin with holes on both sides, only slip the thread through one hole."

      "content": "Set the bobbin in place. Place the bobbin on the bobbin winding spindle, located to the far right of the machine. Lock the spindle in place. The tail of thread should still stick out through the top of the bobbin. To lock the spindle in place, push the bobbin as far to the right as it will go. This sets the machine to its \"bobbin winding\" mode."

If desired, you can let go of the thread tail after the bobbin has wound a few rotations, but doing so is not necessary. The machine should automatically stop once the bobbin is full. Note that the hand wheel should not turn and the machine should not sew while the machine is in its bobbin winding mode."

[1] X Research source Unlock the spindle by pushing it back to the left. Note that the machine will not sew until the bobbin winding spindle is back in its left position. You should also trim the tail of thread sticking out from the top bobbin hole after removing the bobbin."

You'll need to lift up the spool pin before you can position the spool of thread on it. For larger spools, the large side of the cap should face the spool. For smaller spools, the small side of the cap should face the spool."

Standard needle threading instructions still apply when you use an automatic threader. This feature only assists you with inserting the thread through the eye of the needle; the rest of the process should be treated exactly the same way. Even if your machine has this feature, you can still thread the needle by inserting it through the eye without assistance. This feature is only optional."

Continue until the needle goes through a full rotation, lowering into the machine and rising back out to its highest position. [5] X Research source For the sake of safety, it is best to do this while the machine is off. The presser foot should also be raised during this procedure. As you turn the wheel, you should see a loop of thread appear through the needle plate hole beneath the needle. This loop of thread is from the bobbin."
