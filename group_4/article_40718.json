If you are handwriting your letter, avoid using lined paper. Instead, use a ruler to keep your handwriting straight as your write across the page. Pay careful attention to making your handwriting legible."

      "content": "Open with a salutation. Write \"Dear Judge (last name),\" to start your letter. Note that you use \"the Honorable\" when referring to the judge, but use \"Judge\" when addressing him or her in person. The title still applies even if the judge has retired. The term \"Dear\" is always appropriate in a business context, and does not mean that the person is dear to you. It is simply a proper opening salutation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify yourself and state your profession.",
      "content": "Identify yourself and state your profession. In the first paragraph of the letter, begin by introducing yourself and saying what your profession is. Do not be modest about your credentials, particularly if you are held in high esteem in your community because of your professional or private work. Building yourself up is particularly helpful if you are writing on behalf of a defendant, it shows that the defendant has a positive relationship with a respected and productive member of the community. For example, \"I am a local small business owner, and have served this community for fifteen years.\""

    {
      "title": "Give reasons why the judge should grant your request.",
      "content": "Give reasons why the judge should grant your request. You need to persuade the judge to agree to your request. For example, if you are asking the judge to impose only a minimum sentence on the defendant, explain why the defendant will turn his or her life around, why you believe he or she deserves a second chance, and how the defendant can continue to have a positive impact on his or her family and community. Take as much space as you need for this section, but not more than you need. Judges are very busy, and will appreciate letters that are well-edited. Put your strongest arguments first, and phrase your arguments as briefly as you can."

      "title": "Proofread your letter.",
      "content": "Proofread your letter. Once you have finished, re-read your letter several times, and have someone else read it for you.
