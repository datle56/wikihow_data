Look for a button or switch that features the symbol of a car on top of 2 squiggly skid marks—this is the standard symbol for traction control. Depending on your vehicle’s make and model, press the button or switch to disable the TC. [2] X Research source Check your vehicle’s display to confirm that you’ve successfully switched the system off. Some vehicles might display a “Traction Control Turned Off” notification on the dashboard. [3] X Research source On other vehicles, you might also see the TC symbol lit up on your dash. [4] X Research source On some vehicles, this button might be located on the center console; on others, it might be next to the steering wheel. Check your car’s owner manual to confirm where the button or switch is, as well as how to operate it. Don’t know where your owner manual is? Look for your car’s manual here by typing in your vehicle’s manufacturer. On some vehicles, the warning light stays lit up while TC is turned off. [5] X Research source"

On some vehicles, you can switch off the VSC by pressing the TC button for a couple of extra seconds. [6] X Research source Double-check your vehicle’s owner manual to see what type of stability controls it has, and how they can be disabled. Some vehicles might label the VSC as Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Electronic Stability Program (ESP), or something similar. As a general rule of thumb, TC is meant to control how much your wheels spin while your car speeds up. VSC helps control the physical direction of the car in case it gets off track.

This might be labled as Vehicle Stability Assist, or VSA. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "TC helps keep your wheels from spinning or skidding. When ever you drive in slick or slippery conditions, like a rainy or icy road, your tires aren’t able to get as much grip or traction. [14] X Research source Whenever one of your wheels spins too much, the TC system automatically kicks in by slowing that wheel down (either with the car’s antilock brake system or by making engine and transmission adjustments). [15] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Some TC systems only work when a car is driving slowly, while others work constantly. Take a look at your car’s owner manual to see what type of system your vehicle has."

To get out of slippery or otherwise uncooperative terrain, your car wheels need to spin quickly to get traction—unfortunately, this isn’t possible with TC. Switching off TC gives your car a little more wiggle room to escape these types of terrains, so you can get back on the road ASAP. [16] X Research source"
