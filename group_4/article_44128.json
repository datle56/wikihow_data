      "content": "The towel method is an exercise that allegedly slims and defines your jaw. During the exercise, the person working out bites down and makes chewing motions on a folded-up towel. Their goal is to strengthen their neck , chin, and jaw muscles so they will (hopefully) lose fat in these areas and make their jawline appear more defined. This fitness routine was popularized by male TikTok influencers. In their videos, they often show off their snatched jawline after demonstrating the exercise to imply how well the towel method worked for them (as in this TikTok by @iblame.anhtu). Alternatively, they may claim you can get results after using the towel method consistently for only a week (as TikTok user @plainjad does in his viral post with over 7.5 million views)."

      "content": "Fold a towel 4-6 times to turn it into a thick layered stack. A hand towel is best since it's small enough to handle easily but large enough to fold in on itself multiple times. You can also reduce the number of folds to 2-3 if the towel is thick, you have a small mouth, or your jaw is too weak to chew on anything large."

      "content": "Bite down on the towel layers and work your jaw as if you're chewing. Keeping your top teeth securely on the towel, move your jaw up and down to work your neck, facial, and jaw muscles. Repeat this chewing motion 40 times in a single set. Perform 2 sets total with a break between (as explained by @haidwrr in his TikTok tutorial ). You can also perform this exercise on just one side of your teeth if you feel one side of your face needs to be slimmed or strengthened more than the other. After repeating this exercise daily, expect to see results within 3-6 weeks."

When performed consistently, the towel method works on the muscles in your neck and jaw and may make them stronger, more resilient, and more defined. People who combine this and other jaw exercises with a healthy lifestyle and eating habits may also see their facial fat decrease or disappear."

      "content": "It may cause pain and misalignment in the teeth and jaw. Biting down on a towel repeatedly can hurt your teeth and potentially cause them to misalign slightly. Over time, you could develop a crooked smile. Furthermore, overworking your jaw muscles can lead to a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder where the joints, muscles, and ligaments in your jaw feel painful and tender.

      "content": "It may also cause your jaw to appear bigger and more square. An unwanted side effect of using the towel method to exercise your jaw is masseter muscle hypertrophy. In this health condition, the masseter muscles on either side of your face get overworked and grow bigger. This makes your jaw look bulkier and more squared off than normal, which is not always a desirable look (especially for women). [2] X Research source Masseter muscle hypertrophy can happen if you chew gum (or in this case, a towel) too often or too aggressively, or if chew on one side of your teeth more than the other. If the towel method doesn't sound like it's for you, there are plenty of other jaw-slimming exercises you can try! The ones listed below are expert-recommended for addressing facial fat concerns and alleviating TMJ pain (and they don't hurt your teeth, either). They're also much gentler and more science-backed than the towel method."

      "content": "Mewing To mew , straighten your neck, close your mouth, then push your tongue up flat against the roof of your mouth as hard as you can. (Your front top and bottom teeth should lightly touch, but never grind or clench). Hold this position for 2-3 minutes, then relax slightly until you're only pushing half as hard as before. Hold this new position for 2-3 more minutes. Repeat the exercise multiple times, each time slowly decreasing the force you're using to push your tongue upward until you're just barely scraping the roof of your mouth with it. While mewing is extremely popular on social media, there's no scientific evidence that it can reshape your jawline. However, it can make your jawline look more snatched in the moment, so you may consider using this trick when posing for photos."

An experienced plastic surgeon may recommend one of a variety of different procedures. Two popular options are liposuction where the surgeon sucks the fat cells out from under your skin and a chin tuck whereby the surgeon removes and tightens the flabby extra skin hanging around your jaw. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep in mind that some people have naturally fuller, rounder-looking faces that aren't due to extra weight. This means that even if you exercise and eat healthy, your jawline may never be as edgy and sharp as you want. Learn to embrace your face regardless of whether the fullness around your jaw, chin, and cheeks is due to weight gain or just part of who you are!"
