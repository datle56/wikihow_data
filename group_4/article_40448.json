[1] X Research source For people who only drink occasionally, this redness usually goes away when they stop drinking. But people who drink excessively may experience permanent redness (called rosacea) even when they’re not drinking.

      "content": "Spider veins around nose and cheeks Someone who drinks frequently may have burst blood vessels around the nose. This might cause their nose to look red, or it may lead to visible, spider-like thread veins. This condition, called rhinophyma, may also cause the nose to look swollen and bumpy, and the skin may thicken over time. [3] X Research source Rhinophyma is also called “drinker’s nose” or “alcoholic’s nose,” although it can also occur in people who do not drink."

      "content": "Puffiness and swelling in the face and extremities People who drink heavily may experience swelling in their face, hands, and feet. This swelling, called edema, is caused by the body retaining too much fluid and may be a sign that regular alcohol use is affecting their organs. For instance, facial swelling can be a symptom of cirrhosis of the liver.

      "content": "Dry or red eyes When a person drinks alcohol, the blood vessels in their eyes dilate. Additionally, about 30% of people who drink experience dry, itchy eyes as a result of dehydration. These can cause a person’s eyes to look red or bloodshot when they drink. [6] X Research source Serious alcoholism can lead to a vitamin A deficiency or liver disease—both of which can lead to chronically red eyes, even if the person isn’t drinking."

Along with cognitive changes, WK syndrome can cause the affected person to have droopy eyelids, crossed eyes, or abnormal eye movements (called nystagmus). [9] X Research source Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a sign of advanced alcohol use disorder. At this stage, a person likely needs medical intervention to safely quit drinking."

[10] X Research source This can result in dry, peeling, or flaky skin, especially with prolonged use. Chronic dehydration and dry skin can also increase the risk of developing skin infections and sores. [11] X Research source Psoriasis and eczema may be more common as well. [12] X Research source Over time, drinking may also lead to premature signs of aging, including fine lines and wrinkles."

[13] X Research source Those nutrient deficiencies can lead to dull, brittle, or thinning hair. Niacin deficiency, known as pellagra, is often caused by alcoholism. Pellagra can lead to hair loss, as can deficiencies in iron and zinc. Additionally, zinc deficiency can cause hair to become brittle. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Someone with alcoholism might also have symptoms that don’t show on the face. While changes to a person’s skin and face are usually evident to the people around them, some physical effects of long-term alcohol use may be more subtle. These can include: Stomach problems: Someone who’s abusing alcohol may experience a loss of appetite, stomach cramps, or an upset stomach, even when they’re not drinking. [17] X Research source Numbness in hands and feet: Heavy alcohol use can cause a person to experience tingling or numbness in their extremities. The palms of their hands may also redden or swell. [18] X Research source Unexplained bruises or injuries: Alcohol can cause a loss of coordination and may make a person more susceptible to bruises, so a person who’s regularly abusing alcohol may have bruises, cuts, or scrapes that they can’t explain—often in different stages of healing. [19] X Research source Weight changes: Alcohol is high in calories, so some people who abuse alcohol may gain weight. Others may have a decreased appetite and experience weight loss. [20] X Research source Neglected grooming: A person struggling with alcohol use may have a disheveled appearance, including wrinkled or dirty clothing and unwashed or uncombed hair. Withdrawal symptoms: A person who is dependent on alcohol may experience shaking, nausea, vomiting, or insomnia when they stop drinking. [21] X Research source"

Other changes, like premature aging, may improve, but they may not be fully reversible. [23] X Research source Other symptoms of alcohol use disorder, like moderate heart and liver damage, can be reversed over a longer period of abstinence.

Alcohol treatment Specialist Tiffany Douglass, MA, says, “It’s never a good idea to confront a person head-on and tell them they need to stop drinking—that will just make them defensive. Instead, come from a place of vulnerability and where your intention is really coming from.” Douglass recommends saying something like, “When I see you drinking, it makes me really afraid that I’m going to lose you.” Being supportive may increase your loved one’s chances of success. Douglass says, “Having social support is crucial to the long-term success of those who want to stop drinking.”"

Overcoming alcohol use disorder can be difficult, but a person may be more likely to quit if they seek professional guidance early in their recovery.

      "content": "Be an active part of their recovery. Douglass says, “Usually when one person in a family is an alcoholic or addicted person, there’s also someone codependent who’s enabling that addiction. The reality is that everyone needs to be involved in the recovery process, regardless of if you’re the one drinking or not.” That might look like going to therapy to help you identify and stop codependent behaviors, helping the person in recovery avoid the temptation to drink, or just being a good listener when they need someone to talk to."

      "title": "Be firm with your boundaries.",
      "content": "Be firm with your boundaries. “You can only do so much to help another person,” advises licensed psychotherapist Lauren Urban, LCSW. “Learn to recognize your own cues to understand when they’re asking too much of you, like asking you to cover for them or help them manage their addiction. Even if you’re helping someone recover, you can still maintain your separateness from them and live your life outside of that person without feeling guilt.” “If you don’t hold your boundaries,” Urban adds, “it starts to build up as resentment, and it eventually comes out as anger.”"

      "content": "Find your own support network. Urban says if you’re trying to help someone recover from alcohol abuse, “Seek support from outside sources that might be available to you, whether that be other family members or a therapist, teacher, or minister. You are deserving of support and care too, so find places where you can feel that it’s not all on you.” If you need someone to talk to, try calling SAMHSA’s Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP. Consider joining a group like Al-Anon for support from others who are in recovery or who have loved ones with alcoholism."

      "content": "Get professional help to start your recovery. “Initially, I recommend seeking out a local therapist,” says Douglass. “They can help you gauge the level of care you need. You might only need to meet once a week in therapy, or you might need to be treated in an outpatient or inpatient setting.” Talk to your doctor before quitting if you’re a heavy drinker. Douglass says, “If you’re a daily drinker, withdrawal can lead to serious complications like seizures. If you’re trying to quit drinking, seek the advice of your general practitioner, at a minimum.” Reach out if you need someone to talk to. Try calling a helpline like: SAMHSA: 1-800-662-HELP Boys Town: 1-800-448-3000 Al-Anon and Ala-teen : 1-800-356-9996 National Suicide Prevention: 988"

      "content": "Ask for support from your family. Douglass says that you’ll have better long-term success if “the people in your life are engaged and in your life on a day-to-day basis.” Reach out to the people who matter to you and let them know that you’re struggling with alcohol use. Ask for their support as you navigate recovery. Urban says that it can help to be specific about the help you need. “It’s okay to set a boundary and tell the other person that you don’t need or want them to police your behavior. Instead, ask them to support you in engaging in healthier activities and avoid the temptation to drink.”"

      "title": "Get involved with a recovery program for additional support.",
      "content": "Get involved with a recovery program for additional support. According to Douglass, “If you’re trying to quit drinking, it can be very helpful to get connected with a social support group. Not only are you connecting with a community that’s engaging in sobriety, making friends, and finding a sponsor, but you’re making a commitment to them, as well.” When it comes to finding a group, Douglass says, “Alcoholics Anonymous is the obvious one, but there are also other groups like Refuge Recovery, which is a Buddhism-based support group for substance abuse and abstinence. There’s also Smart Recover and Rational Recovery.”"

      "title": "Avoid situations that normally lead you to drink.",
      "content": "Avoid situations that normally lead you to drink. When you’re trying to stop drinking, Urban recommends that you “Pay attention to the rituals around your addiction. Then, use that information to build new habits and different rituals. A lot of people find things like yoga, exercise, or other physical activities to be a great way to get rid of the stressors that can potentially cause you to relapse.” Clinical psychologist Natalie Feinblatt, PsyD, agrees that it’s important to create new habits: “Having fun without alcohol can look like playing sports with friends, making friends with other people who are sober, or joining a local meetup group or a club. Instead of drinking, spend time doing things like hiking, painting, singing, acting, or photography.”"

      "content": "Don’t give up if you have a relapse. Urban says, “Don’t run towards relapse, but if it does happen, it’s not the end of your recovery. Accept that it happened, and that it’s part of the process of addiction recovery. Use it to learn more about your triggers, and get back up and keep trying.”"
