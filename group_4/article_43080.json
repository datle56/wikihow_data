      "title": "Know that he likes you.",
      "content": "Know that he likes you. If you don’t absolutely know that he likes you, don’t act upon it. You may ruin a friendship based on rumors that other people have told you or an assumption that you’ve made because you think he likes you. There are some tell-tale signs that he is truly into you. [1] X Research source He consistently asks you out. He persistently tries for body contact. He persists on hanging one-on-one."

      "content": "Don’t avoid him forever. You can pretend all you want that he’ll “get the hint” if you simply avoid him. Well, he won’t. You need to find a time to talk to him. Make it a time when it’s only the two of you, so that he doesn’t get embarrassed in front of a group of people."

      "title": "Make a plan.",
      "content": "Make a plan. Write down what you’re going to say before you say it. If you fumble over your words, you’ll make the conversation longer, more awkward, and a worse time than it needs to be. In your plan, you should have some points about why you aren’t interested in him. Don’t attack him with reasons he’s gross—just be honest about why you’re not into him. [3] X Research source You can’t seem to move on from your ex-boyfriend. You just aren’t physically attracted to him. You like someone else."

      "title": "Talk over the phone.",
      "content": "Talk over the phone. If you have a conversation on the phone or over text, you can still implement all of these into your conversation. The most important part when doing that is being ultimate. Make sure he knows that there is no future chance for the relationship."

      "title": "Acknowledge the seriousness.",
      "content": "Acknowledge the seriousness. You need to let him know that you want to have a serious conversation. This way, he takes what you’re saying to heart. If you don’t take the time to do this, he may not understand the level of importance of the talk. [4] X Research source"

Add a compliment or two into your talk but convey to him that it’s not enough. “You’re a great friend, but we can’t be together.” “You’ll make someone very happy, but it’s not going to be me.” \"You're great and have a lot to offer, but I don't think we're a good match based on our values.\" [5] X Research source [v161898_b01]. 19 August 2021. \"I think you're an amazing guy, but I think we want different things.

Deliver your official “back-off” message after you’ve told him your reasons. “We won’t have a romantic relationship.” “We can stay friends if you’re going to keep it at friendship.” “There isn’t the right chemistry between us.” \"I think you're a great guy; however, I feel that we connect better as friends rather than romantically.\" [7] X Research source [v161898_b01]. 19 August 2021."

      "content": "Be willing to listen. Rehearsing the conversation in your head helps, but can also hurt you by creating preconceptions in your head about how it will go. Rather than attacking him with your thoughts, sit across from him and hear what he has to say so that he will listen to what you have to say. [10] X Research source"

Rejection hurts, and if you’re constantly reminding him about it, he’ll constantly be hurting. This could eventually lead to self-esteem issues, anger, or even aggression—you don’t want to be at fault for that. [13] X Research source"

This can be in a separate discussion if either of you need time to think about it. Having this discussion will help both of you put some closure on the previous one. Discuss if it’s ok to comment on how one another looks. Talk about if physical contact (hugs, holding hands, etc.) is still appropriate."
