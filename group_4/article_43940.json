      "title": "Pull your hair back into a low ponytail.",
      "content": "Pull your hair back into a low ponytail. If you have long hair, keep it out of the way so you can tie your scarf. Use a hair tie or a scrunchie to pull your hair back at the nape of your neck, then secure it into a ponytail or a bun. [1] X Research source If you make your ponytail too high, you could give your scarf a bump in the back of your head. Try to get it as low as possible so your hair blends in seamlessly. If you don’t pull your hair back, it will stick out underneath the scarf."

      "title": "Fold your scarf in half to make a triangle.",
      "content": "Fold your scarf in half to make a triangle. This folding method works best with a square scarf made of silk. Fold 2 points together to make a large triangle, keeping the pattern side facing outwards. [2] X Research source You could also do this with a short shawl. You can use a scarf as large as 3 by 3 ft (0.91 by 0.91 m), or you can go as small as a bandana. If you have a rectangular scarf, don’t worry about folding it into a triangle."

    {
      "title": "Fold the long side over about 1 in (2.5 cm).",
      "content": "Fold the long side over about 1 in (2.5 cm). Grab the long end of your scarf and fold it over itself just slightly to make a small hem. This will give your babushka tie a clean look so the fold of your scarf isn’t sticking out over your forehead. [3] X Research source You don’t need to secure your hem with anything; once you put it on your head, it will stay in place on its own."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the scarf over your head with the point of the triangle near your neck.",
      "content": "Place the scarf over your head with the point of the triangle near your neck. Keeping the point facing downward, lift the scarf up and over your head, and situate the hemmed end at the very top of your forehead. Make sure the ends of the scarf are even. [4] X Research source If your scarf doesn’t look perfect just yet, don’t worry. You’ll be able to adjust it in just a second."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the ends together under your chin in a double knot.",
      "content": "Tie the ends together under your chin in a double knot. Grab the hanging ends of the scarf and pull one over the other to knot them together. Do that again to make a double knot to ensure your scarf stays on your head. [5] X Research source Silk scarves are so slippery that you’ll need a double knot to hold it closed. If you don’t want to knot your scarf together, you can just pull the hanging ends across your neck and let them sit on top of your shoulders. However, they might not stay put all day without a jacket on top to keep them in place."

    {
      "title": "Loosen the knot by pulling on it if your scarf feels too tight.",
      "content": "Loosen the knot by pulling on it if your scarf feels too tight. Stick your fingers in between your face and the scarf and pull outwards if it’s feeling a little tight. Pull down on the knot to loosen it to give yourself enough room. [6] X Research source You can adjust your scarf throughout the day if you feel it moving around."

      "content": "Wear a pair of large sunglasses to look chic. If you want to look like a celebrity, grab a pair of huge sunglasses and slide them on before going out. This is a look that will probably turn heads for the right reasons. [7] X Research source A$AP Rocky often wears big sunglasses with his babushka scarf at red carpet events."

      "content": "Put on some red lipstick to add a bit of diva glam. If you’re going for a 50s diva look, pop on your brightest red lipstick before heading out on the town. To look really glamorous, put on a bit of black winged eyeliner to complement your look. [8] X Research source You could try matching a red silk scarf to your lipstick if you want to go the extra mile."

      "title": "Pull your scarf back 3 in (7.6 cm) to show off your hair.",
      "content": "Pull your scarf back 3 in (7.6 cm) to show off your hair. If you did your hair and you want to show it off, pull the front of the scarf back to the middle of your head. Pull your bangs forward and let them fall out over the scarf so people can get a peak of your beachy waves or springy curls. [9] X Research source If you do this style, make sure the knot on your scarf is super tight, since it’s more likely to fall off the back of your head."

      "title": "Layer 2 head scarves to show off multiple patterns at once.",
      "content": "Layer 2 head scarves to show off multiple patterns at once. Grab a small scarf and tie it on like a typical babushka scarf. Then, take a large scarf and put it over your head, but pull the front back to the middle of your scalp. Tie the larger scarf under your chin so you can see the pattern of the small scarf sticking out just slightly. [10] X Research source Using 2 scarves is a cute way to keep your head warm on a chilly winter’s day. Try mixing and matching different patterns, like stripes and polka dots, with solid-colored scarves."

      "content": "Tie your knot into a bow for extra elegance. Put your scarf on like normal, then tie it under your chin once. Instead of just making a second knot, tie the ends into a large bow underneath your chin. [11] X Research source This is a great way to make your scarf look a little more put together and elegant."
