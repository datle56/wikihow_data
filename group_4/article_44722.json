      "title": "Apply ice for 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Apply ice for 20 minutes. Use an ice pack wrapped in a soft towel. Lie on your back and place the ice pack underneath you on the spot where the spasm occurred. Relax in this position for about 20 minutes, breathing deeply. [3] X Research source You may want to lie on an incline to reduce the pressure on your back. For a lower back spasm, you may get more relief if you elevate your legs. Repeat as needed every 2 hours for the next 48 to 72 hours. Don't lay on the ice pack for more than 20 minutes at a time, and don't fall asleep on an ice pack. Prolonged exposure can cause frostbite or nerve damage."

      "title": "Take an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever.",
      "content": "Take an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications can help reduce pain and inflammation. Common OTC NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). [4] X Research source You may also get relief from acetaminophen (Tylenol). While it does not have anti-inflammatory properties, it has a smaller chance of upsetting your stomach. You can also try a muscle relaxant, like Flexall or Percogesic. Use the smallest dose possible, as these can cause drowsiness."

      "title": "Try to walk around.",
      "content": "Try to walk around. While your first instinct after a back spasm may be to lie down, a short walk will get your blood moving and can help jumpstart the healing process. Start with short walks every hour or so immediately following the spasm. [5] X Research source If you lay down for too long, you can actually make the problem worse. Inactivity causes your muscles to stiffen, which can lead to more pain or even another spasm. Walking and other low-stress aerobic activity, like swimming, are great things to do during the first 2 weeks. Start slowly and gradually increase your length of exercise over this time."

    {
      "title": "Apply moist heat after 72 hours.",
      "content": "Apply moist heat after 72 hours. After 3 days, the initial swelling and inflammation will have gone down. At this point, you can start using heat to increase blood flow and loosen your muscles. Use a commercial heat pack, or soak in a warm bath. Moist heat is preferable because it won't cause dehydration. Staying well hydrated is important both for the treatment and prevention of muscle spasms generally."

      "title": "Determine what triggered the spasm.",
      "content": "Determine what triggered the spasm. A back spasm may be triggered by a prolonged period of inactivity followed by a sudden movement. Back spasms also may follow overuse of the back muscles, such as heavy lifting, or some other injury. There are many different treatments for back spasms. Understanding what caused the spasm can help you find the most effective treatment. If your spasm was caused by a sudden movement after a period of inactivity, you have no further underlying physical problem that needs treatment. Simply use ice and heat, stay active, and do some gentle stretching. [6] X Research source You may want to discuss the incident with your doctor. They can help you identify the probable trigger of your muscle spasm. You might also talk to a personal trainer or physical therapist."

      "title": "Try massage therapy to reduce stress and tension.",
      "content": "Try massage therapy to reduce stress and tension. Massage therapy from a certified professional can improve circulation and help your muscles relax. If you feel your spasm was caused by general stress, massage therapy can help. You may notice a difference after a single session. However, typically you need several sessions over the course of a couple of months if you want to see lasting results from massage therapy."

If at-home treatment doesn't resolve your problem, or if you continue to have muscle spasms in the same area, your primary physician may order tests to identify the cause. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Discuss your back spasms with your doctor, and tell them what you've been doing to treat them at home.

      "content": "Get physical therapy for muscular injuries. If you tore or injured a muscle, physical therapy can help rehabilitate that muscle. Physical therapy also helps correct muscle imbalances, which can cause one muscle to overwork and lead to spasms. A physical therapist can also provide you with a custom exercise routine designed to treat the specific issues that are causing your back spasms."

      "content": "Rule out neurological conditions. Muscle spasms can be caused by serious neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's. If you have frequent muscle spasms with no identifiable trigger, relay your concerns to your doctor. [8] X Research source Your doctor will discuss any other possible symptoms you might have and refer you to a neurologist for further testing if they believe it is warranted. If you start experiencing incontinence (or the inability to hold your urine in), see a doctor, as this can be a sign of major underlying conditions."

      "content": "Drink water to stay well hydrated. Muscle cramps and spasms can be caused by dehydration. While staying well hydrated won't necessarily prevent a back spasm from ever happening again, it will help your muscles remain loose. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day for proper hydration.

      "content": "Stay at a healthy weight. Extra weight can put more pressure on your back and musculoskeletal system, increasing your chances of developing a back spasm. Make sure that your weight is right for your height. Look up your BMI or ask a doctor for a physical evaluation. If you need to lose weight, consult a registered dietitian for a diet plan that works for you. Slowly incorporate more exercise into your day once your back spasm clears up."

      "title": "Correct mineral deficiencies in your diet.",
      "content": "Correct mineral deficiencies in your diet. If your diet is lacking in calcium, magnesium, or potassium, you may have more frequent muscle spasms. Even if you're working with a physical therapist or a chiropractor, your spasms may continue if you have these mineral deficiencies. Look for whole food sources of these minerals first. Dairy products are a good source of calcium, while bananas and potatoes are good sources of potassium. If you have a mineral deficiency, reduce or eliminate your consumption of coffee and processed sugar, which impede your body's absorption of minerals."

      "title": "Walk to stay active.",
      "content": "Walk to stay active. Staying active is one of the most important things you can do to prevent future back spasms. Walking is a low-impact activity and is generally easy on your back. Start with shorter walks and work up to a 20-minute walk every day. Cycling and swimming are two other exercises that are low impact and particularly good for your back. If you have access to a gym, you might also try 15 to 20 minutes on an elliptical or stair-climbing machine."

      "title": "Incorporate stretching into your exercise regimen.",
      "content": "Incorporate stretching into your exercise regimen. Yoga or pilates can help improve the flexibility and range of motion in your back. Try a few basic stretches before and after any activity to keep your back muscles loose. [11] X Research source With any stretching, only stretch as far as you can comfortably. If you feel any pain or discomfort, stop immediately. You could cause further damage to your muscles. Gentle stretches can also be helpful to reduce pain immediately after a back spasm."

      "content": "Use a lumbar support pillow while sitting. Place the pillow between your lower back and seat to help you sit up properly. Do this while working at a desk or driving for long periods. Get up at least once an hour to walk around. Avoid sitting for too long at 1 time. Avoid hunching over while sitting. If you have to sit for a long time, change positions often."

      "title": "Start strength training to build core muscles once your back spasm heals.",
      "content": "Start strength training to build core muscles once your back spasm heals. Always consult with your doctor before trying any back exercises like these if you have back spasms. Doing exercises improperly or that you are not ready for could result in further injury. The muscles in your core create a natural corset that keeps your spine in alignment and your back in correct posture. Strengthening your core can help you avoid future back spasms. The plank is a basic core strengthening exercise that you can do without any equipment. Lie on your stomach on the floor, propped up on your elbows with your forearms flat on the floor. Raise up until only your toes and your forearms are supporting your body. Activate your core and hold the position for 20 seconds to start. Practice your plank several times a day, gradually increasing the length of time you hold the position. Make sure you're breathing deeply and regularly while holding the plank. Many people have a tendency to hold their breath when they activate their core. Avoid jerky or fast movements while lifting weights or heavy objects, as these may cause a back spasm."
