Place a cushion or exercise mat under your knees for support and comfort. [1] X Research source Make sure your hands and arms are directly underneath your shoulders. Start with the toes of your feet touching the floor. If you don’t have an ab roller, try using a barbell with round plates or a towel on a smooth floor, instead. If you’re using a towel, simply place your hands on top of it and slide forward."

      "content": "Contract your abs and roll forward, tucking your pelvis in. As you hold the bars on either side of the ab wheel , move forward using your core. Push your hands, arms, and torso forward until just before you feel like you can no longer pull yourself back up. Try to keep your abs tight, your hips stable, and your back flat. [2] X Research source Personal trainer and strength coach Brendon Rearick says to “make sure your rib cage and pelvis are on top of each other.” [3] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. If it’s too difficult to keep the proper form, roll the ab roller toward your knees until you’re in the right position. As you practice, it’ll get easier to roll further and further.

      "content": "Hold the position for a second or two before moving backward. The longer you hold the extended or \"rolled out\" pose, the more intensively you will target your abs. If you’re starting this workout as a beginner, pause for only a second. [5] X Research source As your abs get stronger, you’ll be able to pause for a few seconds longer. If holding this position is too difficult, instantly pull back as soon as you extend forward. You can also spread your knees apart slightly before pushing forward. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Engage your abs and lower back muscles to pull the wheel back. Use your core and latissimus dorsi (lats, or lower back) muscles to roll the ab wheel toward your knees slowly. As you \"roll in,\" perform the mirror opposite of the \"roll out\" move you used to stretch yourself out. Once you're back, you have completed one \"rep\" of a standard ab roller workout. [7] X Research source Make sure you’re using your abs to pull yourself back. Try not to use your hips or arms. [8] X Research source This may damage your shoulder if done improperly, so proceed gradually and with caution. If you experience any shoulder pain, reduce how far you push forward and build up gradually."

      "content": "Keep your arms straight and focus on your abs. Make sure your arms and back are completely straight before, during, and after you push forward. Try to keep your elbows straight—some lifters bend their elbows slightly, which can push the emphasis onto the triceps (the upper arm) instead of the abs. [9] X Research source Make sure your wrists are completely straight. Bending your wrists can put unnecessary strain on them. [10] X Research source Try not to let your knees or your bottom sag toward the ground at any point. Imagine that there is a long, flat plank of wood on your back from your head to your tailbone. Instead of arching your back, Rearick says to round in the opposite direction, like a rainbow. This is because “when you go out and your hands go above your head, you actually end up going into neutral,” he says. [11] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. Try not to drive your hips down when you push the wheel or up when you pull back. This can cause your lower back to arch, taking tension out of your core."

Keep your arms even and straight so that the wheel doesn't spin out of control or fall to the side. Try to maintain the same slow, measured speed throughout the entirety of each rep. [12] X Research source Inhale as you roll forward and exhale as you pull the ab wheel back towards your body. This allows you to use your exhale to contract your abs and bring your arms back in.

      "content": "End your roll against a wall or kettlebell. Rearick recommends putting a kettlebell in front of you or positioning a certain distance away from a wall so that the object can catch the wheel and help prevent you from falling. This can also help you “gauge how far away you are” and “progress the exercise in a way that is going to build on each week.” [14] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. To start, position yourself 3 ft (0.91 m) away from a wall. Then, perform the ab roll as normal until your ab roller makes contact with the wall or kettlebell. The wall or kettlebell is your \"touch point,\" or signal that you have gone far enough on this rep. Roll back up to your hands and knees for the next rep. You can also mark the furthest you can push forward without falling with a piece of tape. Move the piece of tape forward 2 in (5.1 cm) when the workout feels easier."

[18] X Research source To see continual progress and build even more strength, try to incorporate warm-ups and nutrition into your exercise program. If you find it difficult to do this many reps, try doing 1 set of 3 to 8 reps until you have mastered your form and built up your ab, arm, and lower back strength."

Try to hold the fully extended, \"rolled-out\" pose with your knees off the ground for a couple of seconds before rolling back to your starting position. Try to stay fully extended for 30 to 60 seconds, then lower your knees to the floor. [19] X Research source Repeat this exercise 2 to 3 times. Try not to overextend yourself.

Pull back once more and move forward, positioning the roller slightly to the right. [21] X Research source Aim to do 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps for each direction you go in.

      "content": "Ab rollers strengthen your glutes, abs, lower back, and obliques. As you push forward on the ab roller, your abdominis (ab) muscles and glutes contract and engage to keep your spine and back neutral. Your latissimus dorsi (lower back muscle) also lengthens and works to bring your hands back underneath your shoulders when you roll back. [25] X Research source Additionally, your triceps, biceps, and shoulders are trained to keep your elbows and arms straight during the exercise. The control and stability necessary to complete this exercise along with the time you spend in the extended position can also increase your abdominal muscle mass."
