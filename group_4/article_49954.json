      "content": "\"Your TV isn't part of the Netflix Household for this account\" If you see this message, you're trying to watch Netflix from somewhere other than the location Netflix considers the account owner's household. You'll usually see it if you try to watch Netflix using an account you share with somebody who doesn't live with you. You may also see it if you try to use your own Netflix account while traveling, at a friend's house, or if you maintain multiple residences."

      "title": "What is a Netflix Household?",
      "content": "What is a Netflix Household? Now that Netflix is cracking down on account sharing, they've added a feature—Netflix Household—that limits accounts to a single internet connection. Your Netflix Household is the account owner's primary location, and all devices that share the same internet connection at that location are considered part of the household. [1] X Research source Each Netflix account owner can have only one household. This makes it difficult to share a Netflix account with people you don't live with, which was Netflix's goal. So, if you've been sharing a Netflix account with somebody who doesn't live with you, only one of your locations can be the Netflix Household, and the other person will see \"Your TV isn't part of the Netflix Household for this account\" when they try to watch. There are also some unintended consequences. If you want to use your own Netflix account in a hotel or Airbnb while traveling, at a friend's house who doesn't have Netflix, or even in your second residence, you might see \"Your TV isn’t part of the Netflix Household\" when you try to stream."

If you frequently travel or have a second home, make sure your Netflix account is always available by connecting your mobile device to your home Wi-Fi and streaming a few seconds of a Netflix show or movie at least once every 30 days. While away from home, connect the same device to the Wi-Fi network you want to stream on, and stream a few seconds of Netflix. You'll then be able to watch in the new location, both on your device and by signing in to a TV. [2] X Research source"

If it's been more than 30 days since you last signed in to the previous location, or if you're using somebody else's Netflix account, you'll need to update the Netflix Household location if you want to keep watching. You can do this from any TV at the new location, but keep in mind that anyone who tries to watch at the original Netflix Household location won't be able to unless they change the location back—which, of course, would boot you out. Still, if you coordinate things right with the person you share with, this could be an easy fix. At the new household location, press the left button on the TV remote and go to Get Help > Manage Netflix Household . Select Update Netflix Household and choose whether to receive a verification link via text message or email. Open the text or email from Netflix, tap Yes, This Was Me , and follow the on-screen instructions."

If you're the account owner and want to share Netflix with someone outside of your household or watch in your second residence without the hassle, you can add an extra member to your account for $7.99 per month.

There are some drawbacks to this type of account.

Plenty of people have run into this problem when sharing Netflix accounts with friends and family, so naturally, there are lots of workarounds/hacks floating around the net. Some Reddit users found they can bypass the Netflix sharing restrictions by searching for the show or movie they want to watch on Google, following the link on their computer or phone, and signing in that way. You may be able to cast Netflix to an older Chromecast. This won't work on a Chromecast with Google TV, but if you connect a 3rd generation Chromecast to a TV, you might be able to cast Netflix from Chrome on your laptop to the Chromecast without getting Netflix Household errors."
