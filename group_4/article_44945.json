Be sure your mustache is dry while you do this so you get a more accurate feel for the length of your facial hair. A wet or damp mustache tends to look longer than it is during normal, everyday wear, and so you may end up cutting off too much. By trimming it while it’s dry, you’ll be able to see how it looks most of the time, when it’s not wet."

Hold the trimming scissors parallel to your lips and make small cuts following your lip line. Work from the outside of your mustache towards the center. Once you reach the center from one side, start from the end of your mustache on the opposite side. [3] X Research source Cutting along the top of your lip line is standard, but alter your mustache length according to the style you’re aiming to achieve. If you're using an electric trimmer , gently press the edge of the trimmer to the top of your lip line and pull it away. Note that this method makes for a standard, classic mustache—alter your trimming length and volume to achieve different styles."

You can always trim more off, but you have to wait for it to grow back if you cut too much. Some electric trimmers come with guides that will work as a replacement for a comb. Start on the longer settings first and work your way to a shorter length. Avoid using electric clippers without a guard or comb since you could easily cut off too much hair.
