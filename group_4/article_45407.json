      "title": "Snake a sink drain with a hanger that's bent at the end.",
      "content": "Snake a sink drain with a hanger that's bent at the end. Straighten out a wire coat hanger and bend the tip to a 90-degree angle with a pair of pliers. Be sure the length of the hook is small enough the fit through the basket strainer, which is the screen designed to catch foreign particles. Push the hooked end down the drain, twist it, and pull it upward. Continue this until you fish out hair and dirt from the drain that is clogged. [1] X Research source Remove the basket strainer from below the sink using an adjustable wrench if the snake doesn't fit through its holes. Try not to push the debris further down into the pipe. The goal is to drag out whatever is causing the clog. For 2-bowl sinks, twist the hanger and pull until you feel it hook onto the baffle, which is the part narrower than the rest of the drain. Afterward, wiggle it up and down while twisting to clear the clog."

      "content": "Suck out the source of a sink or tub clog using a wet/dry vacuum. [2] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Turn the vacuum to the wet setting so it is safe to vacuum liquids and turn it to its highest suction. Now, hold it over the drain and the force of the vacuum will bring the clog up from the drain and into the vacuum. If this doesn't work, insert the nozzle into the drain as far as possible. Remember not to try this with a machine that is not equipped to handle both dry and wet work. Always cover the vacuum vent with a plastic container or bag to catch particles that are too fine for the filter. If you don't, you risk creating a spray or mess with whatever comes out of the drain. Seal the drain with a plunger head to force the liquid that leaves the drain to go directly into the vacuum. Remove a plunger head from its handle, place it over the sink's hole, and insert your vacuum nozzle through the hole."

      "title": "Plunge a sink or tub drain with a toilet plunger.",
      "content": "Plunge a sink or tub drain with a toilet plunger. Place a toilet plunger directly over the clogged drain and press down gently to create a seal. After pressing down, plunge up and down vigorously while maintaining the seal. Stop when you see water flooding down the drain or hear the clog come free. Never attempt this if you have used a chemical solvent like Draino, as you risk the chemical spraying upward onto your skin. Don't angle the plunger or you risk breaking the seal. If you don't have a toilet plunger, you may be able to break or loosen the clog with your toilet cleaning brush. [3] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Remove the plunger from over the drain after you press down on it 4 or 5 times. Check to see if you brought anything up. If you did, clean it away from the drain; if you didn't, try plunging again."

      "title": "Flush the drain with a mixture of baking soda and vinegar.",
      "content": "Flush the drain with a mixture of baking soda and vinegar. Start by flushing the drain with a pot of boiling water. Now, mix 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water with 1 cup (240 mL) of vinegar in a measuring cup. Add 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of baking soda into the drain and pour your vinegar and water mixture on top of it—the drain should rise with bubbles. Allow the mixture to sit in the drain for at least 1 hour. [4] X Research source After letting the mixture sit, run hot tap water into the drain for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Use this method on all drain types—kitchens, bathtubs, basement sinks. If this step doesn't work, you likely have some serious blockage. Try another method."

      "content": "Pour a salt, baking soda, and hot water mixture down the drain. Pour 1/2 cup (64 grams) of regular table salt into a measuring cup and mix it with 1/2 cup (64 grams) of baking soda. Now, pour the mixture slowly down your drain and leave it alone for 10 to 20 minutes. The chemical reaction should eat away the worst of the clog. [5] X Research source Flush the drain with hot water after letting the mixture sit. The drain should clear when you run the water. Use this technique on any type of drain."

      "content": "Dump liquid dish detergent and hot water into your toilet when it's clogged. Pour 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 mL) of any dish detergent into your toilet bowl. It should sink to the bottom since it is denser and heavier than water. Let it sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Now, fill a container with hot water and gently pour it into the toilet bowl. [6] X Research source Be careful not to overflow the bowl with hot water. Plunge the toilet until it is clear when you're done."

      "content": "Purchase a plumber's auger, which is also called a snake. Plumber's augers are long and flexible steel cables that are wound around a spool, which is attached to a hand crank. You can purchase augers up to 100 feet (30 m) in length, although 25 ft (7.6 m) models are ideal for standard house clogs. [7] X Research source Buy augers from a hardware store or home improvement retailer."

      "content": "Remove the trap connected to the sink drain. Traps are the U-shaped piping pieces that connect drains to the standard piping lines. If you have a PVC plastic trap, it is likely held together by a cylindrical threaded coupling, which can be removing by unscrewing it counterclockwise by hand. If the model is held together with bolts, remove them by turning them counterclockwise with a pipe wrench. After removing the trap, empty its water into a bucket and check that it isn't clogged. [8] X Research source Remove the trap's horizontal arm that extends from the stub-out, which is the horizontal piping extending from the wall."

It should be fixed to the tub with 2 screws that can be removed using a standard Phillips head screwdriver. [9] X Research source After removing the overflow plate, you should have access to the overflow tube, which is the piping that you need to remove the clog from."

      "title": "Insert the snake into the sink drain or overflow tube and twist when you feel resistance.",
      "content": "Insert the snake into the sink drain or overflow tube and twist when you feel resistance. Use about 18 inches (46 cm) of cable from the plumber's auger for sinks and 30 inches (76 cm) of cable for the overflow tube in a bathtub. Once the wire is out, tighten the lock screw. Now, turn the handle clockwise and push the cable forward into the piping. When you feel the snake slow down or catch onto something, turn the handle counterclockwise and pull the auger backward. [10] X Research source Continue pushing the cable forward and twisting the snake until you break through the blockage. Retrieve the cable when you have cleared the clog and reattach the trap or overflow plate."

      "content": "Find a drain cleaner that is intended for your system. Head to your local hardware, home improvement, or department store. There are 2 main types of drain pipes: galvanized metal and PVC. Older homes use the former, while modern homes have shifted to the latter. Be sure to check the kind of pipes your drain uses and select a product that is indicated for its use. [12] X Research source Hit your piping with a wrench—galvanized metal will ring, while PVC won't. In addition, PVC has copper crimp rings outside of the pipe holding its pieces together. If you have a septic tank, be sure to select a product that is labeled for use with these systems. Talk to a staff member and ask for product recommendations for your specific clog. Choose a product indicated for use with the clog type—tub, shower, sink, or toilet. Don't mix different kinds of chemicals."

      "content": "Follow the directions listed on the bottle of your cleaner. Carefully read the directions on your cleaner and locate the recommended amount of cleaner and the amount of time to leave it in the drain. Put on your safety gear, such as eye protection and rubber gloves and slowly pour the amount of cleaner listed on the bottle. Afterward, wait the amount of time recommended by the manufacturer. Once the time is up, flush the drain with hot water. [13] X Research source Don't leave the drain cleaner in contact with your piping longer than the manufacturer recommends. Never let your drain cleaner come into contact with finished surfaces like stoppers, faucets, and drain trim. Don't use a plunger or other drain-opening tools following the application of drain cleaner, as you risk getting it on your skin. If drain cleaner doesn't work, call a professional plumber."

To be safe, wash your hands thoroughly with cool water. Pour a generous amount of baking soda to the surface of the sink, tub, and surrounding areas and remove it by scrubbing it thoroughly with a wet rag. Afterward, wipe any baking soda remnants with a paper towel. [14] X Research source Place the drain cleaner somewhere out of reach if you have children."
