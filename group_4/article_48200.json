[1] X Research source The most common way to use NFC on an Android is to make contactless payments, connect to some screenless devices, or transfer content with a tap. NFC is a refined form of RFID with a lower transmission range. Whereas RFID works over a large range, NFC needs a close range of a few centimeters or touch to work. Because NFC requires such a close range, it's considered more secure than Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. [2] X Research source"

The NFC chip in your Android only activates when it comes in close contact with an NFC reader (like a card reader with Google Pay) or another NFC chip (as if you're sharing data with another device). Unlike other technologies, your personal information cannot be skimmed with NFC since it has such a small range. You'd have to knowingly tap your phone to something for the NFC to trigger."
