      "content": "A player that’s “under the gun” is the first player to the left of the big blind. At the start of a poker hand, the first 2 players to the left of the dealer (button) are the small blind and big blind players. Being under the gun means you’re immediately after the big blind player and are the first person to decide whether you want to call, raise, or fold your hand. [1] X Research source The position is called “under the gun” because there’s a lot of pressure to make a good move as the first player and you don’t have any information about the other players’ hands. The players immediately after the under the gun position are commonly known as “UTG+1” and “UTG+2.”"

      "content": "Raise only the strongest hands. When you’re under the gun and it’s your turn to act, play really conservatively since you’re at a disadvantage to the other players. Raising is usually the best option to let other players know you have a strong hand and make them more likely to fold. The hands that are the best to raise when you’re under the gun are: [2] X Research source Pairs of 8s or higher Ace and face card of different suits Ace with a face card or 10 of the same suit Face cards (broadway cards) of the same suit Calling and matching the big blind is also known as “limping,” and some players suggest avoiding this tactic because it puts you out of position post-flop. However, if you have a pair of Aces or another high hand, calling can be a good way to bluff and trick a player into raising the pot higher."

      "title": "Fold weaker hands to avoid losing money.",
      "content": "Fold weaker hands to avoid losing money. For the rest of the possible lower poker hands, it’s more likely that other players have stronger sets of cards than you. Rather than raising or calling and putting more of your chips on the line, it’s best to fold and sit out for the rest of the hand. [3] X Research source This is especially important if you’re playing in a tournament and have a limited set of chips. Folding on a bad hand when you’re under the gun saves your chips for betting on a stronger hand."

      "title": "Raise the bet if another player calls you.",
      "content": "Raise the bet if another player calls you. When a player calls your bet, it usually means they don’t have that strong of a hand but want to stay in the game. Up the ante and increase your bet to see how the other players respond. Some players may call even if they have a strong hand to increase the pot size. Show some restraint with how much you bet so you don’t get caught losing a lot of chips."

      "content": "Fold against a 3-bet if you have a weak hand. A 3-bet is when another player re-raises after you’ve already raised, which usually means they have a strong hand. If you have cards lower than an Ace and Jack, then it’s best to just fold and cut your losses instead of losing more chips. [4] X Research source There’s a chance a player that raises your bet is bluffing, but most experienced players won’t risk losing more of their chips."

      "content": "Check a player that raised you to force their play. If you have a hand that’s an Ace and Jack or better, then check when it’s your turn. Checking means you don’t place a bid, so the other player has to decide if they want to raise the bid. If they raise it again, then it’s best to fold because there’s a good chance they have a really strong hand. If all the players check after the flop, then no bets are made and the next card is added to the middle of the table and a new bidding round starts."
