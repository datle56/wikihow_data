Hold the baby sitting upright in your lap and make sure the mask is snug against the baby's face. If there is space between the mask and the baby, the mist will leak out and the baby will not get the whole dose. As the mist slows down, flick the medicine cup with your finger to make sure the last few droplets of medication are nebulized and inhaled."

      "content": "Don't put the nebulizer on a crying baby. This will give the baby a bad experience with the nebulizer which will make it harder in the future. In addition, a crying baby will not successfully inhale the medication. When a baby cries, she makes a very quick inhalation and a long exhalation. This means that almost none of the medication will be inhaled deeply enough to make into the lungs. If you cannot soothe your baby by holding her and singing to her, you may need to wait and try the nebulizer later when she is less fussy. However, if your baby is having trouble breathing and will not calm, you can use the nebulizer for rescue treatments if needed to help her breathe, even if she is crying. If your baby is a sound sleeper, you may be able to put the nebulizer on while she sleeps."
