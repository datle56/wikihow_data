      "title": "Use a Betadine scrub to kill the water wart virus.",
      "content": "Use a Betadine scrub to kill the water wart virus. Betadine is an effective iodine-based antiseptic that helps to fight off the water wart virus and eliminate the warts. Betadine scrubs are available over-the-counter in most pharmacies. To use the scrub, wet your hands with a little warm water then rub the Betaine onto the infected skin. Do this for five minutes everyday until the warts disappear. This treatment is not recommended for people allergic to betadine or iodine. Alternatively, you can apply a pure iodine solution directly onto the warts, using a cotton pad. It's recommended that you prick each wart with a sterilized needle first, as this will help the iodine to penetrate the skin."

      "content": "Use apple cider vinegar to dry out the warts. Apple cider vinegar is an effective home remedy for drying out and removing warts. The acid in the vinegar attacks the wart, causing it to peel away from the healthy surrounding skin, taking the virus with it. Although some studies support the use of vinegar for warts, more research needs to be done to determine whether it is safe and effective. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source To use apple cider vinegar, soak a cotton ball in the vinegar and place it on the wart. Cover the area with an adhesive bandage for 24 hours. When you remove the bandage the wart should be gone, though you may have a scab in its place (which should disappear in a couple of days). Apple cider vinegar can be used on all types of warts except those which are caused by sexually transmitted disease, such as genital warts."

      "content": "Apply milkweed cream to dissolve the warts. A proteolytic enzyme ( i.e. an enzyme that breaks down protein) found in the milkweed plant can digest and dissolve water warts. Find a milkweed cream in a drugstore or online and apply it to the water warts at least four times a day. While some people think milkweed has a positive effect, there are no studies or trials to support its use."

      "content": "Use salicylic acid to soften the warts. Salicylic acid is an over-the-counter wart medicine used for treating mild skin conditions. Salicylic acid works by softening the keratin (a protein that forms the structure of the skin), in the warts and the surrounding skin. Once the warts have softened, use a pumice stone or an emery board to remove them. [3] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. You can find topical salicylic acid in the wart aisle or section of your local pharmacy. [4] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020.

The medical term for this is \"central umbilication\". Water warts should not feel painful, but the virus may trigger an immune response, causing the wart and the surrounding skin to feel itchy."

The water wart virus can also spread from one part of your body through the other, via auto-inocculation. This happens when you scratch or touch an existing wart, and then touch other parts of your body, causing multiple lesions."

The water wart virus spreads most easily through direct skin-to-skin contact, but kids can get it by touching objects that have the virus on them, such as toys, clothing, towels, and bedding. It can also spread in water, so kids often get water warts from swimming in a public pool. [17] X Research source Sexually active adults. Water wart infections are often transmitted through sexual intercourse and affect the genitals, buttocks, lower abdomen and inner thighs. In rare cases, infections are also found on the lips, mouth and eyelids. People with immune deficiencies: People whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV, cancer treatment, or long-term steroid use are more vulnerable to infection by the water wart virus."

Keep the areas with growths clean and change each bandage daily or when it becomes dirty. Do not scratch or rub water wart growths, and regularly wash your hands with antibacterial soap. Do not shave over areas that have bumps, as the razor could easily spread the virus from one part of the body to the other."
