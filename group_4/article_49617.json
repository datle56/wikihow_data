      "content": "Choose and research an issue to write about. Look at trending topics on Google, the news, or scholarly journals for issues you're interested in. After picking an issue, research its history, recent developments, potential obstacles to fixing it, and different arguments or positions other people and organizations have taken on it. Remember to examine at least 2 sides of the issue. Looking at all sides and perspectives of an issue not only helps you pick the best position, but also helps you choose good counterarguments later. If your teacher or organization assigned you an issue to write about, research that instead."

[1] X Research source When you're creating a thesis, think about how it addresses the arguments or solves the problems you discovered during research. Additionally, decide what you think is the practical or moral stance to take based on your own opinions and experiences. Just keep in mind that whatever thesis you come up with, you must be able to defend it with supportive evidence."

Access scholarly articles in online databases like JSTOR . Find government data reports by visiting the website for the specific department that published it (e.g., the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ). These sites always have \".gov\" at the end of the URL.

What claims (and supporting evidence) could your opponents make that might make it seem like you didn't think your thesis through?

At the end of the paragraph, state your thesis, so that readers know your position on the matter right away. [8] X Research source Use a fact or a piece of data to hook your readers in and underscore how important the issue is going to be. For example, you could provide a statistic of how many children are injured on old playground equipment every year. Consider preceding your thesis with a counterargument to show how strongly you believe in your position. For example: \"Although installing new playground equipment in the park will be expensive, new playground equipment would provide a safe play area for children and offer options for special needs children.\""

For example, \"While new playground equipment is expensive, it's worth the investment because it serves the best interests of the community by providing children with a safe area to play and making the park more accessible for special needs children.\" End by recommending ways to solve the issue that align with your position (if you desire). For example: \"Children need a safe, accessible place to play, so the only choice is to install new park equipment in Quimby Park.\""

      "content": "Ensure your position is arguable. If you're researching an issue to discuss on your own (and aren't being assigned one), make sure it's controversial with at least 2 clear sides, and choose one. [12] X Research source That way, when you make your argument, you can inform your audience about an important point or perspective they may not have thought about before. Sometimes a topic might seem to have 2 sides, but in reality, most people would agree on one side. For example, you wouldn’t want to write a paper arguing that children need proper care, as no one would disagree with that stance. A better issue may be taking a stance on what proper childcare looks like."

      "content": "A position paper is a type of argumentative essay focusing on a specific issue. The point of a position paper is to communicate your position on a specific issue or policy and provide evidence for it, all within a handful of paragraphs and 1-2 pages. It's just one type of argumentative essay, however. There are others, including proposals, evaluations, and causal analyses. [14] X Research source If your teacher asks you to write an argumentative essay without clarifying what type, they may want you to take a stance on a broader topic rather than any one particular problem. For example, an argumentative essay assignment might ask you to provide a thesis statement and arguments for or against government-funded children's playgrounds. A position paper assignment might ask you to stand for or against investing in playground equipment at a real-life local playground."
