      "content": "Calculate how much water you’ll need to brine your pork. Lay out your pork in a cooking dish and cover it up completely with cool water. Then, take out the pork and transfer the water to a large measuring cup (or cups) to see how much water you used. Set aside the water for later. [1] X Research source Make sure the pork is totally submerged before you transfer the water."

      "content": "Make your brine with water, sugar, and salt. Fill a large pot with 1 c (240 mL) of water and set it on the stovetop. Once the water starts boiling, stir in a ¾ cup (150 g) of sugar and a ¾ cup (216 g) of salt, letting both dissolve. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour the mixture into the measured water and refrigerate it. If you didn’t pre-measure the water, use 1 US gal (3.8 L) of cool water. Then, refrigerate the water and check its temperature periodically—you don’t want to brine the pork while the mixture is still warm. [3] X Research source Want to give your brine a little more flavor? Add in small amounts of your favorite seasonings, like fresh sections of herbs, cinnamon sticks, whole vanilla beans, or coriander seed. Feel free to experiment; for instance, a ½ cup (100 g) of sugar per every 1 US qt (0.95 L) of water can give your pork a nice browning effect when it cooks."

Here’s a quick run-down of how long you should brine your pork in the refrigerator: [4] X Research source Pork chops: 12 to 24 hours Pork tenderloin (whole): 6 to 12 hours Pork loin (whole): 2 to 4 days"

      "content": "Rinse off the pork once the brining time is over. Even if you aren’t quite ready to cook your pork at the end of the brining period, take a moment to rinse off the extra salt from the meat. Feel free to stash your brined pork in the fridge after rinsing, or simply cook it right away. [5] X Research source"

Transfer this mixture to a sealable plastic bag or large container—anything that’s large enough to fit both the baking soda solution and the pork cuts should be fine. [6] X Research source Alternative: If you’re working with a larger cut of pork, simply lightly coat the outside of the meat with baking soda and place it in a sealed bag or covered container. Let it refrigerate for 3 hours, and then rinse off all the baking soda before"

Now, you’re ready to cook your tenderized pork however you’d like! [7] X Research source Did you know? Baking soda-based tenderizing is a popular method sometimes applied to Chinese cuisine. It’s also known as “velveting.”"

      "content": "Hit the pork repeatedly with a meat mallet to tenderize it. Slide your pork into a plastic bag, or use wax paper (or plastic wrap) to sandwich the cutlets. Then, whack the meat down to a thinner width using a meat mallet. Tools like rolling pins, saucepans, cutting boards, and even regular hammers can work in a pinch. [8] X Research source Meat mallets help to break up the inner fibers of the meat while also helping thin it out. Flattening the meat gives it a consistent width without, which allows for a smoother, more consistent cooking experience. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Apply dry rub and refrigerate the pork for at least 8 hours. Create your dry rub by combining 2 tsp (6 g) of salt, 1 tsp (2 g) of dried herbs, and ½ tsp (1 g) of black pepper. Blot each side of the pork chops so they’re totally dry, and then coat the meat with the seasoning. Chill the pork chops on a wire rack that’s stacked atop of a rimmed baking sheet, waiting between 8 and 24 hours for the meat to tenderize. After this, you’ll be ready to cook your pork chops. [10] X Research source This recipe provides enough dry rub for 2 pork chops (about 2 lb (0.91 kg) of meat total, with each piece being about 3 ⁄ 4 to 1 in (1.9 to 2.5 cm) thick). Dry rubs help remove moisture from the outside of the meat, while allowing the inner portion of the meat to stay juicy. [11] X Research source"

Then, partially slice open each pork chop horizontally (almost like you’re opening up a textbook). Slip the pork chops into the bag of marinade, close the bag, and let it chill between 6–8 hours.

Then, take a fork and poke the entire surface of the pork. Place the pork into the bag, seal it up, and let it marinate for at least 8 hours. Before cooking, let the marinated pork get to around room temperature. [13] X Research source This marinade works well for around 2 lb (0.91 kg) of pork. Feel free to adjust the recipe for your needs. You can also add 2 tbsp (24 g) of powdered meat tenderizer to the marinade, but you don’t have to."

      "content": "Sprinkle meat tenderizer over the surface of the pork while it’s damp. Pour a tiny bit of water over the pork’s surface—just enough to make it damp. Then, lightly coat the meat with tenderizer (about 1 tsp/small spoonful of powder for every 1 lb (0.45 kg) of pork is a good rule of thumb). Indent the surface of the pork with a fork, and then cook it (using your desired cooking method) right after. [14] X Research source If your pork is exceptionally thick (like a pork tenderloin), wait around 30 minutes after applying the tenderizer and piercing the meat to start cooking. Try to space out your fork indents so they’re about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) apart."
