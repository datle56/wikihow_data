      "content": "Avoid eating right before or after using the tincture. Eating immediately before or after you take the CBD can affect how consistently it absorbs into your bloodstream. [4] X Research source Hold off on having anything to eat for 15-20 minutes after using the tincture, or wait a similar amount of time after eating before you take your dose. This doesn’t mean you should take CBD oil on an empty stomach. In fact, taking CBD while there’s food in your stomach can increase the level of CBD in your bloodstream.

Measure out an appropriate dosage of the CBD tincture with the dropper and place the drops directly under your tongue.

It won’t absorb into your bloodstream as effectively, and you may accidentally swallow it too soon. If the tincture is in the form of a spray, spritz it under your tongue. The label on the product should tell you how much CBD is in each puff of the spray. [7] X Research source"

Since research on the medicinal uses of CBD oil is still in its early stages, there aren’t a lot of formal dosing guidelines available. However, your doctor should be able to give you some recommendations about what dose will be safe and effective for you. If you’re just taking CBD, 10 mg is a good starting dose. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source A common starting dose for sublingual CBD with THC is 2.5-5 mg. [14] X Research source Until you know how the CBD will affect you, it’s a good idea to use a relatively low dose. Gradually increase your dosage until you get the desired effect.

      "content": "Pick a product that’s been third party verified. Since CBD products aren’t consistently regulated, it can be hard to know what you’re getting. CBD oil that’s low quality or contaminated won’t be as effective as a high-quality product, and it could even make you sick. Look for products that have been analyzed by reputable third party laboratories. [16] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source When you buy CBD from a store or dispensary, ask to see the COA (certificate of analysis) for the product. The COA contains detailed information about how the product was tested. Don’t buy from retailers who can’t or won’t share testing information. Check the ANSI National Accreditation Board’s search database for information about accredited labs that test CBD products. Do a search for “cannabidiol” or “CBD”: http://search.anab.org/ .
