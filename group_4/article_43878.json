      "content": "The 👍 emoji is controversial because it can be easily misinterpreted. Since the emoji is so commonly used, the original positive meaning may have become lost, and it can be viewed as a way to shut down a conversation, rather than continue it. The emoji may be interpreted as sarcastic or insincere, especially since people cannot clarify their tone or intent over text. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Consider the sender’s age and the overall context of the conversation. Gen Z-ers are more likely to use the emoji in a sarcastic or passive aggressive way, so reflect on the entire conversation (and your relationship with the other person) to determine their intent. If they send the emoji in response to a serious or lengthy message, it may be a sign that they’re brushing you off. [4] X Research source Other signs that the thumbs up emoji is being used passive aggressively include: Overuse or repetition: Spamming a conversation with the thumbs up emoji comes off as insincere, sarcastic, or mocking. Length of the messages: If the thumbs up emoji is used in response to a longer message, it suggests that the other person is annoyed or reluctant to respond. Topic of the conversation: Sending the emoji in response to a serious topic comes off as rude and disrespectful. It shows you’re not interested in coming up with a meaningful reply. Change in texting behavior: If the sender takes a while to respond or doesn’t usually send emojis, sending a thumbs up emoji could signal they’re over the conversation. Overall tone of the conversation: If the conversation seems tense or emotionally charged, the emoji might reinforce that negative tone. This is especially true if they pair it with short, dismissive replies like “yeah,” “sure,” or “whatever.”"
