      "title": "Plan it out beforehand.",
      "content": "Plan it out beforehand. You don't want to do this unprepared, unless you're a total night owl. To stay up all night, you need to have some things. If you're planning on sneaking around the house, make a map of your house. Test the floors, chairs, couch, and beds and mark out where things creak, shake, or make any noise when you move around. If you're afraid of the dark, plan out which areas you will avoid. You're almost ready to start. Get all your things and entertainment ready to go. Stuff it somewhere inconspicuous (like under your bed). Also, you will want to place a bucket of cold water or a wet cloth there too. Get a lot of sleep the night before you do this, however, try going to bed a little later then wake up as late as possible. Don't go to bed early as you may get tired earlier, for example, if you go to bed at 9:00 PM, you will start to feel tired around that time on the day you are staying up."

      "content": "Don't rush to bed early or your parents will get suspicious. Go at your normal time, acting completely ordinary. You can't have them suspecting anything. If you have a computer, PlayStation, DS, Xbox, etc. in your room, it is a good idea to leave them on with the monitor off, because if you have to turn it on totally in the middle of the night your parents (even sleeping ones) will be woken by the sudden change in volume. If you do not have any devices than try to just chill out."

      "title": "Once you go to bed, wait until your parents go to sleep before doing anything.",
      "content": "Once you go to bed, wait until your parents go to sleep before doing anything. This may take a long time, even more than an hour, but be determined to stay awake. Now, once your parents are asleep, it's time for you to have lots of fun! If your parents haven't fallen asleep, hide under the covers of your bed with a mobile device with low brightness. You should make the volume very low so you can hear if they're walking around. Make sure to have a plan to hide your electronics in case your parents get out of bed."

      "content": "Get out something small like a tablet or phone to occupy yourself until your parents are completely asleep (or if they are light sleepers. ) Don't leave your room. It'll pass time for a while. Get on the computer or something that will keep your brain active. Remember that you want the devices as silent as possible so it won't wake up your parents. Keep one earbud or cover of your headphones out of your ear so you can hear what’s going on around you. If you are using a phone or gadget, make sure you have a cover on it, so if one of your parents come in, you can fold the cover over to block the light emanating from the device. You could also put it under your duvet to hide it."

Don't keep them open for many hours as it may attract ants. Fake sleep when you hear someone coming or creaking noises."
