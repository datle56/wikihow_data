Similar to the 🏳️‍🌈 (rainbow flag) emoji (another symbol of the LGBTQ+ community), the 🏳️‍⚧️ (trans flag) emoji stands for the trans pride flag, a symbol that is widely used by members of the trans community. It features 5 equal-sized horizontal stripes: the 1st and 5th are light blue, the 2nd and 4th are light pink, and the 3rd/central stripe is white. On some devices, the 🏳️‍⚧️ (trans flag) emoji might appear as a combination of the 🏳️‍ (white flag) and ⚧️ (transgender symbol) emojis. In Unicode, the emoji uses a mixture of U+1F3F3, U+FE0F, U+200D, U+26A7, and U+FE0F. [1] X Research source"

You might like to include the emoji somewhere in your social media profile, like on Twitter/X. You might also choose to include your preferred pronouns with this emoji. Important note: While the trans flag (and the 🏳️‍⚧️ (trans flag) emoji, by association) is often associated with binary trans identities (like trans men and trans women ), you can also use it to represent your non-binary identity (people who don’t identify within the gender binary). Ultimately, it depends on you—you may feel really comfortable in trans spaces and feel like the flag represents you well, or you might not necessarily identify with the flag as much. [2] X Research source There's nothing wrong with not using the flag (or the emoji, by extension) if it doesn't feel like a good fit for your identity!"
