      "title": "It’s easier to stay motivated if you have specific goals.",
      "content": "It’s easier to stay motivated if you have specific goals. If you just want to “do better” in school, does that mean an A? Or a B? Are you just trying to pass? Sit down and set specific benchmarks for yourself. You might say you want to maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, or that you want to get at least an A- in history this year. [1] X Research source Use the SMART method to set concrete and meaningful goals for yourself."

      "content": "Have a strategy to get back on track if you space out or get distracted. Whether you're in class or sitting at your desk at home, you might find yourself nodding off or getting lost in a daydream because you're bored. A good way to bring your mind back into focus is to practice a mindfulness trick that “reactivates” your senses and brings you back into the moment. Bobbing your knee, performing deep breathing exercises, pinching yourself, or holding an ice cube are all great ways to wake your body back up. [2] X Research source Create a simple but distinct action that sends a clear message to yourself. It should be something you don't do regularly—wiggling your toes, for example."

      "content": "Prevent burnout by tackling things in smaller, manageable pieces. Don't get overwhelmed by a class presentation or a long paper. Remember that you don't have to finish a project in one sitting. [3] X Research source List all the different steps you must complete to finish the project. Make a schedule that forces you to finish one small piece of the project per day. For a paper, you might read and summarize one source on day one. Then, tackle another source on day two, a third source on day three, and synthesize their arguments on day four. Then, you can write your paper over the course of the next few days."

      "title": "Avoid cramming and focus on creating your own understanding.",
      "content": "Avoid cramming and focus on creating your own understanding. It’s easy to just sit in front of your book and read passively without really absorbing the information. Study in a way that makes the most sense to you. If you find it most efficient to focus on one subject at a time, do that. If bouncing between a few similar subjects helps you stay on task, that’s fine, too. [4] X Research source Review everything you learned at the end of each study session. This will help you commit the material to memory. It’s better to spend 10-15 minutes studying every night than to try and cram everything into one study session the night before the big test. Research has shown that cramming is one of the least efficient ways to prepare for a test, so avoid it at all costs. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Regular breaks will keep you from burning out. Studies have shown that taking a break to recharge when you feel like you’re running out of energy will help improve your productivity. It’s a lot easier to stay motivated if you know you’re going to get to relax eventually, and a little brain break can be life-changing when it comes to maintaining momentum during a study sesh. [6] X Research source You might try the Pomodoro technique if you want more structured breaks. Basically, you choose a task, set a timer for 25 minutes, and then work hard for the entirety of that block, then take a 5-minute break. After 4 blocks (so, 2 hours total), take a longer break—usually 30 minutes. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "If you don’t want to turn it off, at least put it in another room on silent.",
      "content": "If you don’t want to turn it off, at least put it in another room on silent. For most students these days, the phone is the single greatest distraction. Don’t tempt fate by keeping your phone on you when you’re studying or doing schoolwork. Shut the thing off or put it on silent and leave it in another room. [8] X Research source If you really struggle with not checking your phone, give it to a parent or roommate when you want to study and say something like, “Don’t give me my phone for at least 1 hour. I need to finish this paper.” The same goes for social media. If you find yourself popping over to Facebook or Instagram every 15 minutes when you’re reviewing lectures, set up a website blocker to ban those sites when you’re studying."

      "title": "Tie your goals to something you really want so you stay motivated.",
      "content": "Tie your goals to something you really want so you stay motivated. If you want to stay motivated in school, you need something to look forward to. Bargain with yourself: if you study for two hours, you can watch your favorite TV show at 8:00. If you get an A on your paper, you'll take the whole weekend off and just relax. [9] X Research source Remember that nobody can work all the time. Give yourself a little time off when you deserve it."

      "content": "Don’t struggle alone—enlist other students and help each other succeed. When you study with friends, it doesn't feel so painful! But you have to make sure you stay on task instead of joking around and having a good time. [10] X Research source Study groups should have no more than 3-5 members so they don't get unruly. Meet at least once a week on a regular schedule. You can meet at school during a free period, or after school at somebody's house. Volunteer to be the group leader/coordinator. You will determine what classes and projects the group will focus on in a given week so that everyone's working together and helping each other instead of randomly working on their projects."

      "title": "School won’t seem overwhelming if you track everything!",
      "content": "School won’t seem overwhelming if you track everything! Stay on top of all of your obligations and track important assignments and dates. Buy a daily planner to help keep track of the schedule you created in the previous step. Write down all your homework in this calendar, as well as due dates for long-term assignments and projects. [11] X Research source Set lots of reminders for yourself! Remember to write reminders about long-term projects in the days leading up to the due date, so you don’t forget about it until the last second. You can also use a calendar app on your cell phone to keep track of your obligations. However, there’s really strong evidence that physically writing things down helps you remember them, which is kind of the whole point with a planner. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "A specific area that’s exclusively for schoolwork will help you focus. If you’re working in a hectic area, then you might struggle to stay focused. Having a dedicated area for schoolwork will also make it easier to get into the flow of a productive headspace when you work. Make sure your study space is set up to help you enjoy your study time as well as you can. [13] X Research source Keep your desk neat and clean so you don’t get frustrated by how sloppy it is. Keep your tools (pencils, highlighters, staplers) neatly organized so you can find them easily. Make sure the space is well-lit. Dim lighting can give you a headache, which definitely won’t help you stay motivated. Figure out if you work best with silence or with a little background noise. Some people are distracted by noise, while others can’t work without a little music playing in the background."

By creating a regular schedule for after school and the weekends, you’ll bring up your grades, improve your self-confidence, and appreciate school more. [14] X Expert Source Sean Alexander, MS Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 14 May 2020. Set a patterned routine. Successful people often stick to regular routines to help them stay on task and achieve their goals. [15] X Research source There might be some variation throughout the week — for example, you might have a club or practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but not the other days. Make sure that every week, you know what to expect from each day."

      "content": "Having fun things to do at school will motivate you to stay engaged. This doesn’t mean that you should be talking through class or passing notes, but it does mean making school more enjoyable by embracing your classmates. Enjoy your classmates’ company and you might even find yourself looking forward to school. If your classmates aren’t fun enough for you, have a club, sport, or extracurricular you enjoy waiting for you. [16] X Research source Make good use of your downtime at school. Lunchtime and the time between classes is a great time to recharge your energy before your next class by having a good laugh with a friend. Join after-school clubs and teams to find people who share your interests."

      "content": "Identify the big thing you want in life and connect it to your work. Whether you’re passionate about science and want to become a biologist or your main goal is to just want to be wealthy enough to not have to go to school ever again, find the connection between what you want in life and the work you’re doing now. It’s a lot harder to stay motivated if you don’t see the relevance in what you’re doing. [17] X Research source Say you want to own your own business one day and you’re staring at some boring algebra homework thinking, “I’ll never need this…” Well, to own a business you need to be good at math. How else will you manage payrolls or inventories? You may not need algebra per se, but the skills you’re honing will 100% help sharpen your number skills in the future. Alternatively, say you want to be a doctor. Well, you need to get into a good medical school. To get into a good medical school, you need to do well in college. To do well in college, you need to master the skills you’re learning right now! It’s all connected at the end of the day."

Tell your friends, your parents, tell everyone you know that you plan on bringing your English grade up to a B by the end of the semester, or that you're going to ace the chemistry test. By telling other people about your goals, you’ll feel more accountable. [18] X Research source If you work your best and still fail to meet those goals, don't get discouraged. Redouble your efforts. With hard work and time, you'll meet your goals."

      "content": "Get plenty of sleep, eat a healthy diet, and exercise regularly. You cannot stay motivated if your body is not in good health. Get 8 hours of sleep—especially on school nights. Eat a diverse, healthy diet and get plenty of physical activity during the school year to ensure you’re in tip-top shape. If you can, take a fitness or exercise class to ensure you get some movement in during the school day."
