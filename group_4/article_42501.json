      "content": "Lay your coat out flat with the shoulder pads visible. Choose a flat surface, like the floor or a table, to work on. Spread out your jacket and open up the front so that you can see the area where the shoulder pads are. [1] X Research source You can turn your jacket all the way inside out, but you don’t have to."

    {
      "title": "Rip the seam open that contains the padding with a seam ripper.",
      "content": "Rip the seam open that contains the padding with a seam ripper. Feel around for the area that contains the actual “pad” of the shoulder pad. Use a seam ripper to cut off the thread that is holding the shoulder pad closed. Try to make the hole as small as you can to avoid unnecessary stitch work later on. [2] X Research source Try not to rip 2 seams that cross over each other, or it will create more work for you later on since you’ll have to sew a hole up in 2 directions."

      "title": "Pull the pads out until you can see how they are connected to the coat.",
      "content": "Pull the pads out until you can see how they are connected to the coat. Reach into the hole you created and grab the pad or stuffing inside. Pull it out of the hole until you can see how it has been sewn into your jacket. [3] X Research source Most shoulder pads are connected to the inside of the jacket with 2 to 3 strands of thread. However, some are sewn into the actual lining of the jacket."

      "title": "Cut the 2 to 3 threads that attach each pad to your jacket.",
      "content": "Cut the 2 to 3 threads that attach each pad to your jacket. Use scissors to carefully snip the threads that are holding the pads to your jacket without removing any of the thread in the lining. Use caution so you don’t poke a hole in your jacket or tear the lining further. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut around the edge of each pad if they are sewn into the actual lining.",
      "content": "Cut around the edge of each pad if they are sewn into the actual lining. If your shoulder pad is attached to the lining of your jacket with a long line of stitches, it’s best to leave the majority intact so you don’t rip a hole in your jacket. Use scissors to cut around the area that’s sewn into the jacket and remove the parts of the shoulder pad that aren’t sewn down. [5] X Research source This may leave some slight padding in the shoulders of your jacket, but it will remove the majority of the shoulder pads."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a thread color that matches the lining of your coat.",
      "content": "Choose a thread color that matches the lining of your coat. Even though the hole is on the inside of your jacket, try to find a thread color that will blend in easily. Take a look at the color of the thread in the rest of the lining to find a match. [6] X Research source Since you’ll be sewing on the inside of your jacket, the color doesn’t have to match perfectly. For example, if your lining is light brown, going with a dark brown thread color is fine."

      "title": "Thread your needle with 12 in (30 cm) of sewing thread.",
      "content": "Thread your needle with 12 in (30 cm) of sewing thread. Pull a 12 in (30 cm) length of thread through the eye of your needle and then tie the ends of the thread together. Make sure your knot is tight so the thread doesn’t come loose as you are sewing. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Press the lining together over the hole to close it.",
      "content": "Press the lining together over the hole to close it. Grab the 2 sides of the lining of your jacket and bring them together so they line up. If you need to, add a sewing pin to keep them in place. Otherwise, just hold the hole closed with your fingers as you sew. [8] X Research source Since the hole is pretty small, you probably won’t need to use a sewing pin."

      "title": "Stitch the seam back together with a whipstitch.",
      "content": "Stitch the seam back together with a whipstitch . Start at 1 end of the hole and poke your needle through both layers of lining. Bring your needle up and over the seam of the lining, then poke it through again right next to your original hole. Continue stitching this way until the entire hole is closed up. [9] X Research source A whipstitch will hold your lining together more securely than any other stitch."

      "title": "Tie off the thread and cut off the excess.",
      "content": "Tie off the thread and cut off the excess. Make sure the knot in your thread is secure so your stitches don’t unravel. Use sharp scissors to cut off any excess thread that’s left so it doesn’t tickle you when you put on your jacket. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Iron or steam your jacket to remove the boxy shape. Read the care instructions on the label of your jacket to make sure it’s safe to use heat on. Then, iron or steam the shoulders of your jacket so they lay flat and don’t stay in a boxy, padded shape. [11] X Research source Jackets without shoulder pads look much more modern and chic."
