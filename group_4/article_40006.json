[1] X Research source If you have bad eyesight, consider getting a prescription-adjusted mask to help you see underwater without your glasses or using contact lenses. Disposable ones are great for snorkelling in."

      "title": "Take slow, regular breaths in and out through the tube.",
      "content": "Take slow, regular breaths in and out through the tube. Breathe slowly, deeply and cautiously with your mouth through your snorkel. No need to panic: you can always lift your head above water if you want. Just relax and become aware of your breaths. The sound of your breathing through the snorkel barrel should become quite noticeable. Once you get into a rhythm, relax and enjoy the underwater scenery. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a buoyancy vest.",
      "content": "Wear a buoyancy vest. This makes floating on the surface of the water with minimal effort much easier. Many commercial snorkeling locations require a colorful life vest to be worn for safety reasons. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Breathe cautiously.",
      "content": "Breathe cautiously. On any snorkeling adventure you are bound to get some water in your tube at some point, sometimes either due to surf conditions or excessive splashing, or by letting your head dip too low in the water. Learning to clear your snorkel will keep this from being a cumbersome disruption to your experience."

      "title": "Hold your breath and place your head below the water, submerging the end of the snorkel.",

      "title": "Master airway control.",
      "content": "Master airway control. Sometimes you will get water in your tube when you have no air in your lungs. If there is only a little water, inhale slowly and carefully without letting water into your mouth until you have enough air for a full blast. If there is too much, you will need to lift your head out of the water and take a breath around the mouthpiece."

Take a deep breath and swim down. When you need a breath, surface, keeping your face underwater, and clear your flooded snorkel tube like you practiced."

      "content": "Pick the right spot. You want to snorkel in an area that has relatively calm waters and a vibrant mix of benign marine life. Shallow waters above coral reefs are great, as are some deeper spots best accessed by boat. Ask locals or check guidebooks to find the best spots that aren't too full of other swimmers.

      "content": "Go out on a sunny day. Even with a mask it's hard to see much underwater if the sky is dark and gloomy. Snorkel in the middle of a bright day when the water is clear of silt. Storms tend to churn up silt that clouds the water, so if it rained last night you may want to put your adventure off by a day."

      "content": "Learn to recognize different fish and coral. Seen one fish, seen them all? Not if you know what you are looking at. Memorize the shapes and colors of different kinds of fish that inhabit your local beaches and you can turn your simple swim into an aquatic zoological survey. If you see a fish you don't recognize, try to remember its patterns and look it up later. [9] X Research source"
