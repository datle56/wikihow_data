      "content": "Isolate the variable and radical on one side of the equation. This is just like solving for any other algebraic equation. Combine like terms and add/subtract numbers so that your variable and radical stand alone. If it helps, treat the x {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}} like a normal \"x\" in any other problem, and solve for that. For example, with the problem x + 3 = 10 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}+3=10} : Isolate x {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}} : x + 3 = 10 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}+3=10} Subtract 3 from both sides: x + 3 − 3 = 10 − 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}+3-3=10-3} Simplify both sides: x = 7 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}=7} [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Square both sides of the equation to remove the radical. All you have to do to undo a radical is square it. Because you need the equation to stay balanced, you square both sides, just like you added or subtracted from both sides earlier. So, for the example: Isolate x {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}} : x = 7 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}=7} Square both sides: ( x ) 2 = ( 7 ) 2 {\\displaystyle ({\\sqrt {x}})^{2}=(7)^{2}} Final answer: x = 49 {\\displaystyle x=49}"

You must always check your solutions to make sure you have all real answers. To check an answer, simply plug in each answer for \"x\" in the original equation: Original Equation: x + 3 = 10 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}+3=10} Substitute 49 for x: 49 + 3 = 10 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {49}}+3=10} Solve: 7 + 3 = 10 {\\displaystyle 7+3=10} Our solution is valid: 10 = 10 {\\displaystyle 10=10} [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the same technique for more complicated roots, not just squares. This same strategy works no matter what the root, like x 3 − 1 = 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{x}}-1=3} . You just need to raise both sides to the same power as the root. So, for this example: Isolate x 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{x}}} : x 3 − 1 = 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{x}}-1=3} Add 1 to both sides: x 3 − 1 + 1 = 3 + 1 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{x}}-1+1=3+1} Simplify both sides: x 3 = 4 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{x}}=4} Cube both sides: ( x 3 ) 3 = ( 4 ) 3 {\\displaystyle ({\\sqrt[{3}]{x}})^{3}=(4)^{3}} Final Answer: 64 Check Solution: 64 3 − 1 = 4 − 1 = 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{3}]{64}}-1=4-1=3} [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Remember to square both sides of the equation, not just the terms.",
      "content": "Remember to square both sides of the equation, not just the terms. When removing the radical, you square both sides of the equation. If you have multiple terms, such as the equation x = 2 x + 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}=2x+3} , you must square the entire side, not the individual terms ( 2 x 2 {\\displaystyle 2x^{2}} and 3 2 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}} are both incorrect ). Before solving for x in the example, then: Original Equation: x = 2 x + 3 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}}=2x+3} Square both sides: ( x ) 2 = ( 2 x + 3 ) 2 {\\displaystyle ({\\sqrt {x}})^{2}=(2x+3)^{2}} Expand Expressions: x = 4 x 2 + 12 x + 9 {\\displaystyle x=4x^{2}+12x+9} The expression above was expanded through Polynomial Multiplication.

The basics of solving radical equations are still the same. You want to get the variables by themselves, remove the radicals one at a time, solve the leftover equation, and check all known solutions. For this example, solve the radical equation 2 x − 5 − x − 1 = 1 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2x-5}}-{\\sqrt {x-1}}=1} [5] X Research source You frequently end up with quadratic equations when working with radicals. Review how to solve them if you are unsure."

Theoretically, you could keep doing this no matter how many radicals you have, though you can see how complicated things would quickly get.

In this example, x 2 − 10 x + 25 = 4 x − 4 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-10x+25=4x-4} , you'll need to use the quadratic equation. You could also graph both sides of the equation and see where they meet.
