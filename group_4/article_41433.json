      "content": "Differentiate urine marking from a litter box problem. Sometimes, cats spray areas around the house to mark their territory. This is a habit known as urine marking. This is different than a litter box problem, and if your cat is urine marking it needs to be dealt with in different ways. Cats tend to urine mark on vertical surfaces. While litter box problems can be detected by large amounts of urine deposited at random places throughout the house, urine marking is generally present on vertical surfaces like walls, shelves, and sofas. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Urine marking does not leave a large amount of urine. The primary purpose of urine marking is to leave a scent to mark territory. When your cat urine marks, the amount will be significantly less than you would normally scoop out of a litter box. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Urine marks contain certain chemicals used to communicate with other cats. These chemicals make the urine smell pungent.

Consider any recent changes in your home when trying to find the cause of a litter box issue. Do you clean the litter box every day? If you have not cleaned the litter box for a number of days, your cat might prefer to urinate elsewhere. Cats are neat animals and dislike using an unclean litter box. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source How many cats do you have?

Is the box too small? Size and location play a big factor in your cat's litter box use and if he's having trouble reaching or fitting in the box he may urinate elsewhere.

Try and keep an eye on the litter box area and see if you notice any unusual behavior. How old is your cat? A geriatric cat might physically have trouble getting in and out of the litter box, especially if you have a covered litter box with a door. If you notice an older cat struggling to get in and out, this might be the cause of the urinating. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Your cat may have an aversion to his litter box due to a negative experience. If your cat was scared or intimidated while using the box, he may get in the box and leave very quickly or approach the litter box area but hesitate to enter. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Painful urination is another reason for urinating outside the box. Your cat may have developed a fear of his litter box because he associates it with pain. If you notice your cat straining or crying during urination, he may be experiencing pain.

Scolding is not only ineffective, but it may actually make the problem worse. Never rub a cat's nose in urine or feces. This is an outdated training tactic that can alienate a pet from its owner, causing household tensions. If you find urine or feces, simply clean it up. Do not use an ammonium-based cleaner, however.

Your cat will become frightened if they are yelled at or otherwise spoken to harshly. You do not want to create a situation where your cat is afraid of you.
