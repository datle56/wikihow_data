      "content": "It could be, but there’s no proof one way or another. Oil of oregano does have the ability to inhibit certain viruses, fungi, and bacteria in isolated environments, so it’s plausible that it might help with a respiratory infection. [2] X Research source However, there have been no studies involving people inhaling oil of oregano for respiratory issues, so there’s no way to know if it really works, and if it does, how efficient it is. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Thyme, dictamnus, and marjoram are all in the same category as oregano, and they all have similar abilities to combat pathogens as oregano. Again, it’s unclear how effective they are in people, though. [4] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source There are a lot of variables when it comes to fighting diseases. Just because a compound or chemical works outside of the body doesn’t mean that it will work once it’s absorbed by your lungs."

      "content": "In a petri dish, yes; it’s unclear if it does in the human body, though. All of the studies on the antibacterial and antiviral impact of oil of oregano has been done in mice, chickens, or petri dishes. [5] X Research source While there may be something to oil of oregano as a potential medication or treatment option in the future, there’s just no evidence it will has these same properties once it’s ingested or inhaled by people. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Oregano is even proven to inhibit cancer cells when they’re isolated in special environments. This doesn’t mean that oil of oregano will cure cancer, though. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s perfectly safe to smell oil of oregano unless you’re pregnant. While it’s unclear why, oregano is embryotoxic, meaning that it may cause harm to your child if you’re pregnant. As a result, it’s best not to inhale oil of oregano if you’re getting ready to welcome a new child into the world. [8] X Research source It’s okay if you want a dash of oregano on a slice of pizza, but don’t consume large amounts of it, make oregano tea, or use oil of oregano as a topical treatment. [9] X Research source If you aren’t pregnant, there shouldn’t be any unique risks if you want to use oil of oregano for aromatherapy."

      "content": "There’s the old-fashioned way of just sniffing the bottle. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with just opening the bottle of your essential oil and taking a deep breath. This probably the easiest way to inhale the oil of oregano, and you can always bring the bottle with you on the go. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hold the bottle roughly 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) away from your nose the first time you do this, just in case the smell is too strong for you. If inhaling the bottle directly is too much, just pour a few drops into a cotton ball and hold that up to your nose."

      "content": "You can also put it in a diffuser with water if you prefer. If you want your home to smell like oregano, use a diffuser. There are all kinds of diffusers out there, but you typically just fill a device with water up to the fill line inside of the device. Then, you pour a few drops of oil of oregano into the water and turn it on. The diffuser will let a steady stream of oregano droplets into the air!

If you’re on blood thinners or you’re dealing with a bleeding condition (like hemophilia or von Willebrand disease), do not consume any oregano-based supplements.

Lean forward a bit, breathe in through your nose, and fold your arms over your stomach. Intentionally cough from your diaphragm in short, quick bursts. You can even push on your stomach a bit with your forearms to clear your airways out. If possible, do this over the tub or outside. You may cough a bunch of mucus out!"

Lie down on your back so that your chest is lower than your hips by propping your hips up with a pillow. Put one hand on your belly and the other on chest. Push your belly out as far as you can and keep your chest still. Breathe in and out slowly. Do it for 5-10 minutes, then do the same thing on each side. Finish by doing this face-down. [14] X Research source When you’re done, if you feel like you’ve got something in your throat, cough it out. This process may lead some mucus back up to your throat, but you’ll feel much better when you’re done!"

If you really want to improve the health of your lungs, try eating antioxidant-rich foods, getting regular exercise, and cleaning your home regularly to remove dust and pollutants. Quitting smoking will make the biggest impact if you happen to be a tobacco user. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source Using an air purifier and changing your furnace’s air filter regularly will also improve the quality of air in your home. Antioxidant-rich foods include berries, pomegranates, sweet potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. Nuts and red wine are also fairly high in antioxidants as well.

While it may just feel like a little cold to you, it could be something more serious, like pneumonia. [18] X Research source A doctor may be able to prescribe you antibiotics to combat the infection. Don’t take these before seeing a doctor, though. If you have a cold or the flu, antibiotics won’t help with that. [19] X Research source"
