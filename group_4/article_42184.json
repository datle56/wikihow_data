Sometimes after sweeping a pile of debris into your dustpan, you’ll notice a thin line of dust left behind at the front edge.

[12] X Research source This method is especially useful if the dustpan you’re using has a lip that’s too thick to let dust and smaller pieces of debris pass over easily. Alternatively, you can simply vacuum or wipe up dust lines that you’re having difficulty corralling with your broom.

Unless you’re sweeping an outdoor area, you’ll also need a dustpan. These days, most brooms come packaged with dustpans for the sake of convenience, but you can pick one up for just a few dollars if you don’t have one already. [18] X Research source"
