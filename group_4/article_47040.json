      "content": "A valid email contains @ . A fake email address might look like this: john.smithconstruction.com , which doesn't include the @ (at) symbol.

High bounce rates, or getting undelivered emails sent back to you, have a negative impact on your email deliverability. As you get more and more emails bounced back to you, your chances of sending out emails to valid email addresses is less and less. Getting your email back can take seconds or minutes. However, if the email address is valid but un-monitored, you may never get a response. If you don't want to use your personal email to send a test message when you're trying to figure out of an email address is valid, you can create a new email quickly and easily."

Look at the email and enter the domain name into the domain name checker. The domain name is everything after the @ and before the .com . Domains that are newer can be used for spam, so the email address you have can be valid, but still spammy."
