      "content": "Wear the ring to display your heritage . Many Irish people wear Claddagh rings as a symbol of their Irish heritage, rather than as a way to display their romantic status. Claddagh rings may be worn on any finger and may be turned in either direction, whichever is most comfortable for the person wearing the ring. They don't have to be worn to indicate a romantic status, and can be worn on the left ring finger without a relationship or engagement or a marriage. Some people wear Claddagh rings on necklace chains, rather than on their fingers. Claddagh rings may also be worn on bracelets, or kept in the pocket as a charm. Make sure you wear the correct ring size to prevent your ring from spinning. You can determine your ring size using a ring sizer, or by measuring your finger with measuring tape."

If you received a Claddagh ring as a gift and would prefer not to wear it to show your romantic status, it's just fine to wear it however you choose. There are many different types of Claddagh rings, such as ones with birthstones, diamonds, gold, silver, or even platinum. Although they all mean the same thing, different styles may make the ring more personal."
