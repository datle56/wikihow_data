      "title": "Print out or make a copy of the drawing you want to transfer.",
      "content": "Print out or make a copy of the drawing you want to transfer. You will be covering the back of the drawing in charcoal to transfer it to the canvas. Copy it so you don’t have to do this to the original copy of the drawing. Print it out or copy it with a scanner onto a new sheet of paper. [1] X Research source You can also change the size of the drawing when you do this if you want it to fit on a smaller or larger canvas. Use the scale feature when printing to have the computer automatically resize it to fit the paper size you’re printing on. If you don’t have access to a printer, pull up a scan of your drawing or image on your computer’s screen, sized as you want it to transfer. Trace it by placing tracing paper, or thin regular paper, over the screen and using a pencil. This works best in a dark room."

      "title": "Cover the back of the paper in charcoal wherever there are lines.",
      "content": "Cover the back of the paper in charcoal wherever there are lines. Place the copy of the drawing face down (AKA, drawing-side down) on a hard, flat work surface. Use a soft charcoal stick to rub over the back of the paper where the drawing’s lines are. Use side-to-side motions with the side of the charcoal stick to cover more area at once. [2] X Research source You don’t have to cover the paper completely, just where the drawing is on the other side, says Medford. [3] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 26 March 2021. If there are any large spaces without lines on the drawing, hold the copy up to a window and mark those areas with a pencil before you start coloring the paper with charcoal. This way, you can more easily avoid those spots to save time and charcoal. If you don't have a lot of charcoal, just retrace over the lines of the main shapes instead of shading the page entirely. Shake off any loose charcoal dust onto a piece of paper and toss it afterward. You could also pour the dust straight into a trash bin if there’s one nearby. Just be careful not to spill any charcoal on a carpet or anywhere that it might stain."

      "title": "Tape the drawing to the canvas, charcoal-side down, with masking tape.",
      "content": "Tape the drawing to the canvas, charcoal-side down, with masking tape . Position the copy of the drawing where you want it on the canvas , with the art facing you and the charcoal touching the canvas, says Medford. [4] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 26 March 2021. Place a square of masking tape in each corner and several squares along the edges to hold the paper in place. [5] X Research source The number of pieces of tape you need will depend on the size of the drawing. Placing one every 1 in (2.5 cm) or so will do the trick."

      "title": "Trace over the lines of the drawing with a ballpoint pen.",
      "content": "Trace over the lines of the drawing with a ballpoint pen. Apply firm pressure as you go over the lines. This will transfer the charcoal to the canvas, recreating the lines of the drawing so it will be ready for you to paint, Medford explains. [6] X Expert Source Kelly Medford Professional Artist Expert Interview. 10 March 2021 Try to keep your hand off the drawing as you go over the lines as much as possible so you don’t rub any excess charcoal onto the canvas."

      "title": "Untape the drawing everywhere except for along the top and look under it.",
      "content": "Untape the drawing everywhere except for along the top and look under it. Remove the tape carefully from the bottom corners, bottom edge, and sides. Gently lift up the paper by the bottom edge and peek under it to see if the drawing transferred all the way. [7] X Research source If you see any spots that didn’t transfer well or spots that you missed, re-tape the drawing and go over the lines with the ballpoint pen again."

      "title": "Remove the drawing when you are happy with the transfer.",
      "content": "Remove the drawing when you are happy with the transfer. Untape the top corners and edge when all the traced charcoal lines are on the canvas. Discard the charcoal-covered copy of the drawing. [8] X Research source The transferred lines will be very delicate at this point, so be careful not to rub them with anything or you’ll smudge the charcoal."

      "title": "Fix the lines by tracing over them with an India ink pen.",
      "content": "Fix the lines by tracing over them with an India ink pen. Use a fine-tipped India ink pen to trace over the transferred lines. This will fix and secure the outlines of your drawing so the canvas will be ready for paint. India ink is a black ink commonly used for drawing and outlining, especially for comics. You can get an India ink pen at an art supply store."

Load an image that you want to transfer according to the type of projector you have available. [9] X Research source The advantage of using a digital projector is you aren’t just limited to transferring your drawings to canvas. You can find any kind of digital image to use as a reference, such as a photo, and trace the outline onto the canvas to fill in with paint."

Place it about 5–10 ft (1.5–3.0 m) in front of the projector, depending how much space you have and how big you want the image to be. [10] X Research source You can adjust the distance between the canvas and the projector after you project the image to position it just right on the canvas."

Turn on the projector to start projecting the image on the canvas. [11] X Research source Adjust the distance between the canvas and the projector if the image is really big or really small on the canvas. You can also make minor adjustments later using the projector’s zoom feature to get the size perfect. [12] X Research source"

Leave it when the lines are clear and sharp enough for you to trace. Make any final adjustments to the size of the image after it is in focus using the zoom feature on the projector."

      "content": "Use a ballpoint pen to trace your drawing. Press down firmly as you trace to ensure the lines transfer from the transfer paper onto the canvas. If you’re tracing a drawing, follow every line. If you’re tracing a detailed image, focus on the main outlines or silhouettes. You’ll be able to paint in the details after transferring. [17] X Research source Use a pen with visibly different ink from your drawing (either darker or a different color) so you can tell what you’ve already traced as you go."

Before you remove the top strips of tape from the transfer paper, lift it up and peek to see if the transfer was successful. If not, re-tape and re-trace with more pressure until your transfer to canvas is complete."
