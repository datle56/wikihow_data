      "content": "Vacuum your chair to remove dirt and debris. Place an upholstery attachment on your vacuum cleaner. Then, use it to vacuum up dirt, hair, crumbs, and other debris on the front and back of the cushion. [1] X Research source Pay special attention to any crevices and folds to remove as much dirt as possible. Just use a thin nozzle vacuum attachment to get into the nooks and crannies. If you have a cover on your cushion, remove it before vacuuming the cushion. Then, wash the cover according to the instructions on its care tag. Ask a friend to help you clean your papasan cushion. The cushion can be heavy and hard to manage when it’s wet, so having someone help you can make the job easier. Note : Check the care tag on the cushion before washing it. If the tag says not to hand wash it or get it wet, take it to a dry cleaner to get it cleaned."

      "title": "Soak the cushion in your bathtub for 10 to 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak the cushion in your bathtub for 10 to 15 minutes. Fill your bathtub about ⅓ or ½ full with lukewarm water. Then, insert the cushion and push it down in the water so it’s fully submerged. Just let it soak for 10 to 15 minutes. If you don’t have a bathtub, soak the cushion in a large container or a kiddie pool. Soaking the cushion in water releases dirt and grime. As your cushion soaks, the water might turn brown or gray."

      "content": "Agitate the cushion for 5 minutes and then drain the dirty water. Step on the cushion with your feet or press down on it with your hands. This moves the water in and out of the cushion to help remove more dirt and grime. After a few minutes of agitating the cushion, drain the tub to remove all of the dirty water. Flip the cushion once or twice as you agitate it so both sides are cleaned."

Then, pour in 1 to 2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) of a mild laundry detergent. Swirl around the water with your hands to help mix the water and detergent. [2] X Research source Adding laundry detergent to the water helps lift more dirt, grime, and odors than just plain water. Pour a few drops of detergent directly onto any dirty or stained spots on the cushion. Then, rub the detergent into the cushion with your hands or a cloth."

      "title": "Leave the cushion to air dry in front of a fan.",
      "content": "Leave the cushion to air dry in front of a fan. Take the cushion out of the tub and prop it up to allow air to flow over it on all sides. For instance, drape it over your porch railing, place it on a clothes drying rack, or hang it over the backs of a few chairs. Then, set 1 to 2 fans in front of the cushion to help it dry faster. [6] X Research source Dry your cushion indoors or outdoors in a well-ventilated area. If you’re drying it outside, keep it out of direct light so it doesn’t fade. Flip the cushion over several times to ensure both sides dry completely. It can take several hours to days for your papasan chair cushion to dry. Do not use the cushion until it’s completely dry, as a wet cushion can encourage mold and bacteria to grow. Alternatively, dry the cushion on top of several towels. Just replace the towels whenever they get wet from absorbing water. To test if the cushion is still wet, place a few paper towels over the chair and then step on them. If the paper towels get wet, then the cushion still needs to dry."

      "title": "Go over the papasan chair cushion with a steam cleaner.",
      "content": "Go over the papasan chair cushion with a steam cleaner . To steam clean upholstery , cleaning specialist Elias Weston says to put a small fabric attachment on the steamer. Then, he recommends you “prepare the steam cleaner according to the model’s instructions” by “pouring water and soap into the machine.” Simply drag the fabric attachment over the cushion using quick, overlapping strokes to ensure you clean the entire surface. Vacuum and precondition the cushion with a soil emulsifier before steaming it. The pre-conditioner helps the steamer lift off more dirt and grime. [7] X Research source Let the cushion air dry in a well-ventilated spot outdoors or inside. Drape it over a railing or drying rack and set a fan in front of it to help it dry faster. Weston says steam cleaning “not only removes dirt and stains, but it also sterilizes surfaces and eliminates germs, allergens, mites, and bed bugs.” Note : Read the care tag on the cushion to ensure it’s safe to steam clean or get wet. If it isn’t, get it professionally dry-cleaned."

      "content": "Machine wash the cushion in a large-capacity washer. If you don’t want to hand wash or steam the cushion, clean it in a washing machine with a large drum. Simply choose a delicate washing cycle using cool or lukewarm water and add a small amount of mild laundry detergent . [8] X Research source Most laundromats have large-capacity washing machines if you don’t have one at home. Either air dry the cushion or place it in a large-capacity dryer to dry on low heat. Note : Check the care label on the cushion to see if it’s safe to machine wash or get wet. If it isn’t, take it to a dry cleaner."

      "title": "Treat stains with baking soda, dish soap, and water.",
      "content": "Treat stains with baking soda, dish soap, and water. To remove tough, dried-on stains, Weston recommends blotting the spot with cold water. Then, make a paste by mixing “½ cup [136 g] of baking soda with ¼ cup [59 ml] of liquid dish soap and 4 cups [1 L] of water.” Dip a clean cloth into the mixture and soak the stain. Simply “take another clean, dry cloth and blot the area to lift the stain from the upholstery.” Weston says to “alternate between saturating the area with the baking soda solution and blotting with the clean cloth until the stain is gone.” Alternatively, use a commercial upholstery stain remover to treat the stain. Note : Test the mixture (and any other cleaners) on a hidden part of the cushion to ensure it doesn’t stain or damage the material before applying it all over."
