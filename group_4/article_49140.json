      "title": "Cut a long strand of ribbon.",
      "content": "Cut a long strand of ribbon. Estimate the amount of ribbon you'll need based on how long of a bow you want and the size of the mug. Wrap the ribbon around the circumference of the mug's mouth. Cut at least that much ribbon or more depending on whether you want a large or small bow. To prevent fraying, cut the ribbon at an angle. The specific angling doesn't matter so long as it is not straight across."

      "title": "Lay out 2-3 layers of tissue paper.",
      "content": "Lay out 2-3 layers of tissue paper. Place your mug squarely in the center in an upright position. Choose tissue paper that is long enough to wrap over the entire length of the mug. Any shorter, and you will not be able to fully close your wrapping job. [1] X Research source Layer with multiple colors of tissue paper for added decoration."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the tissue paper up and over the mug.",
      "content": "Pull the tissue paper up and over the mug. Bring all 4 corners of the tissue paper up and over the length of the mug. Bunch up the ends and grab them in the middle. Continue holding the middle as you complete the finishing steps so it does not come undone. [2] X Research source Alternatively, you may place a rubber band around the middle to keep the hold from coming apart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap a layer of cellophane over the tissue paper.",
      "content": "Wrap a layer of cellophane over the tissue paper. Cellophane will add a decorative sheen to your gift wrap while adding more protection for your mug. Place the mug over a square of cellophane as large as the tissue squares and wrap it around your mug just as you did with the tissues. [3] X Research source Choose a cellophane square tinted in a color of your choice for decorative purposes. Tissue paper is thin and can rip without the cellophane."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie the ribbon around the top of the mug.",
      "content": "Tie the ribbon around the top of the mug. Wrap the ribbon around the middle of the tissue and cellophane ends. Tie it in a bow or in a double knot, depending on which you prefer. Curl the ends of your ribbons to finish your tying job with flair. If you used a rubber band earlier to keep your bunching secure, leave it on to prevent the tie from coming undone. Make a gift tag and cut it at the end with a hole punch. Weave the gift tag onto the ribbon before you tie it on the package if you need to differentiate it from other gifts."

      "title": "Lay out a square of packing paper.",
      "content": "Lay out a square of packing paper. Find a flat space to wrap your mug to make sure the wrapping job is even. Cut out a length of packing paper that is both longer and wider than your mug. [4] X Research source Packing paper is usually available at most department or shipping stores. As an alternative, you may use old newspapers in a pinch. The longer the length, the thicker the protection your mug will have."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the mug in one corner of the packing paper.",
      "content": "Place the mug in one corner of the packing paper. Turn the mug over horizontally and roll it in the packing paper lengthwise. Continue rolling until you have reached the end of the packing paper. [5] X Research source If your mug feels loose in the center of the paper roll, unroll it and try again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tuck the packing paper's sides in.",
      "content": "Tuck the packing paper's sides in. Fold the bottom end of the packing paper up and around the length of the cup. Stuff the other end of the packing paper inside the mug's mouth. If either end is too long to fold or stuff, trim it with a pair of scissors. Double tuck and wrap the mug in packing paper if it is especially valuable or fragile. For additional security, bind the sides down with packing tape."

    {
      "title": "Pack your mugs carefully inside a box.",
      "content": "Pack your mugs carefully inside a box. Only place wrapped cups and mugs in the box to prevent any of them breaking as you move or store them. Opt for a plastic box instead of cardboard to give your mugs external protection. [6] X Research source Add bubble wrap and crumpled newspaper balls to the bottom of the box for additional cushioning. Label the box contents as fragile so you know to treat it with care."
