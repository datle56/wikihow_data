      "content": "Let go of the temptation to try to keep things a secret. If you're serious about being with this person, eventually it's going to come out. If you've been lying about being together, it's going to cause a lot more drama and upset when that happens. Ultimately, that could make it a lot harder to smooth things over between your partner and your parents. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Being secretive about your relationship could also make your partner feel like you're ashamed of them, which could cause problems between the two of you."

      "content": "Ask them to explain what it is they don't like. It's best to have this conversation without your partner around, so find a time where it's just you and your parents. Then, ask them to give you a few examples of why they don't like your partner.

You might be surprised at some of the insight they have to offer. Even if you don't agree with what they're saying, listen without interrupting. Your parents will be more likely to hear what you have to say if you let them express what they're feeling."

      "content": "Try to keep your composure, no matter what they say. It can be really hard to listen to your parents if they say something you disagree with, especially if they're sharing old-fashioned biases that affect you directly. However, attacking them isn't likely to help them come around. Instead, reassure them that you still love them, but that you believe differently than they do. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Give specific examples of why they're a good match for you.",
      "content": "Give specific examples of why they're a good match for you. In some cases, your parents might disapprove of your partner because they just haven't had a chance to get to know them very well. Tell them how your partner makes you feel. It's helpful to include a few examples of why you think you're a good fit for each other, or you could tell them about some times you felt especially cared for. This might help your parents feel more at ease about the relationship. [5] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For example, you might tell the story of a time your partner cheered you up when you were down, talk about a cute date you went on, or share some values the two of you have in common. Try to keep your tone upbeat and positive, even if you feel upset about some of the things they said. If you're coming across as defensive or angry, they might not be able to really appreciate the good things about your partner. During this part of the conversation, let your parents know you're happy to answer any questions they have about your partner, as well. Don't be afraid to draw the line if you don't want to share personal details about your relationship, though!"

      "content": "Ask your parents what your partner can do to earn their trust. Encourage your parents to share whether there's anything your partner could do to change how they feel. Chances are, they'll say that they just want to know that you'll be happy. If that's the case, assure them that your partner truly loves you, and let them know you'll be honest with them about how your relationship is going. [6] X Research source If your parents share something specific your partner might do, like coming with you to more family functions, talk to your partner about it later and ask if it's something they'd be willing to do. Just be sure it's reasonable—it's not fair for your parents to ask your partner to do anything drastic, like convert their faith or change careers."

      "content": "Think back on their reasoning after the conversation has ended. When you're in love, it can sometimes be hard to see the faults in the person you care about. Give some real thought to whether your parents are picking up on some negative traits in your partner that you haven't noticed yet. [7] X Expert Source Elvina Lui, MFT Marriage & Family Therapist Expert Interview. 15 March 2019. [8] X Research source If the issues that your parents bring up are mostly about how you're treated—like they feel that your partner puts you down, ignores your opinion, or tries to control you—it's worth giving some serious thought to whether they might be right. If your parents' issues are mostly rooted in bias, like they disapprove of interracial, multi-faith, or same-sex relationships in general, they may never approve of who you date. In that case, just focus on choosing the person who's right for you."

      "content": "Be clear about what is and isn't acceptable. Talk to your partner about whether there's anything your parents do that really bothers them. Ask your parents the same thing about your partner. Then, have a series of conversations where you ask everyone to agree to certain ground rules so you can all get along when you're together. [9] X Research source For instance, you might ask your parents to speak respectfully about your partner, whether they're around or not. You might also ask your partner not to bring up touchy subjects that will upset your parents, like politics or religion. If someone starts to cross one of the boundaries you've all agreed to, take a break to clear the air. For instance, you might ask your partner to join you in another room or go outside for a walk."

However, it's not fair to you to constantly have to calm down disagreements. Instead, focus on helping everyone compromise with each other—or at least agree to disagree.

In the case of parents whose children have recently come out, for instance, it sometimes takes years for them to come to terms with the idea. However, many parents do eventually adjust, so try to be patient. [12] X Research source If you need to, it's okay to take some space until your parents are more accepting of your partner."

If you're able to be around your parents just fine as long as your partner isn't there, it might be worth skipping the family gatherings to keep the peace. Talk to your partner about what a fair amount of time is for you to see your family—try to arrange it for times your partner is doing something else, if possible, so they aren't just sitting at home alone.

Remember, it's not fair for your partner to ask that you never see your family—the decision of whether to have a relationship with them should be solely up to you."
