The shirt will need to dry, but once you heat-set it by tossing it into the drier, it will be ready to be worn. This method is similar to the traditional tie-dying method, but it does not require hot water or as much preparation as the traditional method."

Although this method uses acrylic paints, which are more opaque than fabric dye, you will get the best results with a white or light-colored shirt. The paint will be watered down, so some of the shirt's original color will show through. You can tie-dye almost anything, from T-shirts to pants and skirts to even baseball caps."

Pour everything into a plastic applicator bottle and shake it up to mix everything together. The fabric textile medium will prevent the paint from becoming too stiff once it has dried. [1] X Research source Use a different applicator bottle for each color. The colors will bleed together, so avoid using contrasting colors such as red and green, blue and orange, and yellow and purple, or you will get some muddy browns in your finished piece!

      "content": "Tie rubber bands around the shirt. You can create different patterns depending on how you wrap the rubber bands around your shirt. Here are a few popular designs: Stripes are the easiest and simplest design. Simply fold your shirt up like a fan or accordion creating a sort of rope. You can do width-wise, length-wise, or even diagonally. Wrap a rubber band around one end of your \"rope,\" then wrap another rubber band two to three inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) down. Keep doing this until you reach the end of your rope. The sunburst is a circular design, with each ray or ring being a different color. Pinch the middle of your shirt and pull it towards you. Tie the end off with a rubber band. Go a little further down your shirt and tie it off with another rubber band. Keep doing this until you have a thick \"rope\" made out of fabric and rubber bands. The spiral is another popular design. Place your shirt down on a flat surface. Pinch the middle of your shirt and twist it. Keep twisting until you have created a spiral, or something like looks like a cinnamon roll. Wrap a large rubber band around the \"bun\" you have made. Then wrap another rubber band, but this time in the opposite direction, making a cross shape. You can wrap more rubber bands around your bun, sectioning it like a pizza or cake."

[9] X Research source You are creating a sort of mini fabric-and-cup drum. You can also use an embroidery hoop instead of a plastic cup and a rubber band.

You can make the dots as big or as small as you want, but they should not be touching. Be sure to work inside your cup. Here are some design ideas: You can create fireworks by making two circles, one inside the other. Use a different color for each circle.

You can also fill an applicator bottle with rubbing alcohol and drizzle the alcohol over the design. This will give you less control, but it is much faster and you won't have to refill as often.

This means that if you try to tie-dye a yellow shirt blue, you will get green instead. Clothes made from cotton, linen, rayon, and wool work the best.

Here are some tips: Wear old clothes that you do not mind getting stained or dirty. Dark-colored clothes will hide dye stains better than light-colored clothes. If you do not have any old clothes to spare, then wear shorts, a sleeveless top, and an apron. Consider wearing some plastic gloves, such as the type you might use to wash dishes or dye your hair.

Most dyes will need to be diluted with hot water, and how much water will usually depend on the brand. In general, ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of liquid dye requires 2 to 3 gallons (7.57 to 11.35 liters) of hot water.

Once you have added the salt or vinegar, give your dye bath another stir to make sure everything is combined. Here is how you can use salt and vinegar in your dye bath: If your clothing is made out of cotton, linen, rayon, or ramie, add 1 cup (280 grams) salt for every 3 gallons (11.35 liters) of water.
