      "content": "Set up a baby gate. Cats can easily leap over a baby gate, but most dogs can’t. Use a baby gate to allow your cat to separate itself from your dog. If the dog is bothering the cat, then the cat can leap over the gate and ignore the dog rather than scratching or hissing at the dog to get it to go away. [2] X Research source You can also find baby gates with small holes in the bottom that would allow your cat to crawl through, but don’t choose this option if your dog is small enough to follow."
