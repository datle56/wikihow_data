[3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Identify the eye you are instructed to place the drops in, and know how many drops you are to instill with each administration. (Usually it will be just one drop as the eye holds less volume than one typical drop.) Check the clock to be sure it is time for the next use, or make note of the current time so you will know the next time you are to use the eye drops."

      "title": "Inspect the eye drops.",
      "content": "Inspect the eye drops. Look at the liquid inside the container closely. Be sure you do not see anything floating in the solution (unless there are supposed to be particles in the drops). Be sure the product says “ophthalmic” somewhere on the label. It is easy to confuse ear drops, that say “otic” on the label, with those that are to be administered in the eye. Inspect the container to be sure it has not been damaged. Check the tip of the container, without touching it, to be sure there is no visible damage or discoloration."

      "title": "Check the expiration date of the container.",
      "content": "Check the expiration date of the container. Do not use eye drops that have expired. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Eye drops contain preservatives to help keep the solution free of unwanted bacteria. However once the expiration date is passed, there is a risk that the product has been contaminated. Some eye drops are to be used for no more than 30 days once the container has been opened. Be sure to ask your doctor or pharmacist how long your product can be used once it has been opened."

      "title": "Clean your eye area.",
      "content": "Clean your eye area. Use a clean cloth to gently wipe away any dirt or sweat from your eye area. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If available, use sterile dressing material, such as sealed 2 x 2 pads, to wipe around your eye area. Use each pad or wipe only once, then discard. Water applied to the cloth or pad may help in removing any crusted or hardened material around your eyes. If you are treating an infected eye, wash your hands again after wiping away any crusted material before proceeding with instilling the eye drops."

    {
      "title": "Shake the bottle gently.",
      "content": "Shake the bottle gently. Avoid harsh shaking. Gently shaking the bottle, or rolling the bottle between your hands, ensures the eye drop solution is evenly mixed. Some eye drop medications consist of a suspension of particles, so shaking will evenly mix these particles in the solution. Remove the cap from the bottle and place it in a clean place, like on a clean and dry towel."

      "title": "Avoid touching the tip of the container.",
      "content": "Avoid touching the tip of the container. As you prepare to instill the eye drop, take precaution in every step to avoid touching any part of your eye, including your lashes, to the tip of the container. [6] X Research source Touching the tip of the container to your eye can spread germs into the solution, causing it to be contaminated. By continuing to use a contaminated eye drop solution, you are at risk of re-infecting your eye with each drop used. If you accidentally touch the container tip to your eye, wipe the tip with an alcohol pad (70% isopropyl alcohol) to sterilize it or purchase a fresh bottle or let your doctor know you need your prescription refilled."

      "title": "Place your thumb above your eyebrow.",
      "content": "Place your thumb above your eyebrow. With the container in your hand, position your thumb against your skin, just above your eyebrow area. This helps to steady your hand as you administer your eyedrops. Position the eye drop container about ¾ inch above your lower eyelid to help avoid accidentally touching it to your eye area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt your head back.",
      "content": "Tilt your head back. With your head tilted back, gently pull down your lower eyelid with your index finger. [7] X Research source Pulling down your eyelid helps to create a space, or pocket, for the drop to settle into. Look up at a fixed point above you. Focus on a spot on the ceiling or something above you and keep both eyes open. This helps to avoid blinking."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze the bottle.",
      "content": "Squeeze the bottle. Gently squeeze the container until a drop falls into the pocket made by pulling out your lower eyelid. Close your eyes, but do not squeeze them shut. Keep your eyes shut for at least two to three minutes. Tilt your head down as if you were looking at the floor while keeping your eyes closed for the two to three minutes. Apply gentle pressure to the tear duct located on the inner part of your eye for 30 to 60 seconds. This helps the medication to remain in your eye area and also prevents the drops from going into the back of your throat, which can cause a bad taste. Use a clean tissue to gently blot any liquid that forms on the outside of your eye or cheek."

      "title": "Wait five minutes before a second drop.",
      "content": "Wait five minutes before a second drop. If your prescription requires more than one drop for each dose, wait five minutes before you administer the second drop so it has time to absorb. If you put a second medication in immediately after the first, it will wash away the first medication before it has had time to absorb. [8] X Research source If you are to instill drops in both eyes, you can proceed with administering a drop to your other eye in about two to three minutes, once you have kept your eyes shut for the recommended amount of time."

      "title": "Replace the top.",
      "content": "Replace the top. Place the top back on the container, without touching it or the tip.

Wash your hands to remove any medication or germs."

      "title": "Wait 10 to 15 minutes for other drops.",
      "content": "Wait 10 to 15 minutes for other drops. If your doctor has prescribed more than one type of drop, wait at least 10 to 15 minutes before using the other eye medication. In some cases, ophthalmic ointments are prescribed along with drops. Use the drops first, then wait 10 to 15 minutes before applying the ophthalmic ointment."

Sometimes the medication is needed in both eyes. Check for visible particles floating in the solution, the expiration date, and be sure you have an ophthalmic product. Be sure the container has not been damaged and the tip appears clean and is not discolored. Do not wipe or touch the tip. Gently shake the container to be sure the solution is mixed."

In young children, you may need to drop a small amount of the medication on the back of their hand so they can see it does not hurt.

      "content": "Hold the child gently. It often takes two people to put drops into the eye of a child. One person is responsible for gently holding the child in a comforting way and keeping the child’s hands away from their eyes. Take care not to scare the child. If the child is old enough to understand, let them know it is important that their hands are kept away from their eyes. Consider letting the child decide on how to best accomplish that, so the child does not feel trapped. Suggest that they sit on their hands, or lie on their back with their hands beneath them. The assisting adult will need to help keep the child’s hands away from their eyes, and the child’s head as still as possible. Work as quickly as you safely can in order to minimize the stress and anxiety felt by the child."

      "title": "Try another method.",
      "content": "Try another method. For children that are severely distressed by the administration of eye drops, consider using another method. [17] X Research source Recognizing that this method does not provide the same level of eye exposure to the medication, it still is better than no administration. Have the child lie flat, close their eyes, then place a drop of the medication on the inner corner of their eye, in the area of their tear duct. Have the child open their eye, and the medication will roll inside. Have them close their eyes for two to three minutes and apply gentle pressure on the tear duct area. Let the child’s doctor know if this is the only way to administer the medication. The doctor may alter the prescription or allow for more than one drop to be given as one dose, since less of the medication is entering the eye. Do not give more of the medication without talking with the doctor first. Using more than what is prescribed can cause irritation or sometimes mild burning from the preservatives contained in the solution."
