      "title": "F*** is only appropriate for adults to use in informal settings.",
      "content": "F*** is only appropriate for adults to use in informal settings. Whenever professionalism is expected, steer clear of the f-word (and other swear words). If you’re in a casual setting, like a bar or locker room, or with someone else who regularly uses the f-word, there’s a better chance that it’s okay. However, you should never use the f-word to curse at someone. Although there are no hard lines or consensus on a certain age, generally, it’s inappropriate for children (under 13) to ever use the f-word. Using the f-word might still get you in serious trouble if you’re under 18 (especially in schools or official gatherings). Whether or not the f-word is offensive is context-dependent. If you’re using it to give your ideas more emphasis or to lighten the mood, it’s significantly less offensive than if you’re using it to describe a person or yell at someone."

You are so f***ing good to me, I love you, bro. If you don’t think you’re in a situation where you can swear, you can also substitute it with “freaking.”"
