      "content": "Go casual with joggers made of knitted sweatpants material. If you want jogger pants for running errands and lounging, try a pair made of this traditional material. These joggers are very comfortable and feel almost like pajamas, but the tapered ankle and more fitted legs will make you look more pulled together. [1] X Research source Stick to lighter, airier pairs for warmer climates. A lightweight cotton or linen pair is perfect for this. If you need some extra insulation, check out fleece-lined jogger pants or versions in heavier fabrics like wool."

      "content": "Select a black pair made of nice material for a dressier look. Most jogger pants are worn casually, but you can dress them up, too. If you want to wear these to work or for dressier nights out, choose a pair of jogger pants made of a nice material and in a dark color. [2] X Research source Look for fabrics like tweed, corduroy, linen, and even leather to create a dressy look. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Experiment with different colors and patterns.",
      "content": "Experiment with different colors and patterns. You can basically find jogger pants in every color and pattern under the sun. A boldly patterned pair can make a fun statement, but they'll be less versatile than a solid color. [4] X Research source Try a solid statement color, like neon green! Think about how a pair will fit into your current wardrobe. Ideally, you can find a pair that will look great with tops and shoes you already own!"

      "title": "Embrace the details.",
      "content": "Embrace the details. All jogger pants are not created equal. Simple pairs are great, but there are plenty of pairs with fun details and trendy features that will turn heads. Look for a pair with cool metallic zippers on the ankles, or a colorful drawstring around the waist. [5] X Research source For example, a solid pair with a different color or fabric cuff around the ankles creates a nice contrast. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't stick to “athletic” clothing.",
      "content": "Don't stick to “athletic” clothing. Jogger pants might seem like they must be paired with t-shirts, but that's not the case. Dress up your jogger pants with things like blazers, button-downs, and nice sweaters. The contrast between the more relaxed pants and a nicer, more sophisticated top is incredibly on-trend. [7] X Research source For example, you could pair a black pair of tweed joggers with a black blazer and look polished."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stick to tailored and fitted tops.",
      "content": "Stick to tailored and fitted tops. The beauty of wearing jogger pants is that they are comfortable while still being acceptable to wear in public, but pairing them with slouchy, oversized tops can ruin that. To balance out the relaxed look of the jogger pants, it's best to pair them with tops that are more fitted. Whether it's a t-shirt, a nice blouse, or a button-down, opt for something that hugs your body a bit more. For example, go casual with a fitted green tank top and dark gray or black joggers."

    {
      "title": "Tuck longer shirts in.",
      "content": "Tuck longer shirts in. Again, jogger shirts can go from trendy to sloppy easily. If your shirt covers the waistband of your pants, it's a good idea to tuck it in. If you're wearing a t-shirt, you can tuck it in super casually, letting the top still hang loosely. If you're dressing up your jogger pants with a nicer top, tuck it in properly. If you want to pull these pants off in public, it's important to look put-together. [8] X Research source If tucking looks strange, try tying up your shirt into a side knot. The key is keeping the waistband of the joggers exposed."

    {
      "title": "Wear lace-up sneakers.",
      "content": "Wear lace-up sneakers. If you're embracing the athleisure look, pick a pair of sneakers that have laces. Slip-on shoes are popular, but they will make your ensemble look a bit juvenile. Whether you're wearing a pair of every day casual sneakers or a high-tech pair of running shoes, a lace-up pair will work better with jogger pants. [9] X Research source For a sporty look, wear lace-up sneakers with a fitted hoodie and matching joggers."

      "title": "Dress up jogger pants with high heels or dress shoes.",
      "content": "Dress up jogger pants with high heels or dress shoes. You may think your sky-high stilettos or patent leather dress shoes have no place with jogger pants, but they're actually perfect with them. A pair of jogger pants can be styled similarly to skinny jeans, so visualize outfits that way! From solid black to light-colored corduroy, a pair of dress shoes can completely “formalize” your outfit. [10] X Research source For example, you could create a dressy vibe by wearing a black cardigan with black fitted joggers, and finish off the look with patent leather pumps."

    {
      "title": "Pair jogger pants with high-top sneakers or booties.",
      "content": "Pair jogger pants with high-top sneakers or booties. You don't want your footwear to cover the elastic ankles, because you'll lose the shape of the jogger pants altogether. However, high-top sneakers, dress shoes, or short boots that come up to the tapered ankles are perfect. You can pull up your jogger pants a bit to ensure the hem sits on top of the shoe, rather than inside the shoe."
