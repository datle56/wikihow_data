      "content": "Emphasis on the deceased’s face The most common reason to cover a body’s legs is to draw attention to the face so viewers can reflect on the deceased’s humanity. For loved ones saying their final goodbyes , the departed’s face is typically what they want to see before the casket is closed. A half-closed casket or blanket also looks more dignified, formal, and offers less distractions. [1] X Research source At most open-casket ceremonies, a small block is placed beside the head so the deceased’s face is angled slightly toward the room for better viewing. The hands are also emphasized when the legs are covered. Often, they’re placed together over the stomach so they’re visible even when the bottom half of the casket is closed. If the departed was married, the hand with the wedding ring is placed on top of the other."

      "content": "Cultural, regional, or religious traditions Often, the legs are covered simply because that’s what the departed’s loved ones are used to. In some cultures, the legs represent a connection to the earth, so covering them severs this tie and allows the person’s spirit to leave their body. Sometimes, whether legs are covered or not is a regional practice—for example, it’s common to cover legs in the US, whereas putting the whole body on display is traditional in New Zealand. Religion also plays a role in how the body is presented. For example, in Islam and Judaism, the entire body must be covered in a shroud, blanket, or by a casket."

      "title": "Better lighting and aesthetics",
      "content": "Better lighting and aesthetics When only the upper body is visible, funeral directors have an easier time setting up lighting to illuminate the departed’s face. The closed lower half of the casket also provides more room to place flowers, photos, or other decorative or symbolic items the family may want to display. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Affordability",
      "content": "Affordability Morticians spend less time preparing the deceased’s lower half for ceremonies when they know it will be covered, which reduces the price of the funeral. This doesn’t mean they don’t attend to the legs at all, but the presentation will be less detailed. Covered legs allow them to focus more on preparing features like the face, hair, and hands (things that loved ones will remember the most). [3] X Research source The shorter preparation time leads to a slightly lower cost for the family, even though half-lid caskets that hide the lower body (half-couch caskets) and caskets with one solid lid that reveal the whole body (full-couch caskets) cost about the same."

      "title": "Traumatic injuries to the lower body",
      "content": "Traumatic injuries to the lower body Depending on the cause of death, the legs and lower body may not be presentable for an open-casket ceremony. Covering them draws attention away from injuries due to things like car accidents and toward the face of the departed. This is both respectful toward the deceased and less traumatic to witness for mourners and loved ones. [4] X Research source Other conditions may make the legs unpresentable as well. For example, skin from skin donors is often removed from the legs so the upper half of the body is presentable at open-casket ceremonies."

      "title": "Height constraints",
      "content": "Height constraints If the deceased is particularly tall, the mortician may need to bend the knees in order to fit the body in the casket. A half-couch casket will disguise this arrangement, which looks less dignified and may be distracting or upsetting to viewers. [5] X Research source Oversized caskets are an option in these scenarios, but they are more expensive than standard-sized ones. Bodies are moved into caskets by machines or by hand. Afterward, morticians take time to adjust the body’s position so it rests as comfortably and naturally as possible."

      "title": "Swollen feet",
      "content": "Swollen feet Sometimes, the feet of the deceased can swell if fluids collect in the lower body. This makes them difficult to fit into shoes, and the swelling may still be visible even if the mortician finds shoes that fit. This can be painful or uncomfortable for loved ones to see, so a half-couch casket or a blanket is used to cover the legs and feet to preserve the dignity of the deceased. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Half-couch (split-couch) caskets",
      "content": "Half-couch (split-couch) caskets Half-couch caskets have a seam in the middle of the hinged lid, splitting it into 2 parts. This lets you open just the top or bottom half of the casket, or the entire thing if desired. At many open-casket viewings, half-couches are used to display just the face and torso of the deceased. [7] X Research source Half-couches can be used for closed-casket ceremonies or to display the entire body, according to the preferences of the deceased’s loved ones."
    },
    {
      "title": "Full-couch caskets",
      "content": "Full-couch caskets Full-couch caskets have a hinged lid that comes in one solid piece, meaning the body is entirely hidden when the casket is closed, or visible from head to toe when it’s open. Full-couches are popular choices for closed-casket ceremonies since there’s no need to display any portion of the body. [8] X Research source Both half- and full-couch caskets typically have rails or handles along the sides so pallbearers can grab and move the casket easily."

    {
      "title": "Coffins",
      "content": "Coffins Coffins have lids without hinges that lift completely off. Unlike caskets, which are rectangular, coffins have 6 sides that more closely contour the shape of a human body (almost like a kite shape, but with a flat top and bottom). Also unlike caskets, coffins don’t typically have side rails or handles to facilitate easy lifting. [9] X Research source The term “casket” and “coffin” are often used interchangeably, although it’s easy to see distinct differences between them . Coffins were the standard burial vessel in many areas until the 19th century, when caskets became more popular and the funeral home practice became more wide-spread."

      "content": "Funeral directors often suggest half-couches, but it’s entirely up to you. Both half- and full-couch caskets can be used for open- or closed-casket ceremonies, but half-couches give you more flexibility in terms of how you display the body. Both types also come in a variety of styles, materials, and have wide price ranges, meaning you have plenty of options for your needs and budget. When you’re planning a funeral, the decision depends on your cultural or religious traditions, budget, and personal preferences. [10] X Research source Both styles can also be decorated or personalized however you like for viewing ceremonies. If you need guidance, speak to a funeral director for recommendations. If you prefer a full-couch but still want the departed’s legs covered, the funeral director can place a blanket or shroud over the lower half of the body. Most caskets cost between $2,000 and $5,000. Smaller sizes and cheaper materials (like wood, biodegradable materials, or stainless steel in place of bronze or copper) fall on the lower end of the price range."

      "title": "Caskets are sealed for burial after all body preparations and ceremonies.",
      "content": "Caskets are sealed for burial after all body preparations and ceremonies. Sealing the casket protects the body from air, moisture, and other elements that might speed up decay. Once the casket is closed and sealed, it’s typically transported to a cemetery in a hearse or other vehicle from the church or funeral home where the wake, funeral, or viewing ceremony took place. Modern caskets are typically sealed with a special hexagonal lock, or less commonly, with metal clasps. Funeral directors usually keep the hexagonal key to the lock in case the body needs to be exhumed for a criminal investigation or re-embalming. Historically, plain coffins were simply nailed shut. This is very rare today since it’s not an effective method at keeping out the elements."
