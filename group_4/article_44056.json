      "content": "Doing a task \"in a timely manner\" means doing it as soon as possible. \"Timely manner\" is a polite term people use to ask someone to perform a task right away. The level of urgency it carries changes slightly based on the context and setting in which you use it. [1] X Research source At work or school, \"in a timely manner\" typically means \"before the deadline.\" It's often used in professional communications – such as phone calls, e-mails, and Slack messages – to emphasize that a specific task should get done quickly. In casual conversation, \"timely manner\" means \"as soon as possible.\" When used outside of a professional setting, \"timely manner\" doesn't carry as much urgency – but it's still a signal to the listener that an action was either completed quickly (in reference to past events) or needs to be completed shortly (in reference to future events). In legal terms, \"timely manner\" means completing an action by a legal deadline. It applies to contracts between different people or entities, as well as to people who have been court-ordered to complete an action or appear before a judge by a specific time.
