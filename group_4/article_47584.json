      "title": "Go with a classic button-up shirt.",
      "content": "Go with a classic button-up shirt. The most common way to wear a bolo is beneath the collar of a button-up shirt. Bolos were created with a masculine influence in mind, although wearing one more casually allows for more femininity."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pair the shirt with matching slacks or a long skirt.",
      "content": "Pair the shirt with matching slacks or a long skirt. The pants should match your jacket as well, if you wear one. Appropriately formal bottoms can help complete the look, depending on the desire for a masculine or feminine feel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Finish the ensemble with shoes.",
      "content": "Finish the ensemble with shoes. Formalwear is often best completed with a close-toed shoe or heel. Keep in mind that black pants look best with black shoes, and you can wear shoes in brown or another color with lighter colored pants or skirts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find a matching bolo.",
      "content": "Find a matching bolo. As with most formal fashion, you want to select a bolo tie that is going to match or compliment the rest of your attire. Black is most formal for a bolo, either with an all-silver or all-gold slide and tips. Make sure the occasion is open to a bolo tie. Rodeos—yes. Interviews—probably not. Overly ornamental slides should also be saved for more casual occasions. An oversized, animal-shaped slide can be a bit too loud for that date night."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the slide all the way up.",
      "content": "Pull the slide all the way up. Essentially, the lower the slide, the less formal the look will come across. This should be tucked under your collar such that the slide hides your collar button. [2] X Research source Then the braids will fall naturally as they will—ideally hitting about mid-chest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear it with confidence.",
      "content": "Wear it with confidence. Bolo ties are generally not a common accessory outside of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, where they are the official neckwear. That doesn't mean you can't wear them no matter where you live, though! Rock your bolo tie with confidence. [3] X Research source Keep in mind to check that the slide hasn’t started to fall during the evening. Cinch it back up if so."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a bolo that suits your style.",
      "content": "Pick a bolo that suits your style. [4] X Research source This range of occasion is where you can get away with a little more of a style-statement for your look. Think classic turquoise stone, a colored chord or something else, but still a little on the classier side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select a colored button-up shirt.",
      "content": "Select a colored button-up shirt. A semi-formal bolo look will also do best with a button-up shirt. However, unlike more formal occasions, you can start to introduce some color. Solid, somewhat muted colors, will give that slightly more relaxed feel while not taking attention away from your bolo tie. A suit jacket may be a little too formal. Instead, pick a vest to stick with the Western feel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cinch the slide to just below your top button.",
      "content": "Cinch the slide to just below your top button. [5] X Research source In this scenario, you wouldn’t button your collar button or the one below it. This is where the slide should sit just beneath. It doesn’t look too sloppy, but just like the buttoning of the shirt beneath, is still appropriately formal."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete your look with pants or a slightly shorter skirt.",
      "content": "Complete your look with pants or a slightly shorter skirt. A khaki chino pant or well-tailored jean can be good for a masculine look. For the feminine, a good pair of jeans or a knee-length skirt can begin to feel more relaxed without going too casual."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear a more casual shoe.",
      "content": "Wear a more casual shoe. Semi-formal is a bit of a scale where you can wear either a leather loafer, a boot (if you have any), or even a clean sneaker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Transform your bolo tie into a necklace.",
      "content": "Transform your bolo tie into a necklace. [6] X Research source For the most casual of looks, go big. The more colorful and ornate your bolo and slide, the more simple your clothing should be. As with other accessories, you want a balance. For the casual look, the bolo will take place of a necklace, not be in addition to a necklace."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear a T-shirt instead of a collared shirt.",
      "content": "Wear a T-shirt instead of a collared shirt. Since the bolo was meant to be more formal, repurposing it as a casual accessory calls for switching up the standards. [7] X Research source More casual tops paired with shorts or shorter skirts will help make the bolo feel more like an accessory than formal neckwear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the slide worn low.",
      "content": "Keep the slide worn low. [8] X Research source The slide here can be halfway up or lower. If it’s just above the ornamental tips, it can even look entirely unlike a bolo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Match your other accessories to the bolo.",
      "content": "Match your other accessories to the bolo. Think of the bolo as your centerpiece. It is where eyes will be drawn, so make sure to balance and match your other accessories (if wearing any). For instance, a blue purse would look great if the slide of the bolo is blue. Bracelets or rings should complement the colors of the bolo, but not be so ornate that they distract from it. Leather accessories that match the color of the bolo’s braid also make for a nice pairing."
