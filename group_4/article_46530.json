Choose a watch with a clear face that showcases each sub-dial clearly. Make sure that the hands on your watch contrast the color of the watch face, making them easy to see. [1] X Research source Be sure to try on a watch before buying it to make sure that you can see the numbers on your wrist without having to bring it up to your face."

      "content": "Buy a watch that can time the duration you want it to. Chronograph watches range in terms of how long their timer function operates. Be sure to choose a watch that you can use for the purposes you have in mind. Some watches can only time 30 minutes at a time, while others have the capacity to time up to 12 hours. For instance, if you want a chronograph watch to time your long walks or runs, choose a model that times at least 2-3 hours at a time."

      "content": "Opt for a watch that is water- and shock-resistant if you're active. If you live an active lifestyle, choose a watch that will stand up to water, sweat, and intense movement. You should also make sure that chronograph buttons on the side of the watch are not sensitive enough to turn on or off unexpectedly while you are moving. Shop for watches that will be easy to operate while you are active. [2] X Research source If you are going to swim while wearing your watch, choose a model that is water-resistant up to 200 or 300 meters. Watches that are water-resistant up to 30 meters are usually just splash-resistant, and not appropriate for swimming."

Take off your watch and hold it with the face towards you. Brace the crown of the watch and turn it clockwise repeatedly until you meet resistance. If your watch is completely run down, it may take 20-30 turns to wind it fully. [7] X Research source The crown is the small dial on the side of your watch. On most chronograph watches, the crown will be found on the right side under the start/stop button."
