Thank you for coaching and teaching us all the most important lessons—including how to pretend to be disappointed when the referee rules in our favor. Thanks to you, I know what a real leader does: show us how to be better while pretending you’ve never made the same mistakes. You’re a real one! My parents and I both want to thank you for showing me how to throw a ball properly, coach. Our windows are really grateful, too!"
