      "content": "Choose a specific sense of the word and think about the word's meaning in that sense. One good way to go about this is to consider how you would explain this word to a small child or a person who is just beginning to speak the language. Avoid using descriptive words that are more complicated than the word in question, unless you also explain their meaning. [3] X Research source"

Thus, try to be as descriptive as possible. If the word has a range of meanings, you'll need to address each one separately."
