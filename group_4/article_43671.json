The puff pastry won't need to be microwaved or thawed if it can be folded easily. The pastry sheet should be cold to the touch when you use it. If the sheet is room temperature or warmer, return it to the fridge and give it some time to chill. [1] X Research source Don't manipulate a pastry sheet that's not fully thawed as this could lead to the sheet tearing."

      "content": "Place the pastry sheet in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. Place the towels and pastry sheet on the plate in your microwave. Turn the microwave to the \"high\" setting and turn the microwave on for 15 seconds. When the 15 seconds are up, flip the paper towels and pastry sheet and turn the microwave on for another 15 seconds. If the pastry sheet doesn't fold easily after coming out of the microwave, place it back in on \"high\" for another 5 seconds on each side. Keep microwaving for 5 seconds on each side until the pastry sheet folds easily."

      "content": "Take the pastry sheets out of the packaging. The fridge is the slowest method for thawing your pastry but ensures a thorough thaw. The fridge will also keep your pastry cool so you can use it as soon as you take it out of the fridge. Check if the pastry sheets need to be thawed by trying to fold them. If they can be easily folded, the pastry sheets don't need to be thawed. Puff pastry should feel cold when you're using it for baking. If the pastry sheet can be folded easily but feels warm to the touch, you should place the pastry sheets in the fridge to cool them instead of thawing them."

Leave the pastry sheets for 3 hours and check to see if you can easily fold them. [4] X Research source If you can, they are ready to be used. If you still feel like the pastry sheets are frozen, leave them in the fridge for another hour. After the 4 hours are up, check to see how easy it is to fold the pastry.
