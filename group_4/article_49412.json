      "content": "Describe your present moment. The most common way to write in a diary is to talk about your day.

      "content": "Maintain a success log. Another way to cultivate a positive outlook and keep yourself interested in your diary is to create a success log.

Jennifer is supposed to be my friend, but she doesn't act like it.\" You might say, \"I am really disappointing. I thought I would get an A on my essay, but I actually got a B-. I did my best, but it wasn't good enough.\""
