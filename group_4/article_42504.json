A “Duck Under” requires you to move under your opponent’s arm as they approach and quickly grab him around the waist from behind. Keep one arm straight out in front of your opponent as you move behind your him; wrap your other arm around his waist from behind. Once you have a hold on your opponent, flip him onto the mat by falling back and swinging him with you. A “Double Leg” takedown involves grabbing both legs of your opponent around mid-thigh and pulling them up and towards you to force your opponent onto his back. Approach your opponent from the front and grab both legs at once. Be careful not to lower your head or you become vulnerable. Use a “Single Leg Takedown” to quickly take a shot at your opponent’s front leg as you face each other, lift it off the ground and knock him down by attacking the other leg. Grab the leg that is closest to you and pull it up. Use your feet to sweep his other foot off the mat while you push him off balance with the leg you are holding."
