      "content": "Air dry the gloves for several hours after games or practices. While you may not be able to wash your gloves right after you leave the rink, you should at least dry them. Take the gloves out of your hockey bag and place them on a drying rack, clothesline, or equipment tree so air can circulate. Leave them for several hours or until they're completely dry. [1] X Research source Airing the gloves can prevent bacteria from growing on the gloves and will reduce their odor."

      "title": "Put the gloves in the washing machine and soak them for 15 minutes, if needed.",
      "content": "Put the gloves in the washing machine and soak them for 15 minutes, if needed. If you're using a front-loading machine, place the gloves and any other equipment you want to wash into the machine. If you're using a top-loading machine, put the gloves and equipment into the machine. Fill the machine with cold water and soak the gloves for 15 minutes before running the wash cycle. [2] X Research source Front-loading washing machines do a great job of tumbling the gloves and equipment. While top-loading machines can clean hockey equipment, gloves can float to the top of the drum. This is why it's important to soak them before running the wash cycle."

      "title": "Add bleach-free detergent and a cleaning booster to the machine.",
      "content": "Add bleach-free detergent and a cleaning booster to the machine. Use your favorite laundry detergent to wash the gloves. Don't use any detergents that have bleaching agents that could damage the glove material. Add the standard amount of detergent as recommended by the manufacturer. You should also include 1/2 cup (120 ml) of a cleaning booster. [3] X Research source For cleaning boosters, use borax, washing soda, oxygenated laundry booster, or vinegar."

      "title": "Pour vinegar into the fabric softener compartment of the machine.",
      "content": "Pour vinegar into the fabric softener compartment of the machine. Instead of using fabric softeners on the gloves, add the same amount of vinegar to the machine's fabric softener compartment. Vinegar will remove unwanted smells from the gloves and will strip away any laundry detergent residue that could be left on the gloves. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Run a regular wash cycle.",
      "content": "Run a regular wash cycle. Close the lid of the machine and run a standard wash cycle using cold water. The cold water will agitate the gloves in detergent and booster solution so dirt and grime loosen. The vinegar added to the rinse cycle will also remove odors from the gloves. [5] X Research source If you're washing a lot of other hockey equipment at the same time, you may want to divide it into 2 to 3 loads."

      "title": "Hang dry the clean hockey gloves.",
      "content": "Hang dry the clean hockey gloves. Remove the gloves from the washing machine and hang them up on a clothesline . There's no need to pat them dry on a towel since the machine's spin cycle removed excess water from the gloves. Let them air dry for several hours or overnight. Wait to use them until they're completely dry. [6] X Research source To speed up drying time, consider drying the gloves on an electric drying rack or blowing the gloves with a hair dryer set to cool. You can also run a dehumidifier in the room with the gloves. Avoid drying the gloves in a clothes dryer. The heat from the dryer can cause the fabric on the gloves to split or crack."

      "content": "Air dry the gloves for several hours. If you can't hand wash the gloves immediately after practices or games, take the time to air dry them. Remove the gloves from your hockey bag and place them on a drying rack, clothesline, or equipment tree so air can circulate. Leave the gloves for a few hours or until they're completely dry.

      "content": "Mix hot water, laundry detergent, and a cleaning booster in the sink. Measure 1/8 cup (30 ml) of laundry detergent into your sink along with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of a cleaning booster (such as vinegar, color-safe bleach, borax, or an oxygenated laundry booster). Run enough hot water to fill the sink about half full. [8] X Research source Use the hottest water that comes out of the tap. This will dissolve the detergent and booster. If your sink is too shallow to fit both gloves, fill your bathtub half full with water and use the same amounts of cleaning solutions."

      "content": "Stir and agitate the gloves in the cleanser. Use your hands or a spoon to stir the cleanser around. Moving the cleanser will agitate the gloves so the dirt loosens. You should see the cleanser become cloudy or dirty after you've agitated the gloves. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a towel to soak up excess water. Lay an old, clean towel on your work surface and lay 1 of the cleaned hockey gloves on it. Roll the towel over the glove and press down on it so the towel absorbs some of the excess water. Get out a new towel and dry the other clean glove in it. [13] X Research source"

The gloves should dry completely before using them again.
