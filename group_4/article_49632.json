If you have a secured promissory note, this means the person borrowing money has agreed that the lender has the right to collateral (such as property) if the borrower defaults.

[4] X Research source UCC forms differ by state and must be filed with your state's Secretary of State. The form should include a description of the collateral and its value. [5] X Research source"
