      "title": "Contour the lines of your face with makeup to reduce asymmetry.",
      "content": "Contour the lines of your face with makeup to reduce asymmetry. Contouring will accentuate your cheekbones and make them look higher, as well as slim down your nose and chin, if that’s something you feel self-conscious about. It will also allow you to balance your features by giving more definition to any unevenness. Apply a foundation that matches your skin tone, and then apply lighter and darker foundations to accentuate your facial features and balance them. [1] X Research source Look online for makeup artists who have facial asymmetry similar to you, so you can see how they contour their faces. For instance, if 1 side of your face is uneven, look for a tutorial that shows you how to apply your contour to correct it. Choose high-quality foundations made from natural ingredients that correspond to your skin tone for the best results."

      "content": "Highlight your eyes and cheekbones. Highlighting your eyes and cheekbones will make them pop and draw attention away from any asymmetrical features on your face. Apply a primer and foundation, then add some concealer that’s a few shades lighter than your skin tone to the areas beneath your eyes and between your eyebrows. Then, use a makeup brush to blend the concealer and accentuate your eyes and cheekbones. Rather than trying to hide features you aren’t so happy with, highlight the ones you love! Use high-quality foundation and concealer that won’t clump or run."

      "content": "Fill in thinner eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil.

      "title": "Style your hair into an uneven updo to minimize facial imbalances.",
      "content": "Style your hair into an uneven updo to minimize facial imbalances. Perfectly straight hairstyles, such as a bob or a round bun, will make any imbalances that you have more noticeable, so go with uneven shapes. Choose a teased, messy bun to add some unevenness to your appearance, which will distract from facial asymmetry. Try a side ponytail or a side-swept chignon on the opposite side of prominent or asymmetrical features to balance the appearance of your face. [4] X Research source Use a pixie cut with long bangs that are swept over any facial asymmetries to highlight your more balanced features. Choosing uneven haircuts will work the same way. Angular, messy hairstyles like a choppy bob or a short cut with layers will help offset imbalances in your facial features."
