      "title": "Undo the third button on your shirt.",
      "content": "Undo the third button on your shirt. A tie tack is positioned around the midline of your tie and shirt so it’s visible and can keep your tie from swinging too much when you move. Undo the button with your fingers so the buttonhole is exposed. [2] X Research source If you use a button that’s too high up your shirt, it won’t properly hold your tie to keep it from swinging. If you use a button that’s too low, then nobody will be able to see your tie tack."

      "title": "Insert the T-bar through the buttonhole and button it.",
      "content": "Insert the T-bar through the buttonhole and button it. The bar attached to the chain of the tie tack is called the T-bar and will help secure it to your shirt. Slide the bar through the empty buttonhole so the chain and face of the tie tack are hanging in front of your shirt. Then, insert the button through the hole to secure the chain. [4] X Research source The button will secure the chain of the tie tack in the buttonhole. The bar should remain behind the button."

      "title": "Pull the release mechanism and separate the face of the tie tack.",
      "content": "Pull the release mechanism and separate the face of the tie tack. Hold the front, or face, of the tie tack with 1 of your hands using your fingertips. With the fingertips of your other hand, pull the small knob on the base, or the clutch. Then, pull the face away from the clutch. [5] X Research source The post with the face on it will slide out of the base it was connected to. You can let go of the clutch after you pull out the post. Don’t force or try to yank the face. If the release mechanism is correctly engaged, it will slide out easily."

      "title": "Pierce the front of the wide and narrow parts of your tie with the post.",
      "content": "Pierce the front of the wide and narrow parts of your tie with the post. Push the sharp end of the post through the wide section, or the front of your tie. Then, push it through the narrow section that hangs behind it. [6] X Research source Push the post through the center of the tie. Don’t stretch or pull your tie tight, instead, allow it to hang naturally so it doesn’t bunch up or create a larger hole when you push the post through it."

    {
      "title": "Insert the post into the clutch hanging from the chain.",
      "content": "Insert the post into the clutch hanging from the chain. Use 1 hand to retrieve the clutch hanging at the end of the chain. Hold it steady with your fingertips and slide the post into it. Push the post until you hear or feel a small click so you know it’s locked into place. [7] X Research source Some tie tacks may require you to hold the release mechanism, slide the post into the clutch, then let go of the mechanism so it’s locked. The chain will hang behind the tie and keep it from swinging."

      "content": "Put on a tie tack with a suit for a more formal look. Tie tacks are meant to be worn with formal wear and work great to add an accent to a suit, while also securing your necktie. Wear a suit with a jacket whenever you wear a tie tack to an event or party. [8] X Research source You can also wear a vest with your suit, but make sure your tie tack isn’t obscured behind it. A standard, silver-colored tie bar adds a classic touch to your outfit. [9] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021."

      "title": "Wear a tie tack with silk, wool, or cashmere ties.",
      "content": "Wear a tie tack with silk, wool, or cashmere ties. Woven silk ties and ties made out of coarse fabrics such as wool or cashmere are great to pair with a tie tack because the tack won’t leave a mark that you can see in the tie. You can also wear a tie tack with dark-colored ties because the small hole won’t be visible in the material. [10] X Research source Don’t use a tie tack for brightly colored or finely printed ties because the small hole created by the tack will be visible."

      "title": "Use a tie tack to represent your personal style.",
      "content": "Use a tie tack to represent your personal style. A tie tack will help control your necktie and keep it from swaying around as you move. But it’s also meant to accessorize your outfit as well. So choose one that matches your style and completes your look. Wear a single pearl as your tie tack for a subdued but distinguished look. Use a monogrammed tie tack to add your initials as a personal stylistic stamp to your outfit. Put on a tie tack with a precious metal like gold or a gemstone like diamond or sapphire to add a bit of elegant flair to your look."

      "content": "Add a tie tack to your look as a conversation piece. Wearing a tie tack instead of a clip or a fancy knot will attract attention because they’re not often worn these days. Putting one on will catch people’s attention and they’re likely to ask you about it. You can use your tie tack to spark a conversation with someone at a cocktail party or a bar. Tie tacks come in a lot of fun shapes and motifs, like music notes or glasses. [11] X Expert Source Tavia Sharp Certified Image Consultant Expert Interview. 26 August 2021.
