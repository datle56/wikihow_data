      "content": "Avoid touching the area at first. If possible, do not touch or rub the affected area for 10 minutes. Pour fresh water over the area without touching it. Even though the pain can be intense during the first few minutes, avoiding any touching or rubbing may prevent the pain from lingering for days. [1] X Research source The chemical irritants from the plant can dry on the surface of the skin where they can be removed by soap and water. By avoiding any rubbing or touching at first, the chemicals are not pushed deeper into the skin which can cause the painful reaction to last longer, possibly even days. [2] X Research source The chemicals released by the plant include acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, moroidin, leukotrienes, and possibly formic acid. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Know what to expect. The stinging, burning, pain, and itching, is quite intense. The duration of the symptoms varies from person to person, and varies depending on the initial measures taken to clean the area as just described. The rash looks similar to hives, with raised areas of whitish blisters. The entire area can appear swollen and inflamed, with a reddish tint to the area affected."

      "title": "Use leaves from other plants.",
      "content": "Use leaves from other plants. Applying the juices contained in the leaves from either a dock, jewelweed or plantain plant may help. These plants often grow in the same areas as the nettle plant. Locate either plant, and crush a few leaves to release their juices. Apply the crushed leaves to the area affected. The research into use of plants to treat this condition is limited. Yet, this has been common practice in treating a sting from a nettle plant for centuries. A dock weed commonly grows in the same general areas as the stinging nettle plant. The plant grows in height from 20 inches (50.8 cm) to about 50 inches, and the leaves grow to be about 16 inches (41 cm) long. The leaves are very large, oval, have rounded tips, and have a wavy look to the edges. The lower leaves have a reddish color to their stems. [7] X Research source This is sometimes cited as a placebo effect. [8] X Research source A jewelweed plant is similar to impatiens. These plants sometimes also grow naturally in the same areas where you may come across a stinging nettle. The chemical content found in the juice from the stem of a jewelweed plant is reportedly effective at counteracting the sting from a stinging nettle. Ribwort Plantain (Narrow Leaf Plantain, Plantago lanceolata) can help reduce pain and the urge to scratch the sting. It is long and thin, so you can wrap it like a bandage over the affected area and keep it in place which allows you to continue any activities. Alternatively, chew the leaves to make a poultice and apply that to the affected area. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source"

Scratching can irritate the area even further, possibly break the skin, and cause the symptoms to linger. For young children, you may want to put soft gloves or mittens on their hands to help avoid scratching. Also keep nails short."

Apply over-the-counter topical products containing hydrocortisone to treat the rash. Follow the package directions. A rash that includes redness, itching, and inflammation may persist since the skin has been injured from the direct contact from the stinging nettle plant. Calamine or Caladryl速 lotion can help to provide a soothing feeling and help to reduce the itching and burning. Over-the-counter oral antihistamines might also help to counteract the reaction that is occurring in your body. Available products include agents such as cetirizine, or Zyrtec速, loratadine, or Claritin速, and diphenhydramine, or Benadryl速. Apply antibiotic creams or ointments. Products are available over-the-counter that contain a mixture of anti-infective agents. Apply the antibiotic cream or ointment directly to the areas involved. The coolness of the product will have a soothing effect, and the active properties of the cream or ointment can help prevent infection.
