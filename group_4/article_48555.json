      "content": "Buy a supplement with high bioavailability from a reputable seller. Bioavailability refers to how well a supplement can be absorbed through the gut and into your organs. For a magnesium supplement to help with sleep, it has to have high bioavailability. Generally, organic forms of magnesium (like glycinate or citrate) are easier for the body to absorb, while other forms (oxide, sulfate, and carbonate) have low absorption and may be less useful for sleep (and more prone to digestive side effects). [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Since supplements aren’t regulated by the FDA, look for a seller that includes third-party testing as part of their process. For example, all of BIOptimizers' products , including the best-selling Magnesium Breakthrough supplement , are tested by Informed Sport for 250+ substances that are prohibited in sports. The Informed Sport certification on the packaging ensures every product was made in an environment with quality systems appropriate for sports nutrition manufacturing."

      "content": "Try the recommended daily allowance (about 310-420 mg) 1 hour before bed. It’s best to start with a small amount of magnesium (no more than the daily recommended allowance) to see how it affects you, then work up to a higher dosage if needed. The exact daily allowance depends on factors like your age, gender, and if you’re pregnant, but in general, adult males need 400-420 mg per day and adult females need 310-320 mg per day. [8] X Research source Taking magnesium about 1 hour before bed gives the supplement enough time to kick in for most people, but experiment with what time feels best to you. For most people, it’s safe to take magnesium every day as long as you don’t exceed about 400 mg per dose. [9] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You may experience mild side effects like diarrhea or digestive discomfort if the dose is too high. If you have a magnesium deficiency, a doctor may recommend a higher dose temporarily to correct your imbalance. [10] X Research source It’s estimated that about 48% of the population is magnesium deficient. [11] X Research source Whether you have a deficiency or not, the key to finding the right dose is to start small and gradually raise the amount until you reach the ideal dose without digestive upset."

      "content": "Try making a “sleepy girl mocktail” with magnesium as part of your bedtime routine. You may have heard of this viral health hack on social media, but this trendy drink may have real benefits for your sleep. The drink combines 1 tablespoon (15 g) of magnesium powder, ½ cup (118 mL) of pure tart cherry juice, and a fizzy drink like carbonated water or a prebiotic soda to cut it. While it’s not meant to be a magic bullet for sleep, many people claim it helps them get a better night’s sleep. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tart cherry juice contains natural melatonin (the “sleepy hormone”) and an amino acid called tryptophan (the same thing in turkey that makes you feel sleepy after Thanksgiving). When tart cherry juice combines with the muscle and nerve relaxation of magnesium (usually magnesium glycinate), the result is a “mocktail” that eases you into sleep. BIOptimizers’ tart cherry Magnesium Breakthrough powdered supplement is a great natural, vegetarian option for making a sleepy girl mocktail, and it contains 8 different types of magnesium and tart cherry juice powder. Clinically, tart cherry juice significantly increases time in bed, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency, making it an excellent synergy with magnesium for sleep. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source BIOptimizers' Magnesium Breakthrough Tart Cherry stands out due to its drinkable format, which is absorbed better than capsules.

      "title": "Getting enough elemental magnesium in each dose is crucial for sleep.",
      "content": "Getting enough elemental magnesium in each dose is crucial for sleep. Most organic forms of magnesium have about 7-20% of elemental magnesium because the amino or organic acids have a lot of weight relative to the magnesium. Therefore, you may need to take a lot of magnesium supplements. If you take one 200 mg capsule of magnesium glycinate, for example, you have only 28.2 mg of elemental magnesium. Therefore, you need 15 capsules of magnesium glycinate to get the RDA dose. Magnesium Breakthrough packs an impressive 250 mg of elemental magnesium per capsule (or 500 mg magnesium per 2-capsule serving), making it easy to get the dosage you need to reap magnesium’s health benefits."

Excess magnesium from food is passed out of the body through urine and stool, but an excess from medications or supplements (especially low-absorbing magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide) can cause diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and nausea.

      "content": "Magnesium is a natural mineral, while melatonin is a hormone made in the brain. While they can both aid sleep, melatonin has a more specific function. Production increases when it gets dark, prompting your body to feel sleepy and want to go to bed. Melatonin is often used to reset your circadian rhythm (your internal 24-hour sleep-wake cycle), especially if you’re experiencing jet lag, occasional sleep issues, or simply need to change your bed and wake-up times.

While glycinate, citrate, and L-threonate may help you sleep, other supplement types can be beneficial in other areas: [21] X Research source Magnesium oxide is the most commonly used in supplements. It’s poorly absorbed by the body and can cause an upset stomach, so it’s not often recommended. Magnesium malate is easily absorbed, has a smaller laxative effect, and helps with physical discomfort. Magnesium taurate has natural calming effects, is easily absorbed, and can help regulate blood sugar and blood pressure. Magnesium orotate supports heart health, may help with constipation, and is easily absorbed by the gut."
