      "content": "Play your first X in a corner. Most experienced tic tac toe players put the first \"X\" in a corner when they get to play first. This gives the opponent the most opportunities to make a mistake. If your opponent responds by putting an O anywhere besides the center, you can guarantee a win. [1] X Research source In this example, you are going first, and using X as your symbol. Your opponent goes second and uses O."

If they continue to play correctly, they can guarantee a tie. Here are your two options for your second move, followed by instructions on how to win if they make certain moves (if they don't, just keep blocking their plays and the game will be a tie): [2] X Research source Place your second X in the opposite corner from your first, so there's a line going \"X O X\" diagonally across the board. If they respond with an O in one of the other corners, you can win! Place your third X in the last empty corner, and your opponent won't be able to block you from winning with your fourth X. Or , place your second X on an edge square (not a corner), not touching your first X. If your opponent puts down an O in the corner that's not next to your X, you can use your third X to block their move and automatically win with your fourth X."

Respond by putting your second X in any other corner, with an empty space in between the two X's. [3] X Research source For example, say your first X is in the top left square, and your opponent puts an O in the top middle square. You can put your second X in the bottom left corner, or the bottom right corner. Don't put it in the top right, since that would put an O between your two X's instead of an empty space."

      "title": "Place your third X so you have two possible winning moves.",
      "content": "Place your third X so you have two possible winning moves. Most of the time, your opponent will see that you have two X's in a row and block you. (If not, just win by making a row of three X's.) After this happens, there should be an empty square that is in line with both your first and your second X, with no enemy O's blocking that line. Put your third X in this square. [4] X Research source For example, take a piece of paper and draw a tic tac toe board with the top row \"X O _\", the middle row \"O _ _,\" and the bottom row \"X _ _.\" If you place your third X in the bottom right corner, it's in line with both of your other Xs."

      "title": "Force a draw if the opponent starts in the corner.",
      "content": "Force a draw if the opponent starts in the corner. If the opponent plays first and starts with an O in a corner, always put your first X in the center. Your second X should be placed on an edge, not a corner, unless you need to block your opponent from getting three in a row. Using this strategy, every game should be a draw. Theoretically, you can win from this position, but your opponent would have to make a huge mistake, such as not seeing that you have two X's in a row. [5] X Research source In this section, your opponent is still playing O's, but remember they get to play first this time."

After that, just keep blocking your opponent from scoring and the game will be a draw. There is essentially no way for you to win from this position, unless your opponent stops trying to win or stop you from winning! [6] X Research source"

However, if your opponent puts down the first O on an edge, not on a corner or center, you have a small chance to win. Put your first X in the center. If your opponent puts the second O on the opposite edge, making a row or column that reads O-X-O, put your second X in a corner. Then, if your opponent puts the third O in the edge that is adjacent to your X, making a line that reads O-X-O, put your third X in the empty square to block their row of two O's. From here, you can always win with your fourth X. [7] X Research source If at any point, your opponent doesn't make the exact move described above, you'll have to settle for a draw. Just start blocking their moves and neither of you will win."

It might be fun for a while to be unbeatable at tic tac toe, but even without this article, your friends might figure out how to stop you from winning. Once that happens, every single game of tic tac toe you play with them will be a draw â€” ugh. But you can still use basic tic-tac-toe rules to play games that aren't as easily solved. Try them out below."

You can still use all the strategy advice in this article, but it can be difficult to concentrate on that when you're trying to remember where the X's and O's are. Agree on a system for describing moves. For instance, the first word is the row (top, middle, or bottom) and the second word is the column (left, middle, or right)."

Label one board \"top,\" another \"middle,\" and the third board \"bottom.\" You can play anywhere on these boards, and they work as though they were stacked on top of each other to make a cube. [8] X Research source For instance, taking the center on all three boards wins you the game since it makes a line standing vertical through the cube. Getting three in a row on any single board also wins. See if you can figure out how to win with a diagonal line across all three boards. For a real challenge, combine this with the last variation and try mental 3D tic tac toe. The first word is the board (top, middle, or bottom), the second word is the row (top, middle, or bottom), and the third word is the column (left, middle, or right)."

Instead of marking X's and O's inside the squares, write them at the intersections where the graph paper lines meet. You can make each move anywhere on the graph paper. The first player to get exactly five in a row (not six or more) wins the game. This game is surprisingly complicated, despite its similarity to tic tac toe, and even has world championship tournaments. In tournaments, players use a 15x15 or a 19x19 board, but you can use any size of graph paper for this game. You could even play on an infinite board, taping on more graph paper whenever you need to."
