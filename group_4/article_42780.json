      "content": "Turn the pants inside out and put them on. If you’re tapering your own pants but don’t know how much width you need to remove, turn them inside out and put them on. [1] X Research source This will show you where to mark the trousers so you can taper them properly. Turning the pants inside out exposes the old seam, which makes it easier to remove the stitches, cut the fabric, and sew the new seam."

      "title": "Pinch the edges of the pants where you want to taper them.",
      "content": "Pinch the edges of the pants where you want to taper them. Pinch along the inner seam of your pants to determine how tightly you want them to fit. Depending on the fit you want, you may need to remove a significant amount of fabric or just a little. You can also pinch the outer seam, as well, though most recommend working from the inner seam, as any mistakes will be less visible. [2] X Research source For example, if you want the tapering to begin around your knee, pinch the fabric on the inside and outside of your knee to find the best place to create a new seam."

      "title": "Pin the pants where you want your new seam to be.",
      "content": "Pin the pants where you want your new seam to be. Once you’ve found where you want to taper your pants, use pins to hold the trousers in place. Insert a sewing pin about every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) where you want to taper the pants. Keep the pins vertical (parallel to the seam), as this will make it easier to create a seam line once you take the pants off. [3] X Research source This is easier if you have someone to help you. If you don’t have pins, have a friend draw a line with chalk or a fabric pencil where you want to taper your pants. Keep your trousers pinched tightly as they do so so your line is accurate. It’s easiest to do this on just one pant leg. You can mark the other one once you take the pants off. When you insert the pins, try walking around and sitting down to make sure the new seam fits you comfortably."

      "content": "Remove the pants and mark the location of the pins. Take the pants off, being careful not to poke yourself with the pins, and lay them flat. Use a fabric pencil or a piece of fabric chalk to draw a vertical line where you inserted the pins. Once the seam has been marked, remove the pins. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Make sure the seams match up on both pant legs.",
      "content": "Make sure the seams match up on both pant legs. Fold your pants so that the marked leg lies on top of the unmarked leg. Make sure both pant legs are perfectly aligned, then reinsert the pins through both legs. Flip the pants over and use your chalk or fabric pencil to draw another vertical line along the pins. This helps ensure your seams will be equal on both legs. [5] X Research source It’s okay if you pin and mark both legs at the same time. In this case, use a ruler to make sure the distance from the edge of the pants to the chalk markings is the same. For example, if the lines are 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from the edges at the bottom of the trousers on 1 leg, they should be the same on the other leg."

      "content": "Alternatively, use a pair of tapered trousers to mark your new seam. If you have another pair of trousers that fit the way you want your untapered pair to fit, use them as a guide. Lay your untapered pants out flat, then place the tapered pants over them. Trace the outline of these pants onto the untapered pair. [6] X Research source Make sure to choose a pair of tapered trousers that fit you well. You will be replicating the fit of these pants on your trousers."

      "content": "Use a seam ripper to take out the old stitches. Keep the pants turned inside out and use a seam ripper to cut the stitches along the areas you want to taper. Run the hooked part of the seam ripper along the stitches to sever them, then gently pull the fabric apart at the seams to loosen the stitches. Pull out the severed thread with your fingers. [7] X Research source You don't have to remove all of the stitches if you are not tapering the whole leg. Just remove stitches where you want to take in the seam."

Draw another chalk line about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) from the first line on the outer edge of the pants. This will show you how much excess fabric you’ll need to remove to create the new seam.

Thread your sewing machine with a durable thread that matches the color of your trousers. The seams of your pants need to be strong, especially if you’re making them slim or skinny, so your trousers don’t rip or tear. Try using a denim thread for a strong, durable option.

      "title": "Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting.",
      "content": "Set your sewing machine to the straight stitch setting. The straight stitch is an easy stitch that is ideal for sewing seams on pant legs. It is usually the first setting on sewing machines, but check your instruction manual to be sure. Make sure that your sewing machine is set to the recommended tension and stitch length for using the straight stitch. [12] X Research source Crafting expert Daniela Gutierrez-Diaz says, “You will need to adjust the tension according to the fabric weight and how the fabrics are. Sometimes the tension, for example, is too tight or too loose, so you will need to practice a little bit with a piece of fabric.”"

      "content": "Sew a straight stitch along the first line on the fabric. Starting from the top of your chalk line, sew down toward the bottom of your pants leg. For example, if your line extends up to the knee, start sewing at the knee. If it extends up the entirety of the leg, start at the crotch. [13] X Research source Make sure to remove the pins as you go. Don’t sew over them or you may damage your sewing machine. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "Backstitch when you reach the end of the line. To backstitch , hold down the lever on the side of your sewing machine and apply gentle pressure to the pedal. This will reverse the direction of the feed dogs (gears under the needle that move the fabric) so you can sew in the opposite direction. [15] X Research source Backstitch for about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm), then release the lever and sew to the end of the line again. Backstitching will strengthen the ends of your stitches. To avoid mishaps, Beaulieu says, “Always backstitch before ending so it secures what you have just sewn, and trim your threads close to the fabric, not the needle. This will ensure you don’t have extra work to do later [and] keeps your machine set up for the next bit of stitching.”"

Repeat the same process so that both legs have the same amount of tapering. When you’re done, try the pants on to make sure they fit right and that they’re even on both sides. If the pants don’t fit how you’d like, you may have to undo the seam you just made and try again. When you’ve finished tapering your pants, Beaulieu says, “Make sure the seams have been trimmed back so the excess fabric is removed. Then, press the seam with an iron.”"

      "title": "Where should you start tapering pants?",
      "content": "Where should you start tapering pants? Where you start tapering your pants depends on where you want to take them in. For example, if you want to make the entire pant leg narrower, start at the top of the leg near the crotch. If you only want to narrow the bottom of the leg, you may want to start from the knee. [16] X Research source When sewing, start from the top of the area you want to taper and work your way down to the bottom of the pant leg."

      "title": "How much should I taper my pants?",
      "content": "How much should I taper my pants? How much you taper your pants depends on how tightly you want them to fit. However, if you taper them too much, it will distort the construction of the pants and they won’t fit properly. In general, if you’re tapering your pants yourself, do no more than 1 inch. If you want them taken in more than that, see a professional tailor. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "How long does it take to taper pants?",
      "content": "How long does it take to taper pants? The amount of time it takes to taper your own pants depends on how comfortable you are with sewing and altering clothing. Sewing a new seam on a pair of pants usually takes 10-30 minutes, including prep time like pinning and measuring, but it may take a few hours if you’re not familiar with the process. It all depends on the person. If you take your trousers to a tailor, most basic alterations, like tapering, can be completed within a day or two."

      "title": "When should you taper pants?",
      "content": "When should you taper pants? Taper pants when they’re too wide for your liking or if they look baggy when you wear them. [18] X Research source Tapering pants creates a cleaner, sharper look. However, don’t taper your own pants if you’re not confident in your sewing skills. Instead, take your trousers to a professional tailor."

      "title": "How hard is it to taper pants?",
      "content": "How hard is it to taper pants? Tapering pants is a relatively easy alteration as long as you have basic sewing skills. The biggest challenges are making sure the taper is in the right place and that the seams match on both pant legs. Certain fabrics, like leather, may also be more challenging to work with than others. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "Why do people wear tapered pants?",
      "content": "Why do people wear tapered pants? People wear tapered pants to create a sleek, sharp silhouette. The tapered look creates a clean line that can visually lengthen the legs and slim the lower body. Tapered pants can also be dressed up or down, making them the perfect option for all kinds of occasions. [20] X Research source"
