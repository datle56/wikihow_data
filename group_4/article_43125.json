[1] X Research source True, talking a lot could just be a sign he sees you as a friend, but that’s nothing to sneeze at, either. Not talking to you often, though? That’s probably a sign he’s not super invested. When you text him and get a reply from him within 10 seconds, it means that he’s eager to talk to you."

Is he breaking eye contact occasionally but smiling because he feels shy around you?

[3] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020.

Of course, if you’re standup-level hilarious, it’s a given he’s going to laugh at your jokes. To test him, crack an intentionally bad joke. If he laughs, he’s into you, babe. [4] X Research source If you want to encourage him, return the favor and laugh at his dumb jokes too. (Unless you don’t want him to like you, in which case stop being so hilarious.)"

      "content": "If he likes you, he might try to show off to catch your eye. Does he tell stories that make him look strong, funny, or adventurous? People who like you will try to make themselves seem admirable by highlighting their strengths and sharing exciting stories. Make sure to ooh and ahh when appropriate. [5] X Research source It’s possible he might even come off a little arrogant, which is a turn-off, sure, but he may be putting on airs because he’s nervous. If he’s normally pretty humble and chill, consider cutting him some slack."

If he's opening up to you about his childhood or trouble with his friends or family, then he likes you and puts stock in your perspective. But if he's opening up to you about a new girl or guy he’s crushing on, then you may have a problem. [7] X Research source On the other hand, if he brags to you about other girls flirting with him, he could be trying to make you jealous. Love, am I right?"

Telling you you’re a red-hot mama is kind of an obvious sign, but subtle compliments are indicators of attraction as well. If he tells you you look nice today or that you're interesting or funny, then he may be falling for you. Look out for nonverbal compliments too. Does he laugh at your dumb jokes (as aforementioned), smile when you turn in his direction, or light up like a Christmas tree when you walk in the room? These are all ways of saying he appreciates you."

Romance Queen Jane Austen wrote, “Is not general incivility the very essence of love?” which is just a super fancy way of saying, “If he teases you, he might be down bad, babe.” [9] X Research source Don’t take this to mean that if a guy is a jerk, he’s got the hots for you. Being rude could be a sign of affection, but if he can only show he likes you by being a jerk, he’s not worth your time. A guy who pays attention to you will also be sensitive enough to know what to tease you about and what to avoid."

      "content": "Bragging about other girls could be his way of trying to make you envious. Sure, it’s a misguided plan and very indirect, but hey, love is complicated. Talking to you about girls who flirt with him or dates he’s been on could be his way of getting your attention or trying to make you jealous so that he seems more desirable. Of course, if he’s always telling you about girls he likes or dates he’s been on, he might just see you as a friend and want to confide in you. But if he's always complaining about women he's dating or says, \"None of them are what I'm looking for,\" then he may be hinting that you're the one. Observe how he talks about other girls around you to decide how you should react : is he trying to make you jealous? Or are you getting jealous because you like him?"

If it seems like he’s always touching you—playfully pulling your hair, giving you a high-five, hugging you, putting his arm around you—there’s a pretty good sign he likes you. Even if the touches are minimal, if it happens often, it’s a good indication he wants to be close to you. [10] X Research source Notice how he sits next to you. Does he always try to move closer until your knees touch, or is he sitting miles away? Does he get physical if you're playing a friendly game of volleyball or soccer, and does he always ask you to be his partner when it's time for chicken fights in the pool? Observe how often he touches other people. Does he put his arm around everyone, or only you?"

      "content": "If his body is often angled in your direction, it could mean he wants you. Body language can tell you a lot about his true feelings; he might not even be aware of what his body is doing! Notice his body language : is his body directed towards you when you speak? Does he nod when you speak and gesture while he talks to you? If so, then he wants to give you all of his attention and is engaged in your interactions. [11] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. It’s about more than his body language when he’s speaking to you. Is he frequently facing your direction even when you’re not engaged in conversation? If his attention is focused on you, his whole body will show it: his feet and chest will be turned toward you, and he might keep his arms open, rather than crossed, to convey engagement."

All of those gifts he gives you or kind acts he goes out of his way to perform for you may indicate he’s fallen for you. [12] X Research source Is he thoughtful? Does he bring you coffee when you're having an intense study session, or get tickets for a movie you hinted that you want to see? If so, then he's probably hanging on to your every word and just wants to make you happy."

Some guys may seem like they like you, but if they act the same way toward everyone, you can assume it’s just their personality. Study how he acts around other people to see if he shows them the same behavior he shows you. If he doesn’t treat you the same way he treats others, it means you’re special. See if he's a perpetual flirt . Does he flirt with everyone in the room, or only you? You can also look for the opposite sign. Does he flirt with everyone except for you? Then maybe he’s not flirting with you because you’re the only one he likes. He may respect you too much or be too nervous to tease you."

[13] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source If he sends you a lot of emoticons when he’s texting, then he’s flirting with you.

      "content": "If all your hangouts feel like dates, that could be where his mind is at. Not only will a guy who digs you want to spend lots of one-on-one time with you, but he’ll also want to do romantic things with you in romantic places, like wine tastings at classy jazz bars, or Twilight movie marathons at the local theater (your mileage may vary). Where you hang out and what you do can tell you if he just sees you as a friend or if he wants all of your hang sessions to be more like dates. [16] X Research source Does he invite you to spend time in romantic locations like gardens, nicer wine bars, or places where you see couples hanging out for date nights? If so, then he may want to take your friendship to the dating realm. Notice when he wants to hang out as well. Is he inviting you out to brunch, or does he ask you to dinner on a Friday night? Daytime hangs aren’t necessarily red flags (who doesn’t love brunch?), but nighttime is usually more romantic."

If your friends are around when you interact with your fella, they see how he treats you and can probably give you some perspective. You may be too blinded by Cupid’s arrow to be able to see the situation clearly, but your friends probably have some solid opinions on the subject. Ask a friend to study the two of you next time you’re together and to report back. Just make sure the friend isn’t being too obvious. Tell your friends to be honest. If they don’t think he likes you, or even know that he likes someone else, then you should benefit from the truth. Ask your friends to do a little spying: if you’ve got a buddy who’s in his next class, ask them to see if he flirts with anyone in that class or if they ever hear him talking about you."

      "content": "If you’re feeling bold, ask his friends how he feels. This is a very dangerous step since there’s a chance they would run and report your question back to your crush. But if you don’t know who else to ask, or if you trust one of his friends, then casually ask how he feels about you. Though this is a riskier step, his friends will have a better answer than your friends, since they have firsthand information from your guy. This could also be a strategic move on your part: if you want him to know you like him but don’t want to tell him directly, asking his friend if he likes you could be a sneaky way to let him know how you feel since there’s a chance they’ll tell him you like him."

If you’re feeling fairly confident that the guy likes you and are tired of waiting around and reading the signs, it may be time to just tell him how you feel and ask if he feels the same way. He could be really shy and may be relieved that you’re taking the initiative. [17] X Expert Source Candice Mostisser Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 24 January 2020. Find some time to be alone with him. Make sure you don’t ask him when his friends are looking over your shoulder. Be honest and open. Just say you have a crush on him and want to know if he shares your feelings. If he doesn't feel the same way, that's fine! At least you know and can move on. You should only do this if you’re pretty sure that he likes you. If he has exhibited multiple signs of liking you, then be bold and ask him."
