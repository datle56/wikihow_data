      "content": "Bridges and roads might be damaged or blocked after an earthquake. Whether there is an official tsunami warning or you live in a tsunami hazard zone and an earthquake just happened, immediately start moving on foot. Walk or run towards safety to avoid getting stuck in a car in a dangerous location. [1] X Research source Stay away from any damaged roads, bridges, or buildings that could collapse. Try to walk on open ground as much as possible to stay extra safe."

      "content": "Tsunami hazard zones usually have signs to direct you to safety. Keep an eye out for white and blue signs that say “tsunami evacuation route” or something similar. Use them to guide you inland and out of the hazard zone to safety. [2] X Research source There are often arrows posted with these signs to show you which way to go. If not, just move from sign to sign until you see one that says you’re out of the tsunami evacuation zone."

      "title": "High ground is the safest place to be during a tsunami.",
      "content": "High ground is the safest place to be during a tsunami. If there is an earthquake and you live in a tsunami hazard zone, don’t wait for an official tsunami warning! As soon as the shaking stops and it’s safe to move, go to the nearest high ground as quickly as possible to get out of danger. [3] X Research source If you don’t live in a tsunami hazard zone, you don’t need to evacuate to high ground after an earthquake. Stay put unless there are any instructions from emergency services to leave the area."

      "title": "In some cases, you might not have time to evacuate.",
      "content": "In some cases, you might not have time to evacuate. If you don’t have time to evacuate and get to high ground, go up to a third floor or higher in a sturdy building. Even better, try to get on the roof of the tallest, sturdiest building you can find. Either of these options is better than nothing! [4] X Research source If you’re right on the coast, there might be a tall tsunami evacuation tower nearby. Look for evacuation route signs and follow them to the tower, then climb to the top. As a last resort when you can’t make it to any other type of high ground, climb a tall, sturdy tree."

      "title": "The further away from the shore you are, the less danger you’re in.",
      "content": "The further away from the shore you are, the less danger you’re in. Choose a piece of high ground that’s as far inland from the shore as you can get. If there is no high ground, just get as far inland as you can. [5] X Research source Tsunamis can travel as far as 10 mi (16 km) inland in some cases. However, the shape and slope of the shoreline affect how far they can reach."

      "title": "This can help keep you safe if you get caught by a tsunami’s waves.",
      "content": "This can help keep you safe if you get caught by a tsunami’s waves. Look for something sturdy like a tree, a door, or a life raft. Grab the object and hold on tightly while you get carried by the waves. [6] X Research source Though it may be difficult at the moment, try your best not to swallow any of the water. Tsunamis can pick up chemicals and waste that can be harmful to your health."

      "title": "Going further away from land is safer if you’re on the water in a tsunami.",
      "content": "Going further away from land is safer if you’re on the water in a tsunami. Steer your boat towards the open sea, facing the waves, and get as far out as you can. Never return to port if a tsunami warning is issued in the area. [7] X Research source Tsunami activity causes dangerous currents and water levels near the shoreline, which can capsize your boat. If you’re already docked in a harbor, get out of your boat and go inland to safety as quickly as possible."

      "title": "Tsunami activity can continue for up to 8 hours or longer.",
      "content": "Tsunami activity can continue for up to 8 hours or longer. Stay away from the coast and on high ground for this period to play it safe. Listen to announcements from officials and only move when they say it’s safe to do so. They're the ones that know best! [8] X Research source You may be stressed out and worried about loved ones, but you must stay where you are and try to remain calm. Don’t put your life at risk to try to meet up with someone in another area."

      "title": "There are certain natural warnings the ocean gives before a tsunami.",
      "content": "There are certain natural warnings the ocean gives before a tsunami. Listen for a loud roaring sound made by the ocean. A tsunami sucks coastal water seawards, watch out for the water receding abnormally far from the shoreline or for abnormally high water levels as well. [9] X Research source These things normally happen after a strong earthquake, but you might not necessarily feel it if the epicenter is far out at sea. It’s best to always be aware of your surroundings if you live on the coast in a tsunami hazard zone! It’s also important to know the signs of a coming tsunami if you’re a surfer. If you happen to be surfing near the shore and you see any of these signs, paddle to shore as fast as you can and start evacuating. If you’re surfing in deep water, paddle further out to sea as far as you can. [10] X Research source"

Listen to local radio and watch the local news to find out if there is any risk of a tsunami after an earthquake. [11] X Research source If you’re not sure about local emergency alert systems, call the non-emergency phone line for the local police or call your local government’s office and ask about them. Always follow instructions from local emergency managers in the event of a tsunami. They are your best bet for safety. Local emergency announcements also let you know when it’s safe to return home after a tsunami."

Keep an eye out for downed power lines or any other damaged electrical equipment when you’re walking home or to a shelter after a tsunami is over. Give the equipment a wide berth if you see any and don’t wade through any water that they’re touching to be extra careful! [12] X Research source Examples of other electrical equipment to avoid are electrical boxes and telephone poles."
