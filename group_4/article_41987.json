      "title": "Gather information about your claim.",
      "content": "Gather information about your claim. Before you start filing a lawsuit, get together information about the contractor you want to sue and the work they were supposed to perform. Pull out the contract you signed with the contractor, which should contain the information you need. If you didn't have a written contract with the contractor, you can still sue, but the amount of money you can get may be limited. It also may be difficult to prove the existence of an agreement to perform particular work in the absence of a written contract. Consult an attorney to discuss your options. To sue the contractor, you must use the contractor's legal name. Even if you knew the contractor by their individual name, they may have an official business name registered with your state. If that name isn't included on a written contract, search the business name directory on the website of your state's Secretary of State. Gather any invoices, receipts, or cancelled checks you have that are associated with payments you made to the contractor."

      "title": "Find out how long you have to file a lawsuit.",
      "content": "Find out how long you have to file a lawsuit. Every state has a statute of limitations that provides deadlines for filing lawsuits. Which deadline you use depends on the nature of your claim against the contractor. Look for these deadlines on the website for civil courts in your state. You could also call the small claims court clerk's office, or go to a public law library or legal self-help center at your local courthouse. If the contractor violated a written contract, you typically have several years to file your lawsuit. If you're arguing the contractor was negligent in completing the work for you, on the other hand, you may have less time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Calculate your damages.",
      "content": "Calculate your damages. The amount of damages you're claiming will determine whether you can sue the contractor in small claims court. If the amount of damages is greater than the maximum amount allowed in small claims, you'll have to file your lawsuit in civil court. One way to find out the amount of damages to which you're entitled is to go to the website of the board or agency that licenses contractors in your state. Information is also available on the state court's website, at a public law library, or at a legal self-help center. In some states, small claims courts can handle claims of up to $10,000. However, many states limit recoveries in small claims to $5,000 or less. In most cases, you can't get around this limitation by claiming less money than you're entitled to by law. If you're not eligible to sue in small claims, you can still sue in your state's civil court. The only difference is that the process is somewhat more complicated and it may take more time to resolve your issue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send a demand letter to the contractor.",
      "content": "Send a demand letter to the contractor. In some states, you're required to send a demand letter before you can file a lawsuit in small claims court. When you file your lawsuit, you may be required to provide a copy of the demand letter to the court. Particularly with contractors, your state's law may require that you give them the opportunity to fix any problems before you sue them. The board or agency that licenses contractors will have more information on these requirements. Be specific about the problem and what you want the contractor to do to resolve it. Attach any photos or documents that support your demands. Give the contractor a deadline to respond. Two weeks from the date of receipt is typically sufficient. Send the letter using certified mail with return receipt requested. That way you'll know when your letter was received."

      "title": "Get paperwork from the appropriate small claims court.",
      "content": "Get paperwork from the appropriate small claims court. You don't need an attorney to file a lawsuit in small claims court. Many states even forbid attorneys from representing clients in small claims courts. The forms to file a claim are available at the court clerk's office. Some courts also make small claims court forms available for download from the court's website. Forms can differ among courts even in the same state, so get the forms for the specific court where you're going to file your claim. Usually this is the small claims court in the county where the work was done."

      "title": "File your claim.",
      "content": "File your claim. Your small claims court forms typically include instructions on how to complete and file the required forms. You may be able to mail them in, but typically you'll need to make a trip down to the clerk's office to file your forms in person. Pay the filing fee, typically under $100. If you can't afford the filing fee, ask the court clerk if you can apply for a fee waiver. The court may waive your fees if you have a low income, or if you receive certain types of public assistance, such as AFDC or food stamps."

      "title": "Have the contractor served.",
      "content": "Have the contractor served . The contractor must know that you've filed a lawsuit against them so they have the opportunity to respond. Hire a sheriff or private process server to deliver the court papers to the contractor. You'll have to pay a small fee to have the contractor served, typically around $20. Sheriff's departments in some areas waive this fee if you've been granted a fee waiver by the courts. The contractor will receive a summons to appear in court, as well as a copy of your claim. You will be notified when the contractor has been served with those papers."

      "title": "Appear on the date of your hearing.",
      "content": "Appear on the date of your hearing. Organize your court papers along with any documents or photos you want to show the court to back up your claim. Take these with you to your court date. If you don't show up on the date of your hearing, the court will dismiss your claim. Small claims court is less formal than civil court, but you should still dress in neat, conservative clothing. The clerk's office may have information on appropriate court dress and conduct. Take a seat in the gallery and step forward when your name is called. If the contractor doesn't show up on the court date, you may win your claim by default. In some courts, you still must prove to the judge that you're entitled to the specific amount of money you've claimed."

      "title": "Verify your suit doesn't qualify for small claims.",
      "content": "Verify your suit doesn't qualify for small claims. Filing a law suit in civil court is time-consuming and expensive. In most cases, you'll get quicker relief by suing the contractor in small claims court. Generally, your total claim must be below a specific dollar amount to be eligible for small claims court. In some states this is only a few thousand dollars, but in others it can be as much as $10,000. Usually you can only sue for money in small claims court. If you want the contractor to do something, you may have to file your lawsuit in civil court. For example, suppose the contractor did work on your house that they promised was up to code. Later, your house failed inspection. You would typically have to sue the contractor in civil court, rather than small claims, if you wanted them to come back and do the work necessary to bring it up to code."

      "content": "Identify the correct court. In most cases, if you want to sue a contractor in civil court, you'll use the court in the county where the work was done. You may have to use a different court, however, if the contractor is located in another county or out of state. The name of the court to use differs among states, but you're looking for the lowest civil court level. It may be called the county court or the district court. You'll almost always sue a contractor in state court. You can't use federal court for these kinds of cases unless the contractor is located in a different state and you're asking for more than $75,000 in damages. [2] X Research source"

Most civil courts have forms you can use if you've decided to file the lawsuit on your own without representation. [3] X Research source Through the complaint, set forth the facts of the dispute that you believe constitute a violation of state law. A lawsuit against a contractor typically alleges either that the contractor breached their contract with you in some way, or that they were negligent in completing the work.

Hire a sheriff's deputy or private process server to deliver the court papers to the contractor. The fee to have the documents served is typically around $20. Once service is complete, file your proof of service document with the court. Sometimes the sheriff's deputy will take care of filing this document for you, but ask beforehand. In addition to serving the contractor, you may also have to serve a copy of the forms on the licensing board or agency in your state. That board or agency will have information on whether they must be served. If the contractor was bonded and you want to go against the bond, have the court papers served on the company that holds the bond. Contact information for the bond company should be included in your work contract."

[5] X Research source Through this process, both you and the contractor gather evidence and information about the case. You may have formal interviews of the contractor and their employees. The contractor (or their attorney) may interview you as well. These interviews are called \"depositions,\" and take place under oath with a court reporter present to transcribe the proceedings. You also may request documents from the contractor, including contracts and records related to your dispute."

At trial, a judge or jury will listen to both you and the contractor, along with any witnesses you call. [6] X Research source Organize all of the documents, photos, and other evidence you want to use in trial. If you've never been to a civil trial before, go to the court house and watch one so you can gain familiarity with court conduct and procedures. Often, civil cases are settled at some point during the discovery process. The contractor may make a calculated decision that it's better to pay you at least some of what you've demanded rather than facing the uncertainty of trial."
