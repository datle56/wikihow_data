However, some plans require you to send in a letter from your doctor stating that your treatment is medically necessary. Check your insurance benefits or talk to your insurance provider to find out what they cover. If your insurance requires pre-authorization, ask your doctor to fill out the template, then send it into your insurance. If you get insurance through work or school, you may need to ask your employer or school to remove exclusions against transgender treatments before you can get coverage.
