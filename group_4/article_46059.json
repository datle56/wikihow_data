      "content": "Add a drop of fragrance oil to a light bulb. Apply by soaking a cotton ball in your choice of fragrance oils. When you turn the light bulb on, the oil will heat. As it heats, it will start to evaporate and scent your room. Be careful not to add too much oil to a cold light bulb, or the scent may be too strong. Experiment with different oils to find the one you prefer. Different occasions may call for different oils. Avoid getting oil on the base that screws into the light socket. Also avoid putting oil on incandescent or halogen light bulbs because they can get very hot and burn. Your light bulb may have a shorter lifespan as a result. If you have a radiator, that may be a more suitable place for the oil."
