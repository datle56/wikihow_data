  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Check for any instructions from the employer.",
      "content": "Check for any instructions from the employer. The employer may want specific information in the subject line of your email. If the job listing includes instructions for what to include in the subject line, follow those instructions rather than creating a subject line from scratch. [2] X Research source Often employers provide a specific formula for the subject line because they have programmed email filters to catch emails from people applying for a specific job. If you don't follow the employer's formula, your email may be overlooked."
    },
    {
      "title": "List your name and the position you're applying for.",
      "content": "List your name and the position you're applying for. Start your subject line with the word \"résumé\" or \"CV.\" Then check the job listing to get the exact name the employer uses for the position, including any identification numbers. Type your first and last name as the last element of your subject line. [3] X Research source Copy the specific job title, rather than using a generic description such as \"entry-level position\" or \"manager.\" Use your full first and last name in the subject line. Nicknames or shortened names are not appropriate at this stage. If you have an interview , you can let the recipient know what you prefer to be called."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate elements with hyphens or colons.",
      "content": "Separate elements with hyphens or colons. Minimal punctuation keeps your subject line neat and easy to read. Avoid using more than one type of punctuation if at all possible. Make the parts of your subject line flow in a logical way. [4] X Research source For example, you might use \"CV – Product Developer – Marco Diaz.\" Another subject line format that works is \"CV: Marco Diaz for Product Developer.\" You can also flip these elements around and write \"Marco Diaz CV: Product Developer.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Type your subject line in title case.",
      "content": "Type your subject line in title case. Using all caps in your subject line may seem like a good way to get the recipient's attention, but it's seen as shouting and sends a bad impression. Capitalize all nouns and verbs in your subject line, and put anything else in lower-case. [5] X Research source For example, you might use \"Marco Diaz for Product Developer: CV Attached.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Research the recipient of the email.",
      "content": "Research the recipient of the email. If you know the name of the recipient, search them online and get information on their background and professional experience. You may find ways that you can make your subject line stand out by appealing to them directly. [6] X Research source If the recipient has a LinkedIn account , this can be a good place to find information on their professional background. Reading any articles the recipient has written will also help you prepare for the interview or give you information to add in a follow-up email."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a common connection, if possible.",
      "content": "Include a common connection, if possible. If you know someone who works for that employer, or if someone recommended you apply for the job, mention their name in your subject line. This will help you stand out from other applicants. [7] X Research source For example, you might use \"CV Recommended by Star Butterfly: Marco Diaz for Product Developer.\" If someone recommended you for the position, put that information at the beginning of the subject line. You want it to be the first thing the recipient reads."

    {
      "title": "Add your top qualification for the position.",
      "content": "Add your top qualification for the position. Generally, you want to keep your subject line brief. However, if there's something special about your background or experience that makes you uniquely qualified for the position, briefly point it out in the subject line. [8] X Research source For example, you might write \"CV: Marco Diaz for Product Developer, 20 Years Experience.\""

      "title": "Proofread your subject line carefully.",
      "content": "Proofread your subject line carefully. While you may already know to proofread your email, the subject line often gets overlooked. This can be a serious mistake because the subject line is the first (maybe only) thing the recipient will see. [9] X Research source Make sure there are no spelling mistakes or typos. Double-check proper names – even your own – to make sure they're spelled correctly."

      "title": "Use a specific name if possible.",
      "content": "Use a specific name if possible. Check the job listing or the company's website to see if there's a specific person you're submitting your résumé or CV to. If you can't find a specific name, leave the name off entirely and start your email with a basic greeting, such as \"Hello.\" [10] X Research source Traditional letter-writing salutations can seem stiff and overly formal in emails. Instead of typing \"Dear Mr. Marley,\" try \"Hello Jacob Marley.\""

      "content": "Explain briefly why you're writing. Start your email with a sentence clearly stating that you are applying for the job title you listed in your subject line. If applicable, let the person know where you saw the job listed. If someone recommended you for the position, include that in your first sentence as well.

      "content": "Include more detail if you're not attaching a formal cover letter. If the job listing requests a résumé or CV and cover letter, write a separate cover letter and attach it to the email along with your résumé or CV. However, if the job listing doesn't specify a cover letter, you may want to include the same sort of information in your email that you would in a formal cover letter. Follow the same guidelines you would if writing a cover letter to print on paper. Try to keep the full letter to under a page, using active, direct language to describe your skills and experience. Keep in mind that the recipient may be reading your email on a computer, or on a mobile phone or other mobile device. Use short paragraphs of 3 to 4 words to make your email easier to skim."

You can also use a .rtf file, although some of your formatting may be lost with that file type. [18] X Research source PDF is typically the best format to use for your résumé or CV because the contents of the file can't be accidentally changed or deleted. If you're also sending a formal cover letter, attach it as a separate document in the same file format as your résumé or CV. Save the file with a unique name that includes your first and last name. For example, you might use \"Hamilton Alexander Resume.pdf.\""
