      "content": "Change the water for a few days before moving. Some of the water in your aquarium should be changed prior to moving and transporting the aquarium. This helps ensure that the water in the tank is clean. Switch out 20 percent of the water in the aquarium daily for five days prior to transporting the aquarium. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid feeding your fish for one to two days before moving.",
      "content": "Avoid feeding your fish for one to two days before moving. When you are travelling, you don’t want your fish to mess up the water more than they have to. Fish can go around a week without food, so they will be fine during your move. Don’t give them food for 24 to 48 hours prior to transporting them. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Plan for transporting your fish.",
      "content": "Plan for transporting your fish. Unlike some pets, you can’t just put a fish tank or fish bowl in the car and go. Instead, you need to figure out how you will transport them. Most fish can survive for around 48 hours of travel, but beyond that you increase the risk that they will not survive. [3] X Research source When you stop for the night, you need to take the fish with you. Don’t leave them unattended in cars or trailers. If you need to fly with your fish, contact the airline to find out what requirements they have for transporting fish."

    {
      "title": "Wait until the last possible moment to pack the fish.",
      "content": "Wait until the last possible moment to pack the fish. You shouldn’t pack the fish until you are ready to go. They shouldn’t be packed and waiting to be transported. You want to take as little time as possible to transport your fish. [4] X Research source You should also plan to unpack your fish as soon as you reach your destination. They should be the first thing you unpack."

      "title": "Avoid unnecessary travel with your fish.",
      "content": "Avoid unnecessary travel with your fish. Fish are not pets that are easily transported. You shouldn’t take them on vacation with you or carry them around in a vehicle for fun. Fish are very fragile, which means you should only transport them when it is absolutely necessary, like when you are moving. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your fish in plastic bags.",
      "content": "Place your fish in plastic bags. One way to transport your fish is to put them in plastic bags. You can get plastic fish bags from a pet store. Fill the bag a third of the way full with water from the aquarium. Then, place one fish into each plastic bag. Don’t put multiple fish in the same bag. [6] X Research source Place a second bag over the first bag so that it is extra protected. This helps in case the bag leaks. Use a rubber band to secure the bags so the fish and water cannot get out. If you are going to have the fish in bags for longer than an hour, get some pure oxygen from your local pet store to place in the bags with them."

      "content": "Transport the fish in five-gallon buckets. A five-gallon bucket can be an easy way to transport multiple fish in the same container. Make sure you buy a new bucket and don’t use one that has had chemicals inside them. The bucket may have residual chemicals, which may kill or harm your fish. Make sure to cover the bucket with a water tight lid. [7] X Research source Fill the bucket with water from your tank."

      "title": "Put the fish in a container.",
      "content": "Put the fish in a container. Another way you can transport your fish is in a sturdy container that has a lid. Fill the container with water from the tank. Make sure the lid is secure so your fish doesn’t fall out and water doesn’t leak out. [8] X Research source This may be good for fish with sharp fins or who may get out of a plastic bag."

      "title": "Transport the aquarium if it is small.",
      "content": "Transport the aquarium if it is small. Small tanks can be moved with the fish and water in it. Large tanks should never be moved as a unit. If you move the aquarium with water and fish, make sure to remove all other objects. Take out all rocks, decorations, and filters. These may come loose and hurt your fish. You should also remove some of the water. This helps reduce the risk of spillage, along with giving your fish less room to be bounced around. [9] X Research source However, even small tanks can be difficult to move. They are very heavy, but also fragile. If you drop the tank and it breaks, you may lose all of your fish. Tanks that are moved with water in them are more likely to get chipped or cracked."

      "title": "Transport your fish in an insulated, secure container.",
      "content": "Transport your fish in an insulated, secure container. If you have placed your fish in a bag or small containers, you should pack them in a secure carrier. Place bubble wrap between the fish bag and the container or other fish bags. Make sure they are sturdy so they don’t roll around. This can cause damage to your fish. [10] X Research source If you have an insulated container, consider transporting your fish in it. A picnic cooler or styrofoam cooler will be great for this."

They don’t need a ton of room, but they should be comfortable. You should also make sure the container is large enough that the water has enough oxygen for the fish. [11] X Research source You should only fill the container around a third of the way full. The rest of the container should be open for oxygen."

Fill your transport container with water from the top of the tank. This water is the cleanest.

Any fluctuations in water temperature can cause your fish to get sick. Try to keep your fish’s water the same temperature of their normal aquarium. This means you should transport them in the part of your vehicle where you can use the air conditioner or heater. [16] X Research source You can also use insulation to the transportation container. This can help regulate the temperature. Check the fish’s temperature to make sure it doesn’t get too hot or too cold."

      "content": "Place your fish in a dark place. Transporting the fish in a darker state can help keep them from getting too stressed. Fish are active and awake during the day when it is bright outside. At night, they are less active. Place something over the fish if they are in a container where they can get light during the day. [17] X Research source For example, you may place a sheet or rug over the container."

      "content": "Avoid feeding your fish during travel. Travel is very stressful for your fish, so you don’t want to do anything to cause more stress. Don’t worry about opening bags or containers to feed your fish. This also helps reduce the need for elimination, which can make the water it is traveling in dirty. [18] X Research source"

You may also want to use a net to move them from the bucket to the tank. [19] X Research source If you transported your fish in bags, place the bags on top of the water and let them float. This helps regulate the temperature of the water in the bags. When the temperature of the water in both are similar, you can pour the fish into the tank."

This water should be gotten from the top of the tank, not near the bottom. This limits the amount of waste you take with you. [20] X Research source"
