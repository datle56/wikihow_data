With each album, Taylor Swift embodies a particular aesthetic, known to fans as \"eras.\" These eras come with their own distinct colors, outfits, sounds, and vibes. Basically, an album release means more than new music; it means an entirely new world for fans to become immersed in. The reputation era (which corresponded with her sixth studio album, reputation ) is arguably Swift’s most dramatic and transformative era, as it saw her emerging from a year of silence with a new, unapologetic attitude and darker aesthetic. The bright red lips and high-waisted skirts of the 1989 era (Swift’s fifth studio album) were replaced with dark burgundy lips, ripped jeans, and snake skin. Aesthetic: The color black, snakes, tabloids, smoke, knee-high boots Timespan: November 2017 to August 2019. A lyric from reputation that sums up the era: The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now / Why? Oh, ‘cause she’s dead (“Look What You Made Me Do,” reputation )."

While there are overarching themes of love, the album is a composition of personalities, defining the term “reputation” itself. The songs on reputation depict the personas Swift has been given, as well as who she truly is (fans call this the “ half album theory ” ). As Swift told Rolling Stone Magazine, “Creating reputation felt different to any other album I’ve ever made because it felt a lot less fragmented in its storytelling. It was about a journey, from one emotional place to another…I wanted it to sound like losing something you thought you wanted, and in the end, gaining something you really needed.” At the end of the day, reputation is an exploration into a person’s image and how the words of others can negatively and positively affect it."

Gone are the nostalgic synth-pop beats, and in their place are heart-racing beats, choir-like harmonies, and aggressive lyrics.

While not congruent, reputation is a lyrical retelling of the events leading up to Swift’s disappearance from the public eye. Swift may not ever disclose the full meaning behind her songs, but fans and critics speculate that much of the album is in response to the backlash Swift endured after “Famous” came out. In “Look What You Made Me Do,” Swift sings: I don’t like your little games / Don’t like your titled stage . This is believed to be a direct reference to Ye’s 2016 Saint Pablo Tour, where he performed on a floating stage. In “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things,” Swift sings: This is why we can’t have nice things, darling / Because you break them / I had to take them away . This is most likely a reference to her on-again, off-again friendship with Ye and Kardashian. In “I Did Something Bad,” Swift opens with: I never trust a narcissist.

The album proved to be an immediate success, despite some disbelief that Swift would ever be able to recover from the backlash from “Famous.” Here is what leading critics had to say back in 2017: [26] X Research source “‘Reputation’ is fundamentally unlike any of her other albums in that it takes into account — prioritizes, actually — the tempo and tone of her competition. ‘Reputation’ is a public renegotiation, engaging pop music on its terms, not hers…She still has adversaries in her sight; there are jabs at Kanye West, and also at an ex-boyfriend or two. But here, too, she turns the magnifying glass around. Some of the most caustic and aware songwriting on this album is about herself.” - The New York Times “Swift is a smart cookie. She’s smart enough to write lyrics far better and wittier than the average pop fare…And she’s certainly too smart to put all her eggs in one basket…there’s more to Taylor Swift than dropping hints and creating drama.” - The Guardian “The world was expecting ‘Reputation’ to be a celebrity self-pity party, after her September single ‘Look What You Made Me Do,’ airing her grievances about getting mistreated by other famous people…Instead, she’s playing for bigger emotional stakes – this is an album full of one-on-one adult love songs.” - Rolling Stone “‘Reputation’ is largely a look at an artist in love, and not the kind of flash-in-the-pan romance or tragic heartbreak that populated her previous releases. For the first time in her career, Swift has written an album about a successful relationship, while she’s still in it, finally sharing the story of the new relationship that she’s so fiercely kept away from the cameras.” - USA Today"
