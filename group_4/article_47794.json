      "content": "Every couple fights from time to time—it’s just a fact of life. When you start getting into small arguments with your partner, it can feel like fighting is all that you’re doing. Take a step back and examine the subject of the fights. If you two are getting cranky at each other about the dishes or who’s going to walk the dog, these little fights probably don’t mean you should break up. By improving communication and talking about your expectations upfront, you can stop fighting and instead have healthy, productive conversations.

      "content": "This means little to no yelling (and definitely no name-calling). All couples fight, but that doesn’t mean you have to get mean or nasty with your partner. Think about the most recent fights you two have had: were they calm and productive, or did they blow up into a 3-day ordeal? If you and your partner can keep love in the forefront of your mind when you fight, your relationship is worth holding onto. If your partner yells at you or calls you names when you fight, you may want to end your relationship . Healthy partnerships involve respect, even when you two are fighting.

      "content": "You don’t feel like you have to keep tabs on your partner all the time. Sure, you might call and check in on them if you haven’t heard from them in a while, but with a solid foundation of trust, you won’t feel the need to track their location or who they’re with. Healthy relationships are built on trust, and if you have that, your relationship can definitely be saved. [4] X Research source Unfortunately, if your partner has betrayed your trust in the past, it can be hard to get that foundation back. Consider working with a couple’s counselor to rebuild that trust with each other."

As long as you have at least 1 thing that you like to do together, it’s worth trying to work on the relationship , since the connection is still there. [5] X Research source If you two don’t have a favorite activity that you like doing together, try something new as a couple! Take a pottery class together or go hiking for the first time. You might just find a fun activity to bring that spark back into your relationship."

Or are you only thinking about how they’ve hurt your feelings or made your life worse? If you’re still holding onto that loving, caring feeling, then it’s worth talking to your partner before making any rash decisions. [6] X Research source On the other hand, if those feelings of love and care for your partner are completely gone, it may be time to end things.

      "content": "As you drive home from work, you hope to see their car in the driveway. A lot of couples headed for a breakup report that they found ways to actively avoid their partner, like staying late at work or taking the long way home. If you look forward to coming home from a long day and giving your partner a hug, your relationship is probably worth holding onto. [8] X Research source Avoiding your partner usually points to deeper issues, which is why it’s a red flag.

This isn’t always true (sometimes your friends and family have terrible taste in partners), but if your loved ones are telling you to hang onto the relationship, you may want to believe them. This is especially true if you’ve shared some of the details of your relationship with a person close to you. [9] X Research source If you’ve talked about some of your issues with your partner and your friends and family are telling you to leave them, it may be time to rethink the relationship. Again, the decision is always your own to make, but loved ones can help us see things from an outside perspective."

Studies show that expressing your gratitude to your partner is one of the most important things you can be doing (it might be even more important than expressing your love for them). If your partner still thanks you for the things that you bring to the table, hang onto that relationship. [11] X Research source Gratitude is also something that can be worked on. If you feel like your partner is taking you for granted, sit down with them and express your feelings. Your partner might not realize that they haven’t said thank you in a while, so let them know."
