      "content": "You’re biologically hardwired. Some studies suggest that younger people have an evolutionary pull toward older men. Some of this relates to genetics—theoretically, older men have higher status and more resources at their disposal. Because of this, you might be drawn to physical features that signal this status.

      "content": "You crave stability. Most people spend their younger years figuring themselves and their lives out.

Success can make you feel protected in a relationship—like if you needed help, he could take care of you. Specifically, you might like: [2] X Research source That he’s super successful in his career.

Less insecurity means less of a chance that he’s threatened by your success. He might be more likely to support and celebrate your career. Understand his role in a healthy relationship. An older man has been in great relationships and bad ones. He knows what he needs to do to make this relationship a great one."

      "content": "You’re tired of men your own age. After tons of bad dates with immature guys, it makes sense that you’d be looking for greener pastures. If you’re suddenly only interested in older men, it could be because you’re turned off by bad experiences with dates your own age. Subconsciously, you might be looking for a way to avoid the same heartbreak or frustrations.

If you’re attracted to older men, you might just like that they know exactly what to do and exactly how to do it. After years of practicing their moves, pleasing their partners, and reflecting on their own sexual desires, your older crush might just be exceptional between the sheets. That makes total sense!

Because of this, they might be more likely to make serious commitments, unlike younger men. [6] X Research source So if you’re ready to get married or to start a family, it makes sense that you’d be attracted to people who want the same thing. Oftentimes, shared relationships are what makes a relationship built to last. So you're starting with a great foundation! Older men are also more likely to already have kids themselves. You might be attracted to this, too. Maybe you love how much he cares for his little ones. That's a sweet quality!"

      "content": "The attraction might be mutual, so it happens naturally. Maybe, when you think back, it's not always you pursuing older crushes. Studies show that when older men get divorced, they tend to seek out younger partners. So in that case, it not might be that you're especially attracted to older men. Instead, they might be seeking you out—and because for you, the attraction happens to be mutual, you're ending up in age-gap romances. [7] X Research source"

You might just love the idea of flowers on a first date, car doors held open, and sweet, traditional romance. Older guys who grew up in a different generation may be more capable of giving you this. In short, maybe it's not that you're especially attracted to older men; more so, you're attracted to their style of romance. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "If you’re worried about other people’s opinions: remember that you don’t owe anyone any explanations. This is about you, your life, and your relationship—and even though age gap relationships are more likely to receive annoying questions and critiques, remind yourself that your opinion is the only one that really matters. [9] X Research source When people share unwelcomed opinions, try this: Explain that it’s not their business: “This is my relationship, not yours. I don’t pass judgment on your love life, so why do you feel so comfortable doing that to me?” Shift their focus to a positive: “I get that you don’t like our age gap, but he loves me and treats me well. Doesn’t that make you feel happy for me?” Set a boundary and change the subject: “To be honest, I don’t want to hear your opinion on this in the future. Let’s talk about something new.”"

Older men might be more likely to be married or in poor health—in short, there are less eligible bachelors within your preferred age range. That’s okay! Just keep looking, know your worth, and don’t waste time on someone who can’t—or won’t—provide the relationship you want. And in most cases, married men especially can’t do that for you. [10] X Research source The dating pool is a little smaller in this age range, but that doesn’t mean that your dream guy isn’t out there, waiting to be found. Don’t give up!"

If you’re dating a man in his 50s or 60s and he’s still totally unsure, that might be a bit of a red flag. Have an open discussion about what you two are looking for and if it’s not compatible, do your best to move on. [11] X Research source When you start to develop feelings for him, open up a discussion: “Hey, I wanted to talk about what we’re both looking for here, because I’m starting to like you.” Ask him what he’s looking for: “I want something serious eventually. It doesn’t have to be right now, but do you think that’s where this is headed?” Reflect on his response. Is there a compromise here, or is this not worth pursuing? Discuss with a friend or try journaling if you need more clarity."

In most serious relationships, some level of finances are shared—if he doesn’t have any interest in doing this, ask him to be honest about why that is. [12] X Research source If it’s lack of trust or a sign that he’s not serious, consider moving on. For instance, let’s say you’re engaged, but he’s asking you to sign a brutal prenup. Investigate further: “Why is it so important to you that I’m shut off from your finances?” Ask him whether or not he trusts you and takes you seriously enough to truly share a life together. Then, decide whether or not the relationship can continue. Trust your gut—if he says no, ask yourself if that’s something you can handle down the line."

If you’re having trouble sticking to a younger age range, consciously enter the dating scene with these qualities in mind. When you go on a date with a younger man , look for signs that he has the traits that you’re looking for. [13] X Research source After a few dates, ask him what he’s looking for in his romantic life. Does he want kids or marriage down the line? Does he have his life together generally? Is he on a solid career path? Is he a straight shooter, or does he play games?"
