      "content": "Test the thickness of the cornstarch mixture. Make sure it’s sufficient for thickening. You can test it simply by spooning out some of the mixture and pouring it slowly back into the bowl. Or, you can add it to a small portion of a soup or sauce to see what it does.

      "title": "Add a cooked cornstarch mixture to liquids for more control.",
      "content": "Add a cooked cornstarch mixture to liquids for more control. Cooking the cornstarch first and then adding it to the mixture is an easy way to thicken a syrup , sauce or soup if you’ve found that it isn’t thick enough. Cooking the cornstarch mixture alone isn’t really any different than cooking it with the mixture. You should essentially follow the same instructions. The only difference is that you pour the cornstarch mixture into an empty pot and then add it to the liquid after it has started to bubble. After cooking the cornstarch mixture, add it to a heated up liquid. You have more control because you can as little or as much mixture to the liquid as you’d like."

      "content": "Turn the stove to a medium heat setting. Add the cornstarch mixture to a liquid that has been thoroughly stirred and simmering. Turn up the setting to a medium heat setting because the cornstarch mixture will thicken the best when it is lightly boiling. Using too much heat, however, can thin out and break down the sauce. [8] X Research source If you are only cooking the cornstarch mixture, you should pour it in a pan and turn it to medium heat."
