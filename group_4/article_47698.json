      "content": "Learn the history behind the brown scapular and the promises it brings. The brown scapular is believed to work because Simon Stock, the superior general of the Carmelites in 1251, prayed to the Virgin Mary for help and protection and in return she gave him a scapular. She promised that it was a safeguard and that if he died while wearing it, he wouldn't suffer everlasting fire. Many Catholics are said to have been given a second chance at redemption or saved from hell because of their scapular. For example, it's said that a priest who was shot at during a Mass was saved by his brown scapular because the bullets were embedded in it. Wearing the brown scapular means that if you are dying and have sinned, the Virgin Mary will help you absolve your sins so you die in a state of grace."

      "content": "Hide the scapular under your clothes so it’s not visible. While it’s not necessary for the brown scapular to be touching your skin for it to work, it should be under your shirt or other clothing so it’s not immediately visible. Situate the two woolen ends under your clothing, but don’t worry if the strings are visible near your neck. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid pinning or fastening the scapular to yourself.",
      "content": "Avoid pinning or fastening the scapular to yourself. Wearing the brown scapular in any other way besides around your neck won’t give you any of the promises it holds. If your scapular is worn out or breaks, it’s best to replace it with a new one. A worn out brown scapular should be buried or burned because it’s a sacred object. Never put a brown scapular in the trash."
