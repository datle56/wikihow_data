If your cat is scratching its ears a lot, if you spot signs of infection, or if the cat's itching has caused it to injure itself, then it needs veterinary care. Make an appointment with your veterinarian and take the cat in. Discuss the cat's symptoms with the veterinarian and allow them to do an exam. After the vet does the exam, discuss your cat's diagnosis. Itchy ears can have a variety of causes, including ear mites , ear infections, and polyps or growths.

      "content": "Have the cat's ears cleaned . Your veterinarian may suggest that the cat get its ears cleaned at the veterinary office or by you at home. If you are told to clean them at home, your veterinarian should give you very clear instructions and they should provide you with cleaner or the name of a product they recommend. Use a specific cleaner made for cats’ ears. Clean very carefully, as cleaning that is too rough can damage the cat's eardrums or inner ear. Never stick a cotton swab or any other item into your cat’s ear canal. Don’t clean your cat’s ears before taking it to the vet. The vet may need to get a sample of the discharge to determine the cause of the itching. In some cases, cleaning the cat's ears will remove the dirt and debris that was causing irritations, and thus will be all that is needed to treat the itching."

      "content": "Watch for excessive scratching. Cats normally scratch their ears to ease minor itches or irritations. They may also rub on their ears as they clean them, licking their paws and then rubbing their paws on their ears. However, there is a difference between itching normally and excessive itching.

      "content": "Decide what type of care your cat needs. If your cat has a little bit of waxy build up or grime in its ears, but they seem otherwise healthy, then you may simply choose to clean your cat's ears . Once the cat's ears are cleaned, you should then keep a watchful eye on whether the itching persists. However, if your cat has injured itself with its itching, or there is evidence that your cat may have some sort of ear disease, then it should be seen by a veterinarian. Cats are very good at hiding discomfort and pain. Just because you do not notice any behavioral changes or signs of unhappiness, that does not mean that your cat doesn't need veterinary care."
