      "title": "Measure the long side of the box to see how much paper you need.",
      "content": "Measure the long side of the box to see how much paper you need. Using a ruler or measuring tape, measure one of the longer sides of the gift box. Then, measure how tall the gift box is and multiply this number by 2. Add these measurements together to get the length you’ll need to cut the wrapping paper in order to wrap the box without tape. [1] X Research source If you’re wrapping a square box, you can measure any of the sides since they are all the same length."

      "title": "Cut the wrapping paper in a square to size.",
      "content": "Cut the wrapping paper in a square to size. Using your measurements, cut the wrapping paper so that all 4 sides measure the length needed to cover the longest sides of the box. Even if the gift box is rectangular, you’ll need to cut the wrapping paper in a large square to make the folds more even. [2] X Research source You are essentially cutting the wrapping paper into a very large piece of origami paper, which is almost always square."

      "title": "Place the gift box facing down on top of the wrapping paper.",
      "content": "Place the gift box facing down on top of the wrapping paper. First, lay the wrapping paper out on a flat surface, making sure the decorative side is facing down. Then, place the gift box in the middle of the wrapping paper with the top of the box facing down. Finally, turn the gift box so that the corners of the wrapping paper are aligned with the middle of the corresponding side of the gift box. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold one of the long flaps over the gift box.",
      "content": "Fold one of the long flaps over the gift box. If you’re wrapping a rectangular box, first fold the corresponding flap over one of the longer sides so that the corner of the wrapping paper lays on top of the box in the middle. If you’re wrapping a square box, you can fold any of the flaps up first. Run your finger along the edge to make a crease and smooth out the fold so it’ll stay in place better. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift the 2 side flaps and fold them over the top.",
      "content": "Lift the 2 side flaps and fold them over the top. Lay your hand underneath one of the flaps on either the left or right side of the box. Lift the paper up to fold the flap over the edge of the box, laying it on top of the flap you’ve already folded. [5] X Research source Run your finger along the edge to make a crease and keep the flap in place. Repeat this process to fold the other side flap on top of the first flap as well. If the folded-in flaps won’t stay in place, you may need to use a paper weight or heavy item, such as a book, to temporarily hold them in place. The side flaps should meet in the middle of the box, creating a “v” shape. They can meet in the middle exactly or overlap slightly – either way will work fine."

      "title": "Fold the final flap up over the top of the box.",
      "content": "Fold the final flap up over the top of the box. The flap should lay on top of the 3 flaps you’ve already folded up. Run your finger along the edge to crease the paper at the fold and smooth it out. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Tuck the corner of the final flap under the side flaps.",
      "content": "Tuck the corner of the final flap under the side flaps. Hold the final flap down flat on top of the box, noting where the flap meets the edges of the side flaps. Lift the final flap slightly and fold it over so the crease lines up right where the flap meets the edges of the side flaps. Then, use your fingers to tuck the folded corner of the final flap under the side flaps, pushing it back towards itself. [7] X Research source Once the flap is securely tucked under, your present should stay wrapped on its own. If the wrapping paper puckers at all, run your finger along all the edges again to flatten the creases even more."

      "title": "Tie a ribbon around the present to hold the wrapping paper in place.",
      "content": "Tie a ribbon around the present to hold the wrapping paper in place. Lay a piece of ribbon out on a flat surface. Wrap the present as you normally would while making the creases in the edges sharp so that the paper holds in place while you work. Place the box on the ribbon in the middle so the top faces down. Fold the ribbon pieces on either side over the box, twisting them up around each other in the middle. Then, wrap the ribbon down around the other sides. Flip the box and pull the ribbons to meet in the middle, then secure them with a bow. [8] X Research source You might need another person to help you hold the wrapping paper in place until you can secure it with a ribbon. Instead of ribbon, you can also use twine or string. After tying the package with a ribbon, consider tucking foraged plant foliage under it, adding a pom pom, a tassel or a handmade clay tag."

      "title": "Apply stickers along the edges to secure the wrapping in place.",
      "content": "Apply stickers along the edges to secure the wrapping in place. Choose a set of at least 3 holiday or theme appropriate stickers. Wrap the gift as you normally would, using the stickers to securing the paper in place right where you would generally use tape. [9] X Research source Add some additional stickers on the top of the gift to make it more decorative and fun. If the stickers you’re using are small or not very sticky, you’ll likely need to use more on the sides to hold the paper in place."

    {
      "title": "Use glue to secure the wrapping in place of tape.",
      "content": "Use glue to secure the wrapping in place of tape. Cut your wrapping paper to size while adding a few extra inches on each side so the paper will overlap. Place the box on top of the paper, then fold up 2 opposite sides first. Lay one side down flat and put a dab of glue in the center along the edge. Immediately press the other flap on top and hold it in place for about 10 seconds. Then, fold and wrap up each of the sides of the gift, securing with glue in the same manner. [10] X Research source Let the glue dry completely before giving your gift away. Using a hot glue gun will likely work best for thicker wrapping paper. A glue stick or regular tube of glue will likely work on thinner wrapping paper, however."

      "title": "Paint nail polish along the edges to hold the paper in place.",
      "content": "Paint nail polish along the edges to hold the paper in place. Wrap the gift as you normally would with wrapping paper. Then, as you fold up each of the flaps, paint nail polish along the edge of the paper that lays on top. Hold it in place for about 2 minutes to give the polish time to dry. [11] X Research source If you want it to be invisible, you can use clear nail polish, or a polish in the same color as the wrapping paper. Add a bit of extra décor to your gift with a glitter, glow-in-the-dark, or colorful polish. [12] X Research source"
