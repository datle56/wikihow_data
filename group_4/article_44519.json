      "content": "Use steroid creams. Topical treatments, such as creams, are the first thing you should try when it comes to treating eczema. Corticosteroid creams can help reduce itching resulting from eczema. In a clinical study, 80% of respondents reported that their eczema or dermatitis responded well to hydrocortisone. Ask your doctor if you should use a corticosteroid cream or an ointment to treat eczema. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Eczema Association Nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of those with eczema through research and education Go to source Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream or you can try an over-the-counter product, such as a 1% hydrocortisone cream. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If using an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, use it two to three times per day for seven days. If you fail to see improvement or an abatement of itching in seven days, discontinue use and call your doctor. [4] X Research source Ask your doctor if you need prescription steroids. They are much stronger and more effective than 1% hydrocortisone. If you are not improving with prescription topical steroids, your doctor may recommend systemic corticosteroids Although the dosage of steroids in over-the-counter products is small, use the product only as directed on the package or by your doctor. Overuse of corticosteroids can cause side effects including but not limited to thinning of the skin, redness, lightening of the skin and acne."

      "content": "Ask your doctor about antibiotics. Because eczema causes itching, you are at risk of a bacterial skin infection if you scratch and damage the itchy skin. Your doctor may recommend you take antibiotics to treat the infection.

      "content": "Consult your doctor if you should use calcineurin inhibitors. These creams help control itching and reduce eczema flare ups; however, these prescription-only creams should only be used when other medications have failed due to side effects.

      "title": "Try light therapy.",
      "content": "Try light therapy. Phototherapy uses natural sunlight or artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation to suppress overactive immune system and reduce inflammation in the skin. As a result, it helps relieve rash and itching. The most common type of phototherapy used for eczema is called narrow band UVB and overall is a very safe and effective treatment. [7] X Research source Because long-term phototherapy has harmful effects (including skin aging and risk of cancer), consult your doctor before using light therapy. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Phototherapy is not the same as visiting a tanning bed — it can only be administered in a doctor's office. If your child has atopic dermatitis, narrowband UVB is considered safe. Talk to your doctor about this treatment."

      "content": "Take a bleach bath. Bathing in a diluted-bleach water helps reduce bacterial infections on your skin. Try bleach baths two to three times a week for a few weeks to see if it helps relieve your symptoms. [9] X Research source Add 1/2 cup of bleach (use household bleach and not concentrated bleach) to a bathtub filled water. Soak just the affected skin (not in the face) for 10 minutes. Rinse with warm water and moisturize. Another option is to try an oatmeal bath. The ingredient in oats has anti-inflammatory and anti-itching properties that can be very soothing for your skin."

[11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Keep your fingernails short to help keep your skin damage to a minimum. You may also want to wear gloves during the night to prevent yourself from scratching while sleeping. You may also want to wrap your skin to prevent yourself from scratching.

      "content": "Recognize your lifestyle triggers. Eczema flare ups can be triggered by different things that are not the same for everyone. Thus, it is important you learn to recognize the factors (such as clothing materials, chemicals, or foods) that trigger your eczema. [12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep a diary and write down the products you use and foods you eat.

      "content": "Avoid clothing made of irritating materials. Some materials may irritate your skin and worsen or trigger your eczema. Keep track of your symptoms and if you recognize a material that triggers your eczema, stop using it. [13] X Research source Avoid scratchy materials, such as wool, and tight-fitting clothes that can irritate your skin and trigger an episode. Opt for light and breathable materials, such as cotton, silk and bamboo. Be sure to wash new clothes before wearing them for the first time to soften the fabric and wash off any possible irritants. However, some detergents may also trigger an episode by leaving a slight residue on your clothes. Before throwing away your favorite outfit, try using a natural washing powder or a different detergent and see if that makes a difference."

Also, you may want to keep a food diary that will help you identify the foods that trigger your condition. [15] X Research source If you are unsure whether a food triggers your episode, eat it for a few days to see if you experience a flare-up. Then eliminate the product from your diet and see if your eczema clears up. Do the same for all foods that you believe may be triggering the conditions.

      "content": "Moisturize regularly. To keep your skin moist and prevent eczema and dryness flareups, use a moisturizer at least twice a day. Creams and ointments help retain the skin’s natural moisture and reduce dryness and itching resulting from eczema. [17] X Trustworthy Source National Eczema Association Nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of those with eczema through research and education Go to source Use creams and ointments over lotions — lotions contain a lot of water, while creams and ointments have a higher oil content and are better at repairing the skin barrier and retaining moisture. Apply moisturizers after bathing or showering to trap in moisture to your skin. Choose an unscented, moisturizing soap. Pat the skin dry rather than rubbing it to avoid irritation. Consider using a barrier repair moisturizers (such as petroleum jelly, Aquaphor, Aveeno Healing Ointment, Crisco, or Coconut Oil) that help lock water into the skin and prevent dryness."
