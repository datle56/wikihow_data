      "content": "Look for a plot of land that’s at least 3 acres (1.2 ha). Try to find a spot that’s private and away from noisy roads or highways so you can create a relaxing experience for your campers. Look for an area that has other attractions nearby, such as hiking trails, lakes, or beaches, since they may attract more campers. Make sure the plot has level ground throughout, or else you’ll need to have it flattened. The minimum required size of an RV park depends on where you live. Check your area’s building or zoning codes to find out the requirements or regulations you need to follow. Make sure your park isn’t too difficult to get to or out of the way since some campers will only need to stay for 1 night at a time."

      "content": "Divide the land into sites that are at least 1,500 sq ft (140 m 2 ). Basic RV campsites are usually at least 25 feet (7.6 m) wide and about 27–35 feet (8.2–10.7 m) long so RVs can easily fit in them. Start laying out where you want to place the sites on a map or blueprint of your land. The number of campsites you can put in your RV park depends on the shape and layout of the land you purchased. It usually costs around $15,000–20,000 USD per campsite to build an RV park. Opt to have a few sites that are around 50–60 feet (15–18 m) long so you can accommodate extra-long RVs or big rigs."

      "content": "Have water, sewer, and electric hookups run to each campsite. Campsites that hook up to water, sewage, and electricity make it much more comfortable for your guests. Plan to place the hookups on the same side of the campsite as the RV’s rear driver side so they can attach to the lines easily. Have professional plumbers and electricians run supply lines to each of your campsites to ensure it’s done correctly and efficiently.

      "title": "Install concrete or gravel pads to provide level areas for parking.",
      "content": "Install concrete or gravel pads to provide level areas for parking. The concrete or gravel pad ensures that RVs are parked on level ground. Make sure the pads are at least 10 feet (3.0 m) wide and about 25–30 feet (7.6–9.1 m) long so they can hold an entire RV. Have someone pour concrete or pack the gravel down for you on each site. Avoid using dirt since it can easily get muddy and make RVs get dirty."

      "content": "Design roads that are 25–30 ft (7.6–9.1 m) wide to improve the flow of traffic. Make sure the roads are wide so you can accommodate for larger vehicles. Aim to use asphalt, concrete, or packed gravel for your roads so they stay clean and easy to drive on. Make sure the roads allow campers to access each of the campsites without any hassle or concern. [2] X Research source Try using one-way roads so you can easily direct the flow of traffic without it getting too congested. Reach out to other RV park designers to help you if you don’t know how to design the roads or sites yourself."

      "title": "Provide sanitary facilities if campers don’t want to use hookups.",
      "content": "Provide sanitary facilities if campers don’t want to use hookups. Find a location on your land where you can put a public bathroom and showers so campers have the option to use them. Aim to have 1–2 separate bathroom buildings and place them in a central location to make them easier to access. Make sure your park also has sewer or septic tank access where they RVers can empty their wastewater. [3] X Research source You may also want to include laundry machines near your sanitary facilities since you’ll already have plumbing in the area."

Many RV parks have a small clubhouse area with tables, books, or full kitchens where RVers can socialize and get out of their vehicle. Place the building in a central location in your RV park so all of the campsites can easily access it. [4] X Research source If you want to make the RV park family-friendly, have a restaurant or diner. If you want something for an adult group, consider putting in a bar."

      "content": "Have a pool or fitness center installed to make your park more desirable. Many high-end RV parks offer extra amenities for their guests to help them have the best stay. Choose a place in your RV park where every site can easily access your pool or fitness center. If you choose to provide a fitness center, pick a variety of equipment so your guests have options to choose from. If you choose a pool, make sure there are various depths to so people can have fun swimming or wading.

      "content": "Save 10% of your land to leave as open space. Open green space is a great way to make your guests feel comfortable and relaxed while they stay at your park. Use the open area to make a park, playground, or comfortable area where your guests can go spend time outside of their RVs. Try to spread the open spaces throughout the park so all of your guests can easily reach them. You can change what you include in the open space depending on the guests you want to attract. If you want something more family-friendly, try putting in a playground. If you want something for a more adult group, you may include things like a putting green or nature trail."

      "content": "Hire friendly staff to maintain the sites and amenities. Find someone with good organizational skills and customer service to assist guests with making reservations and checking in. Hire 1–2 groundskeepers to mow lawns, maintain campsites, and clean any other facilities. Try to keep a plumber or electrician that stays on-site to help with any hookup problems or concerns as well. [6] X Research source Make sure everyone working at your park follows the same procedures and levels of customer service so campers are more likely to stay there. As your business grows, you may need to hire more staff to accommodate new customers."

      "title": "Adjust your park’s prices depending on the peak season and off-season.",
      "content": "Adjust your park’s prices depending on the peak season and off-season. Every location has a peak season, which tends to be during the summer months, and an off-season, which usually happens in the winter. Charge more during your peak seasons when you have the most business and less in the off-season since there won’t be as much competition for sites. Just be sure to charge enough so you can still make a profit from your guests. [7] X Research source Daily RV park prices usually range from $90–120 USD during peak seasons and $60–80 USD for off-seasons. If you have consistent business throughout the year, you may not need to adjust your prices."

Provide brochures or handouts during check-in so your guests can easily see the rules right when they arrive at your park. Put signs throughout your park in common areas and at regular intervals between campsites as reminders for your guests. Make sure you or your staff enforce the rules if someone breaks them. [8] X Research source Some example rules could be, “No loud noises between 9 PM–8 AM,” or, “Clean up after your pets immediately.” Don’t post your rules too often around your park since they could seem too uptight."

Sell items such as kitchen supplies, emergency kits, toilet paper, and jumper cables so your guests can pick them up as they need them. If you want to help spread the word about your park, you can also sell things like T-shirts or bags with your park name on them as well. [9] X Research source Plan how much inventory you buy based on how many guests usually stay in your park. That way, you won’t have extra items that are difficult to sell."

      "content": "Provide wifi for your guests to make your RV park more attractive. Many RVers want to connect to the Internet when they settle down for the night, so set up a wireless network you can use throughout the park. Test the connection from all of the campsites to make sure it’s consistent throughout. [10] X Research source Talk to an Internet provider or technician if you don’t know how to set up the wifi system yourself. If the wifi doesn’t reach every campsite, you may be able to list the sites that don’t connect to the Internet for a cheaper rate."
