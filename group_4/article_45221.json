      "content": "Choose a sweater that fits you well. The sweater can have a solid front or it can have a button-up front. It would be easier if the sweater has a V-neck, but don't worry if it doesn't; you can always add one."

      "title": "Cut the sleeves off.",
      "content": "Cut the sleeves off. Use a pair of fabric scissors to do this. You can also extend the cut a little bit below the armhole, but do not extend it to the front or back, or it will be too big. Don't worry if the sweater starts to unravel a little."

      "title": "Measure around the arm holes.",
      "content": "Measure around the arm holes. Add both measurements together, plus 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) for the seam allowances. You will be using this measurement to cut the ribbing for the arms."

      "content": "Cut a strip of ribbed fabric according to that measurement and 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) wide. The wider you cut the strips, the wider the ribbing will be on the arm holes. You can cut the material from a matching sweater or from cotton ribbing. The colors can match, or they can contrast for an interesting look."

      "content": "Fold the strip in half lengthwise twice to make a double-fold bias strip . Fold the strip in half lengthwise with the wrong sides facing in. Press it flat with an iron. Unfold the strip, then fold both of the long edges towards the center by ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter). Fold the strip shut, and press it flat with an iron once again. Make sure that your iron is set to a temperature appropriate for the material you are working with."

      "content": "Sew the strips into two loops. Unfold both of the strips once so that the long, side edges are still folded towards the center crease. Fold the strips in half, widthwise, with the right sides together. Sew along the narrow edges using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance."

Fold the top edge down of each ring over the raw edge of the armholes, sandwiching them inside. Pin the rings in place. Align the ribbings' seams at the bottom, with the sweater's side seams."

      "content": "Topstitch the rings down. Choose a narrow, zigzag stitch and a thread color that matches the ribbed material. Sew around the ring and armhole, about ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) away from the inside folded edge. Be sure to sew through all layers of fabric and the remove the pins as you sew. The stitch needs to be narrow, almost a straight line. Alternatively, you can use a stretch stitch."

      "content": "Press the armholes once more. Tuck the iron into the sweater, and iron the back armhole on each side. Flip the sweater over, and repeat this step, ironing the front armhole. This ensures that the ribbed binding layers nicely against your sweater. It also prevents creases from forming at the shoulder and armpit."

If you want to be more precise, you can tuck the sweater inside an existing sweater vest, and use the existing vet's neckline as a guide. Put the sweater on and make sure that you are happy with the look. Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen for this."

      "title": "Cut the V-neck.",
      "content": "Cut the V-neck. If your sweater has a ribbed collar, cut the ribbing off first, then cut the V-neck. This will help reduce bulk. If your sweater has a turtleneck, cut the turtleneck off at the seam first, then cut the V. Avoid cutting off too much material at the side and back of the neck hole."

The strip needs to be 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) wide—the same width as the ribbing on the armholes. You can use the same color as you did for the armholes, or you can use a different color for something more unique. Make sure that the material matches, however!"
