      "title": "I’m sorry",
      "content": "I’m sorry Sumimasen is a common, polite apology in Japan; it means “I’m sorry.” It expresses regret and sincerity over whatever mistake you’re apologizing for. For example, you might use sumimasen to apologize for bumping into someone on the street, or for running late to an appointment (including a meeting, or lunch out with a friend). [1] X Research source You could also use “sumimasen” to apologize for anything from losing an important document to accidentally stepping on someone’s foot. It can be like a reflexive apology—something a Japanese person would say instinctively after running into someone."

      "title": "Excuse me",
      "content": "Excuse me Sumimasen is also an expression used to get someone else’s attention, like saying “excuse me” or “pardon me” to a person you’re trying to speak to. For example, you might see someone in Japan say “sumimasen” to a member of the wait staff at a restaurant, as a way to signal that they’re ready to order. [2] X Research source You could also say “sumimasen” to stop someone on the street and ask them for directions, or ask a store clerk for help finding something."

      "title": "Thank you",
      "content": "Thank you Finally, sumimasen can also be an expression of appreciation or gratitude in Japanese. While “Arigato” or “Arigato gozaimasu” is the typical “thank you” in Japan, “sumimasen” is a mixture of appreciation and regret or guilt. People tend to use it when they feel grateful for something, but also feel a little bad about it, too. [3] X Research source For example, someone might say “sumimasen” (instead of “arigato”) when another person: Offers them a ride home Returns an item they lost Offers them a seat on the train Helps them out with a task Holds the door for them In this context, saying “sumimasen” is like thanking someone while also recognizing they may have inconvenienced themselves to help you, and apologizing for that inconvenience."

      "title": "Sumimasen is pronounced “soo-mee-mah-sehn.”",
      "content": "Sumimasen is pronounced “soo-mee-mah-sehn.” Some Japanese speakers may pronounce the word in slightly different ways (like elongating or emphasizing the “en” sound at the end of the word, but generally, the above pronunciation is standard. “Sumimasen” is written as: すみません in Japanese. [4] X Research source You may also see Japanese people bow when saying sumimasen, either in appreciation or apology. Bowing is a show of respect and emotion; the deeper the bow, the deeper the emotion behind it."

      "title": "Both terms mean “I’m sorry,” but they’re used in different contexts.",
      "content": "Both terms mean “I’m sorry,” but they’re used in different contexts. “Gomennasai” comes from the word “gomen,” which means “sorry” or refers to begging for forgiveness. It’s less formal and usually used among friends and family when someone wants to apologize and ask for forgiveness. On the other hand, “sumimasen” is more often used in public, used to admit a mistake and express regret without necessarily asking for forgiveness in return. [5] X Research source For example, if someone hurt their close friend or sibling’s feelings, they might say “gomennasai” to apologize. However, if someone arrives late to a meeting with a coworker, they might say “sumimasen” to apologize instead."

      "title": "In professional situations, “Moushiwake arimasen” is more appropriate.",
      "content": "In professional situations, “Moushiwake arimasen” is more appropriate. Instead of using “sumimasen” or “gomennasai,” Japanese people tend to use “moushiwake arimasen” as an apology when dealing with business matters, especially when addressing a superior (or when writing rather than speaking). It’s a very formal apology and expresses stronger feelings than sumimasen. Like sumimasen, “moushiwake arimasen” can be used to express gratitude as well."

      "title": "“Suimasen” is a more casual, spoken version of “sumimasen.”",
      "content": "“Suimasen” is a more casual, spoken version of “sumimasen.” Although “sumimasen” is the proper word and spelling, you might hear a Japanese-speaker say “suimasen” instead, cutting out the first “M” sound after “Su.” This is simply a variation of the original word; it means the same thing as “sumimasen” and is only used when saying the word out loud—not when writing it. [6] X Research source In other words, when you need to write out the word, you’d write “sumimasen” (not “suimasen”). However, if you said “suimasen” to a Japanese person, they’d understand that you’re really saying “sumimasen.” Just remember: “suimasen” is very casual—a bit like Japanese slang. Thus, it’s not appropriate for formal or professional situations!"
