Avoid using your nails to scrape things, open things, and do other things that you might do with a tool. [5] X Research source For example, don't use your nails to open packages. Get a pair of scissors and cut them open. Or, if you notice that something is stuck to your desk, don't use your nails to scrape it off. Use a stiff metal object, like a paint scraper instead. Always try to avoid putting stress on your nails. [6] X Expert Source Lindsay Yoshitomi Nail Artist Expert Interview. 12 July 2019."
