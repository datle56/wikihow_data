      "content": "Pay attention to how he treats you. One of the best ways to tell if a guy is obsessed with sex is to examine how he acts when he’s with you. Behavior such as frequently trying to initiate sexual acts or bring a sexual element into situations that really aren’t sexual may be an indicator that he’s focused on sex. For instance, if he always wants to watch movies or TV shows that have lots of nudity or sex scenes, you might take it as a sign that he is sex obsessed. [1] X Research source Or, for example, if every time you’re together he wants to do sexual things, he may be obsessed with sex. Physical affection does not always need to lead to sex, and if he expects physical affection to always lead to sex, then this could be a clue about his attitude towards sex."

      "content": "Listen to what he says. The things that guys talk about with their friends, partners, and other people close to them can tell you a lot about them. Pay attention to how frequently you hear or hear about conversations that he has that are sexual in nature. While some sex talk is normal for everyone, if you rarely hear him talking about anything other than sex, he might be sex obsessed. Does he, for example, add a sexual comment or joke to conversations that have nothing to do with sex?"

      "content": "Pay attention to his interactions with others. You can tell if a guy is obsessed with sex by watching how flirtatious and sexual he acts around others. Most people flirt occasionally or include sexual innuendos every now and then. But, if he seems to always be flirting or continually bringing a sexual component into his interactions, he may have a sex obsession. For example, if the first kinds of comments he makes about people are of a sexual nature, or if his value of people is based primarily on their sexual desirability, then this could be another clue."

      "content": "Ask about past relationships. Often guys that are obsessed with sex have trouble maintaining relationships because of their focus on sex. They may ruin long-term relationships by cheating or end them because they feel they need more sex. The more you know about why a guy’s past relationships ended, the easier it may be for you to tell if a guy is sex obsessed. Ask him directly why his previous relationships ended. You might say, “Can you tell me about your other relationships? Did you have any problems with infidelity?” Someone with a sex addiction may even be currently partnered and looking for additional sex outside of his committed relationship. If this is the case, it's best to walk away from the situation entirely. Reader Poll: We asked 1657 wikiHow readers and 51% of them agreed that the best way to handle a partnered man showing sexual attraction to you is by distancing yourself from him . [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Look out for lying. One of the first signs you may get that a guy has a sexual addiction is that he is dishonest with you. Sexual addicts often have to lie in order to cover up their obsession and their behavior. [2] X Research source While you don't have to dissect everything the guy says, you should be alert for blatant dishonesty or inconsistencies that you notice. For example, if a guy tells you he spent the weekend doing work, but you find tickets to a strip club in the trash, it definitely suggests he isn’t being honest with you. However, keep in mind that it is rare to find this kind of obvious confirmation about a person’s lies. You may notice more subtle things, such as him spending lots of money and not having a good explanation about where it went. Or, you might find he is not where he said he would be when you go to check up on him."

For guys that have a sexual addiction, their thoughts about sex and efforts to engage in it may result in them neglecting other responsibilities and obligations. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Pay attention to how well the guy is addressing other areas of his life to get an indication of whether he is a sex addict. For example, has the guy been neglecting or missing school or work for seemingly no good reason? Or has he been fired from his job? Or, for instance, a guy may neglect bills and other financial obligations because of money they are spending on their obsession with sex."

      "content": "Be aware of the risks to you. If you’re in a relationship with a guy that is a sex addict, you have to realize that his addiction doesn't just affect him. Because sexual addicts often engage in risky behavior, it puts you at risk for stress, emotional strain, financial problems, health issues, and more. Make sure you’re taking proper precautions in all areas of your life. [5] X Research source For example, you should make efforts to avoid unprotected sex with a guy who you think has a sex addiction. It is perfectly acceptable to request that a sexual partner provide documentation that they have recently had an STD screening. You may want to make it harder for him to access money, credit cards, or your other financial information. Avoid putting yourself in sexual situations, or being alone with a guy that seems aggressive in addition to showing signs of a sexual addiction."

      "content": "Find help for the guy. If you do know a guy who shows many of the signs of sexual addiction, you should support him in getting help. In some cases, the guy may not see his behavior as a problem and may not want help. In other cases, though, your support could help the guy address his problems and treat his addiction. For example, you might tell your new boyfriend, “Based on several things I’ve noticed, I think you have a sexual addiction. Can we talk about it and about getting you help?” You might suggest he review the information about treatment for sexual addiction provided by Psychcentral. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that you might have to have a series of conversations about your concerns as he opens up to the idea of having a problem. He may be very defensive about it at first. Give him time to process what you have to say and see if this changes."

But if you are in any type of relationship with this person, it's important to make sure that your feelings are a priority, too. Whether you are friends or in a romantic relationship, remember that you matter in this relationship, too. If you feel ignored, anxious, or have difficulties expressing your feelings, your needs are probably not being met. [7] X Research source Try setting some boundaries.

Ask your partner if he is willing to try couples counseling with you. This can be a great way to find solutions to relationship problems.

      "content": "Recognize normal sexual behavior. Thinking about sex a lot or frequently engaging in sexual activities doesn’t necessarily mean that a guy is obsessed with sex. In fact, sexual thoughts and actions are a normal part of life. [9] X Research source This is true for boys going through puberty as well as for young and older men. Remind yourself that both men and women of all ages have sexual urges and thoughts. It’s the way these thoughts and feelings are handled that distinguish normal behavior and sex obsession. For instance, a guy may want to have sex several times a week with his partner. This could be considered normal sexual behavior, not a sign of sex obsession. It is also normal if you do not want to have sex this much. The difference in the amount that he wants to have sex versus the amount you want to have sex may just be an indication that you are not compatible."
