      "title": "Chew gum to keep your mouth busy if you tend to read aloud.",
      "content": "Chew gum to keep your mouth busy if you tend to read aloud. Chewing gum makes it difficult for you to use your lips and tongue to form words. This means you’re less likely to recite or mouth the words you’re reading. This is a simple, easy way to stop a subvocalization habit. Choose a sugar free gum to reduce the risk of dental cavities."

      "title": "Suck on a piece of hard candy so you can’t talk.",
      "content": "Suck on a piece of hard candy so you can’t talk. Similar to chewing gum, eating candy may also help you stop saying or mouthing words as you read. Put the candy on your tongue when you sit down to read. The candy will keep your mouth busy and make it hard for your lips and tongue to form words. Keep a bag of hard candy nearby while you’re reading or studying."

      "title": "Put a pencil or pen perpendicular across your mouth.",
      "content": "Put a pencil or pen perpendicular across your mouth. Hold a clean pencil or pen so that it lays across your bottom lip, then gently bite down on it. The pencil or pen should stick out on either side of your mouth. Leave the pencil or pen in your mouth while you read to make it harder for you to read aloud or mouth the words. Try not to chew the pencil or pen. Just hold it in your mouth to keep you from moving your lips. If the pencil or pen becomes uncomfortable, you might want to switch it up by alternating between the pencil or pen and a piece of gum. This might help you prevent your jaw from getting tired. Make sure the pencil or pen you use is clean and new. Don’t put a dirty object in your mouth."

      "title": "Listen to music while you read.",
      "content": "Listen to music while you read. Music will distract your mind just enough to stop you from saying the words in your head as your read. Listen to songs through earbuds or play them through a speaker. Choose music that calms and relaxes your mind so you don’t get distracted by it. For best results, choose instrumental music. It’s best to avoid lyrics, which can make it hard to process the words you’re seeing on the page."

      "title": "Count to 4 in your head while you read a block of text.",
      "content": "Count to 4 in your head while you read a block of text. While reading, repeat 1, 2, 3, 4 in your head. As you count, try to keep your focus on the text, not the numbers. The mindless counting in the back of your head should prevent your mind from saying the words you're reading. [2] X Research source This may take some practice for you to get used to it, so don’t try it with an important reading, such as a book for school, until you know you can do it well."

      "title": "Say the alphabet or list the vowels A-E-I-O-U as you read.",
      "content": "Say the alphabet or list the vowels A-E-I-O-U as you read. Repeat the letters over and over in your mind as you read. However, focus your attention on the words you’re reading. The mindless repetition of the letters should help you stop subvocalization as you read. [3] X Research source Just like with the counting technique, it may take you some practice to get used to comprehending what you read while you’re trying this technique. Don’t use it while you’re reading an important text until you know you can do it."

      "title": "Use a pointer to direct your attention to the words on the page.",
      "content": "Use a pointer to direct your attention to the words on the page. Point at the words on the page with your finger, a pencil, or a pen. Slide the pointer under the words as you read. Move the pointer fast enough that it’s hard for you to vocalize each word, either aloud or in your mind. In addition to helping you stop subvocalizing, using a pointer can help you keep your attention on the text."

    {
      "title": "Focus on blocks of text, not individual words.",
      "content": "Focus on blocks of text, not individual words. Reading word-for-word slows down the speed of your reading, and it makes you more likely to subvocalize. That’s because your mind naturally recites the words it sees on the page, whether it’s aloud or just in your head. To prevent this, take in an entire line or paragraph of text at one time. Gaze at a whole paragraph or page at one time, rather than looking from word-to-word. Start by focusing on a few words at a time, then slowly increase how many words you take in at once as you get used to the process. This helps you focus on the meaning of the text as a whole, not just the definition of individual words."

      "title": "Use a piece of cardboard to box in a block of text.",
      "content": "Use a piece of cardboard to box in a block of text. Cut the cardboard into a square about the size of a book page. Then, use an exacto knife or scissors to cut out a small box in the middle of the cardboard. At first, cut your box just big enough to see a line at a time. Put the cardboard over the page to isolate a line of text, then slide the box down the page as you read. The box will help your brain focus on larger pieces of text rather than just a single word. Your eyes will naturally look at the box as a whole, not each word. After you get used to a single line, expand the box so it’s big enough for 2 lines. Then, cut your box to fit an entire paragraph. You can continue to expand your box until a whole page of text fits in the box."
