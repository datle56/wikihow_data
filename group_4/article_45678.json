      "content": "You can only unsend one message at a time. While time-consuming, Instagram has yet to incorporate a way to select and unsend more than one message at a time. Until then, you'll need to go through each chat message individually, select it, and then unsend it. Deleting Instagram messages is different from unsending. While you can delete multiple messages at a time, this only happens on your end. The recipient will still see your message unless you unsend it."
