These are called zoonotic diseases, and they include the flu, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. [1] X Research source It’s a small risk, but it could cause your dog harm if it ever happens. Plus, if your dog drinks too much of your blood (we’re talking cupfuls of it here), then they might experience vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea."

One of the major viruses to be concerned about is rabies, which is a potentially deadly disease that is passed via open wounds. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other things that your dog could pass onto you include: Salmonella, a bacteria that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Giardia, a parasite that is ingested via dirty water. Campylobacter, a bacteria that causes severe vomiting and diarrhea."

      "content": "The bacteria from your dog’s mouth could give you an infection. Have you ever heard that a dog’s mouth is cleaner than ours is? Unfortunately, that rumor isn’t 100% true. When a dog licks an open wound of yours, they’re introducing bacteria that can cause infection, some of them so severe that they could lead to amputations. [3] X Research source Plus, the constant licking can agitate the wound, slowing down healing time."

      "title": "Your dog will lick your wounds because they’re trying to heal you.",
      "content": "Your dog will lick your wounds because they’re trying to heal you. When your dog gets a cut or a scratch, they’ll instinctively lick at it to clean off the blood. Some components of canine saliva can actually help heal wounds, which is why dogs will often lick their own wounds so incessantly. Since your dog views you as part of their pack, they want to take care of you and help you heal fast. [4] X Research source Dogs are intelligent animals, and they can tell when you’re hurting (especially if they see blood). While it’s true that a dog’s saliva can help heal their own wounds, a dog’s saliva is not beneficial to wounds on a human. The healing properties that may help your wound are negated by the potential bacteria and illnesses you could contract from a dog’s mouth."

Keeping a wound covered will not only put a barrier between it and your dog, but it will also speed up the healing process, too.

      "content": "Keep your wound out of your dog’s reach. The best way to prevent your dog from licking your wounds is to not give them access to the wounds in the first place. If your dog comes near you, cover your wound with clothing or get up and walk away. Eventually, they’ll lose interest and will likely leave you (and your wound) alone. [6] X Research source If your dog really won’t leave it, distract them with a treat or a fun toy instead."
