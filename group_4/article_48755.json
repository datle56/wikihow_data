      "title": "Negativity bias",
      "content": "Negativity bias A “negativity bias” is essentially the belief that all living things (humans and animals, anyway) tend to focus on negative circumstances rather than positive ones. [1] X Research source Even if plenty of uplifting things are happening in your life, you might not even be aware of them thanks to the unconscious bias in your mind. Let’s say a coworker criticizes you at work, while another acknowledges what a good job you’re doing. Because of a negativity bias, you’d probably leave work feeling negative (since you’d be more focused on the negative coworker’s comment). Negative thoughts in general can take a toll on your mental well-being, and make it harder to maintain a positive outlook in life. [2] X Research source Clinical psychologist William Gardner suggests “taking a closer look at the aspects of your life that aren’t working for you. In what ways are you failing? What parts of your life aren’t great? Figuring that out can help you specify what’s wrong so you can work on that problem.”"

Unfortunately, making frequent comparisons can make you overly focused on what you don’t have rather than what you do have. Breaking the cycle of self-comparison can be tough, but acknowledging it is an important first step! It can also help to ask yourself questions like “Why do I feel like I’m less successful than this individual?” or “Would I really be happier if I had the things they have?” [3] X Research source"

During these chats, you could use “I” statements to share your feelings without shifting the blame onto your significant other. [9] X Research source If you’re stressed about a big bill coming up, you could plan to set aside small amounts of your weekly paycheck rather than paying a large sum upfront. As you focus on your goals, life coach Guy Reichard suggests “to plan for what could go wrong or stand in the way, and how you will overcome such obstacles.

Here are a few common types of negative thinking you might run into: [10] X Research source Overgeneralizing: “My boss turned down my idea. I’m never going to contribute anything to the workplace.” Minimizing the positive: “I got an A- on my test, but I still should’ve done better.” Jumping to conclusions: “I know my interview tomorrow is going to go terribly.” Viewing situations as “all” or “nothing”: “I forgot to exercise yesterday. My new fitness plan is a total waste now!” Filtering: Most of your co-workers complimented your presentation, but you’re only focused on Jodie, who was critical of it. Magnifying mistakes: “I sent out an email with a typo in it. I’m the worst, most unprofessional person ever!” Thinking in “shoulds”: “I should’ve taken the train instead of driving; then, I wouldn’t be late.” Labelling: “I can’t believe spelled the word changeable wrong. I’m the dumbest person out there!” Reasoning things emotionally: “My last boyfriend treated me poorly, so all men must be mean and uncaring.” Personalizing problems: “It’s my fault that my child had a terrible day at school today.”"

      "content": "Accept negative thoughts without judging them. Better known as “thought-stopping,” this strategy involves hitting the brakes on your negative, unwanted thoughts by uttering “stop” to yourself (while picturing something that really invokes that energy, like a red traffic signal). Once you’ve paused that thought, repeat the word “calm” while visualizing something really soothing (e.g., a beach, a mountain lake, etc.). With practice, this exercise can be a useful way to get your negative thoughts under control. [11] X Research source Make your moment of peaceful visualization extra soothing by incorporating your 5 senses. What would you see at this relaxing place? What would you smell? What would you be touching?"

If you find yourself thinking negatively about a certain aspect of your life, look for small ways to put a positive spin on things. Instead of thinking “I can’t believe I embarrassed myself like that,” try thinking “Everyone does embarrassing things sometimes—there’s no need to be so hard on myself!” Learn to laugh . Teaching yourself to laugh during stressful or otherwise inconvenient times can help sprinkle some positivity into the moment. Practice the golden rule with your thoughts. If you wouldn’t say your negative, critical thought to a close friend, you shouldn’t say it to yourself, either. You deserve love and kindness, too! Build a positive support network. When your life is filled with positive individuals, your day-to-day interactions will naturally start to feel more positive."
