      "content": "Rule out flea allergies. Some cats and dogs experience a condition known as flea allergy dermatitis. This condition is an allergy to the saliva in fleas, and when a pet with this condition gets bitten, it experiences an adverse reaction. Signs of flea allergy dermatitis in dogs include hair loss, thick skin, redness, and hot spots on the rear end, tail, thighs, and abdomen. Cats can be harder to diagnose. Signs typically include hair loss due to frequent and excessive licking (especially on the back) and tiny red crusts on the back, though these crusts are not always present. If you think your pet is having an allergic reaction to a flea bite, talk to your vet about how to safely prevent fleas. Your vet may also prescribe antibiotics for skin infections and/or medicated shampoos to treat inflammation."

If your pet is having a topical allergy to flea and tick preventatives, the first thing you'll need to do is to remove the collar or the treatment and wash any residual preventative product off the animal's body. You can do this in the bathtub or shower, but it should be done as soon as possible to minimize your pet's adverse reaction. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Use a mild soap to wash any areas where the product was applied. Thoroughly rinse the area with copious amounts of water, ensuring that all of the soap (and the preventative product) have been rinsed off. Gently dry your pet with a clean, dry towel. Be extra cautious when toweling off the area where the product was applied, as it may have caused skin sensitivity in your pet."

You should always read the instructions before administering any product. Even if you've used a product before, the directions or usage guidelines may have changed. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Only use one application per pet. Make sure it's for the right animal, as cats and dogs should receive different products. Use the right size or dose for each application. For example, don't split a large dog application between two small dogs or use two small dog applications for one large dog. Closely monitor your pet after you've administered any flea and tick preventative to ensure that it does not experience any adverse side effects. Always talk to your vet before using a preventative product on animals that are old, weak, sick, nursing, or on medication. Ask your vet about how to prevent fleas and ticks on pets that have had allergic reactions in the past."

      "content": "Consider the timing of applications. Timing can be a factor in how your pet reacts to flea and tick preventatives. Many pets suffering from adverse reactions experience these problems when the treatment is used too soon before or after administering other products or vaccinations. If you must give your pet multiple medicinal products, space out their use by at least 7 days. If going to the vet, make sure your pet does not receive a vaccination on the same day as any preventative products. An abnormal body temperature can also lead to adverse reactions to preventative products. Never administer flea and tick preventatives immediately after your pet has been bathed, sedated, or anesthetized. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Switch treatment methods. Sometimes pets that have an adverse reaction to one type of preventative can handle a different application method. For example, if your pet did not do well with a topical product, try an oral product. If oral products have caused problems for your pet, try switching to a topical product. [5] X Research source Always talk to your vet before administering any flea and tick preventative if your pet has experienced problems in the past. Give oral products with food. This can help reduce the risk of digestive problems. Some experts recommend administering an over-the-counter antacid like Pepcid shortly before administering an oral preventative product."
