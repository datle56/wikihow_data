      "content": "The Model S pressure depends on what tires are on the car. The Model S comes with a few different tire configurations, both square (where all the tires are the same) and staggered (where the back tires are wider). Your recommended pressure will vary depending on which ones you have. If you have 245/35R21/XL 96W tires, the pressure is 42 psi. The pressure for 245/45R19 98W tires is 45 psi. For staggered tires, if you have 245/35R21/XL 96Y in the front and 265/35R21/XL 101Y in the back, the pressures vary from 38-45 psi in the front to 40-45 psi in the back. [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source In this case, the pressure depends on what kind of tire is on the car. If you have a the 20” Continental, LX20 275/55R20 111T, the pressure is 45, any other tire it comes with is 42 psi. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "The Roadster always has different pressures in its front and back tires. The front needs 30 psi and the back needs 40 psi. [6] X Research source The tires are different pressures to maximize the car’s power and handling—the high pressure tires in back have low resistance on the road and the low pressure front tires allow you to have better control."

      "content": "Check the pressure before driving the car when the tires are cold. When the temperature of something goes up, so does the pressure. [7] X Research source Tires that have been driven on for more than 1 mile (1.6 km) will have different readings than tires that have been sitting in a cool garage all night. Check the pressure when the tires are completely cool for the most accurate reading. Checking first thing in the morning is a reliable way to make sure the tires are cold."

Wait until the hissing stops, then read the gauge. [8] X Research source If the hissing doesn’t stop, you’re either not pressing hard enough or there’s debris in the valve stem."

Some Teslas come with a variety of wheels, so check your Tire Pressure and Loading Information label to find the pressure specific to your set up. [10] X Research source When filling up tires, use the pressure written on the label and not the number on the side of the tire. The label tells you what pressure your car requires, while the tire’s rating is the highest pressure it can withstand. The only time you should use the number on the tires is when they aren’t original to the car."

Driving with flat or under inflated tires is dangerous and can damage the wheels. [15] X Research source"

The weight of the car can cause the tires to flatten over time, so filling them to the max pressure will help prevent that.
