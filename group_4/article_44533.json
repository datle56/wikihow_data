      "content": "Undergo reconstructive surgery if needed. In some cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to reduce scarring or to graft skin onto the wound to help it heal. You may need to undergo separate surgeries for each region of your face (such as your cheeks, eyes, forehead, nose, and chin). Your doctor will discuss the best course of action for you. [7] X Research source Skin grafting is a procedure in which the surgeon will remove healthy skin from one part of your body and apply it over the wound. The skin will grow over the wound to help treat it. You will need to undergo anesthesia for surgery. Recovery times can vary based on the severity of the burn and the type of surgery done. It can take between 12-24 months for you to recover completely."

The doctor will do a physical examination of the burn. They will decide if it is a first, second, or third degree. In some severe cases, they may refer you to a burn specialist. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source First degree burns are very minor and can be treated at home. These may be pink or red in color. They may be a little painful at first, but this will go away after a few days. Second-degree burns may be a splotchy red or white tone. They may be blistered. Second-degree burns smaller than 3 inches (7.6 cm) are usually treated in the same way as first-degree burns while larger second burns are considered to be more serious. Your doctor will likely recommend an antibacterial ointment and a painkiller. Third-degree burns are the most severe. They may start out as gray or white but turn brown or black. They may be painful or they may feel numb. There is a good chance you will need surgery."
