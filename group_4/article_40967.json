Emotional boundaries can help you maintain healthy, balanced relationships while taking care of your mental health and keeping your identity intact. [1] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source To create healthy boundaries , try to: Determine what your needs are and communicate them openly. If you need an hour to recharge after work before talking to anyone, tell your family or partner. [2] X Research source Figure out what you won’t compromise on, and be clear about it. You might say “no” to certain activities because of your health, your children, or other valued priorities. Plan your responses to difficult situations in advance to stop from relaxing your boundaries. If your coworker always asks you to help them out, you might say “I’m sorry, but I have my own work to complete and I can’t help you right now.” Set time limits on visits with people who overwhelm you. If you have a friend who always wants to call you to complain about work, you might say “I am happy to listen, but I only have 10 minutes to talk today.”"

      "content": "Check in with your feelings and needs. When you’re constantly taking on the emotions of other people, your emotions might get lost in the process. When you’re in your own space away from others, try to ask yourself what feelings you’re having, how you might label them (like “anger” or “sadness”), and when you became aware of them. [3] X Research source Journaling can be a great way to describe your thoughts and feelings in a space where others can’t interfere. Pay attention to the places where you absorb others’ emotions most often, like in crowds, at work, or at a party, and practice checking in with your feelings in those situations. Once you know how you feel when you’re away from others, you can better identify when you’re picking up on someone else’s energy. When you get into a situation where you’re overwhelmed with emotions, check in with your feelings and ask yourself if they’re yours or someone else’s."

      "content": "Give yourself physical space when you’re feeling overstimulated. Empaths and highly sensitive people don’t just pick up on the energy of other people, but the entire space. [7] X Research source If you’re feeling suffocated while in public, try to move to a quiet, clean location where you don’t feel as overstimulated. [8] X Research source If you’re unable to change locations, try to make yourself feel more comfortable. If you’re at a restaurant, sit at a table with your back against the wall so you can ground yourself better."

Other rituals might be taking a long bath after being in a crowd, putting on different clothes after work, or imagining yourself “shutting out” others’ emotions when you close your front door."

Taking time to unwind and practice self-care techniques that make you feel rejuvenated can be difficult if you live in a space with others. Find a place you associate with peace, like your bedroom or a backyard, and ask others to leave you to relax for at least 15 minutes. [10] X Research source Activities might include reading a book, meditating , doing a hobby you enjoy, taking a walk, listening to music, laying in a hammock, or sitting quietly.
