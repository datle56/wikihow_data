      "content": "Fill a sink with lukewarm water and add a capful of conditioner. The T-shirt’s fibers won’t stretch properly if the water is too hot or too cold. Fill the sink (or a large bowl) with enough water to completely cover the shirt, then add your conditioner. A capful will generally be enough, but if you want to measure, add 1 tbsp (15 ml) for every 1 quart (1 liter) of water. Swirl the conditioner with your hands to make sure it fully dissolves. [1] X Research source Hair conditioner softens the shirt’s fibers, making them easier to stretch. A cheap conditioner is fine; don’t waste your fancy hair products on your T-shirt. If you don’t have hair conditioner, baby shampoo will also work."

      "content": "Submerge the T-shirt for 10-15 minutes. Place the T-shirt on top of the bowl or sink, then gently press it into the water, keeping it as flat as possible so the conditioned water gets into every fiber of the shirt. If it’s wadded up, areas of the shirt will shrink differently. [2] X Research source Hold the shirt flat toward the bottom of the bowl for a minute or two. This will keep it from gathering or bunching up and will ensure every fiber gets infused with the conditioned water. The more saturated it gets, the more it will stay on the bottom of the bowl or sink on its own. To really saturate the shirt, laundry specialist Ayad Mirjan recommends “letting it sit for 25-30 minutes.” [3] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021."

Work the shirt with your hands to remove all the conditioner, or it will be covered in a sticky residue. Spend about 5 minutes rinsing the T-shirt, making sure the clean water penetrates every fiber.

      "title": "Place your forearms inside the shirt to stretch it.",
      "content": "Place your forearms inside the shirt to stretch it. Choose the area you want to stretch, like the torso, and put your arms inside, stretching outward. Be careful not to put too much pressure in one spot, as this can leave a “dent” and make the shirt look awkward. If your arms aren’t strong enough to get a good stretch, try using your legs, a sturdy pole, or getting someone with more arm strength to help you. [5] X Research source If you just want your T-shirt to be longer, stretch from the neck and the bottom, pulling it in opposite directions. Work from left to right, making sure all sides are equally stretched. Squeeze out excess water to keep the shirt from dripping everywhere as you work. Try not to wring it, however, as this could alter the shape. If your shirt has a graphic you don’t want to stretch, iron it before stretching so the image doesn’t get distorted. Dry fabric won’t stretch as much as wet fabric."

      "content": "Spread the stretched shirt on a towel to dry. It may be helpful to place weights on the edges of the shirt to help prevent shrinking. If you’re looking for a larger bust or stomach, place objects within the t-shirt to stretch those areas out even more. For best results, lay the shirt flat to dry. [6] X Research source The shirt will retain its shape until it is washed and dried again. To keep the new size, make sure not to put it back in the dryer. Mirjan says it’s important to dry your shirt “away from direct sunlight.” [7] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Strong sunlight can cause the shirt’s colors to fade, and the UV rays can even break down fabric bonds."

The shirt doesn’t need to soak for a certain amount of time; just make sure it’s evenly wet. [8] X Research source This stretching method also works well for collared shirts and button-downs."

      "content": "Squeeze out excess water and lay the shirt on a flat surface. Gently wring out the shirt to prevent it from dripping and soaking your ironing surface. An ironing board is best, but a countertop or the floor will also work if you’re careful. If you aren’t using an ironing board , make sure whatever surface you’re using can withstand heat. [9] X Research source If you’d like, give the shirt a few tugs to start the stretching process. You’d be surprised just how much you can do with only your bare hands."

      "content": "Set your iron to medium-low and begin ironing. Hold the iron in one hand and keep the shirt in place with the other, then start pulling and pressing the shirt out. Be sure to use pressure as you run the iron over it so it stretches properly. Stretch and iron in every direction, pulling up, down, and to the sides. Then, flip the shirt over and iron the back in the same way. [10] X Research source This method isn’t great for significant stretching; it’s best used if you just need the shirt to fit a little better or a little longer. The heat from the iron helps loosen the shirt’s fibers, making it easier to stretch. Don’t use a higher heat setting, as this could damage the shirt."

Hang it up to dry, or if you prefer, lay it flat and place weights around the edges to ensure it maintains its stretch. [11] X Research source Don’t machine dry it or it will revert back to its original size. From now on, the shirt should be air-dried after you wash it. It may occasionally need to be stretched out again, but avoiding the dryer will help keep it larger."

      "title": "Wear the T-shirt in a hot shower.",
      "content": "Wear the T-shirt in a hot shower. Turn on your shower and make sure the water is warm-to-hot (the hotter, the better). Clothes stretch more when they’re wet, so if your T-shirt fits, put it on and get in the shower. Make sure the entire shirt is thoroughly wet so you can stretch it properly. [12] X Research source This method also works for stretching wool sweaters."

      "title": "Tug the shirt with your hands to stretch it.",
      "content": "Tug the shirt with your hands to stretch it. By wearing the shirt, you’ll be able to choose which areas need stretching, rather than stretching the entire thing. Use your hands to pull the shirt outward to stretch it. Repeat this for every area you want to loosen. [13] X Research source For example, this method would work well if you need a shirt that’s longer or only bigger in the bust. If your shirt doesn’t fit or you’re stretching a shirt for someone else, it may still be possible to stretch it in the shower. Simply hold the shirt in your hands under the shower stream until it’s thoroughly soaked. Then, place your arms inside the shirt and press outward to stretch it. From now on, when you wash your shirt, let it air dry. If you put it in the dryer, it will likely shrink back to its original size."

      "content": "Alternatively, tug on the shirt while it’s dry. Cotton shirts are pretty malleable, so if you tug on it repeatedly, the T-shirt will eventually stretch. If you wear it all the time, constantly pulling on it will stretch it out bit by bit. Just be careful not to overdo the stretching, or it will eventually look out of shape. [16] X Research source Like other stretching methods, don’t dry your T-shirt in the dryer after you’ve stretched it. Allow it to air dry so it doesn’t shrink back up."

Lay the shirt flat and place the weights around the edges, pulling the shirt out slightly as you do so to help stretch it. The weights will hold the shirt down and keep it in its stretched-out position. [18] X Research source Place items inside the shirt, as well, to stretch it that way. For example, if the chest needs to be looser, place a couple of baseballs inside. For wider arms, put a cylinder or small bowl in the sleeves."

The fibers of the fabric will be looser than when they’re dry, so it will be easier to stretch the shirt. For additional stretch, tug the shirt outward with your hands. [21] X Research source It may be possible to stretch the shirt without getting it wet first. Depending on how small it is, try wearing the dry T-shirt for a few hours or overnight to see if you can get the desired stretch."

      "title": "Alternatively, have a larger friend wear the T-shirt.",
      "content": "Alternatively, have a larger friend wear the T-shirt. If you don’t want to walk around in a damp T-shirt, another way to body stretch it is to have a larger friend wear it. Choose a friend who is a size or two larger than you and see if they’ll wear the dry T-shirt for an hour or two, or sleep in it overnight. This should provide the adequate stretch you need. A friend who is too close to your size won’t stretch the shirt enough, and a friend who is much larger than you either won’t be able to put it on or will stretch it out too much. As usual when stretching a shirt, let it air dry from now on whenever you wash it. A dryer might cause it to shrink back up."

Slide the shirt over the back of the chair, ensuring that the arms are stretched out in opposite directions. Like the weights method, the chair will hold the shirt in place so it dries in a stretched position. [23] X Research source If the chair is too small or narrow, it won’t give you the stretch you want, and if it’s too big, the shirt might not fit over the back or it will stretch it out too much."

[24] X Research source Then, leave the shirt alone until it air dries completely. When it’s dry, take it off the chair and it should be properly stretched. If it isn’t, repeat the process until you get the fit you desire. Don’t put the T-shirt in the dryer after it’s been stretched, or it will likely shrink back to its original size. Instead, let it air dry after you wash it."
