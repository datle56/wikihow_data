      "content": "The wrong size coffee filter won’t sit properly in the brew basket. As a result, water can pool around, causing the filter to collapse. To identify this easy-to-fix issue, check the filter package to see what size you’re using. The package will either say something like “8-12 cup” or it’ll give you a number like “#6.” Here’s how to decode coffee filter sizes so you can buy the right ones: #1 Size: 1 cup coffee makers #2 Size: 2-6 cup coffee makers #4 Size: 8-10 cup coffee makers #6 Size: 10+ cup coffee makers"

      "content": "If the filter sticks to the sides of your coffee maker evenly, it won’t collapse. This method works for any type of paper filter. All you have to do is run your filter under a very hot faucet (or pour boiling water over the filter). Make sure to completely wet the sides. Then, place the filter in the brew basket and you’re ready to make your coffee ! [1] X Research source Some coffee aficionados believe pre-wetting the filter will also rinse away “paper taste” from a dry filter."

      "title": "Folding your paper filter adds extra support and structure.",
      "content": "Folding your paper filter adds extra support and structure. Conical coffee filters typically come with a crimped section along the sides and bottom. Before you open up the filter, simply fold the bottom crimped portion up, creating a strong crease. Then, fold the crimped portion on the side over toward the filter. Open the filter normally and place it into your brew basket. The folds will flatten out the bottom of the filter, making it less likely to collapse. [2] X Research source To figure out the best direction to fold the paper, bend the paper back and forth. Sometimes, it’ll feel easier to bend towards one side. When you fold the crimped parts, fold towards the easier side in order to add extra support on that side. Use the folding method rather than doubling up on filters. Using 2 coffee filters can slow down the brewing process and result in a less-than-ideal tasting cup of coffee. If you have basket filters, you don’t have to worry about folding them."

      "title": "Paper basket filters or “cupcake filters,” have built-in ridges for support.",
      "content": "Paper basket filters or “cupcake filters,” have built-in ridges for support. These alternatives to conical filters are great for drip coffee machines because basket filters have large, flat bottoms. [3] X Research source Combine a basket filter with the pre-wetting method, and you’re almost guaranteed that your filters won’t collapse. As a downside, we should mention that coffee experts tend to prefer conical filters to basket filters. The flat bottom of basket filters can cause slightly uneven “extraction” (a fancy term for pulling the flavor out). That means your coffee might taste subtly more sour if you use basket filters."

      "content": "Permanent filters fix the collapsing filter issue and make your coffee taste richer. Shop for a gold tone filter , because gold is an inert metal that resists acid and won't affect the flavor of your coffee. [4] X Research source However, in contrast to paper filters, permanent coffee filters allow more sediment and coffee oils to seep through. The result is a bolder cup of coffee with a well-rounded flavor profile. [5] X Research source Selecting the type of filter changes how the coffee would taste but generally speaking people use mostly the paper filter to filter out the concentrated coffee. There’s some concern that the increased amount of coffee oils from permanent filter brewing will increase LDL cholesterol. [6] X Research source However, as long as you consume coffee in moderation, coffee won’t have much of an effect on your LDL levels. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source One study shows you can consume up to 2 cups (.47 L) of coffee per day before it starts to affect LDL.

      "content": "Cloth filters are a sturdier alternative to paper filters. Look for filters made out of organic cotton that's unbleached and undyed. If you have a nel drip setup, you can even buy cloth filters attached to a sturdy hoop. [9] X Research source Cloth filters are conical, so they’re ideal for brewing pour-over coffee because the shape allows for even extraction of the coffee flavors. Cloth will filter out the fine particles of coffee, but it lets slightly more oil through than paper filters do. The result is a smooth-tasting brew. [10] X Research source The downside to cloth filters is that they require thorough cleaning after each use. You’ll dump the leftover grounds, rinse the filter thoroughly, and then store it soaking in a glass of water in the fridge. [11] X Research source"
