      "content": "Combine warm water, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Watson recommends proofing the yeast to test its freshness. The test works for active dry yeast, instant yeast, and fresh yeast. He breaks down the following instructions: Heat ¼ cup (60ml) of water to about 100–110°F (38–43°C) so it’s lukewarm, but not hot. Stir in ½ teaspoon (2 g) of sugar. Add 2 ¼ teaspoons (7 g or 1 packet) of yeast."

      "content": "Look for foam and bubbles after 5-10 minutes. Watson says that after a few minutes, “The mixture should start to foam and bubble, creating a frothy top. This means it's alive and active.” Once you test the yeast and it’s bubbling, you can use it immediately for your next recipe! Some things you could start baking right now include: Homemade bread Pizza dough Soft pretzels"

    {
      "title": "No bubbles or foam while proofing",
      "content": "No bubbles or foam while proofing Watson explains, “If there’s no foam or only a few bubbles after 10 minutes, the yeast is likely dead and should be replaced.” Yeast is a living microscopic organism that creates gas when it eats, which causes bubbling and rising while proofing. When the yeast dies, then it no longer produces gas. If you’re in the middle of baking and don’t have time to run to the store, check out our list of easy substitutions ."

      "title": "Sour odor",
      "content": "Sour odor Watson describes that if the yeast has a bready smell that’s slightly sweet, then it’s still good. If the yeast has already gone bad, then it will have developed a strange, sour odor."

    {
      "title": "Past expiration date",
      "content": "Past expiration date Watson suggests checking the expiration date on the yeast’s packaging to see if it’s expired. You can still test yeast that’s past the expiration date, but there’s a good chance it will not be active anymore."

      "title": "Visible mold growth",
      "content": "Visible mold growth If you have fresh yeast and you notice any white or green fuzzy growths on it, then it’s spoiled. Toss the yeast out right away to prevent any other spoilage in your fridge. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Expired yeast is safe to consume, but your recipe might not turn out.",
      "content": "Expired yeast is safe to consume, but your recipe might not turn out. Yeast isn’t harmful once it goes bad and it’s really unlikely that you’ll get sick from it. However, when yeast expires and doesn’t form bubbles, it’s not active and your dough won't rise properly. To ensure that your baked goods rise and have the best texture, use yeast that’s still good in your recipes. [2] X Research source If the yeast is years old or far past the expiration date, then it’s probably best to throw it out. Toss expired yeast in your trash or add it to a compost bin."

      "title": "Baking soda and lemon juice",
      "content": "Baking soda and lemon juice Baking soda also acts as a leavening agent and will help make baked goods rise, but it needs an acid like lemon juice to work. Split the yeast measurement into an equal amount of baking soda and lemon juice as your substitution. [3] X Research source Example : If your recipe calls for 1 teaspoon (3g) of yeast, then use ½ tsp (4.8 g) of baking soda and 1 ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of lemon juice."

      "content": "Double-acting baking powder Double-acting baking powder releases carbon dioxide while you’re kneading the dough and while it’s baking to give baked goods an airy texture. Use the exact same amount of baking powder as you would yeast when you’re making your dough. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Active dry yeast",
      "content": "Active dry yeast Store the yeast in an airtight container and set it in your fridge. For even longer shelf life, keep the yeast in your freezer instead. [5] X Research source Watson says, “heat and humidity kill yeast.” While you can keep yeast at room temperature, it stays fresher when you keep it cool. Shelf life: 6 months in the fridge, 1 year in the freezer You don’t have to wait for yeast to thaw. Just proof it before adding it to your recipes."

      "content": "Instant yeast Keep instant yeast in a dry place, like a kitchen cupboard or pantry. Try to avoid areas with high-humidity or moisture. To preserve instant yeast’s freshness, place it in an airtight container in your freezer. [6] X Research source Shelf life: 6 months at room temperature, 1 year in the freezer"

      "title": "Fresh yeast",
      "content": "Fresh yeast Fresh yeast isn’t as common because it has the shortest shelf life. Wrap your fresh yeast in parchment paper and place it in an airtight container. Label the container with today’s date and keep it in your fridge. [7] X Research source Shelf life: 2-3 weeks [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Yeast is a single-celled organism that’s used to leaven dough. Yeast is a microscopic living creature that feeds on sugars and starches. As it eats sugars, yeast releases carbon dioxide that forms pockets of air that causes your dough to rise and grow in size. [9] X Research source Active dry yeast has been dried out and needs to be proofed before you add it to your dough. Instant yeast is made up completely of living cells and can be added directly to your recipe without proofing. Yeast also creates alcohol while it’s fermenting, but it’s removed from the dough when you bake it."
