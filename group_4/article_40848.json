      "content": "Cook your meals ahead of time. Having healthy meals like lean chicken breast, light stir-fry, or pork loin ready to eat at all times will help you resist the temptation to just order a pizza after a hard day at work or school. There are several ways to ensure that you always have a few healthy, fast meals ready to go. Buy a slow cooker . You can fill it up in the morning and enjoy a hot, savory meal at night. Cook a week's worth of meals at once. Divide the food into portions so you'll be able to quickly reheat and enjoy on busy weeknights. Consider a meal delivery service. Some companies such as Freshly and Green Chef specialize in delivering fresh, healthy, ready-to-cook meals designed for busy people who want to eat healthy. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid drinking or eating out too often.",
      "content": "Avoid drinking or eating out too often. Alcohol and restaurant food are both high in calories, low in nutritional content, and can make you tired and sluggish. If you still want to go out with your friends, consider bringing a healthy snack along, drinking seltzer instead of alcohol, or limiting yourself to one drink or one half-portion of a meal."

      "title": "Drink lots of water.",
      "content": "Drink lots of water. You will save a lot of calories and feel better physically by switching to water for most of your liquid intake. Too much caffeine and sugar in your drinks can increase your exhaustion and decrease your energy levels. Try sugar-free water flavorings. Buy a reusable water bottle and keep it filled.

      "title": "Wake up early to exercise.",
      "content": "Wake up early to exercise. Set your alarm for a half-hour earlier and use that time to get in a quick workout. If you get your workout done early in the day rather than saving it for the end, you are less likely to put it off or cancel it altogether."

      "title": "Look for hidden opportunities to exercise.",
      "content": "Look for hidden opportunities to exercise. If you are completely unable to schedule specific workout times, look at your routine and see how you can add exercising to the schedule you already have. You don't need to block out an hour at the gym every day to add more fitness to your routine! Park your car at the back of the lot and walk into the building. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Get up every half hour and take a quick walk around the office. Do chores like folding laundry or organizing your desk while standing up. [5] X Research source Take your dog on longer walks."

      "title": "Reevaluate your priorities.",
      "content": "Reevaluate your priorities. Take some time to think about all of your obligations. Are some of them not actually productive or helpful? Have you taken on too much responsibility? If so, consider cutting back on your obligations in favor of spending more time focused on your health. For example, if you work full-time, attend night classes, and belong to three clubs, take a break from one of the clubs until school is out of session. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Think positive, helpful thoughts. Staying positive will decrease your stress and exhaustion levels, making it easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle despite a busy schedule. When you become tired or irritated at work or school, think about things that you enjoy. Imagine yourself enjoying your next day off. Think about how much healthier your lifestyle is now. Think about the money you save by not eating out or getting pizza delivered. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Give yourself rewards. You will be less stressed and more motivated to continue eating healthy and exercising if you have a goal to work towards. Rewards can be anything you enjoy, but be careful to avoid giving yourself junk food rewards! Use the money you save eating in to buy a specific item you want, like a new shirt or video game. Reward exercise with a fun outdoors activity. If you've been parking your car a little further out every day for two weeks, plan a short hike to test your new fitness regimen. Watch a new TV show in the evening on days when you get up early and exercise."

      "content": "Get plenty of sleep. When you're juggling a busy schedule, cutting back on sleep can seem like a good idea, but it will actually make you less healthy and more stressed out! Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep, so take a look at your schedule and see what you can change to ensure that you get into bed at a reasonable hour. [8] X Research source"
