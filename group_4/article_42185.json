      "content": "Give her a unique compliment. If you want to charm a girl, make her feel special right away and get closer to sweeping her off her feet, then you have to make her see that you don't just see her as any ordinary person. Let her know that you think she's special by complimenting her when you see her. Remember not to say something that might creep her out. Tell her she has amazing hair, a quirky sense of humor, a fantastic laugh, or the most incredible sense of style you've ever seen. [1] X Research source Don't tell her she's beautiful or gorgeous quite yet. Though this is a nice compliment, if you tell her too early, she may feel like you're coming on too strong or being insincere. In your very first or second conversation, try to sneak in a subtle compliment that makes her see that you really see her as an individual, not just as any other girl. You can compliment aspects of her personality, too. Like a strong sense of responsibility, strength of character, morals, etc."

If you want to make the girl feel special, and like you really care, then you have to ask her a few questions about her life and her ideas. Don't give her the third degree or make her feel like she's in an interview. Just asking some slightly personal but not intrusive questions can really make her see that you're interested. Here are some topics to ask about: [2] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source If she has any pets -- if she does, what breed or what kind of cat or dog does she have? If she has siblings, what are their names, gender, what do they do, etc.? What her favorite movies, bands, books are? What her hobbies are and what she likes about her hobbies? What her job or classes are like for her?"

Ask her what she thinks about a variety of topics, from your new shoes to her taste in music. Don't ask any questions that could start a fight right away -- steer away from politics or any other sensitive topics. But asking what she thinks from time to time will make her see that you really care about her instead of just seeing her as a plaything. [3] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source If you take her out to a movie, ask her what she actually wants to see. When you walk out, you should ask her what she thought of the movie. If you pick her up and are listening to music, ask, \"What CD's do you have in your car?\" If you're making a life decision and are close enough for her opinion to matter, don't make it without asking what she thinks first."

Pay attention to the little details, from what she really thinks of her friend, to her favorite types of sweaters. [4] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. Sure, you may drift off from time to time, but you'll rack up major points the next time her friend Stephanie comes up or you find yourself sweater shopping together; if you mention something she previously said, she'll be really impressed that you care. [5] X Research source Really listening to her will also make her see that you're interested in her mind just as much as you care about her body. Listening to her carefully can also help you get a sense of what she likes and doesn't like, so you can get her the perfect thoughtful gift when the time comes."

You don't have to go over the top or try to do something that really doesn't fit with your personality, but if you want her to feel special, you have to make her feel like a lady. To be a gentleman, you have to treat the girl with respect, be kind and affectionate, and make her feel like all of your attention is on her, whether you're out at a fancy date or just grabbing coffee. Here are some other things you can do: When you pick her up, don't just wait in your car and honk your horn. Get your butt out and knock on her door. When she does get in your car, open the door for her. Open doors for her and pull out her chair for her. Always let her walk in front of you. Ask her if she's comfortable from time to time. Is she too cold or too hot? Offer her your jacket or hang up her coat. Always start off a date with a compliment to her. She made an effort, so tell her she looks beautiful, stunning, pretty, or both beautiful and stunning.

This doesn't mean you should become obsessed with Power Yoga or trail her to the Farmer's Market every Saturday like a little dog for her. It does mean that you should show an interest in some of the things she loves to do and to ask about her passion for them without being too intrusive. If she loves to write poems or paint, ask if you could see some of her verses and canvasses. If she's going to a book reading one night and asks if you'd like to come along, say yes. This doesn't mean that you should start doing a whole bunch of things that seem completely boring to you. It does mean that you should show that you care about the girl's interests and that you'll support her as much as you can."

[6] X Expert Source Cher Gopman Dating Coach Expert Interview. 17 May 2019. This may sound completely obvious, but you'd be surprised by the number of guys who barely look into a girl's eyes either because they're too shy, or too busy looking at their cell phones to really pay attention to their girl's eyes. [7] X Research source This doesn't mean you have to be creepy and gaze into the girl's eyes 100% of the time, but when she's talking to you and you're really listening, take a look into her eyes to show that you care about her. Making eye contact will also make it easier for you to be really attuned to your girl's feelings. If you look away from her face, you may not see that she's really upset or agitated until it's way too late for you to do it."

Though you may think that your girl must know how you feel because you are shy to tell her from time to time, physical affection can go a long way in sweeping her off her feet. You don't have to have your arm around her all the time or hold her hand 24/7 [you may be surprised to hear that plenty of girls don't like it all the time], but you should give her a loving touch or gesture when you're together often enough to make her feel loved to you. Here are some things you can do: If you're at the movies or walking around, hold her hand for at least a part of it -- if she wants you to hold her hand. If you're on the couch together, don't forget to snuggle or cuddle with her to make her feel special and loved. When taking photographs, you can put an arm around her to make her feel close to you for the photo If you're talking and she's upset, put a hand on her knee, stroke her arm, or hold her hand to let her know you care about her. When you greet her and kiss her, run your hands through her hair or touch the back of her head slightly but not too much. Don't forget to touch her playfully. Picking her up, or just playfully swatting each other is a great way to show affection to each other."

You have to support her, whether it's by watching her soccer game or being there for her after the death of her grandmother or her mother. Love isn't always just fun and games and affection, and to really sweep her off her feet, you have to be part of the complete package and be there for her when she needs you with her. If she's really into sports, be there to watch her games when you can, or at least don't forget to ask how it went for her sports games like a baseball game, basketball game. If she has a tough exam coming up, help her study, or support her by bringing her lunch or offering to do small favors for her while she studies for her exam. If she's having a stressful week at work, take it easy on her. Help her relax by planning a stress-free night in and don't bring up any big questions right then and there."

      "content": "Give her unexpected kisses. Sure, kissing her in the middle of a hot hook-up session will make her feel good, but it's the unexpected kisses that count the most. If you're just chatting in the middle of a date or having a nice stroll through a park, give her a kiss and say, \"I just had to kiss you right now. You look so pretty or beautiful right now.\" That will really impress her and she will want to kiss you too. And once you're kissing, make sure you give her a kiss every time you see her without making her feel neglected or a nobody. Not every kiss has to be a full-on French kiss. A gentle kiss on the lips is a great way to show you care about her and to mix things up right away. Before leaning in for an unexpected kiss, make sure you know your girl well enough to recognize that she'll be comfortable with this."

Make sure you have a weekly date night, no matter how stressed and tired you both are, and you'll continue to make your girl feel loved and cared about. Romance doesn't have to mean chocolate. It just means making time to show each other that you care about each other."

Shoot her a text once a day to let her know you're thinking of her or about her, or send her an email from work with a link that made you think about her. Don't check in eight times a day unless you want to seem overbearing about it, but if you're started seriously dating, don't let a day go by without a quick phone call or a text. Though it's important to let her see how much you care when you're together, it's equally important for her to see that she's on your mind when you're apart."

Though it may not be as glamorous to pick up a few groceries for her when she's in a pinch, to fix the broken table leg in her living room, or to go to the vet with her when her kitty is sick, these are the things that will make her think that wow, you really must care about her.

Whatever you do that feels new, it will keep the girl's adrenaline pumping and will keep making her excited about the relationship. [9] X Research source This could mean running a marathon together, learning to scuba dive, or even learning a new language. When a new task is presented, have the \"say yes\" mentality, instead of saying \"no\" and thinking of all the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea."

While you can start off a steamy and exciting romance without ever meeting her friends and family, if you want to be in it for the long haul, then you have to make the effort to get to know her friends and to be polite and kind when it comes to meeting her family. Even if you don't quite hit it off with her friends right away, give them a chance. If you stick with the girl, it's likely they'll be a part of your life forever. Sure, family events aren't always the most fun, but don't complain about it. If you really care about her, then you have to really care about her family -- even if you'd rather be watching the big game than hanging out at her uncle's birthday party."

She will be wowed that you're not possessive or jealous enough to want to be around all of the time, and she'll like you even more for it.

You have to keep things fresh if you don't want the girl to lose interest. Bring her flowers, continue to compliment her every day, and find new activities that you can do together, like hiking or learning to cook to keep things excited and not boring. If you already reached the \"I love you\" phase, make sure to say it at least once a day to keep showing that you care about her."
