Although trench foot was termed over a hundred years ago and seems to be something of the past, it can still occur in people who spend many hours in cold, wet conditions. One of the best ways to treat trench foot is to keep your feet dry and clean . If you find yourself standing in water for a few hours or more, clean and dry them as often as you can, and change into dry socks as soon as possible.

[4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source The heat will open up (dilate) blood vessels and increase the circulation to your feet, which will stop the progression of trench foot. Apply warm packs or soak your feet in warm water for approximately 5-10 minutes. Resist the urge to use hot water, because you may scald your feet and make the condition worse."

      "content": "Take off your socks while sleeping and resting. Once you've warmed your feet up, it's important to keep your socks off initially while you rest and sleep in your bed. This may seem counterintuitive for cold feet, but wearing tight socks can reduce blood circulation and make trench foot worse. [5] X Research source After a few days of recovery, you can wear loose socks made of breathable material, such as cotton. Instead of socks, keep your feet warm while resting by covering them with a wool blanket. Don't elevate your feet while sitting on the couch because you want to encourage blood flow to your lower legs and feet. While lying in bed at night, add another blanket to the bottom of your bed to keep your feet warm. Try not to cross your ankles, because that can slow circulation to your feet."

[6] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and or naproxen (Aleve) are common over-the-counter types that work well. Anti-inflammatories work best and are safest if taken for short periods of time—less than a few weeks. Once trench foot sets in, it can take between a few weeks to several months to fully heal, depending on the severity and the overall health of the person."

Other signs of infection to look out for include bloody pus discharge, red and/or white streaks on your feet, foul odor and mild fever.

If you notice any signs of infection on your feet, or if the tissue doesn't look normal, see a healthcare provider as soon as possible.

In addition to dark discoloration, other signs of gangrene include: further swelling, severe pain then a loss of sensation, peeling away of skin, foul-smelling discharge and disfigurement of toes. In severe cases of trench foot where gangrene has set in, foot and lower leg amputation is usually required."

The majority of people don't want to stand in cold water for very long, although some jobs and pastimes (fly fishing or seeing outdoor concerts) significantly increase the risk of developing trench foot. Keep an eye on the clock and remember that trench foot can develop in as little as 12 hours or so under some circumstances. Retreat to dry ground within that time frame if possible.

If your job or situation requires spending substantial amounts of time standing in wet or damp conditions, it's important to check or monitor your socks regularly to see if they're damp or wet also.

[11] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source If you're on the job or need to walk or stand in wet conditions, pack a few extra pair of socks with you just in case. For wet conditions, use polypropylene sock liners , which are specially designed to draw moisture away from your feet. Socks made out of natural fibers, such as cotton and wool, tend to be better for preventing trench foot than artificial materials."

      "content": "Wear properly fitting footwear. Ideally, you should wear waterproof boots that fit above your ankle, but regardless of type, make sure they fit well—not too loose or too tight. Stick to shoes or boots made out of treated leather, and avoid ones made of synthetic materials, such as rubber or vinyl. Leather is more expensive, but repels moisture while being able to breathe. [12] X Research source Depending on your situation, it may be best to change your footwear a few times daily and let the wet pair dry out overnight. Rubber boots and gators are great for spending a few hours standing in the water (for fly fishing, for example), but can help trigger trench foot after many hours, especially if the rubber doesn't have an insulating inner lining."

An old trick used back in the World War I era to prevent trench foot was to apply lots of whale oil to the feet in order to repel the moisture and help insulate the feet from the cold.

[13] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Another method of keeping feet dry is to sprinkle some talcum powder on them, which helps absorb the moisture instead of repelling it. Talcum powder is especially recommended for people who tend to sweat more. Excessive perspiration can also be controlled by applying drying agents, such as aluminum chloride."

      "title": "Trench foot is caused by prolonged exposure to moisture or water.",
      "content": "Trench foot is caused by prolonged exposure to moisture or water. Trench foot develops because the blood vessels of the feet constrict in an attempt to keep the rest of the body warm, which reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients the tissue gets. Without adequate oxygen and nutrients, the tissues of the feet swell and eventually die. Bacteria in the water can also trigger infections if there's cuts or abrasions on the feet. [15] X Research source Trench foot can take less than a day of water exposure (as few as 12 hours) to develop. While trench foot typically happens in wet conditions, it can also happen in dry climates if the temperature stays between 30 and 40 °F (−1 and 4 °C)."
