      "content": "Slide your glasses beneath the hijab fabric as an easy solution. Check that the glasses are touching your skin and hair, then tuck them around your ears. If you’re wearing an undercap, you may need to tuck your glasses beneath the material. This is a really popular option for a lot of people who wear hijabs. If your hijab is made of a smooth, slippery material like chiffon, this might be a good option for you."

      "content": "Select light-colored glasses to match a warmer skin tone. Look in the mirror to see if your skin has a warm tone, or if it has subtle pink and blue undertones. If so, shop for frames with lighter, pastel colors, like light pink or peach. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to skin tone. If you have your heart set on a pair of glasses that don’t naturally complement your skin, feel free to wear them! Above all, choose glasses that best match your personal style."
