For “yes,” say \"opo” when talking to social superiors, such as people from an older generation, one's boss or teacher, or even the President or royalty. Simply use \"oo\" for \"yes\" for one's equals, those younger than you, or those of a lower social rank than you. [2] X Research source Yes: Oo (informal) / Opo (formal) No: Hindi (informal) / Hindi po (formal) Thank you: Salamat po Thank you very much: Maraming salamat You're welcome: Waláng anumán (literally, \"nothing at all\") \"Po\" is the correct word to show respect. Technically, it means \"sir\" or \"ma'am.” Add it after the phrase, such as with the formal “yes” and “no” or “thank you.”"

      "content": "Sound out Tagalog words phonetically as you begin learning. With its origins in several native languages, a heavy dose of Spanish, and a growing English influence, you might think Tagalog pronunciation would be a real challenge. However, when it is adapted to the Latin alphabet (which is now most common in the Philippines), the language is almost entirely phonetic—that is, the words sound the way they look. So, if you “sound out” a word in Tagalog, you'll likely be pretty close on the correct pronunciation. [10] X Research source Check out, for instance, the following examples, in which the Tagalog words are phonetic forms of their English counterparts: Automobile / Awtomobil; Economics / Ekonomiks; Website / Websayt. With further practice and immersion in the language, you'll be able to pick up on some of the limited phonetic variations in Tagalog."

Immersing yourself in a language by listening to native speakers converse can be a great way to pick up the most commonly-used words and phrases. If you have Filipino friends, ask them to converse in the language and try to follow along with them. Ask them for tips along the way and try your hand at saying some key words and phrases. [11] X Research source If you have a background in English or Spanish, you'll likely pick up on many phonetic (sound-alike) connections to Tagalog. These can help you follow along and pick up new words more quickly. If you're in the Philippines, try to follow Tagalog conversations and ask questions or for clarifications in English. Most Filipinos speak a fair amount of English, and they're usually happy to help someone who wants to pick up some Tagalog!"
