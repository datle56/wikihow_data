      "title": "Wet the bar of soap so it’s softer.",
      "content": "Wet the bar of soap so it’s softer. Hold the soap under running water for a few seconds to get it moist. This will make it easier to use on your pet. However, you may want to hold the soap in a towel or rag so that it’s not slippery. [1] X Research source If the soap you’re using has been in the bath for a while, you may not need to wet it. Any kind of bar soap will work, but you cannot use hand soap to treat your pet’s bleeding quick."

      "title": "Hold your pet’s foot to keep it steady.",
      "content": "Hold your pet’s foot to keep it steady. It’s best to hold your pet in your lap as you apply the soap. Then, grasp their foot with a firm, but gentle, pressure. Since they’re experiencing discomfort, it’s normal for your pet to want to pull away from you. [2] X Research source If you can, ask someone to help you apply the soap to your pet’s foot."

    {
      "title": "Press the bleeding nail into the bar of soap.",
      "content": "Press the bleeding nail into the bar of soap. Twist the soap as you push the nail a few millimeters into the bar of soap. Not only will the twisting make the nail go in more easily, it will also coat the nail in a thin layer of soap, which can help stop the bleeding. [3] X Research source Make sure you aren’t holding onto your pet’s foot too tightly. You don’t want to squeeze its foot while trying to push the nail into the soap, as this can hurt your pet."

    {
      "title": "Hold the nail in the soap for 2-5 minutes to stop the bleeding.",
      "content": "Hold the nail in the soap for 2-5 minutes to stop the bleeding. You can check on the nail after 2 minutes to see it's still bleeding. If so, put the nail back into the soap. [4] X Research source It’s okay if soap is stuck to the end of your pet’s nail. This will help keep the clot in place, and it will eventually rub off of the nail. If your pet’s nail is still bleeding after 5-7 minutes, you may need to take them to the vet."

      "title": "Mix baking soda, baking flour, and cornstarch in a bowl.",
      "content": "Mix baking soda, baking flour, and cornstarch in a bowl. These common household ingredients have a similar effect to clotting powder. Add 1 part baking soda, 1 part baking flour, and 1 part cornstarch, then stir them together.

The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show.

      "content": "Scoop out a spoonful of the mixture and pour it into your pet’s cut nail. You can also use your hand to scoop the powder. You will likely see a hollow inside the nail, which you will fill with your clotting mixture. [7] X Research source Don’t worry if most of the powder falls away from the nail. The next step will coat the nail in your homemade clotting powder."

Make sure the powder covers the entire end of the nail so that the quick is submerged.

      "content": "Hold the nail in place for 2 minutes, then check it. Your pet will likely try to pull away, so keep a gentle, but firm, pressure on the foot. After 2 minutes, check to see if the quick is still bleeding. [9] X Research source Your pet’s nail will likely have powder crusted around the end of the nail, which will help stop the bleeding. Don’t clean off the powder, as this might cause the quick to start bleeding again."

If the quick is still bleeding after 2 minutes, press the nail back into the powder for up to 3 additional minutes. Then, check to see if the bleeding has stopped.

You should see a thin layer forming on the quick. [14] X Research source The styptic pencil may sting when it’s first applied, so your pet may whimper or try to pull away. However, this sensation should pass after a few minutes."

      "content": "Check that the bleeding has stopped. Remove the pencil from the quick and look to see if the bleeding has stopped.
