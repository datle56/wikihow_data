      "content": "Pick something you enjoy that has the potential to make money. It’s important that you’re passionate about the focus of your blog so you can stay motivated. Do market research to see if there are people interested in the topic so you can figure out if there’s a potential to make a profit. Check out the competition by searching for similar blogs as well. The smaller your niche, the better you’ll be able to market to specific people. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re really passionate about cycling, there are probably a bunch of blogs and sites dedicated to cycling. But if you can narrow your niche and target a specific demographic such as middle-aged women cyclists, you can carve out a corner in the market. You can also search for online trends by visiting Google Trends."

      "content": "Choose one that describes your niche or industry. A domain name is the web address of your site. While most blogging sites offer free domain names, if you want to attract more attention, make it easier for people to find you, and look more professional, you want a custom domain name. Use a domain name provider such as BlueHost, Google Sites, or HostGator and choose a name that’s short, includes relevant keywords, and reflects your site’s topic or niche. [3] X Research source For example, if your blog is about caring for hermit crabs, you could have a domain name like “hermithome.com” or “hermitcrabcentral.com.”"

On the other hand, if your blog is about mountain climbing, which you know a lot about, you wouldn’t want to write about long-distance running if you don’t have much experience with it."
