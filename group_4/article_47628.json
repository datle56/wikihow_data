      "content": "Select the right sized ring. Your knuckle ring size will be the same as your traditional ring size. To determine your ring size, measure the circumference of your finger with measuring tape and compare it to a ring sizing chart.

You can also get your ring size measured at most jewelry stores free of charge. If you feel like the ring is slipping off you need a smaller ring size. If the ring is cutting off the circulation to your fingertip, you should purchase a ring that has a larger ring size. Don't force a ring on because it may become stuck."
