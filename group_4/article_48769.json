      "title": "You're using the wrong vape juice.",
      "content": "You're using the wrong vape juice. There are two kinds of vape juice, or e-liquids, that you can use in refillable e-cigarette disposables: propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) vapor. [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Using the wrong juice can cause the coils to burn or the cartridge to leak. You may also experience discomfort or a burning sensation in your throat after you pull. If you’re a smoker more interested in the vapor experience, aim for a VG ratio above 70%. [2] X Research source When paired with vapes that fire above 20 watts, you’ll end up with thicker clouds and stronger flavors. For smokers interested in a throat hit, use Mouth to Lung (MTL) vape kits with a PG ratio above 50% at low-heat like 20 watts or less. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Your vape is low on e-liquid.",
      "content": "Your vape is low on e-liquid. The less vape juice left in your cart, the more you expose the device's wicks to the coils. When this happens, the wicks get dry and overheat, creating a dry hit when you pull. When left unaddressed, a dry hit turns into a burnt hit. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Your coils are primed incorrectly.",
      "content": "Your coils are primed incorrectly. Priming refers to the process of coating a vape's coils or wicks in oil (for cannabis pens) or vape juice (for e-cigarettes). [5] X Research source This allows the vape to heat up and properly turn the juice into vapor. However, you'll experience a dry or burnt hit if you don't give your coils adequate time or saturation. For most vapes, you only need to prime the coils the first time you use it. However, chain vaping can contribute to the problem, too."

    {
      "title": "You're not allowing your vape to rest between hits.",
      "content": "You're not allowing your vape to rest between hits. Vapes perform best when the wick can soak in the vape juice before being heated by the coils and turned into vapor. When you chain vape, which is the act of smoking back to back without any pause, the wick doesn't have time to draw up more vape juice, so when you pull, the coils end up burning the wick."
    },
    {
      "title": "Your coils are old or scorched.",
      "content": "Your coils are old or scorched. You may overwork your vape's coils if you're refilling your cartridge with more e-liquid. Built for one-time use, the coils inside will grow old or scorched, resulting in a burnt taste when overused."
    },
    {
      "title": "Your vape's voltage is too high.",
      "content": "Your vape's voltage is too high. Many vapes offer adjustable wattage settings that control the coil's heat, affecting how you smoke. However, every vape has a wattage range. You're putting yourself at risk for a burnt flavor when you go beyond that."

    {
      "title": "Your faulty vape is the result of a manufacturing error.",
      "content": "Your faulty vape is the result of a manufacturing error. You're bound to wind up with a defective vape every once in a while. Faults include inefficient coils and faulty wicks or batteries. If this is the case, it's time to get a new one from a different seller or brand."

    {
      "title": "Use the correct vape juice for your device.",
      "content": "Use the correct vape juice for your device. If you prefer discretion when you smoke, it’s important to pair the right vape juice with the right device. For instance, e-liquids with high PG require low heat, so pairing it with a vape that burns between 35 and 50 watts would only cause it to burn. Instead, you’d want to pair PGs above 50% with an MTL tank, which works best for thinner juices. Use Sub-ohm tanks for VG juice for a thicker, stronger vapor delivery. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Inspect your specific vape's user manual to determine what type of vape juice is compatible with your device."

      "title": "Refill your cartridge.",
      "content": "Refill your cartridge. One of the major causes of a vape's burnt taste is a lack of e-liquid. When this happens, the vape's wick can't draw enough juice to soak from, resulting in less vapor production. If you have a refillable disposable vape or know how to hack it, top it off with your choice of juice. With your hands, a pair of pliers, or a similar tool, remove the vape's mouthpiece. Brush off any residue from the mouthpiece with a cotton swab or Q-tip before running it under cold water. [7] X Research source For a deeper clean, douse the cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and rub it along the mouthpiece before rinsing under hot water. [8] X Research source Remove the rubber chimney (in Elf Bar devices) or rubber circle (in battery pens) to reveal the cotton pad beneath. [9] X Research source Take your vape juice and add enough drops to soak the cotton pad inside. Afterwards, place the rubber piece back, snap the mouthpiece on, and start pulling!

      "title": "Prime your coils.",
      "content": "Prime your coils. When you first buy a disposable vape or replace your device's coils, give your vape time for its juice to saturate the wicking material inside. Shake the disposable lightly to move the e-liquid around the coil and wick. You can also try to: Stand your cartridge upright for at least 10 minutes to allow the vape juice or oil to sink into the wick. Take a light pull without activating the coils. Adjust your wattage settings to the lowest temperature or voltage and pull to activate the heating coil. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Allow your vape to rest between hits.",
      "content": "Allow your vape to rest between hits. After taking a long pull, avoid going in for another. Allow your vape 15 to 20 seconds to absorb more liquid before pulling again. [12] X Research source You can also shorten your pulls, aiming for 5 to 8 seconds."

    {
      "title": "Unclog your coils.",
      "content": "Unclog your coils. A burnt flavor from your disposable and reduced vapor results from the residue left by e-liquid. Thoroughly clean your coil by removing it from the device. Run it under hot water for a few seconds to eliminate flaky residue. You'll also want to boil a pot of water and submerge it for 30 minutes to lift any stubborn grime. [13] X Research source Allow the coil to dry for 24 hours before returning it to the device. Cleaning your coils is a temporary solution that may add a few days or weeks to your device. Eventually, you must replace your coil or invest in a new device."

      "title": "Replace your vape's coils.",
      "content": "Replace your vape's coils. To increase your device's lifespan, you'll want to replace the coil once you experience a burnt taste. Remove the tank, empty any remaining e-liquid, and twist off the coil. Be sure to pre-saturate your coil with 5-8 drops of vape juice before screwing it back on. Check your product's instruction manual to determine the type of coil replacement you need, or speak to an employee at your local vape store."

      "title": "Adjust the wattage settings.",
      "content": "Adjust the wattage settings. Your vape's wattages work hand-in-hand with its coils. If your vape only supports 20-50 watts, setting it to 60 watts can lead to a burnt taste. Refer to your device's User Manual or instructions to locate the specific wattage range for your vape."

      "title": "Store your vape in dry, cool places.",
      "content": "Store your vape in dry, cool places. If you're not actively using your vape, leave it in a drawer or a cupboard. Aim for temperatures between 50 and 77°F (30 to 25°C). When left in excessive heat or direct sunlight, your vape's e-liquid will break down, affecting its taste, texture, and strength. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Unplug your vape after 2 hours.",
      "content": "Unplug your vape after 2 hours. For most vapes, a battery can charge between 1-2 hours. However, it all depends on the quality of your charger and the device itself. A green light will turn on for most vapes when your battery is 100%. If you allow your device to overcharge, the battery may let out more voltage, heating the coils unintentionally."

      "content": "Replace your disposable vape. If you've followed all of the steps above and you continue to experience a burnt taste, it's time to replace your disposable vape. When purchasing a new one, opt for a different brand, model, or vape shop to avoid future issues."
