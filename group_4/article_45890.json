    {
      "title": "Be sure to have a powerful deck.",
      "content": "Be sure to have a powerful deck . Use a win condition card that will attack the towers like hog, x-bow, giant, or battle ram. These are the tank or main damage dealers. You will then need win condition supports, or cards that cover your win conditions weaknesses to help then become stronger. Wait for ten elixir at the beginning of a match. This helps you so you can use elixir to support your push. If you put down a hog rider as soon as you have four elixir, this will be your downfall. The opponent might have skeleton army and shut down your hog since you didn't have enough elixir for arrows or zap."
    },
    {
      "title": "If you are stuck with a bad hand, wait for your opponent to make the first move.",
      "content": "If you are stuck with a bad hand, wait for your opponent to make the first move. Say you have fireball, Wizard, tornado, and golem. These are all bad to use at the beginning or too risky. Wait for your opponent to make a move and react accordingly. However, don't do this every match. If you have cards like skeletons, ice spirit, or Bats, play them because they are low-risk for starting off . How you know a card is good for cycling is if its 1-2 elixir in cost but if it's like a spell or ice golem wall breakers then generally don't cycle them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a crown tower to focus on and continue attacking it.",
      "content": "Choose a crown tower to focus on and continue attacking it. This wears down the same tower, so all your damage goes in one spot. It is helpful in every match. The only reason you wouldn't do this is if the opponent puts down a Golem. Then, you should rush the other lane with hog, X-Bow, or Giant preferably. Certain cards are weak to other cards so if you use hog rider than take a zap/lightning/Electro wizard to kill inferno ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Get positive elixir trades.",
      "content": "Get positive elixir trades. Use less elixir to counter a troop than it cost to play it. For example, counter minion horde with arrows or P.E.K.K.A. with bats. Getting ahead in elixir lets you play more cards. Some cards are very good at getting positive elixir trades. These are inferno tower, knight, skeletons and ice golem Remember that you don't need to counter everything. You can let some goblins touch your tower so you will have more elixir for a game-winning push."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare powerful combinations of troops.",
      "content": "Prepare powerful combinations of troops. Send a tank followed by a high damage splash unit such as a wizard. The tank such as a giant, will tank the tower will the wizard wrecks it. The wizard will also destroy any swarm cards your opponent places to counter it. However, a good opponent might have inferno tower for your giant and knight for your wizard. Next time, be sure to add some more troops to your push so this doesn't work. Have spells to support your push, like electro wizard for inferno and mini pekka for knight. Zap, freeze, and fireball are good examples."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use less reliable ways to win or lose quickly.",
      "content": "Use less reliable ways to win or lose quickly. When you opponent places an expensive troop, immediately rush with all your elixir. Your opponent might not be able to counter this and you will quickly destroy them. High damage building targeting troops are the best like hog, Royal giant and balloon. The other person might be ready for this and score some positive elixir trades if you aren't careful."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use synergies.",
      "content": "Use synergies. These cards pair well with each other, but are different from win conditions and win condition supports. These cards work well played apart and played together. Examples are fireball and zap, P.E.K.K.A and valkyrie, Inferno Dragon and wizard, Balloon and Princess, executioner and tornado, and miner and goblin barrel."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know your opponent's counters.",
      "content": "Know your opponent's counters. If your opponent always has inferno to counter your hog, don't place your hog as soon as you get it. Wait for your opponent to use their inferno and its health to go down. Place your hog and if you're lucky, your opponent won't have inferno tower in cycle. After your opponent places a card, it takes 4 more cards to get back to it. Try to keep track of their hand or at least their win condition and main defensive unit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place buildings in front of the King tower and 3-4 tiles from the river.",
      "content": "Place buildings in front of the King tower and 3-4 tiles from the river. This allows them to distract troops coming down both lane and defend your towers better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure the troops are going on the tower you are attacking if you use spawners.",
      "content": "Make sure the troops are going on the tower you are attacking if you use spawners. Place a spawner slightly in that lane."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a troop behind the crown tower that shoots, like Musketeer, Witch, Wizard, Princess, Ice Wizard, etc.",
      "content": "Place a troop behind the crown tower that shoots, like Musketeer, Witch, Wizard, Princess, Ice Wizard, etc. The crown tower will act as a wall for your troops. Now you have a double team fighting your opposing troops! If they have multiple troops attacking, place a durable troop for distraction (e.g. P.E.K.K.A) so your tower doesn't suffer too much damage.. If you put the troop in front of the tower, the enemy will swiftly kill it. This method protects the troop so it will live to fight another time and save you elixir. So go ahead and give it a shot!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Have at least one main defensive unit and one defensive support.",
      "content": "Have at least one main defensive unit and one defensive support. The main one can be a building, barbarians, minion horde, or some other combinations working together. Supporting defenders are typically ranged attackers that deal a lot of damage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be ready at all times.",
      "content": "Be ready at all times. The enemy can quickly put a hog rider at the bridge and if you are distracted, it will wreck your tower. Look at your device at all times, disable notifications, and get rid of distractions like your family tapping at your screen for no reason."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have units countered by the same thing in your deck.",
      "content": "Have units countered by the same thing in your deck. Use minion horde and goblin barrel. Your opponent only has one arrows and will have to choose. Whichever one it is, the other card will deal a lot of damage. This applies to both offense and defense. Skeleton army is amazing, but is easily countered by zap. Bait this counter out and all your opponent's cards will get wrecked."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use Minions and Baby Dragons when someone uses a Balloon.",
      "content": "Use Minions and Baby Dragons when someone uses a Balloon. If you don't have that, you can alternate with the Musketeer. Avoid using Minion Hordes as they can be countered with Arrows. (Since Arrows only cost 3 elixirs and Minion Hordes cost 5 elixirs, your enemy will have an advantage of 2 elixir.) Mega minion is also a better choice because it cannot be arrowed down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Zap spell against the Skeleton Armies.",
      "content": "Use the Zap spell against the Skeleton Armies. It only costs two elixir and it is faster to strike than Arrows, but you have to be accurate, as the Zap Spell has a shorter range. The zap Spell can do more than just smashing multiple enemies! If your opponent places down annoying Inferno Towers and Sparkies, use the Zap Spell to freeze them for a split second! It will reset their charge giving you more time to destroy it. Use it at the right time though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use Goblins, Skeletons, or anything fast to push the giant, if you want your slow, tank troop to go faster.",
      "content": "Use Goblins, Skeletons, or anything fast to push the giant, if you want your slow, tank troop to go faster. The Valkyrie and the Prince deal massive amounts of damage! Just use the Prince to push the Valkyrie. Also, the Valkyrie and Goblins is a good duo as the goblins can push the Valkyrie but the duo is counter-able with flying units."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Rocket when people use those pesky spawners.",
      "content": "Use the Rocket when people use those pesky spawners. The Rocket timed correctly can deal a large amount of damage within a group of highly durable troops, but the Lighting Spell is good too because it will zap up to three targets at once with a circular radius which is really handy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Fireball against Barbarians and Minion Horde.",
      "content": "Use the Fireball against Barbarians and Minion Horde. It is only really worth it to fireball musketeers, witches, wizards, and electro wizards if your fireball one shots them. Otherwise, they are still alive and your opponent can put a giant in front to tank."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Princess to take out Spear Goblins, Goblins, Minions, Archers, etc.",
      "content": "Use the Princess to take out Spear Goblins, Goblins, Minions, Archers, etc. Also, use the Baby Dragon to take out Barbarian Hordes and Fire Spirits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the Bomber wisely.",
      "content": "Use the Bomber wisely. It throws Bombs that actually deal a lot of damage! They throw from a distance while is handy, so if you want to take out Barbarians, you can substitute the Valkyrie for a Bomber. Just remember to place it a distance away from an enemy troop group, as the Bomber doesn't really have lots of HP."
    },
    {
      "title": "Destroy spawners before they do too much damage to your crown towers.",
      "content": "Destroy spawners before they do too much damage to your crown towers. It stacks up over time. They will also net your opponent positive elixir trades. Damage can be dealt with barbarians and goblins with Bomb towers, but the furnace is cheaper than the Bomb Tower. Use it with caution, however, because the furnace is a spawner, and the fire spirits it produces can be quickly destroyed before they launch their explosive attack!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Kite troops around.",
      "content": "Kite troops around. Use ice golem at the river, just when the P.E.K.K.A. crosses the river. Deploy it in the other lane to make the big robot go on a long walk. The arena towers will constantly shoot at it and the P.E.K.K.A. will die in no time. Use skeletons in the center to distract many other troops including Minion Horde."
    },
    {
      "title": "Counter a P.E.K.K.A when you need to!",
      "content": "Counter a P.E.K.K.A when you need to! Her weakness is that she walks too slow. Using a Knight, Skeletons, Barbarians, Goblins, or anything that is cheap and either durable or spawns a lot is the best counter strategy. A Musketeer would be great for supporting the troops attacking the P.E.K.K.A too!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your opponent have second thoughts to Inferno Towers!",
      "content": "Make your opponent have second thoughts to Inferno Towers! If you place down a tank, you can also spawn a Battle Ram behind it, so anytime your opponent uses an Inferno Tower, or any other tower, the Battle Ram will rush forward and smash it up! Plus, you will also have 2 extra Barbarians to support the tank. Zap can reset an Inferno Tower's target and damage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use tornado to get many positive elixir trades.",
      "content": "Use tornado to get many positive elixir trades. You can put it at the corner of your king tower to pull hog riders, goblin barrels, elite barbarians, miners and more to your king tower and save your arena towers. Best of all, tornado is only 3 elixir. Pair it with executioner or wizard to wreck any push."
    },
    {
      "title": "Counter a skeleton barrel as soon as possible, since it can be very deadly for just 3 elixir.",
      "content": "Counter a skeleton barrel as soon as possible, since it can be very deadly for just 3 elixir. Keep in mind that the barrel will not deal damage when it drops down, and don't think you have to be super early to counter it. Once you see the last balloon about to pop, aim your spell or building or troop and prepare yourself!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Push slower troops with troops with a very fast speed.",
      "content": "Push slower troops with troops with a very fast speed. For example, push a Valkyrie with a Prince or Hog Rider for a low-risk and high-reward combo. Or push a Giant Skeleton/Giant/Golem with Battle Ram. This will make the slower troop get to the tower and deal damage faster."
