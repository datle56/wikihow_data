      "content": "Take a short nap before the exam, if possible. Academic tutor and professional test prep specialist Jake Adams recommends a quick nap to help you feel more alert and remember all the details you studied for your test: “If possible, see if there's a possibility for a nap because naps have the ability to put you into your REM sleep cycle. Studies have shown that just entering your REM sleep cycle is helpful for reintegrating memory. So if that's possible, do that.” [1] X Expert Source Jake Adams Academic Tutor & Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 24 July 2020. Aim for no longer than a 20- to 30-minute nap. Anything longer and you’ll probably end up feeling even groggier than before. [2] X Research source You could try to take a nap on the bus ride to school, during a study hall, or during a break between classes."

Staying cold can keep you alert, so take off that sweater and put on a t-shirt. If you're too warm, you're more likely to get sleepy. There are even studies that show your brain works better when you’re a little chilly (it takes more energy and glucose to cool you down than to heat you up, so being cold gives your brain more energy).

To help you get as much light as possible, try to sit by a window. You'll get light from both outside and inside, and the natural light can help keep you awake. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take brain breaks. If you feel like you're having trouble concentrating, take a few seconds to refresh your brain. Just looking away can help some, but taking a few deep breaths is even better. Getting more oxygen to your brain can make you feel more alert. [6] X Research source Try the “stimulating breath” technique. Close your mouth and breathe rapidly in and out through your nose for 10 seconds, then take a break and repeat. Keep your breaths short and quick."

If you can, run outside to get a breath of fresh air and look at the sky or some trees, since nature can help wake you up. Even just walking around the halls can make you more alert.

A lack of sleep can impair your memory, so Adams suggests “refreshing your memory with your notes and indoor study guides right up until the test time. That way, you eliminate that memory loss that you are probably going to have because you didn't have very good sleep.” [8] X Expert Source Jake Adams Academic Tutor & Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Keep your notecards, notebooks, study guides, or any other review materials handy so you can easily pull them out to review leading up to exam time."

      "content": "Read the questions carefully. You're going to be very sleepy and tired, and that can cause you to miss things in the questions. Read each question thoroughly and check that you understand it completely before you answer. That way, you won't make careless mistakes. [9] X Research source If you have to, try moving your lips as you read. Pretending to read out loud can slow you down enough that you pay more attention to the question."

      "content": "Work on the hardest parts of the test first. When you get your test, skim through it to see what’s on it. Your brain will be the most alert and ready at the beginning of the test, and you may wear out later. So, try to tackle the hardest or most important parts first so that you have enough brain power to get through them. [10] X Research source Alternatively, work on the parts you know best first. That way, you can breeze through them without making mistakes. However, you may have a harder time when it comes to the parts you find more difficult."

To help, try writing down every relevant fact you can remember in a place you can easily reference, like a piece of scratch paper (this is called a “brain dump”). [11] X Research source Then, you can use your notes to help you answer tricky questions or recall information you may have forgotten. Most teachers will at least give you partial credit if you get part of the answer right, so answer questions as completely as you can. To take an educated guess from a choice of answers, start by crossing out the answers you know are wrong. If you can't figure out the answer, just pick one between the ones leftover."

When you are tired, you're more likely to obsess over the questions you can't answer at all, trying to figure out the answer. Instead of obsessing, just skip the ones you don't know for now. If you have time at the end of the test, go back to the ones you skipped to see if you can figure out an answer. Often, other parts of the test can give you a clue. [12] X Research source"

Take a few deep breaths to make sure you're calm, and then just take it one question at a time. [15] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 316 wikiHow readers how they manage their time during tests, and only 13% of them said keeping an eye on the clock to pace themselves.

However, you don't want to extend your sleep by hitting the snooze button, as that can just make you more tired. Instead, think about the latest time you could get up and still get to your exam. Set your alarm for that time. [16] X Research source Put your alarm clock or phone out of reach, so that you don't hit snooze without thinking about it."

It's important to skip the sunglasses, at least at first. The sunlight needs to hit your eyes for you to receive the waking up benefits of being outside. [17] X Research source Try going for a short walk or sitting near a bright window to get a dose of sunlight before your exam. Sunlight increases your serotonin levels, which can make you feel more positive and alert throughout the day."

Don't eat anything too heavy, as it can make you sleepy. Pick something that centers on protein with some energizing carbohydrates on the side for a boost. Carbohydrates keep you energized. [19] X Research source Try some yogurt with fruit, for instance, or a few links of chicken sausage and whole grain toast. You could also try some hummus with carrot sticks. If you're pressed for time, try a protein bar or shake."

If you choose to drink caffeine to give you a boost, make sure to do it about 30 minutes before the test so it has time to kick in by the time you take the test. Caffeine will usually only give you a boost if you don't drink it every day, so use it sparingly. [20] X Research source If you have the time and a quiet space, you can also drink a cup of coffee and take a 15-minute power nap. When you wake up, the caffeine will start to hit you and you’ll feel refreshed. Keep your caffeine consumption under 400 milligrams for the day. A single cup of coffee has about 100 milligrams.

Studies show that getting more sleep the night before a test is positively correlated to the number of correct answers on a test (AKA, a higher grade). [24] X Research source On the other hand, pulling an all-nighter or only getting a few hours of sleep is associated with worse concentration, reaction time, and decision making (AKA, things that can pull your grade down). [25] X Research source The fact is, getting a good night's sleep is one of the best things you can do to prepare for a test. What’s the bare minimum amount of sleep you need? Most people need a minimum of 3 hours of sleep to be (mostly) functional the next day. The best time to get those few hours is between 2AM and 6AM. [26] X Research source Keep in mind that if you just plain don’t know the test material, sleep won’t necessarily help you get a better score. You can’t remember what you didn’t know to begin with, after all."

Here are the most important things you can do to walk into class well-rested and prepared: [30] X Research source Start a good sleep routine several days (or weeks) ahead of the test. This will help you fall asleep easier the night before and cope with a lack of sleep if you pull an all-nighter. This includes going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. Limit your alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine consumption during the day. Avoid large meals or super hearty snacks 2 hours before bed time. Choose a light, healthy snack if you’re hungry. Try to get some physical activity (preferably outdoors) each day. Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet. Ignore electronics and screens (phones, laptops, tablets, TVs) 1 hour before bed and try not to keep them in your bedroom."

This way, you’re less likely to keep fixating on what you have to do tomorrow. [31] X Research source Set aside some specific “worry” time before bed. Choose a time to let yourself feel anxious and stress out for a few minutes, then take a deep breath and try to set those thoughts aside at bedtime. Talk back to your negative thoughts. If you’re thinking “I’ll fail my test because I can’t sleep” over and over, try countering with a positive thought like “I am prepared for the test and ready to do my best.” Try some meditation or mindfulness work. Get comfortable and just let your thoughts (good or bad) flow without judgment. Try journaling to release negative thoughts. Don’t try to force yourself to sleep. If you’re still wide awake after 15 minutes, get up and do something outside your bedroom to relax. Then, come back when you’re sleepy again. This keeps you from just laying in bed feeling frustrated. [32] X Research source"
