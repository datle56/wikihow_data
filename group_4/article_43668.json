      "content": "Store milk in small portions. Breast milk is only good for about 24 hours after thawing, so don’t freeze more than one day’s worth of milk in a single container. You can store your milk in special freezer bags or freezable bottles--two to four ounces is best for each container. If you're using a container, choose a glass or BPA-free plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. If you're using bags, avoid using normal storage bags or bottle liners. Choose bags designed for freezing breast milk."
