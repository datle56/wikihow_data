      "title": "The nickname \"Habs\" is short for the French word \"habitants.\"",
      "content": "The nickname \"Habs\" is short for the French word \"habitants.\" This is a word used for the French peasants who originally settled \"New France,\" a territory that historically included parts of modern-day Canada and the United States. This much is not in dispute—but where this nickname came from is a different issue altogether. [1] X Research source ' The mistake:' Tex Rickard, the then-owner of Madison Square Garden, told reporters in 1924 that the \"H\" in the Canadiens' \"CH\" logo stood for \"Habitants.\" [2] X Research source As legend has it, the reporters picked up that mistake and the nickname continued to be used as a result. ' The reality:' Turns out Rickard could be excused for believing this to be true because people had been calling the Canadiens \"the Habs\" for several years at that point. The first verified use of the nickname was in the February 9, 1914 issue of the French-Canadian newspaper Le Devoir . Some fans and historians also believe that the term \"habitants\" became widely associated with the team to distinguish it from the Montreal Wanderers, an English hockey club in the same city."

      "title": "The nickname \"habitants\" is controversial with modern French Canadians.",
      "content": "The nickname \"habitants\" is controversial with modern French Canadians. Modern French Canadians have largely divorced themselves from their agricultural and Roman Catholic roots. Because of this, the word \"habitants\" has come to symbolize backwoods country bumpkins and is typically considered more of an insult than anything else. [3] X Research source The shortened \"Habs\" version, though, which only applies to the beloved hockey franchise, doesn't suffer from this same understanding. The nickname has escaped relatively unscathed from the cultural shift. Despite having never been an official nickname of the NHL team, \"Habs\" is a common nickname and one you'll often hear repeated in regular conversation. Players and coaches don't normally use it though—at least not when talking to reporters."

The single \"C\" was still there, but now it was in a stylized Old English font and surrounded by a drawing of a maple leaf, a perennial symbol of Canada. [5] X Research source The logo was likely originally blue, as was the original 1909 logo, but it's sometimes stylized in green for retro uniforms. This particular version of the Canadiens' logo looks a lot like the modern-day logo of the Toronto Maple Leafs, although that club wasn't in existence yet when the Canadiens premiered the maple leaf design."

The maple leaf itself was red, although the letters were blue.

[7] X Research source The jerseys were white and the letters were solid red outlined by a blue pin-stripe. For the 1912-1913 season, the Canadiens wore red, white, and blue striped uniforms, affectionately known as the \"barber pole\" uniforms. [8] X Research source The Canadiens revisited the barber pole design for the team's retro uniforms for the 2009-2010 season—although it turned out the bright stripes were pretty tough to look at on hi-def TV screens. The team only donned the uniforms once, not twice, as originally planned. [9] X Research source"
