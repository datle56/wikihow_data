Makeup artist Cordelia Frost says that determining your face shape is all about looking at the balance between the widest and narrowest parts of your face. Here’s how to take your face measurements to see if you have a triangle face shape: Forehead: Touch your middle fingers to your eyebrows’ tails. Move your fingers halfway between your brows and your hairline and measure the width between them. [2] X Research source Cheekbones: Place your fingers on the corners of your eyes. Trace them down until you feel the bone at the top of your cheek and measure between them. [3] X Research source Jaw: Measure the distance between the base of your jaw right below your ear and the tip of your chin. Multiply the measurement by 2 to get your full jawline measurement. [4] X Research source You have a triangle face shape if: Your jawline is the widest measurement. Your cheekbones are slightly less wide than your jaw. Your forehead is the narrowest measurement."

      "content": "Straight hair with chin-grazing layers Straight hair that’s longer than jaw length can help balance your wider jawline with your narrower forehead. For shorter styles, opt for volume at the root and crown and soft layers at the jawline to soften your sharp angles. [5] X Research source Styles that taper along your jawline can make your forehead and cheekbone areas seem fuller to balance out your features. If you want to wear your hair longer than your collarbones, ask for layers from below the jawline to the ends to avoid fullness at the bottom of your style."

Make sure your fringe is on the heavier side and ends at your cheekbones. Part it on the side to bring fullness to your narrower forehead. [6] X Research source Straight-across bangs can work for you as long as they aren’t too short or and have lighter, wispy ends. Blunt-cut bangs may emphasize the sharpness and width of your jawline. Master cosmetologist Shun Pittman adds that a bang with a horizontal line makes your forehead appear narrower."

      "content": "Choose short hairstyles with volume on top. Makeup artist and stylist Frankie Sanderson recommends understanding your facial proportions and how they relate to your hair to balance your facial structure so you can look your very best. In general, men with triangle face shapes look good in shorter hairstyles with more volume at the top and on the sides that balance their wider jawlines. Here are a few hairstyles to consider if you have a triangle face shape: [9] X Research source Textured quiff : A quiff is longer on the top and shorter on the sides with a stiff wall of hair above your forehead. Style it by applying a dime-sized amount of gel or hair wax , then blow dry it over and over your head. Pompadour : The classic pompadour is a type of quiff that is larger and wavier on the top. Style it by blowdrying the top up and back from your forehead. Side-swept undercut: The back and sides are buzz cut with the top left long. Apply a dime-sized amount of hair gel to your hair to style it. Use a wide-toothed comb to part your hair then slick it over to the side. Textured French crop : It has short, tapered sides with a longer top. Style it by raking a dime-sized amount of gel from the back to the front then comb your hair forward."

      "content": "Go with facial hair styles that elongate and soften your jawline. Choose a short beard style that doesn’t add bulk to your jawline or go with a longer beard that narrows at the bottom. Avoid thick full beards that add weight to your jaw. Beardstache : This features short stubble on the chin and jaw with a longer mustache to soften your prominent jawline and draw the eye up. Ducktail: This style is trimmed into a V or U shape on the chin to help elongate and soften hard, prominent jawlines. [10] X Research source Bandholz: This is a mustache that’s connected to a full beard. [11] X Research source It helps camouflage and soften your sharp, wide jawline. Handlebar : This mustache style has long ends that are curled up and held with wax. It helps draw attention upward away from a wider jawline. Walrus : These mustaches are thick and long on the sides and trimmed over the lip in the middle. Because they’re so large, they balance out a wide jawline. Pencil: This mustache style is very thin, which can help a jawline appear narrower. It’s also an eye-catching style that draws attention away from the jaw. Pyramid: These moustaches are narrow on top and wide on the bottom. The width on the bottom helps to minimize a wide jawline."

      "content": "Choose round, cat-eye, or square frames that balance your face. Whether you wear glasses for better vision or need some new sunnies, choose glasses with oval frames to help soften your face’s angles. Or, add more fullness to your forehead with large aviator sunglasses or square and rectangular frames. [12] X Research source Cat-eye or browline style glasses add width to your brow and forehead area to offset the width of your jawline. Try to avoid chunky, butterfly, angular, oversized, or geometric styles that can overemphasize the angles of your face."

Or try bold colors like scarlet, periwinkle, or lavender. Finish the look by adding false lashes or applying one or two coats of mascara. Create a long, arched brow to balance your face shape. Extend the tail of each brow to balance your wider jaw. Alternately, try a rounded brow with a subtle arch to soften your jawline and elongate your forehead."

Brush a contour shade that’s 1-2 shades darker than your skin tone under your cheekbones from your hairline to the corner of your mouth. This accentuates and defines your cheekbones. Apply a line of contour along the outer corners of your jawline to make it appear narrower. [13] X Research source Make your cheekbones pop by adding a shimmery highlighter along the tops. Add a little highlighter to the top corners and center of your forehead to make it look wider. Avoid contouring your forehead, which can make it look smaller than it really is. [14] X Research source Keep highlighter away from your jawline as this will draw attention and make your jaw appear larger."

It also helps to make the upper part of your face wider to balance with your jawline. Add more definition by applying a light dusting of blush over the outsides of your eyebrows. Another technique that adds symmetry to your face is to apply blush in a sideways v-shape from the outer corner of your eye to your hairline. [15] X Research source Avoid adding blush to your nose or the lower half of your face, which can emphasize your wide jawline."
