      "content": "Place torches 6–8 feet (1.8–2.4 m) (1.83-2.44 m) apart. Use a measuring tape to space your torches in your yard. This will help prevent accidents if you accidentally knock a torch over."

      "content": "Avoid placing tiki torches near overhangs or other flammable materials. Plant tiki torches away from trees, porches, awnings, or hanging party decorations. If you have a propane tank in your yard for a grill or your home, place your tiki torches at least 6 feet (1.8 m) (1.83 m) away. The more space you can allow between your torches and any potentially flammable materials, the better."

      "title": "Use a 1 inch (2.5 cm) drill bit to create a hole for your tiki torch.",
      "content": "Use a 1 inch (2.5 cm) drill bit to create a hole for your tiki torch. Hold your drill perpendicular to the ground, and drill directly into the dirt until the hole is at least 6-8 inches (15.3-20.4 cm) deep. If you’re unsure how deep your hole is, withdraw your drill from the ground and check with your finger. [1] X Research source Avoid using this method to plant tiki torches in extremely hard soil or gravel, as you could damage your drill. To find the best method for your particular soil, follow the manufacturer’s directions."

      "title": "Plant your tiki torches.",
      "content": "Plant your tiki torches. Place the bottom of your tiki torch in the hole you’ve created with your drill. If the hole needs to be larger for your tiki torch to fit, use your drill to widen the hole by drilling slightly off center from your original hole. Use a torch stake for extra stability, if needed. Repeat this process with the rest of the torches as desired. You can purchase torch stakes at your local garden or home improvement store. These secure your tiki torch with a tightening pin and simply need to be pressed into the ground to be installed."

      "title": "Pat dirt around the opening of your hole to secure your tiki torch.",
      "content": "Pat dirt around the opening of your hole to secure your tiki torch. Use your hands to gather dirt that was displaced by drilling the hole. Press it firmly against the base of the tiki torch as it rests in the hole. Do this until the torch feels secure. When secured properly, your torch should stand perpendicular to the ground. If you apply gentle pressure to the staff, the torch should not move."

    {
      "title": "Use a funnel to pour fuel into the torch.",
      "content": "Use a funnel to pour fuel into the torch. Buy a funnel whose stem fits snugly with the fuel opening of your tiki torches. Pour your fuel into the funnel slowly to avoid spills. Avoid overfilling the fuel reservoir by keeping an eye on the fuel level as you fill. If you don’t have a funnel, pour the fuel in a thin stream directly into the torch. Avoid pouring the fuel into another container and then trying to fill the torch, which can cause spills. An overfilled fuel reservoir will overflow and leak down the sides of the tiki torch."

      "title": "Soak up any spilled fuel with kitty litter.",
      "content": "Soak up any spilled fuel with kitty litter. Let the kitty litter sit on the spilled fuel until it is clumped and firm to the touch, at least 10 minutes. Throw away the soiled kitty litter in its own garbage bag away from other flammable materials. Use a commercial-grade cleaning solution suited to the spill surface to remove any remaining fuel residue. Keep the area well ventilated after cleaning so it can dry out completely. Typically you can apply cleaner to the stain with a damp towel and let it air dry."

      "title": "Light your tiki torches.",
      "content": "Light your tiki torches. Use a match or lighter to ignite the wick of your tiki torches when you’re ready to use them. Avoid lighting them long before your event to keep from wasting fuel."

      "title": "Use a snuffer cap to extinguish your torches.",
      "content": "Use a snuffer cap to extinguish your torches. When you want to extinguish your torches, place the snuffer cap completely over the wick and let the torch go out naturally. Remove the snuffer cap when the flame is out, and let the wick cool down completely. Once the wick is completely cool, replace the snuffer cap. This will protect your wick from the elements if you store your tiki torches outside. How long your torches take to cool down will depend upon how long they were lit. Hold your hand close to the torch to feel if it is still giving off heat, if you’re unsure."

      "title": "Store torches in an upright position when not in use.",
      "content": "Store torches in an upright position when not in use. Make sure your torches are firmly staked into the ground if you intend to keep them outside. Keep an eye on the weather forecast, as temperatures below 32 ℉ (0 °C) will cause the fuel in your tiki torches to freeze. If you store your tiki torches in a garage or shed, use a tether to secure your torches upright. It is safe to let any unused oil stay in the torches while they are in storage. If the temperature hits freezing, either empty the fuel reservoirs of your outdoor tiki torches or bring them inside to a warmer area."
