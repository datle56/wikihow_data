      "title": "They’re politely acknowledging you.",
      "content": "They’re politely acknowledging you. Receiving a quick, tight-lipped smile from someone is often seen as a polite greeting. This smile is typically viewed as a formal gesture, rather than a friendly or welcoming one, because it doesn’t reach the person’s eyes. So, someone might give you this smile if they don’t know you well but still want to acknowledge your presence, or if they don’t have time to stop and chat with you. [1] X Research source For instance, you might receive this smile if you bump into an acquaintance while running errands. Or, your coworker might give you this smile when they’re rushing off to a meeting."

      "content": "They’re hiding their true feelings, which are likely negative. People often paste tense, tight-lipped smiles on their faces to maintain composure after hearing something they don’t like. For instance, they might make this smile in response to a rude or sarcastic remark, a lie, or a comment they find absurd to hide their anger or contempt from the person. [2] X Research source The person might feel the need to keep their real feelings a secret in polite or formal social situations. This is a way to keep the peace and placate or humor someone instead of confronting them."

    {
      "title": "They’re trying not to fully smile or laugh.",
      "content": "They’re trying not to fully smile or laugh. If the situation is inappropriate for smiling or laughing, someone might press their mouth into a tight-lipped smile to keep their joy or amusement contained. Or, they might make this expression if they privately found something funny and want to keep it to themselves. If this is the case, you might notice wrinkles around their eyes or a sparkle in their gaze. [3] X Research source For example, someone might make this smile if an authority figure, like a teacher or boss, made a silly comment but it would be rude to laugh at it."

      "title": "They feel shy or uncomfortable.",
      "content": "They feel shy or uncomfortable. A tight-lipped smile can sometimes convey that someone feels nervous or self-conscious in a social situation. For instance, they might feel unsure about how to act around people they don’t know well or uncomfortable sharing their thoughts or opinions in a big group. So, they keep their face in this expression to try to stay polite and friendly-looking. [4] X Research source If someone is feeling shy or uncomfortable, you might notice them avoiding eye contact and keeping their head slightly down."

      "title": "They’re distracted.",
      "content": "They’re distracted. If someone wasn’t paying attention to a conversation, they might make a tight-lipped smile when they realize the person they’re talking to wanted a reaction. They might even give this smile to signal that they’re disengaged from the conversation because it's uninteresting or boring. [5] X Research source If this is the case, you might notice the person looking around the room, checking the time, or even sighing."

      "title": "They don’t like smiling with their teeth.",
      "content": "They don’t like smiling with their teeth. For many people, the tight-lipped smile might simply be their preferred way to smile. This might be because they don’t like how their open-mouthed smile looks, they’re self-conscious of their teeth, or they find it difficult to smile fully. Someone who typically gives you a full smile might make this expression if they think they have food stuck in their teeth or they chipped their tooth."

      "content": "Examine how tightly their lips are pressed together. The amount of tension in the person’s mouth can help indicate what their smile means. A more relaxed mouth might mean that the person is being polite, friendly, or trying to contain a broad smile. If their lips are firmly pressed together and strained-looking, this can indicate that they’re suppressing their true thoughts or feelings (like anger, disdain, or mockery). [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pay attention to their other body language cues . According to Keegan, a “large percent of our communication is in our body,” which can help you “read a lot” into someone’s thoughts and feelings. In general, someone who makes eye contact, has a straight and relaxed posture, and keeps their arms uncrossed is signaling friendliness or interest. If someone isn’t interested in you or has negative feelings, they’ll typically avoid eye contact, turn their body away from you, and cross their arms. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Other body language cues include: Eye contact : Strong eye contact is a positive sign of interest and attraction while a lack of eye contact suggests disinterest or shyness. Gopman also notes that intense eye contact can come off as intimidating.[v161196_b01].23 May 2019. Proximity : Gopman notes that leaning away from someone is usually “a sign of uninterest or disinterest” while leaning towards them is “a sign of interest.”[v161196_b01].23 May 2019. Body positioning : According to Rosenfield, “facing [someone] directly or a little bit on an angle” signals approachability and friendliness while facing away from them suggests disinterest. Posture : Muñoz says that hunched or tense shoulders can convey a lack of confidence, nervousness, or stress. On the other hand, open, relaxed, and pushed-back shoulders suggest confidence and friendliness. Eyebrows : Raised eyebrows can communicate surprise, attraction, or interest, while low or furrowed brows can signal anger or worry. Pupil dilation : According to Dr. Brown, our pupils widen “when we find someone attractive” or we’re excited.[v162069_b01]. Tuesday, November 28, 2023. However, pupil dilation is also a response to stress. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Note : Lui says it’s important to remember that body language cues are just generalizations “because everyone's personality and cultural upbringing is different.” Getting to know someone’s unique quirks and behavior can help you figure out what their smile means. Keegan also cautions against reading too hard into someone’s body language. Look for multiple cues of interest or disinterest before assuming what their smile means. It’s always a good idea to ask someone how they’re feeling if you’re not sure, too!"

For instance, receiving this smile from your crush as they ran to catch their ride might just be a polite greeting. But, receiving this smile from your coworker after your boss made a critical comment about their work can mean they’re hiding their irritation."
