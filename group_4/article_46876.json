      "content": "Remove the cap. The cap is a small covering located over the mouthpiece of the inhaler to prevent foreign objects from getting in the inhaler. Pull the cap to remove it and set it in a safe place. An uncapped inhaler can pick up germs and debris, which you will then pump into your lungs. Make sure that you don't lose your cap while you're using your inhaler."

      "content": "Inspect the inhaler. The inhaler should be clean, especially the mouthpiece. Remove the cap and check the inside and outside of the mouthpiece. Check the expiration date to make sure that it can still be used. Wipe any grime or debris off the inhaler with a dry tissue or cotton swab.

      "content": "Hold the inhaler upright and shake it 5-10 times. Hold the inhaler in your hand with your index finger on top of the canister. The mouthpiece should be on the bottom with the top of the canister pointing up. Quickly move your inhaler up and down by pumping your forearm or wrist. If you haven't used it in a while, make sure that you prime it by pumping it until it sprays at full force. Don't worry about wasting medicine because an unprimed inhaler will not provide you a full dose, putting your breathing at risk. Instructions for priming vary, so know how many pumps it takes to prime yours."

If you can't clear out the debris, you may need to wash your spacer. Don't wipe your spacer with a cloth because it will create static cling that attracts your medicine. [2] X Research source Clean your spacer by dismantling and washing it in mild dish detergent. Allow it to air dry before putting it back together. [3] X Research source"

Begin inhaling slowly through your mouth as you press down on your inhaler. This will release a dose of your medicine. Keep the mouthpiece in your mouth to help keep the medicine in your mouth. Continue to breathe in for about three to five seconds. Try to push the medication back towards your lungs as you inhale. This movement is known as a \"puff.\" Only press the canister down once. If you're holding your inhaler 1-2 inches in front of your mouth, then close your mouth as soon as the dose is delivered. If you're using a spacer, some spacers have a whistle on them. Listen for the whistle. If you hear it, you are breathing in too rapidly. If you don't hear it, you are breathing in at an acceptable rate."

Rinse your mouth with water thoroughly after using the inhaler. Gargle, then spit the water out. If you're supposed to take two puffs from your inhaler, wait one minute before repeating the process. Continue to use your inhaler as directed by your doctor. In general, most people take one or two puffs every four to six hours or as needed. It's especially important to rinse your mouth if your medication is steroid-based because the medicine can cause a secondary yeast infection in the mouth called thrush. Rinsing your mouth after use will help prevent this."

To prevent your medicine from clumping, don't store your DPI in the bathroom or in an area without air conditioning. Your breath also contains moisture, so it's also important that you don't exhale into the inhaler."

When you're using the inhaler, make sure to put your cap down somewhere safe so that you don't lose it. Depending on what kind of inhaler you have, the cap will look different. If your inhaler looks like an upright tube - called a “rocket” inhaler - then the cap will cover the length of the inhaler. It may be a different color than the base. If you have a diskus inhaler - called a “flying saucer” inhaler - you will remove the cap by placing your thumb on the thumb grip and pressing away from you. The cap will slide away to remove the mouthpiece. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Load your dose of medicine. The medicine is already in the inhaler, but with a DPI you must release it into the delivery chamber before you can use it. This keeps your medicine dry. Depending on whether you have a rocket or a diskus, how you load the inhaler will differ. Do not shake your inhaler. If you have a rocket inhaler, twist the base as far to the right as it will go, and then as far to the left as it will go. You will hear a click when the medicine is loaded. If you have a diskus inhaler, slide the lever away from you until it clicks. The click tells you that your medicine has properly loaded. If your model is a twisthaler inhaler, then the medicine will load when you take off the cap. There is no need to do anything else. If you're still having trouble, then check with the directions for your model because DPIs vary more in how they're used compared with other inhalers."
