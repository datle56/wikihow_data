      "content": "Set your parking brake and place a backstop under the diagonal wheel. Place pieces of wood or large rocks in front and in back of the tire that is diagonally across from the one being changed to keep the car from rolling. Make sure this wheel will not roll. [1] X Research source If it's a rear wheel, set the parking brake. If it's a front wheel on a front wheel drive car, be sure the car is in park for automatic transmission. On a manual transmission, put the vehicle in first gear."

Once it is removed, place the hubcap in your trunk or set it inside of your vehicle so that you don’t accidentally scratch the hubcap up. [2] X Research source"

On newer cars, refer to the manual to find the jacking point. Place the jack in place and raise the car slowly. Make sure the car doesn't try to roll away as the wheel comes off the ground."

If you're a small to medium build person, I would say they should be as tight as you can get them. If you're a body builder, just don't break the studs. The lug nuts should be exceptionally tight. You shouldn’t be able to move the lug wrench at all when you try to turn it."

Double-check each nut one more time to make sure that they’re 100% tight. Replace the hubcap and ensure that’s it’s secured to the wheel. If you are not comfortable that the hubcap is secure, remove it and have someone help you at a later time."
