It may seem like an expense you can't afford, but you will be glad that you have health insurance if someone in your family gets sick or needs medical attention. Emergency room visits and other medical expenses without health insurance are extremely expensive and may put you into long-term debt. Government programs may help with the cost of insurance. Your options will vary by state, but see if you can apply for reduced-cost insurance programs. If you have insurance for your car or home, you may consider modifying your plan to a higher deductible to help save on monthly premium expenses. Keep in mind that if you need to file a claim, you will have to pay that higher deductible.This strategy is not a good long-term solution for saving money, but it can help you out for a short time."

Another way to cut your monthly expenses is to purchase your essential items when they are on sale, when you have a coupon or when you can save money over time by buying in bulk. Watch local ads, clip coupons, and compare prices on your essential items to make sure that you get the best possible prices on the items that you buy. Consider shopping at bulk retail stores, like Sam's Club or Costco. If you have a friend or family member with a membership, see if they will take you so you don't have to purchase your own membership. Some things can be purchased cheaply at these retailers. Make sure to consider unit price, however, because not all items sold at these stores are cheaper. Buy generic brands. Most grocery stores carry their own brand of products that sell for significantly less than other brands. This can be a way to reduce your grocery expenses. Give up certain things. Since you are cutting corners, you can't buy everything you usually do. Items like sodas, expensive meats, and snack foods are unnecessary expenses. Instead, buy what you need to feed you and your family. The extraneous items can be skipped for now."
