      "content": "Find someone to tell the joke to. Try to tailor the joke to the person you're telling the joke to. For example, some knock knock jokes are basically toilet humor, so you may want to save those for your friends! If you don't know the person well, stick to clean knock knock jokes. If you know the person has the same sense of humor as you, it's an added bonus. There's a much bigger chance the person will find the joke funny."

You don't need to instruct the other person on what to say because it's widely known that \"Who's there?\" is the correct response to \"Knock knock.\" The knock knock joke is also great because it invites the other person to get involved in the joke."

Make sure you don't tell the other person the punchline of the joke at this stage! A few examples: You could say \"A broken pencil\" is at the door. [2] X Research source You could say \"Howl\" is at the door. You might say \"Tank\" is at the door. You could say \"Boo\" is at the door. [3] X Research source"

The punchlines of most knock knock jokes are based on this standard response. At this point, the joke is almost over!

By now, you've set the joke up and got the other person interested in the punchline. To finish off \"A broken pencil\" you can respond, \"Oh never mind, it's pointless.\" [4] X Research source To finish \"Howl\" you can say \"How'll you know unless you answer the door?!\" Finish \"Tank\" by saying \"You're welcome!\" Close \"Boo\" by saying \"I didn't mean to make you cry!\" [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Play around with the other person's expectations. A large part of comedy is playing around with what other people expect. By playing around with the knock knock joke, you can inject some comedy into the joke. You can try playing with the structure of the joke. For instance, when they say \"Who's there?\" reply \"Britney.\" Then, after they say \"Britney who?\" repeat the beginning of the joke by saying \"Knock knock.\" When they say \"Who's there?\", laugh and say \"Oops, I did it again!\" For example, when they say \"Who's there?\" reply \"An old lady.\" When they say \"An old lady who?\" you can reply with \"I didn't know you could yodel!\" When they say \"Who's there?\" reply \"Opportunity.\" After they say \"Opportunity who?\" you can walk away and say \"Don't be silly, opportunity doesn't knock twice!\" [6] X Research source When they say \"Who's there?\" reply \"Interrupting cow.\" As they're trying to reply, can you interrupt them and say \"MOOOOOO.\" [7] X Research source"

This will build their expectations, meaning they think they know where the joke is going. When they say \"Knock knock,\" ask them \"Who's there?\" The other person will get stuck now as they didn't think they'd have to provide the set up for the joke. You can start laughing at this point as you've successfully tricked the other person. When they say \"Knock knock,\" you also say something like, \"Come in, it's open!\" which they won't expect.
