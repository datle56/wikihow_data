      "content": "Look on the bright side. Have you ever had an overwhelmingly successful and productive day, but yet upon reflecting, found yourself focusing on nothing but the negatives? When there is something wrong in our lives, we tend to block out everything that is good. This is called filtering. Like a filter, you mentally discard all of the positives from your mind and increase the significance of the negatives. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Instead, choose to zoom in on the positives, as this will improve your overall perspective on life. One easy way of looking on the bright side is by completing the sentence starter, “the good news is” whenever you are facing a challenge. For example, you had a minor car and your car’s rear bumper is damaged and needs to be replaced. You can tell yourself, “The good news is that there is no damage to the actual car frame, which is a relief.” Try to reflect on your personal successes. Make a list of all the good things that you have accomplished throughout your day by listing all of the reasons that you are successful, and all of the things that you have accomplished. Try and think of what makes you happy and relaxed while creating your list."

      "content": "Pinpoint specific areas plagued with negative thinking. There are probably certain things about yourself that you tend to view in a negative light. It might be your career, family, appearance, etc. If you can identify which areas you need to view more positively, you can work on improving your self perception. Instead of viewing the particular issue negatively, try seeing it from a more positive perspective. In time, you will recognize that your life is filled with a lot more positives than negatives. Be sure to start with one area at time so you can give it your full attention. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, let’s say you are working a part-time job and are feeling down because it’s taking longer than you would like to be hired for a full-time job. Instead of dwelling on negative thoughts like, “I’m not making enough money with this part-time job,” you could tell yourself, “I really appreciate the extra time I now have to go the gym and prepare some home cooked-meals for the family."

      "content": "Engage in positive self-talk. Positive self-talk is about focusing your internal thoughts into all of the things that are good about you. How you talk to yourself plays a prominent role in your self perception and worldview. Engaging in positive self-talk is a skill, and with practice you can develop this skill. When you have negative thoughts, change it to a positive thought. For example, instead of thinking, “I’m no good at dancing,” tell yourself, “I will get better with practice.” If you’re negatively thinking, “I’m too tired to work,” change it to, “I will put forth my best effort even though I’m tired.” Like anything, practice makes perfect. It takes time to develop a habit, so the more you focus on engaging in positive self-talk, the more natural at it you’ll become."
