      "content": "A stomach ulcer is a spot of damaged tissue. The normal, healthy tissue has been eroded away, leaving the lining exposed. The exposed spot can become irritated and can easily bleed, which can be really painful and uncomfortable. Oftentimes, a stomach ulcer occurs in the mucosa, which is the outer layer of the stomach lining. But sometimes, they can be severe enough to penetrate down to the serosa (the inner layer) or even rupture the lining and cause internal bleeding. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Ulcers can form if the lining of the stomach or intestine is damaged.",
      "content": "Ulcers can form if the lining of the stomach or intestine is damaged. Your dog’s stomach has a mucosal lining that keeps it protected. Similarly, their intestinal lumen, which is the opening where their stomach empties into their small intestine, comes into direct contact with food and helps them absorb nutrients. If either (or both) of these linings is worn down or damaged, then the inner lining can be exposed, which can lead to ulcers. [4] X Research source There are many different factors that can affect your dog’s stomach or intestinal lining, which is why treating the underlying cause is the best way to get rid of ulcers."

If that’s the case, your dog will need antibiotics to knock out the ulcers. It’s also not known if H. pylori can easily be transferred from dogs to humans, but your vet can test your dog to see if the bacteria is present. [8] X Research source"
