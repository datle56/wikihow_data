You'll notice that 10 of the keys ( 7, 8, 9, U, I, O, J, K, L, and M ) have smaller numbers either above or below the main letter or symbol. This is a numeric keypad you can activate by pressing the NumLk (Number Lock) key. When NumLk is on, the keys with smaller numbers will only type those smaller numbers. You may have to hold down the Fn key to activate NumLk. If you don't see these keys, you can use Windows 10 on-screen keyboard. Here's how to start it: Right-click the Start menu and select Windows PowerShell . Type osk at the prompt and press ↵ Enter . An on-screen keyboard (without a 10-key keypad) will appear.
