Then, place a period after the initials. If you need to list two authors for the same source, then use an ampersand between the two authors’ names instead of using the word and. If you need to list three to seven authors' names for one source, then place commas between the authors’ names and place an ampersand before the last author's name. [1] X Research source To list more than seven authors, add a comma between the authors' names, then use an ellipses to stand in for any authors between the sixth author and the final author. Place an ampersand before the final author's name as well. [2] X Research source Example of one author: Krauss, L. M. (1993). Example of two authors: Wegener, D. T., & Petty, R. E. (1994). Example of three or more authors: Kernis, M. H., Cornell, D. P., Sun, C. R., Berry, A., Harlow, T., & Bach, J. S. (1993). Example of more than seven authors: Miller, F. H., Choi, M. J., Angeli, L.

It's best to avoid these, because they may sell your information to businesses that will clog your inbox with spam. Many searchable library databases also provide citations in multiple styles, such as EBSCO. If you are using your university library’s databases, then you should have the option of getting an APA style citation for the source from the article’s page in the database.

[11] X Research source The auto-fill method will supply a lot of information instantly, which you will then verify to make sure it's correct. The manual entry method will give you a form to complete yourself, and you will enter the appropriate author names, dates, and other relevant information manually.

Generally, using the url for the source will get more accurate results. For a book, enter the book title, author's name, or ISBN. You can find the ISBN on the book jacket, usually next to the price and the barcode. The ISBN will provide the most complete information. For a video, enter the URL or a major keyword. The URL will yield more specific results. If you choose “Other,” you will see a long list of alternative formats to choose from.

Your source may or may not be included, depending on whether the generator located it. If your source is not on the list, then try supplying more specific information, or using the manual-fill entry mode. If you enter a common book title, then you will see a list of options.
