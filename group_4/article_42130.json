However, if your only escape route would put you in sight of the shooter, it might be better to hide or fight . Otherwise, do everything you can to put distance between yourself and the shooter as quickly as possible. [1] X Research source “The best thing you can do is flee and leave the area,” affirms Thompson. “Fleeing is generally your safest course of action, and this may involve breaking windows or jumping out of second-floor windows.” In these cases, you may have a broken leg or arm, continues Thompson, but you’re more likely to get away with your life."

      "content": "React immediately without freezing up. Even if your natural fear instinct is to freeze up, force yourself to act immediately. Find an escape route and start running toward it, as long as this escape route doesn’t put you in the line of fire or in the shooter’s view. While you want to be smart about your escape, don’t waste time debating with yourself which is the best escape route—find one and start running. It’s often a natural instinct to hit the floor, lie flat, and cover your head, but moving is much more likely to improve your chance of survival. [2] X Research source If you hear gunshots in the distance but can’t see the shooter, you can likely get out of the area before the shooter arrives. Just make sure to run away from the sound of gunshots. 98% of shooters act alone. If you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire, you are usually safe. [3] X Research source If you have shoes that prevent you from running, take them off. It’s not advised to pull the fire alarm, even as an attempt to evacuate others. The evacuation procedures for a fire and an active shooter are completely different, and pulling the fire alarm can increase the risk of casualties as a result. Don’t waste time debating whether or not you heard gunshots. If you think you did, it’s better to run and be safe than sorry."

If you’ve determined that your safest response strategy is to run, then leave behind your wallet, your purse, your cell phone, your computer, and any other personal items. Though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you, none of them are as important as your life. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Run directly to the exit.",
      "content": "Run directly to the exit. Run straight to safety as quickly as you can—don’t slow yourself down with evasive maneuvers like running a zig-zag or bending over as you run. These tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you and using a weapon with a low rate of fire. In most cases, getting away quickly is the better option. [5] X Research source The one exception to this step is if you’re forced to run within sight of the shooter in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit. In this case, running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance. We’ll go over this strategy in more depth in the “Hide” section ."

      "content": "If you can, encourage others to run as you’re running. If someone looks disoriented or too scared to move, grab that person and drag them along with you. Tell these people that running is crucial to their survival. Plus, if you’re running in a bigger group, it’ll be harder to target you individually, and you’ll have strength in numbers if you do come up against the shooter. [6] X Research source However, if others refuse to go with you, you need to keep running without them in order to save your own life. If you are with or encounter someone who is injured, they may not be able to move easily with you. If they have a superficial injury or are able to run easily with their injury, encourage them to come with you. If they are too injured to flee safely, however, tell them to hide instead and play dead until police arrive—in some cases, moving may exacerbate the person’s injuries."

      "content": "Grab a weapon only if it’s convenient and doesn’t slow you down. If you happen to see a sharp or blunt object you can carry while running, grab it. However, do not waste time looking for a weapon when you could be running to safety. Locating a weapon should only be a priority in a last-case scenario where you’re unable to escape the shooters (see our section on the “Fight” response ). A fire extinguisher could work as a weapon, says Thompson. “You can spray the chemicals on the [shooter], ruining their ability to see and breathe, and then you can hit them with the extinguisher if necessary.”"

      "title": "If you cannot run or flee the area, resort to the second response—hiding.",
      "content": "If you cannot run or flee the area, resort to the second response—hiding. It should only take you a few seconds to determine whether or not running is possible. If the shooter is rapidly approaching your room or if they’re blocking your only escape route, then you should start hiding or barricading yourself in a room immediately. [7] X Research source Hiding is a secondary option to running because it traps you in one area and is only effective temporarily, according to Thompson. So, if the shooter is able to find you in that area, you’re in more danger than you would be if you’d been able to flee the danger area entirely. However, most mass shooting events are over within ten or fifteen minutes. If you can avoid the shooter for that long, you have a better chance of survival. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Find cover immediately, whether you’re in an open space or an enclosed room. The term “cover” refers to barriers that will stop a bullet, e.g., brick or concrete walls, steel building support beams, or thick trees. If you’re in an open area, try to find a room to hide in—if you can’t find one, find cover instead. If you’re trapped in a single room, your best option for cover is to hide behind a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet. [9] X Research source Ideally, find a spot that does not restrict your movement. If the situation changes, you want to be able to run to an exit as quickly as possible. If you’re hiding behind a wall, try to stay at least 1 foot (0.30 m) away from it. When bullets ricochet off of walls, they usually travel about 6 inches (150 mm) down the wall. So, if you’re right next to the wall, you’re more likely to be hit."

If it’s your only safe option, hide behind furniture, in closets, or in any other hiding spot that you can find. Once behind your piece of concealment, crouch low to the ground to minimize the chance that a stray bullet hits you. [10] X Research source For instance, most interior walls and thin wooden objects will not stop a bullet. However, if they get you out of a shooter’s line of sight, they can still increase your chance of survival."

If you have time and are able to do so without attracting the attention of the shooter, silence your cell phone and any other electronics you have. If they beep, ring, or vibrate while you’re hiding, the shooter may hear and be more likely to approach you. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "If possible, continue to move away from the shooter while staying hidden.",
      "content": "If possible, continue to move away from the shooter while staying hidden. If you’ve found an initial hiding spot or area of cover or concealment, you might still be able to run while remaining hidden. While safely hidden, plan a route that will get you to a place where you can run to safety. Then, move from cover to cover to put distance between yourself and the shooter. When you’re closer to the shooter, crouch down and crawl to move between covers, then move more quickly and agilely as you get further from the shooter. You may have to move across a riskier open area, like a hallway or sidewalk. In this case, pause in a safe hiding spot before this risky area. Listen to the shooting, try to figure out a pattern, and discern when the shooter routinely takes a pause to reload. Time your move across the open area during this pause in shooting. However, if it’s too risky for you to move between areas of concealment, then just stay where you are. Assault rifles have a maximum shooting range of about six American football fields. With this type of weapon, you can hear the gun, you can be shot. If you choose to keep moving, do so with purpose and caution."

One person should call 9-1-1 (or the emergency number in your region). One group of people should grab anything that could be used as a weapon."

      "content": "Lock and barricade the door. Lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter the room, advises Thompson. Remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up, so they’re not interested in taking the path of most resistance. To make it more difficult for the shooter to enter your room, lock the door and place a doorstop on it (if you have one). Place all heavy furniture like desks, chairs, and bookshelves in front of the door to deter the shooter. [13] X Research source If the shooter is approaching your room, get away from the door and hide yourself in a corner of the room as far as possible from any doors or windows. If you’re hiding in a bathroom that doesn’t have a lock, take a belt, bra, or T-shirt and loop it around the arms of the door butler (the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open). Blocking the door butler may prevent or slow the door from opening to the shooter."

The faster the police arrive, the fewer casualties a shooting is likely to have. If you have other people in your room who are barricading the door and carrying out other safety steps, calling the authorities immediately can be literally life-saving help. Dial 911 or whatever the emergency number is in your area. [14] X Research source If possible, use a landline instead of your cell phone so that the police can automatically trace the call. If you’re unable to speak safely, call 911 can leave the line open so that they can hear what’s happening and trace your call. If you can’t reach a phone to call emergency services, look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by hitting it or holding a lighter underneath the detector. This should automatically call the fire department. [15] X Research source If someone in your room is injured, let the 911 dispatcher know. They may be able to give you instruction to provide first aid to the injured person."

      "title": "Grab any weapons that you can find in the room.",
      "content": "Grab any weapons that you can find in the room. Look around the room that you’re hiding in and find anything that you can use as a weapon. A weapon could be a stapler or a sharp pair of scissors that you find on the teacher’s desk, the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office, beakers or dangerous acids (e.g., sulfuric acid) in a science room, or anything that’s sharp, heavy, made of glass, or that can be used as a weapon. Hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room you’re in. [16] X Research source Even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people works together. While this strategy is obviously a last resort (and shouldn’t be used if throwing a weapon reveals your hiding spot), anyone who can't find a weapon should still grab something to throw. “In a gymnasium,” Thompson shares, “there’s a bunch of weights that you can throw at somebody. Nobody can shoot anything accurately if they have things whipping past their head. Do that, and just overwhelm them with the amount of violence.”"

In that case, you’ll have no choice but to fight, as described below . [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Play dead as a last resort. People have survived mass shootings by playing dead in areas where shots have been fired in order to avoid being shot . However, some shooters are aware of this tactic and will target bodies by shooting them again. The only time you should try this approach is when both running and hiding are impossible to do safely. [18] X Research source If you have been shot by the shooter but are still conscious, you might also try playing dead if you’re unable to run or hide. This way, the shooter will hopefully ignore you and move on to a different area."

      "title": "When you have no other option, fight the shooter.",
      "content": "When you have no other option, fight the shooter. Attacking or defending yourself against the shooter should be your final option. Don’t jump out of your hiding place to attack the shooter if they’re approaching, and don’t attack them if they say they can see you (unless they’re looking directly at you, they’re probably not telling the truth). Don’t try to be a hero. Fighting should only be considered when running and hiding are no longer options, and/or if the gunman puts down or loses their weapon. As a rule of thumb, you should only fight them if you’re sure you’ll be shot if you do nothing. [19] X Research source"

You should stab them in the neck, gouge out their eyes, or stab them in the arm—doing anything you can to make them get rid of the weapon or to hurt them so the weapon is within your reach. [22] X Research source You can also kick them in the crotch. This move is more effective if the shooter is a man, although it could still hurt, distract, and discourage a female shooter. If you can't reach their crotch, go for their face or weapon. This will be an effective way to disarm them and to cause them a large amount of pain."

Grab the barrel of their gun with one hand and cover the ejection port with your other hand (try to keep the muzzle pointed away from you and any other people). The shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire, but only once, because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round.
