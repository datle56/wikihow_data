      "content": "Set your oven or toaster oven to BROIL and let it heat up for 5-10 minutes. Turn the dial on your regular oven or toaster oven to its broil setting. Use its highest broil setting if it has different ones. Let it preheat for 5-10 minutes so it is ready to toast your buns. [1] X Research source If you are using a regular oven, make sure there is an oven rack in the top position right under the broiler. If you are using a toaster oven that has multiple rack positions, you can put the rack in the top position to get the buns closer to the broiler as well."

      "content": "Place the buns cut-side-up on a baking sheet. Cut or pull the buns apart to expose the inside for toasting. Set the halves of the buns face-up on a baking sheet so the cut side will get toasted. [2] X Research source If you have to cut the buns in half, then try to make the 2 halves as even as possible so they toast evenly. If the buns are supposed to be attached, such as hotdog or sub buns, you can just spread them apart as much as you can without pulling the halves off of one another."

Keep an eye on the buns and remove them after 30 seconds or when you see that they start to turn a golden brown color. [3] X Research source It’s easy to go from toasted to burnt with a broiler, so it’s important to stay and watch the buns as they toast."

      "title": "Cut the buns in half or pull them apart.",
      "content": "Cut the buns in half or pull them apart. Pull precut buns apart to separate the halves. Use a knife to carefully cut the buns in half if they are not precut. [4] X Research source This method works best when you are already grilling other foods. That way, you have a grill already hot to toast the buns on. If the buns are meant to be attached, such as hotdog buns or sub sandwich buns, then just open them up as much as you can without pulling the halves apart where they connect. You can brush the buns with about 1 tbsp (14.2 g) of butter or 1 tbsp (15 mL) of olive oil before grilling them for added flavor."

      "content": "Place the buns face-down on a hot grill. Carefully put the buns cut-side-down on the grill over indirect heat. Avoid any areas of the grill where there are large flames that will burn the buns. [5] X Research source If you are using a charcoal grill, then wait until the charcoals are embers and not flaming to toast the buns. If you are using an electric grill, then wait until it has been heating up on medium-high heat for at least 5-10 minutes. Around the edges of the grill is generally the safest place to put the buns to toast them. This will toast them with indirect heat without burning them."

      "content": "Toast the buns for 10-60 seconds or until they are slightly charred. Use tongs to lift up the buns every 10 seconds to check how toasted they are. Remove them when you start to see char marks on them. [6] X Research source The length of time to toast buns on a grill varies based on the type of grill, the grill temperature, and the position of the buns. If you are grilling things like hamburgers and hotdogs, toss the buns on the grill at the last minute so everything is ready at the same time and you can serve up burgers and dogs to order."

Make sure to cut it in half evenly if you have to cut it apart so it will fit in the toaster. [11] X Research source This method of toasting will only work for hamburger-style sandwich buns. You'll need a toaster with large enough slots to accommodate the bun halves. You won't be able to use this method for hotdog buns or other irregularly-shaped buns. Don't put butter, olive oil, or any other substance on the buns before using a toaster to toast them. It will just burn and cause a lot of smoke and a mess."

[13] X Research source It doesn’t matter which direction the bun halves face when you insert them into the toaster. Unlike other methods, this procedure will toast the bun halves on both sides, resulting in a bun that is drier and more crumbly."
