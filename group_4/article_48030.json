If someone on your Snapchat friends list has a yellow heart emoji next to their name, it means that the two of you are mutual “Best Friends” on the app. You’ve achieved this status because you both send more snaps to each other than you do to any other contact. Basically, it’s a mutual status that showcases your active exchange of messages and photos on Snapchat! [1] X Research source Other heart emojis, like the red heart (❤️) and pink hearts (💕) show that you’ve maintained this Best Friend status for a longer period of time."

If you want to get “Best Friend” status (or a yellow heart emoji) with a contact, the two of you must commit to messaging and snapping each other frequently. Send snaps to each other as much as possible (at least once a day, if not more), send a variety of message types (i.e., photos and videos as well as text messages), and lessen the number of snaps you send to other people if necessary. The snaps between the two of you must be greater than the number of snaps you send to and receive from any other contact. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The 💛 changes or disappears due to the number or duration of your Snaps.",
      "content": "The 💛 changes or disappears due to the number or duration of your Snaps. The yellow heart emoji is the initial status showing that you have a new BFF on Snapchat. If you keep up the best friend status, however, your yellow heart may change to a different color! Alternatively, if you don’t send Snaps as frequently, you may lose your yellow heart emoji. Here are a few of the ways that a 💛 may change, as well as the meaning behind the change: [4] X Research source Yellow Heart (💛) to Red Heart (❤️): This change occurs if you and your Snapchat BFF maintain your mutual status for two consecutive weeks. Red Heart (❤️) to Pink Hearts (💕): This change occurs if you and your Snapchat BFF maintain your mutual status for two consecutive months. Loss of Yellow Heart (💛): This change occurs if you and your Snapchat BFF start interacting more frequently with other users, losing your mutual “Best Friend” status. Sometimes, this change occurs based on a change in Snapchat’s internal algorithm, so it may happen without you doing anything differently."

If you and a friend have achieved the yellow heart emoji on Snapchat, then it’s a clear sign that your friendship is mutually meaningful and important!

Similar to the yellow heart (💛) and other heart emojis, the various face emojis used on Snap showcase the relationship between two contacts: [7] X Research source Smiling Face Emoji (😊): The 😊 on Snapchat means that you’re best friends with someone. You’re not necessarily #1 best friends or mutual best friends (like with the yellow heart), but this contact is one of your most frequently contacted users. Sunglasses Face Emoji (😎): The 😎 on Snapchat means that you’re mutual best friends with someone. You’re not necessarily #1 best friends, which would be signified with a heart emoji, but you both occupy a space on each other’s Snap best friends list. Grimacing Face Emoji (😬): The 😬 on Snapchat means you have an “awkward best friends” status with someone. In other words, your #1 best friend is also the #1 best friend of this person. Yikes! Smirking Face Emoji (😏): The 😏 on Snapchat means that you are one of this person’s closest friends, but they aren’t one of yours. In other words, they message you a lot more than you message them. Baby Face Emoji (️‍👶): The 👶 on Snapchat means that this friend is a very new Snapchat contact that you’ve only had for a few days or less."
