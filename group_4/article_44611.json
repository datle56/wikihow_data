      "content": "Overactivity If you’ve noticed your dog’s paws are red after they’ve been running around for an hour, it can lead to pododermatitis—especially if it’s hot or cold outside. Friction, extreme temperatures, and excessive use can irritate their paws and lead to inflammation. [1] X Research source"

Just like people, dogs can be allergic to food ingredients, dander, pollen, fleas, or other environmental factors. If you’ve just adopted or bought a puppy, the red paws are likely an inherited allergy.

      "content": "Bacterial or fungal infection Check your dog’s paws for any kind of discharge, puss, or flakey skin, all of which point towards an infection of some sing. The other big sign is the odor. Your dog is probably not going to smell very good, regardless of how often you bathe or clean your dog . Your pup is also likely to lick their paws obsessively if it’s an infection. [5] X Research source If you notice that your dog gets infections more than once every year or so, it’s likely that they’re allergic to something. Dogs with allergies are more prone to infections. This might sound scary, but it’s sort of like a person getting a yeast infection or athlete’s foot. It does require treatment, but it’s not the end of the world."

[12] X Research source If your dog burned their paw pads, rinse the paw and then apply an antibiotic cream and bandage.

From there, work on a treatment plan with the vet. [14] X Research source It can be kind of difficult (and expensive) to test for allergies. Most of the time, it’s easier to try and use the process of elimination to figure out what irritates your dog. You might start by switching your dog’s diet. If they’re eating chicken & rice kibble, try switching to lamb & potatoes, for example. Note when and where your dog has the most symptoms. They may be allergic to certain plants, so you can change your walk route, or allergic to seasonal allergens, which require shorter walks during the relevant season. If worst comes to worst, you can always give your dog a daily dose of Zyrtec per your vet’s guidance."

[17] X Research source Autoimmune disorders are often treated with steroids or other medication. The treatment for hormonal and metabolic disorders depends on the underlying condition. It could be as simple as some regular medication, or as serious as surgical intervention.
