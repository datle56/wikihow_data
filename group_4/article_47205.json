      "title": "Keep your head up.",
      "content": "Keep your head up. The first step to mastering a graceful walking posture is to make sure your head is always in a natural, upright position, instead of bent forward or pointed towards the sky. You will know that your head is in the right position if your chin in parallel to the floor. [1] X Research source You should also be conscious of not jutting your head out in front of you, which can often happen when you walk in heels. If you notice that you are doing this, try to lean back slightly so that your head is in line with your spine."

      "title": "Be mindful of your shoulders.",
      "content": "Be mindful of your shoulders. Try to keep your shoulders down and back. You want to avoid having them hunched forward or elevated near your ears at all times, whether you are walking or not. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you're not sure about the position of your shoulders, try standing with your back against a wall. You shoulders should be far enough back that they both touch the wall, but not so far back that they prevent your upper spine from touching the wall."

      "title": "Aim for a straight spine.",
      "content": "Aim for a straight spine. If you try too hard to avoid hunching over, you might find that you are arching your spine. This is not ideal posture either, so try to relax a bit! Your spine should be as straight as possible, without any noticeable curves in your shoulders or low back. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The easiest way to check the straightness of your spine is to look in a full-length mirror. Your spine should create a straight line all the way from your neck to your tailbone. If you're arching your back, you will probably notice that your butt is sticking out a little."

      "title": "Don't forget your legs.",
      "content": "Don't forget your legs. Your legs are the foundation of your posture, so it's important that they are in the correct position when you are walking. Not only will the proper leg position make you appear more graceful, but it will also help prevent back pain. To achieve the ideal posture, the distance between your feet should be about the same as the width of your shoulders. You should also avoid locking your knees.

      "title": "Use your core.",
      "content": "Use your core. Your abdominal muscles are very important for maintaining good posture. Try to consciously draw your lower belly in while you walk. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If your abdominal muscles are not very strong, a good exercise regimen can help you both strengthen your core and improve your posture."

    {
      "title": "Practice.",
      "content": "Practice. In order to perfect your walking posture, you will need to devote some time to practicing. If possible, videotape yourself while walking and then watch the footage carefully to look for ways in which your posture can be improved. [6] X Research source You can also try practicing walking with great posture by balancing a book on your head. The more you do it, the easier and more natural it will become."

      "title": "Emulate others.",
      "content": "Emulate others. In addition to being mindful of your own posture and poise, be mindful of the way others carry themselves. If you see someone who has a particularly graceful walk, make note of her posture and try to learn from it."

    {
      "title": "Look straight ahead as your walk.",
      "content": "Look straight ahead as your walk. You don't need to stare at everyone you pass by, but don't be afraid of making brief eye contact. Even if your posture is perfect, you will not look very graceful if your eyes are always looking at the floor. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source It might help you feel more comfortable if you imagine a straight line on the floor and focus your attention on a spot far in front of you. This will help you walk straighter, and it will make it appear as though you are looking straight ahead, without having to worry about direct eye contact."

      "title": "Watch your hands.",
      "content": "Watch your hands. Nothing will ruin your otherwise graceful walk more easily than fidgety hands. As you walk, hold your arms gently by your sides and allow them to move ever so slightly. Avoid crossing your arms, putting your hands in your pockets, or touching your hair and clothing with your hands. All of these actions will make you look anxious and uncomfortable. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source It's important to find a natural-looking arm position. Your arms should not be swinging wildly by your sides, nor should they be so rigid that you look like a robot. If you can't seem to hold your arms at your sides without looking too stiff, try holding a clutch. This will give your hands something productive to do so they don't fidget."

      "title": "Take your time walking.",
      "content": "Take your time walking. Sudden movements will make you appear jittery and uncertain of yourself, while calm, deliberate movements come across as graceful and confident. Be especially mindful of how fast you are walking if you feel anxious. It can be easy to pick up the pace without realizing it. The more deliberate you are with your movements, the more natural this kind of walk will become. While you want to move slowly, make sure your movements are not unnaturally slow. If you are walking in heels, it is even more important not to walk too quickly. You will probably find that your natural stride is slightly shorter when you are wearing heels, so walking quickly will look awkward. It will also make you more likely to lose your balance."

      "title": "Smile as you walk.",
      "content": "Smile as you walk. There's no need to have an artificial grin on your face all the time, but it will help you appear more confident and graceful as you walk if you have a pleasant expression on your face."

      "title": "Make sure your shoes fit properly.",
      "content": "Make sure your shoes fit properly. If your shoes are too loose, it will be very hard to walk in them. If they are too tight, you will be in so much pain that your walk may look very awkward. Make sure to take some time to walk around in them at the store to make sure they really fit well and don't pinch your feet. [9] X Research source If you find that your shoes are slightly too big, you can purchase inserts to add a little bit of cushion and prevent rubbing."

    {
      "title": "Choose the right kind of heel.",
      "content": "Choose the right kind of heel. High heel shoes come in many different shapes and sizes. In order to walk gracefully in them, it's crucial to choose a pair that is right for you. [10] X Research source Start off with a lower heel and gradually work your way up to a higher heel. Keep in mind that not everyone is capable of walking in super high heels. Typically people who have smaller feet need to wear shorter heels. Shoes with super narrow heels are much more difficult to walk in, so look for a slightly wider heel if you are not used to walking in heels. If your ankles tend to get wobbly when wearing heels, you may want to look for a pair that has ankle straps. Heels with pointy toes are usually less comfortable than other styles. Don't choose high platform heels unless you are experienced at walking in heels."

      "title": "Practice walking in your heels.",
      "content": "Practice walking in your heels. Walking in heels is a little tricky, and you can easily come across looking clumsy and awkward if you are not used to walking in them. Before you go out in public in your heels, make sure you take some time to practice walking in them around the house. Keep these pointers in mind when walking in heels: [11] X Research source Always put your heel down first when taking a step. Take smaller steps than you would if you were wearing flats. Watch out for soft or uneven surfaces that might catch your heel."

      "title": "Wear shoes you feel comfortable in.",
      "content": "Wear shoes you feel comfortable in. You can walk gracefully in almost any kind of shoe, so don't feel like you have to wear heels. If you prefer flats, just work on improving your posture and conveying confident body language, and you will look very graceful. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You may want to avoid walking around in flip flops, as they make a lot of noise, are bad for your posture, and may cause you to trip, none of which is very graceful.
