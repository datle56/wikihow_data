      "content": "Understand the basics. Atopic dermatitis is a skin condition that most often appears in childhood. It is related to environmental allergies, hay fever, and asthma, meaning that if you develop one of these conditions, you are more likely to develop the other conditions. Atopic dermatitis is an immune response. Typically, an irritant (called the \"precipitant\" or immediate cause) comes into contact with your body. The body gets confused and overreacts, causing inflammation of the skin even in areas that weren't exposed."

      "title": "Know the symptoms.",
      "content": "Know the symptoms. If you develop acute (short-term) eczema, you may see small, red, itchy bumps on your skin. There might also be some swelling and scaling. If the eczema continues, the symptoms may reach the chronic stage, developing into itchy, thicker patches of skin that turn brownish or reddish. In addition, the bumps may weep, meaning they produce liquid. You may also have scaly, dry skin."

      "content": "Be aware how atopic dermatitis can affect your vision. This condition can cause problems with your vision. If you think your vision is being affected by a recent flare-up, always speak with your doctor. One way it affects your vision is the skin around your eyes can be red and puffy, making it difficult to see. However, this disease has also been linked to a higher occurrence of cataracts and spontaneous retinal detachment, even when treated. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use an ice pack or cold compress around your eyes.",
      "content": "Use an ice pack or cold compress around your eyes. Application of cold causes temporary numbness of the nerve endings, leading to reduced sensation, soothing the skin, and reducing your urge to itch. It also helps in sloughing off dead skin, leading to a smoother appearance and quicker healing. Put cold water in a bowl with some bath oil. If you want it colder, you can add some ice to the water. Soak a paper towel or clean washcloth in the water. Hold it on your face over the affected area for about 5 minutes."

      "title": "Apply a moisturizer to your face.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizer to your face. A cream or ointment is best, as they have more oil than lotions, which are heavier on water. The oil helps protect and moisturize your skin better. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Pick a cream that is fragrance-free, and make sure to keep it out of your eyes when applying it. Apply moisturizers as often as your skin feels dry. Applying it after a shower or washing your face is especially effective. These moisturizers soften skin and help heal and prevent flare-ups.

      "content": "Stay healthy and comfortable. Stress can make your eczema worse, as can exposure to chemical irritants. Because of this, it often helps to use a holistic medicine approach. Aromatherapy, massage, and similar techniques can help reduce stress and potentially bolster your immune system. Many alternative medicine skin preparations are soothing and irritant-free, such as a light layer of unrefined coconut oil. [6] X Research source If you are currently taking medication for your eczema, consult your doctor before taking any dietary supplements or skin care treatments, including herbal remedies. Essential oils are highly concentrated and should not be used undiluted, especially around sensitive areas such as the eyes. Even when diluted, take care not to let any get in your eyes.

      "content": "Ask about oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are sometimes used when you get an infection related to your dermatitis.

      "title": "Avoid known allergens.",
      "content": "Avoid known allergens. Eczema is often caused by exposure to an allergen. Avoiding your personal triggers is the number one strategy for controlling flare-ups. If you know you are sensitive to certain substances, do your best to avoid them. Remember that the allergen does not need to come into contact with the affected skin. Your body can detect the allergen in one location and react with a flare up in a different place."

[9] X Research source Identify stressors. When your stress levels are running high, think about what's affecting them. Write about what makes you worried or excited, and think about what you can do to reduce the stress of that event. For instance, if you find your job stressful, maybe you can reduce stress by asking your boss if you can telecommute once a week. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try conscious breathing to calm yourself. Take a moment to close your eyes. Let your breathing fill up your mind. Focus on slow, deep breaths, and think only about your breathing. Keep focusing until you feel yourself calming down. [11] X Research source Try animal sounds with your kids to meditate. Have them breathe in deeply while raising their arms. As they lower them, have them make extended sounds such as hissing or buzzing. This exercise helps them slow down their breathing and takes their mind off of what is stressing them out."

Scratching can also cause you to lose part of your eyebrows and eyelashes. If you or your child scratches at night, try wearing gloves or trimming your fingernails to help reduce the problem."

      "content": "Identify allergens and irritants. Allergens and irritants can contribute to flare-ups. Sometimes changing a product such as laundry detergent or soap may help in treatment of eczema. Attempt to isolate what causes you issues by slowly switching out products to help determine what bothers you. While you are having a flare-up, it's best to skip make-up altogether. It may help to keep a diary recording the food, perfume, scents, and other substances you come into contact with, along with the eczema flare-ups you experience. Look for patterns in the substances you contact in the days before a flare-up. You can visit an allergy specialist to help identify your allergies. The face and eye area can be especially problematic because so many products are applied in this area, particularly on women. Sunscreen, make-up, soaps, and fragrances can all cause flare-ups."
