  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Summarize the subject's most memorable actions.",
      "content": "Summarize the subject's most memorable actions. The conclusion of a biography should remind the reader of the subject’s achievements or actions. Briefly describe their greatest achievements so that the reader can remember why it is important or enlightening to learn about their life. [1] X Research source A conclusion in Jane Austen’s biography, for example, should mention that she wrote 6 novels, some of which are regarded among the memorable and influential works of English literature. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Describe the subject's impact.",
      "content": "Describe the subject's impact. It is important to describe the impact the subject had during their lifetime. [3] X Research source If their actions caused political reform, describe the laws, changes, or conflicts that that took place because of their actions. If they enacted important societal changes, mention how their actions changed the cultural mindset. A biography about Martin Luther, the 16th-century monk who lead the Protestant Reformation, should mention his impact on the development of religious beliefs throughout Europe. Not only did he challenge the ruling Catholic Church, but he made the Bible more accessible to all individuals, not just the clergy. A conclusion should mention that his actions influenced religious beliefs during the Renaissance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss the subject's legacy.",
      "content": "Discuss the subject's legacy. If your subject’s work, actions, or opinions had a wide-reaching influence that impacted future generations, mention that in the conclusion. Perhaps their work lead to the development of laws that are still in use today, or perhaps their opinions helped eradicate unfair societal norms. A biography of Susan B. Anthony, for example, could mention that her actions and beliefs influenced generations of women and their continued fight for gender equality. A conclusion of the biography of Albert Einstein could mention that his theories and publications have influenced the development of quantum theory and generations of scientists who work toward unifying his theories of the universe. A biography of author Upton Sinclair could mention that his novel The Jungle influenced the American public health system and helped create laws for regulating the food and drug industries.

    {
      "title": "Explain what the subject learned or achieved throughout their life.",
      "content": "Explain what the subject learned or achieved throughout their life. While a biography on an important historical figure may include details about their legacy, a biography about a family friend or person who is unknown to the general public may not. In this case, mention what the person learned or achieved in their life, or note experiences that transformed them. [5] X Research source For instance, a biography written by your grandmother may focus on how moving to a metropolitan area when she got married changed her perspective on women in the workforce. If you’re writing the biography about yourself , note the greatest life lessons you’ve learned or the biggest achievements you’ve had so far."
    },
    {
      "title": "Humanize the subject.",
      "content": "Humanize the subject. Sometimes reading about important figures or influential people can make the subject appear unrelatable to the reader. Use your conclusion to briefly mention personal details, stories, or accounts that you mentioned throughout the biography. Bringing these personal details into the conclusion can make the subject more accessible to the reader. [6] X Research source Discuss how they loved visiting their grandmother, or mention that their favorite place was a quiet cabin in the mountains."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mention their challenges.",
      "content": "Mention their challenges. While reading a biography, the reader may forget that each person has had their own difficulties and personal struggles to overcome. If a subject has been greatly influenced by a personal tragedy or was fired from several jobs during their lifetime, consider mentioning that in the conclusion. The late Nelson Mandela led an influential, prominent, and successful life as a South African activist and former president. Although he earned many awards and honors, he admitted that he was not a very good student when he was trying to earn a law degree. [7] X Research source A reader may be able to better understand that Nelson Mandela had to work hard during his life."

    {
      "title": "Describe their hobbies or passions.",
      "content": "Describe their hobbies or passions. If the subject’s hobbies, passions, or interests played an important role in their life, incorporate that into the conclusion. Perhaps reading particular books inspired them to write their own popular novel, or maybe their love for animals inspired them to work to protect endangered animals. [8] X Research source Weave their personal interests into the conclusion by acknowledging how those interests influenced their work or life decisions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recap your key points.",
      "content": "Recap your key points. Your thesis , or the main point or claim, most likely guided how you organized the biography. To remind the reader of your thesis, summarize its key points within the conclusion. [9] X Research source Reminding the reader of your thought process will help make a stronger case for your thesis and help the reader understand the goal of the biography. Briefly remind the audience of the key points that influenced your thesis. Perhaps your subject moved a lot as a child, and you believe the subject’s bestselling novels were influenced by this. Point out that the main character in the novel is often on the go, and that was the basis for your thesis."
    },
    {
      "title": "Refrain from introducing new ideas or details.",
      "content": "Refrain from introducing new ideas or details. Do not use the conclusion to add new details, facts, or stories that were not referenced in the biography. [10] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Introducing new information at this point may confuse the reader or leave them with unanswered questions. Focus on referencing information that you already discussed."

    {
      "title": "Cite brief examples to support your thesis.",
      "content": "Cite brief examples to support your thesis. The biography’s main idea should be reinforced and supported in the conclusion. Briefly remind the reader of the evidence you provided in the biography. Use the biography’s themes, patterns, or messages to support your thesis. [11] X Research source If you believed that the subject’s actions later in life were a result of their experiences during war, briefly reassert what major decisions you think were affected. Perhaps they participated in anti-war protests, founded an organization that promotes peace, and worked to uphold human rights. Make a note that their actions revolved around establishing peace. Remind the reader what makes the subject unique or special and what life events demonstrate these qualities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid using transitional phrases.",
      "content": "Avoid using transitional phrases. Avoid including phrases like, “in conclusion,” “therefore,” and “finally” in your conclusion. Phrases such as these may make the reader feel as though the ending is abrupt and has been hurried along. Try to leave your reader with an ending that seems natural. [12] X Research source Instead of saying, \"in conclusion,\" try to provide your reader with a subtle transition instead. Conclude by saying, \"Because of the magic and popularity of her novels, I believe that J.K. Rowling will continue to influence young readers for generations to come.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Use direct quotes from your subject if they will strengthen your thesis.",
      "content": "Use direct quotes from your subject if they will strengthen your thesis. If it makes sense for the biography you are writing, pull quotes from the subject’s letters, interviews, or essays to support your thesis or your belief in their impact. [13] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Choose a pertinent quotation, but do not take a quote out of context simply to add strength to your thesis. [14] X Research source This is an exception to the rule of not adding new information to the conclusion, as quotes shouldn’t be repeated throughout the biography."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide closure.",
      "content": "Provide closure. Give the reader a satisfactory and fulfilling conclusion by offering them a sense of closure. Revisit the opening scene from the biography so the reader can experience it again now that they have more information. Reiterate a key event, important publication, or central accomplishment that encapsulates their life story. [15] X Research source Conclude with a sense of hope or continued progress. Allow your reader to imagine that this person’s life story will continue influence the lives of others. If your subject is still alive, for example, provide a hopeful ending by saying “Elizabeth continues to fight for the rights of those who have been repressed by being a vocal leader in the United States Senate.”"
