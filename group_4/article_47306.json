      "content": "Work on a cool, cloudy day so the windows don’t dry too fast. Choose an overcast day to wash your exterior windows so that there won’t be any direct sunlight on them. Too much sun will dry the window cleaning solution before you can wipe it all off and leave streaks on your windows. [1] X Research source It will also be much easier to see where the windows are dirty without the sun reflecting off of them."

      "content": "Remove any window screens and clean them if necessary. Pop off or unscrew the windows screens and set them on a clean tarp or drop cloth outside. Rinse them thoroughly with a garden hose on low pressure to clean off dust and dirt. Shake the excess water off the screens, dry them with a clean towel as much as you can, and let them air dry all the way. [2] X Research source You can spot-clean any particularly dirty areas with a soft-bristled scrubbing brush and water to remove stuck-on dirt that doesn't come off by rinsing. For extra cleaning, rinse the screen, then spray it with a water and vinegar solution. Rinse it again, then let it dry thoroughly.

It will make it much easier to focus on cleaning the more stubborn grime off the windows. [4] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 3 December 2020. The easiest way to do this is with a garden hose. If you don’t have a garden hose or you can’t reach all of the windows with your hose, then fill a bucket with water from the faucet and splash it onto the windows to rinse them."

Squeeze 1 squirt of liquid dish detergent from the bottle into the water in the bucket to make a window washing solution.

Cool water takes longer to dry, so it will give you more time to work before the cleaning solution starts to dry and leave streaks on your windows."

      "content": "Dip a window scrubber or sponge into the bucket and wring it out. A window scrubber is ideal for cleaning medium to large windows as it will cover more area. A large sponge, like the kind for washing cars, works fine as well. [6] X Research source You can also use a soft microfiber cloth. [7] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 3 December 2020. It’s important to squeeze out the excess cleaning solution from the sponge or scrubber to help reduce streaking. Window scrubbers are wide rectangular sponges attached to a handle of some kind. The handle can often be screwed onto a standard broomstick or telescopic pole."

Start in the top corner, tilt the squeegee so just the corner is touching the glass, and pull it all the way down the glass to create a clean vertical strip along the edge on 1 side of the window. This will make it easier to squeegee the whole window clean using horizontal strokes. [9] X Research source If you are right-handed, start in the top left-hand corner.

Pull it firmly across the window to remove the cleaning solution from the glass. Work your way down the entire window, overlapping your strokes by about 2 in (5.1 cm), until the glass is totally clear. [10] X Research source Wipe your squeegee with a clean, dry cloth between strokes to remove excess liquid. You don't need to rinse the window after scrubbing it with the soapy water because the squeegee will remove all of the solution and leave the window clean."

Pay special attention to the perimeter of the glass where the squeegee might not have reached all the way. [11] X Research source Put your fingertip inside the cloth and wipe it along the side, top, and bottom edges to get right into the corners and ensure you dry up all the remaining drops of water. You can also use newspaper to dry your windows. [12] X Expert Source Jon Gholian Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 3 December 2020."

      "content": "Use a telescopic pole to clean hard-to-reach windows. A telescopic pole is like a broomstick that extends to different lengths. Screw a window scrubber onto one of these poles in order to scrub tall and out-of-reach windows, then swap a squeegee onto it to finish the cleaning. [14] X Research source Use a window scrubber attached to the pole to scrub the window at all angles with soapy water, working from top to bottom. Then, put a squeegee on the pole and pull it straight down the window, working from one side to the other using overlapping strokes to remove all the water and soap. If you don’t have a telescopic pole, then you can use a ladder to reach high windows. Just make sure you have a helper to hold the ladder steady while you are cleaning the windows and be careful!"

A window scrubber will be too wide to clean a window that has multiple panes on it, so use a handheld sponge that will fit within each pane. Cut a squeegee to fit the window panes using a hacksaw for the metal part and a utility knife for the rubber strip. Scrub the glass with the sponge soaked in a solution of clean, cool water and liquid dish detergent. Squeegee each pane clean with 1 stroke from top to bottom with your custom-cut squeegee."

Use a commercial cleaner that is meant for removing things like calcium, lime, and rust to remove these types of mineral stains. Follow the directions on the label to use it. [16] X Research source These types of commercial cleaners are often marketed for cleaning things like showers and bathtubs. You don't need anything made especially for glass. Avoid using commercial window cleaners for regular outdoor window cleaning because they often leave streaks and even attract more dust and dirt. Only use special cleaning products for removing mineral deposits left by hard water."
