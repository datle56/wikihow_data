      "title": "Check the care label.",
      "content": "Check the care label. Before washing anything, carefully read the washing instructions on the item’s care label. This label will provide guidance regarding exactly how to clean the clothing. For instance, some types of fabric might require you to hand wash and/or hang dry them. Other clothes can be cleaned in washing machines, but may need cold or warm water. [1] X Research source Use a pair of scissors to remove any price tags on the clothing. Don’t forget to slip the plastic clip out of the clothes, too."

      "title": "Determine which clothes are likely to leach dye if the care label is not specific.",
      "content": "Determine which clothes are likely to leach dye if the care label is not specific. Garment care instructions are written in order to prevent you from causing your new clothes to lose color when washed. Most of the time, determining if clothes are likely to leach dye is as easy as consulting the care label. However, if your new clothes do not have a care label, ask the salesperson who sold them to you what the garment is made of, and whether it is likely to leach dye. [2] X Research source Cotton, wool, and silk are more likely to leach dye than synthetic materials like polyester, nylon, and acrylic. Wash clothes of these materials separately on the gentle cycle in cold water."

      "title": "Test for dye transfer if necessary.",
      "content": "Test for dye transfer if necessary. If you cannot consult the salesperson who sold you the new clothes, or if the salesperson is ignorant as to the material your new clothes were made of, you can test the clothing yourself. Dip a white cloth in a bit of the laundry detergent you intend to use to wash your clothes that are brand new. Dab an inconspicuous portion of the garment (for instance, an inner seam) with the white cloth. Check the cloth intermittently as you dab the garment. If any color comes out, wash the new item separately in cold water on the gentle cycle. [3] X Research source Set the dye. If you suspect or know that your new clothes will leach dye, you can purchase a dye fixative from your local tailor or clothier. Specific directions for use will vary according to the product you’ve selected. Generally, however, you can simply wash the clothing along with a small amount of the dye fixative on a cold water cycle. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Separate your clothes.",
      "content": "Separate your clothes. If you’re planning on washing clothes that are brand new along with clothes that are not, or planning on washing several items of brand new clothing, you will need to segregate your clothes into appropriate categories. These categories are determined by the information on the care tags. [5] X Research source For instance, you typically should not wash light clothes with dark clothes. Other brand-new clothes need to be washed separately because they are delicate. Consult the care tag(s) on your brand new clothes to determine how to best separate your clothes."

      "title": "Turn your clothes inside out.",
      "content": "Turn your clothes inside out. If you’re washing brand new clothes that are colored along with other clothes (whether they’re brand new or older), turn your brand new items inside out. This will prevent the dye from running, and will reduce the chances of staining other garments even if the dye does run. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Unbutton your clothes.",
      "content": "Unbutton your clothes. If you’re washing any brand new clothes that are buttoned, unfasten the buttons. This will prevent the clothes from rending during the washing process. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Use cold water.",
      "content": "Use cold water. Cold water is appropriate for washing brand new clothes that are delicate, such as sweaters, lacy tops, mesh jerseys, and the like. It is also the best option for washing clothes that might shrink. Finally, if you have a piece of brand new clothing that is colored or features both light and dark colors, wash it in cold water to prevent the colors from running. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your washer to use warm water. Warm water is an acceptable way to wash brand new clothes that are light-colored or white. Warm water – when mixed with detergent – will effectively lift soil and stains, as well as remove bacteria. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Choose the appropriate load size.",
      "content": "Choose the appropriate load size. If your laundry load fills the washing machine to about three-quarters of its capacity or more, you will need to select the “large” setting on your washer. If your washer is filled about halfway with new clothes, you should select the “medium” setting. If your washer is filled to about one-third of its capacity or less, you should select the “small” load setting. [11] X Research source Choosing the right load size will prevent wasting water and get your clothes washed faster."

      "title": "Decide on your washer speed.",
      "content": "Decide on your washer speed. Washing machines can spin at different speeds. Higher speeds should be reserved for more durable clothes. Gentle or delicate cycles should be reserved for brand new clothes like women’s lingerie, sweaters, and other items that could be damaged by rough handling. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a high-efficiency laundry detergent.",
      "content": "Choose a high-efficiency laundry detergent. High-efficiency washing machines use less water than traditional washing machines, and specialized high-efficiency laundry detergents must be used when washing clothes in such a machine. However, most high-efficiency detergents can also be used in traditional washing machines, too."

If you are washing new clothes that are colored, you’ll need to wash them in cold water to prevent color bleeding. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Cold water detergents generally work best in water between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 24 degrees Celsius). Adjust your washing machine’s water temperature to the appropriate temperature range, if possible. Washing your brand new clothes (or even your older clothes) in cold water can save energy, which means you save money."

      "content": "Purchase an environmentally friendly detergent. Traditional detergents often contain chemicals that could be discharged into local waterways, affecting aquatic life and, potentially, the communities that use those waterways. Fortunately, there are many environmentally friendly detergents that use nontoxic alternatives or, at the very least, fewer chemicals. Choose one of these to reduce your negative environmental impact. [16] X Research source You can often identify an environmentally friendly detergent by its name. Look for detergents with names preceded by the prefix “eco” or “bio.”"

If you are unsure of how long the washing cycle will take, ask someone more familiar with the machine or consult your washing machine’s user guide.

      "content": "Take your clothes out as soon as possible. Wet clothing is more likely to color bleed.

      "content": "Hand wash anything that needs to be washed by hand. If the care label on your brand new clothes indicates that you must wash something by hand, do not attempt to wash it in the washing machine. Instead, fill a sink basin with cool water and mix in a bit of dishwashing liquid until the water is sudsy. Soak your clothes that are brand new in the water for 10 minutes. Drain the sink and rinse your clothes in cold water. [20] X Research source Just as you did with brand new clothes that you washed in the machine, separate clothes you wash by hand according to their color. Lay hand-washed clothing flat on a clothing rack or towel to dry."
