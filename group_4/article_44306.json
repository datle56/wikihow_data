      "content": "Fill out a license transfer form. Pet licenses are issued by the city or county where you live. You can pick up a transfer form at animal shelters, or from many veterinarians. You may also be able to download a copy of the form online. The form requires information about you and the new owner, as well as basic information about the pet. You will have to include the pet's license number, and typically a brief description of the animal."

      "title": "Sign the form in the presence of a notary if required.",
      "content": "Sign the form in the presence of a notary if required. The license transfer form typically must be signed by both you and the new owner. Some cities or counties will require you to sign in front of a notary. Look on the form to see if there is a block for a notary signature and seal. [1] X Research source Once you've signed the form, make two copies so both you and the new owner will have a copy for your personal files. You'll have to turn in the original to the city or county animal control authority."

    {
      "title": "Submit your form in person if necessary.",
      "content": "Submit your form in person if necessary. Some cities or counties require you to bring your form in person to an animal shelter or animal control office. Typically both the old owner and the new owner are required to be present. [2] X Research source There typically isn't a fee to simply transfer the license to a new owner. However, if the new owner wants to have a new license number issued, or wants new tags printed, they may have to pay a fee."

      "title": "Find out where your pet's microchip is registered.",
      "content": "Find out where your pet's microchip is registered. If your pet is microchipped, that microchip is registered with a particular registration service. Some city and county governments have their own agreements with these services, so they'll transfer microchip registration along with the pet's license. Typically, though, you'll have to do this separately. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Kennel Club The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a purebred dog pedigree registry in the United States. The AKC advocates for the responsible ownership of dogs and promotes purebred dog events, such as the Westminster Dog Show.

      "title": "Follow the microchip registration service's instructions.",
      "content": "Follow the microchip registration service's instructions. Each registration service has its own process for changing ownership of the microchip registration. Some require payment of a fee, while others do not. [4] X Research source In most cases, it takes 2 to 3 weeks for the transfer of microchip registration to take effect."

      "title": "Search the internet for templates and samples.",
      "content": "Search the internet for templates and samples. Many nonprofit pet adoption services have sample transfer of ownership agreements that you can use for your own purposes. Just remember to adapt the agreement to suit your needs. Don't copy clauses verbatim if you don't understand them or they don't apply to your situation. [5] X Research source For example, if you and your new owner live in North Carolina, you wouldn't want to copy an agreement clause that stated the agreement was governed by the laws in the state of California. Pet attorneys and legal document websites also have sample transfer of ownership agreements you can use. Some of them will charge a fee for you to access or create these documents."

      "content": "Provide details about the pet. The transfer of ownership agreement should include a description of your pet, including the animal, breed (if appropriate), and coloration. You may also include your pet's name if you want. [7] X Research source Many transfer of ownership agreements also include medical information about the pet, such as a record of veterinary checkups and vaccinations. You may also want to disclose if your pet has any diagnosed medical conditions, such as a heart murmur or hip dysplasia. Include license or tag numbers and any registration or microchip numbers associated with your pet. Add a disclaimer that these numbers will be transferred to the new owner. Typically this is your responsibility as the old owner of the pet."

      "content": "Add proper disclaimers and choice of law. Once you and the new owner sign the agreement, it will be a legally binding document. Like any legal contract, your agreement should include standard provisions stating that the document represents the entire agreement between you and the new owner. [8] X Research source If both you and the new owner live in the same state, you can simply provide that the agreement will be governed by the laws of the state in which you both live. If you live in different states, discuss the issue with the new owner. You also want to state where and how the agreement can be enforced. You can elect to go to court to enforce the agreement if necessary, or you can provide for mediation or arbitration. While it's unlikely you'll have to do this, the point of a written contract is to make sure all bases are covered."

You don't need to make any special agreements with the new owner regarding care and treatment, but you can if you want. [9] X Research source For example, you may want your pet to continue going to the same vet. If the new owner lives in the same town as you, they may agree to do this. If your pet is currently taking any medications, discuss this continued treatment with the new owner. Make sure they understand the dosing schedule."

Make and sign two copies so that both you and the new owner have an original with original signatures. [10] X Research source In most states it isn't necessary to sign your agreement in front of a notary. However, you may want to do so to prevent disputes later on. For example, the new owner could claim they never signed the document. A notarized signature would prove they had."
