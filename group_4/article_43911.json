      "title": "Use at least 3 fenders on your boat.",
      "content": "Use at least 3 fenders on your boat. A boat should have at least 3 fenders tied to it to protect it efficiently, more always being a good option. You can follow the guidelines of having 1 fender per 10 feet (300 cm) of waterline while also always having a minimum of 3 fenders. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Place 1 fender at the widest part of the boat.",
      "content": "Place 1 fender at the widest part of the boat. The widest part of your boat is the part that will bump into something first along the sides, so you definitely want to place a fender at this section. [2] X Research source You can place other fenders forward and aft."

    {
      "title": "Use a fender board if the spaces between pilings are big.",
      "content": "Use a fender board if the spaces between pilings are big. Sometimes your boat will bump into pilings even if they have fenders attached if the spaces between the pilings are large. To prevent this, you can use fender boards which connect to 2 fenders, forming a barrier against the pilings."

      "title": "Orient your fenders either horizontally or vertically.",
      "content": "Orient your fenders either horizontally or vertically. When you're choosing the position of your fenders, think about what your boat is going to come into contact with. [3] X Expert Source Travis Lund Sailing Instructor & Executive Director, Treasure Island Sailing Center Expert Interview. 24 April 2020. If your boat will be stationed next to another boat, by a dock, or by a seawall, you’ll want to tie the fenders on going vertically. If your boat will be next to pilings or posts, choose to tie them horizontally."

      "title": "Choose something solid and low to tie your fenders to.",
      "content": "Choose something solid and low to tie your fenders to. You want to tie the fenders as low on the boat as possible, choosing something sturdy such as a cleat, a lifeline stanchion, or a padeye. [4] X Expert Source Travis Lund Sailing Instructor & Executive Director, Treasure Island Sailing Center Expert Interview. 24 April 2020. Tying them low will help keep them steady and prevent them from swinging around too much. Avoid tying fenders to the top of a lifeline or rail."

      "content": "Stand on the boat to adjust the fender heights. Position yourself next to what you'll be protecting your boat from bumping against to decide where to position the fenders. Stand on your boat when adjusting the fenders, next to the dock, boat, or other structure. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the fenders according to what they’re lying against. When you’re holding the fender over the boat, position it so that it becomes a buffer between the boat and the dock or other structure. You should raise or lower the fenders depending on the height of what you’re protecting your boat from. [6] X Research source"

Pull the end of the line up through the loop you just created. Pull it tightly to secure it. [12] X Research source You can repeat this process to create several half hitches, making your line even more secure. Use half hitches if you're attaching the fenders to a lifeline.
