Obagi offers a product called Sun Shield Matte Broad Spectrum SPF 50 specifically designed to be used with the Obagi systems. It offers both UVA and UVB protection for your skin, and comes in a sheer, matte finish. This sunscreen can be used on all skin types. Sunscreen only needs to be applied after you've completed your morning routine. You do not need to apply sunscreen before you go to bed."
