[1] X Expert Source Jon Rowland Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. If you live in a colder climate but have Callas growing in the garden, consider removing your Calla rhizomes, or bulbs, over the winter to give them a better chance of survival. To do this: Wait until just after the first frost. Cut the withered foliage back to three inches above ground level. [2] X Research source"

Cut off the dead foliage, leaving about a 2-inch length of dead leaves on the rhizome. [5] X Expert Source Jon Rowland Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Rinse the bulbs under cool running water (such as the water from a garden hose) to remove the rest of the soil."

      "content": "Put the rhizomes on a tray and allow them to dry for a few days. They should be well spaced to allow air to circulate between them. A cool dark place such as a garden shed or garage is suitable. It may be better to avoid bringing them into a heated home as the heat may be a shock that could cause mold to form on your bulbs. 60 to 70 degrees F is an ideal temperature for rhizome storage. It should not be less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). [6] X Expert Source Jon Rowland Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Try not to let them be exposed to sunlight."

[7] X Expert Source Jon Rowland Plant Specialist Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. Put a small amount of dry peat moss or vermiculite inside. [8] X Research source Putting the moss or vermiculite in the bag will help to prevent one bulb from infecting another if it develops mold. You can also use a cardboard box if you make some ventilation holes to let air circulate. Avoid letting the bulbs touch each other and put moss or vermiculite between them."

      "title": "Try to keep your rhizomes dry.",
      "content": "Try to keep your rhizomes dry. Damp and rot are the biggest threats to overwintering rhizomes, so try to keep them dry where possible and store them in a dark, dry place. They should not dry out completely however. If the bulbs appear dry or shrunken, a light mist with a water spray should prevent them from drying out too much."

      "title": "Give your rhizomes time to recover before you replant them.",
      "content": "Give your rhizomes time to recover before you replant them. Callas need to rest for a few months before growing again. Try to plant them in mid or late spring once the threat of frost has passed and the ground is warmer. Your Calla is more at risk of rotting because of the winter rain rather than the frost so avoid planting if the ground if waterlogged, even if the weather is mild."

      "content": "Consider keeping your Calla in a pot. You can plant a Calla lily outside in a container and move it inside for the winter. [9] X Research source When planting, use decent-quality compost and make sure the container has good drainage holes. Plant the rhizomes with the eyes upwards so that they are just visible in the soil. Once flowering ends, give the pot a feed with a potassium-rich fertilizer (one suitable for tomatoes will do). After that, cease watering your container-grown Calla lily and move the pot to a cool dark area once the foliage withers away. A dark corner of a garden shed is suitable. Don't water your plant again for three months and avoid cutting the foliage until it has withered away."

      "content": "Consider keeping your Callas outside if you live in a mild climate. Calla Lilies will survive outdoors over winter in mild climates that don't experience much sustained snow, deep freezes and heavy prolonged rainfall in the colder months. They can generally cope outdoors through winter in zones 8 through 10. This means that they can survive in temperatures that do not drop below 30 to 35 degrees F (-1.1 to 1.7 degrees C).

      "content": "Choose a well-drained spot in a sunny position. Keep in mind that if you can't find a super sunny spot, Callas will tolerate shade for part of the day. It's a good idea to incorporate some well-rotted manure or compost into the soil to improve it ahead of planting. A rich soil will help the plant produce flowers."

These are the growing points that look like the 'eyes' on a potato. [13] X Research source Leave about 12 inches (30.5 cm) of space between each of your rhizomes. Once they are in the ground, give them a good soaking and then continue to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged as they grow."

      "content": "Water your Calla lilies. Calla Lilies require water throughout the summer. If you dig them up for overwintering indoors, they will need extra water as they get established back in the ground. Remember to feed fortnightly during the growing period—a water-soluble fertilizer added to the watering can is ideal—but stop feeding ground-planted Calla lilies once flowering begins. Continue feeding container-grown Callas throughout the flowering period."
