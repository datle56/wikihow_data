You should see the power indicator light up after a second. This will reset the router to its factory settings. [1] X Research source Depending on your brand of your old router, you may need to use a pen or unbent paperclip to press the Reset button."

It's a good idea to turn off Wi-Fi on the computer for testing purposes.

For example, if the first router has a default IP address of 192.168.1.1, you can change the second router's IP address to something like 192.168.1.2, as long as it's not assigned to another device. [5] X Research source You can usually find the option to change the IP address under \"Home\", \"Setup\", or \"LAN\". Consult the user's manual to change the IP address with your particular router."
