      "content": "Consider your own role in the situation. Someone can only use you if you let them, so ask yourself if this could be the case for you. If you have low self-esteem, then it's likely that you will be too nice to people and easily go along with what they want. This can make you feel used. Don't give yourself a hard time for letting people use you. Instead, focus on the future."

      "content": "Ask for clarification on the relationship’s status. Sometimes in relationships, you may feel uncertain about where things truly stand because the other person is either resistant to labeling the relationship or doesn’t consistently differentiate their feelings for you from others. This might occur when someone is reluctant to call the other their “girlfriend”, “boyfriend”, or \"partner\" – to others, in front of others and to the other. In cases such as this, there’s a good chance you’re being used. This might also occur when, for example, your “best friend” calls several others their “best friend” as well, causing you to wonder about the true nature of your friendship. Often this happens because the person is happy with the situation as it is, wants to leave their options open, or doesn’t want to lose the benefits of being special to you. [1] X Research source [2] X Research source If you find yourself in this situation, ask how the other person defines the relationship and, if applicable, where they would like to see the relationship go in the future. If this doesn’t align with what you want, you might consider either severing ties or modifying your expectations of the other person and the relationship."

      "content": "Observe when you spend time together. You would be wise to question the motives of another person if you find a) that you typically spend time together when the other person is bored or wants or needs something (like someone to listen as your mother-in-law rants about how little she sees your husband), b) that the time is generally spent alone (like late at night), or c) that it’s time spent to fill a spot (like as a date to an event or as a last-minute bowling partner). In doing this, the other person’s needs and wishes not only disregard yours but also dictate one of the most fundamental aspects of any relationship – when you see the other person. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source [5] X Research source [6] X Research source If this is the case, you must decide if what you’re getting out of the relationship compensates for this, assuming it upsets you. And you must choose whether or not to discuss your feelings and/or your decision with the other person.

For instance, are you rarely invited to dinner parties at your supposed friend’s home? Does a woman at work stop by your desk religiously after office meetings to make copies of your notes but fail to include you every day for lunch with “the girls”? When you need something, can you never track down the other person? While occasional oversights happen, repeatedly avoiding or not including you indicates the relationship might not be what you thought or wanted. Just as the other person dictates when you spend time together, the same is happening when you don’t spend time together. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source Here, too, you must decide on a course of action – to talk with the other person and see if things change or emotionally detach from a relationship you may have wanted but do not have."

This ultimately leads to you not trusting in the person or the relationship. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source In many cases, the commitment was made while also asking something of the other person. So, pay attention to whether anything is asked of you (or wanted from you) when a commitment or plans are made, but dropped.

It’s also a good sign that they may not be very serious about you, that you’re not particularly significant or that you’re viewed as a push-over who won’t cause trouble even when taken advantage of. [11] X Research source [12] X Research source [13] X Research source If you find yourself in this situation, express your feelings to the other person.

Does your sister shower you with affection and tell you how important you are but then complain to your mother about how you’re never around when she needs you? Has a co-worker praised you for doing a great job on a project you helped them with but then grouched to other co-workers, saying you were so computer illiterate they might as well have done the work themselves? If a person tells you 1 thing but then does something else, then they are disrespecting you. Remember that actions speak louder than words. If a person gossips about you or acts differently to you than they would when you’re around others, red flags with the words “ulterior motive” and/or “jealousy” imprinted on both sides should be waving in your mind’s eye. Think about who this person is to you really and decide how to best let go of (you don’t have to be friends with everyone) or handle (you do have to work with some people) a relationship with a person you cannot trust.

They talk about their families; their jobs; their problems; their triumphs; and what they want and what they believe they need, generally from you. Often they care little about imposing on your time, or what you might be doing, so they can drone on and on about themselves. When you find this happening, change the subject to something that would still interest them but not be about them. Or cut the conversation short; hopefully they’ll eventually get the picture."

Do you find that your neighbor, who’s always running out of something, rushes out the door as soon as you bring up something that’s been worrying you about work or your kids? That’s because of the four words – it’s all about them. If a person has no interest in getting to know you or about your life, they have another interest in you that is typically not to your benefit.

Either that or you’re needed for something, such as being the designated driver for a semi-buddy’s bachelor party perhaps.

If your desires, needs and opinions aren’t factored into the relationship, you’re getting the short end of the stick.

Ask your romantic partner why they always have some reason that you’re never invited to the Friday night dinner and drinks they have every week with their circle of friends and their significant others.

True friendship, in which you each have the other’s best interests at heart, depends upon trust. “What we say here, stays here” either is or is not in the other’s vocabulary. If you cannot confidently confide in someone, be wary. If you cannot confidently confide in someone without the fear of judgment, don’t reveal it in the first place. Unfortunately, you typically have to learn this lesson the hard way – by having your confidence betrayed.

Do you cancel plans because the other person had a rough day and needs to talk? If you’re doing these types of things for someone on a regular basis – for free – consider yourself being taken advantage of, unfortunately. [22] X Research source [23] X Research source [24] X Research source Think about how often they do things for you.

[25] X Expert Source Allison Broennimann, PhD Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 11 December 2020. It's important to set boundaries when dealing with someone you think is taking advantage of you. Your boundaries should limit the impact their behaviors have on you. For example, you might tell them that you won't answer your phone after 9:00 p.m., even if it's an \"emergency.\" Be sure to follow through with consequences if they violate your boundaries. [26] X Research source Unless they are doing as much for you, even if in other ways, pull back on your support. You will likely meet resistance, so kindly explain your reasons.

[27] X Research source [28] X Research source If someone is constantly borrowing from you but not returning (or crediting) what’s borrowed, that person is, essentially, stealing from you right under your nose. Stealing from you and using you are on the same side of the coin, which is not heads up for you. In the case of borrowed items, ask the person to return what’s been borrowed before you lend anything else. If nothing’s returned, don’t loan again. In the case of borrowed ideas, decide if addressing the issue would create a bigger issue. If not, talk about it and in the future be careful about what you share and with whom."

If your final calculation reveals a high figure, at a minimum your relationship isn’t balanced (maybe right along with your checkbook). At the most, you’re being used, both financially and emotionally. [29] X Research source [30] X Research source [31] X Research source Now decide what you can afford, or if you want to continue assisting the other person at all. For the big things like living expenses, let the other person know what you’ve decided, why you made the decision and both how and when you will implement the changes. For smaller things like picking up a bar tab, simply pay only your portion. If your friend conveniently “forgot” her wallet, the next time you meet for drinks slip in a sly, “Hey, don’t forget your wallet if you’re swapping purses again.”"

Add to that the frequency at which the other is in the midst of some kind of drama and needs you, right now. Subtract how often they are there for you when you need someone to talk to or need help (particularly serious help), and the result will strongly correlate with whether or not you’re being used.

Often you do so much that you fail to take care of your own needs. At times you convince yourself that it doesn’t bother you because you love the person or you feel the person needs you. Yet this feeling is typically fleeting because healthy relationships require a give and take.

Taking care of other people may make you feel valuable and needed, and it can even meet some of your unmet needs. However, it's harmful for you in the long-run. When you find yourself wanting to please the other person, write down what you’re feeling, why you’re feeling this way and if doing what you planned to do for the other person will a) take away from what you need, b) go unappreciated and c) fail to solve the problem.
