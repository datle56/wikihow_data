Jamaican Patois has the same 5 vowels you're familiar with in English, a , e , i , o , and u . However, there is no long o or long e sound in Jamaican Patois. In the written form of the language, long vowels are typically represented as a double-vowel. [2] X Research source The long a (aa) sounds like the \"a\" in the English word \"car,\" or the word \"last\" using British pronunciation. The long i (ii) sounds like the \"ee\" in the English word \"meet.\" The long u (uu) sounds like the \"oo\" in the English word \"boot.\""

Most of these are similar to the short vowel sound you're already accustomed to hearing and saying in English. [3] X Research source The short a sounds like the \"a\" in the English word \"at.\" The short e sounds like the \"e\" in the English word \"egg.\" The short i sounds like the \"i\" in the English word \"give.\" The short o sounds like the \"o\" in the English word \"done.\" The short u sounds like the \"u\" in the English word \"put.\""

      "content": "Practice Jamaican vowel diphthongs. Jamaican Patois includes 4 diphthongs, which are created when two vowels next to each other are blended to create a new sound. Some of these are similar to English, but many are not. [4] X Research source An ai sounds like the \"uy\" in the English word \"buy.\" An ie makes a yeh sound, similar to the \"ie\" in the French word \"pied.\" An ou sounds like the \"ou\" in the English word \"round.\" A uo sounds like the \"uo\" in the English word \"duo.\""

      "title": "Learn Jamaican consonants that differ from English.",
      "content": "Learn Jamaican consonants that differ from English. Since Jamaican Patois evolved from English, it uses most of the same consonants. For the most part, they also have the same sounds in Patois as they do in English. However, there are a few that are different. [5] X Research source Ch is pronounced like the \"ch\" in the English word \"church.\" The only time the letter \"c\" is used in Jamaican Patois is with a \"ch.\" The rest of the time, it is replaced with \"k.\" The letter k only produces a hard sound, as in the English word \"kick.\" The consonant combination kw replaces the letters \"qu\" and sounds like the \"qu\" in the English word \"quick.\" The letter \"q\" is not part of the Jamaican Patois alphabet. The letter h is used as an aspirate, meaning you exhale a puff of air as you say it. It is used before words that begin with a vowel, especially when the previous word ended with a vowel. However, it is optional and not used in some Patois dialects. The combination hn indicates that the preceding vowel sound should be nasalized."

      "title": "Greet Jamaicans with \"waa gwaan?\"",
      "content": "Greet Jamaicans with \"waa gwaan?\" \"Waa gwaan\" is by far the most common way to great people in Jamaica. The phrase is more accurately translated to mean \"how's it going\" or \"how are you doing,\" but it is also used as a general \"hello.\" [6] X Research source Other ways to say \"hello\" include \"ello,\" \"hail up,\" or simply \"gud day.\" If you're traveling in Jamaica, it's a good idea to say this only if the other person says it to you first. If they say \"hello\" or \"hi\" to you, say the same back. It might seem condescending to use this greeting if you are clearly a foreigner."

      "content": "Try alternatives to ask how someone is doing. While \"wa gwaan\" is sufficient both to say \"hello\" and ask the person how they're doing, you can also combine it with another phrase. One such phrase is \"weh yuh ah seh.\" You can literally translate this phrase as \"what are you saying,\" but it's used to mean \"how are you doing.\" Other alternatives include: [8] X Research source Wat a guh dung? : literally \"what's going down?\" How yuh stay? : literally \"how's your status?\" Howdeedo? : \"how do you do?\" (more common among older people)"

If someone asked you how you were doing in English, you'd probably respond \"fine\" or perhaps \"I'm well.\" In Jamaican Patois, there are numerous ways to say you're doing well. If someone speaks to you first in Patois, you might use one of these responses. Some examples include: [9] X Research source \"Everyting criss\" \"Everyting cook an curry\" \"All fruits ripe\" \"Mi deh yah\" \"Everyting cris n curri\" \"Mi irie\""

[12] X Research source Another common expression when parting ways in Jamaica is \"walk good.\" While this is more or less English, it's used to mean \"take care.\" This expression is most commonly said to someone who is traveling a longer distance.

You also don't change the pronoun to show possession. You simply use the appropriate pronoun. There is a singular and plural pronoun for first (I/we), second (you), and third person (he/she/they).

[15] X Research source Older, urban, or highly educated speakers of Jamaican Patois may use \"did\" instead of \"ben\" to indicate past tense.

However, in Jamaican Patois, an \"s\" or \"es\" at the end of a word does not necessarily mean the word is plural. To indicate a plural, add either the word \"dem\" after the noun or the word \"nuff\" before it. The noun stays in singular form. [16] X Research source Even though \"nuff\" evolved from the English word \"enough,\" in this context it means \"many\" or \"a lot.\" For example, if you had several bunches of bananas, you might say you had \"nuff banana.\""

Jamaican Patois, like Spanish, has two infinitives that express states of being. However, unlike Spanish, these verbs are not conjugated. [17] X Research source A refers to being in a state or condition. For example, to say \"I am a boy,\" you would say \"mi a bwai.\" De refers to the place where you're located. For example, to say \"I am in Kingston,\" you would say \"mi de a Kingston.\" Note that the \"a\" here is not the verb, but a particle used to mean \"in.\""

      "title": "Double words to increase their effect or intensity.",
      "content": "Double words to increase their effect or intensity. Repeating a word twice makes the meaning more intense. If you double an adjective, it's similar to adding \"very\" or \"extremely\" before the adjective. A doubled verb implies that the action is continuous or lasted for a long time. [18] X Research source For example, \"priti\" means \"pretty.\" \"Priti-priti\" would mean the thing described was very pretty or exceptionally pretty. Verbs are doubled the same way as adjectives. For example, the word \"linga\" means \"linger.\" However, if you said somebody was \"linga-linga,\" it would imply that they'd been dawdling or hanging around for a long time or an inappropriate length of time."

If you just start speaking to Jamaicans in Patois, they may think you are condescending or making fun of their culture. Apart from this, English is the official language of Jamaican, so it's not as though you have to worry about people not being able to speak English. [19] X Research source Some Jamaicans, particularly upper- and middle-class native islanders, consider Patois to be bad English or evidence that the speaker isn't well-educated. If you start speaking to them in Patois, they may be offended because you've inferred they are lower class or not well-educated."

Express your interest in learning the language and ask if you can practice with them. If you approach someone with respect and acknowledge that Jamaican Patois is a language, they'll likely be happy to help you with your grammar and pronunciation.

However, you can still seek out a conversation partner to help you with your grammar and speaking skills. If there is a Jamaican community or restaurant near you, start there. They may know someone who is willing to work with you. If you're visiting Jamaica, travel away from the more touristy areas if you want to speak Jamaican Patois. In more rural areas, you're more likely to find people who speak Patois and don't have any qualms about practicing with you."

If you want to learn how to speak Jamaican Patois, learn the pronunciation and grammar the same as you would for any other language. However, don't confuse speaking in a \"Jamaican accent\" with speaking in Patois. Trying to fake a Jamaican accent will come across as racist and rude. [20] X Research source If you are practicing your Jamaican Patois and someone calls you out, explain that you are learning the language. If they remain skeptical or believe that you're being culturally insensitive, it might help to explain your passion for or interest in the language or talk about the finer points of grammar and pronunciation that you've learned."
