      "content": "Attach the water reservoir to the bottom of the pot. Check out pieces that make up your self-watering pot . Locate a bottom reservoir that stores water and a pot with holes (or a wick) that you use to actually plant your plant. Set the planting pot on top of the reservoir or snap it into place so it’s secure. On some self-watering planters, the reservoir is a larger outer pot and the pot you plant into sits inside of it."

      "title": "Add moist potting mix to the bottom of the pot.",
      "content": "Add moist potting mix to the bottom of the pot. You can use any standard potting mix for your plants. Moisten it with a little bit of water and fill the bottom third of the pot with your soil. Keep the potting soil loose and avoid compacting it down. That way, your plant's roots will grow in easily and water can move through the soil faster. [1] X Research source You can add nutrients and improve drainage by mixing in 1 part compost and 1 part perlite with your potting mix. If your self-watering pot has a fabric wick, hold it straight up while you fill the pot with soil. That way, the water will reach higher into the pot."

      "title": "Plant your plants into the soil.",
      "content": "Plant your plants into the soil. Break apart the soil around your plant’s roots, and plant it in the pot. Fill in around the plant roots with your potting mix until it’s about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the pot’s rim. Gently press the soil down around your plant but don’t compress it completely. Otherwise, it may be hard for the roots to establish."

      "title": "Water your plant from above to compact the soil.",
      "content": "Water your plant from above to compact the soil. The air pockets in the soil prevent it from making the best contact with your plant’s roots. For the first time you water a self-watering pot, water the soil directly. Once the soil compacts, fill in any low spots of soil in your pot with extra potting mix and water it again."

    {
      "title": "Fill the reservoir completely with water.",
      "content": "Fill the reservoir completely with water. Check the reservoir on the bottom of your self-watering planter and add more water if it isn’t completely full. Usually, the reservoir is transparent so you can see the water level or there will be a fill meter telling you how much water is left. Fill your self-watering pot from the fill tube sticking up from the side of the pot or by pouring it into a spout on the side of the reservoir. [2] X Research source Refill your self-watering pot whenever the reservoir’s water level is low. Depending on how much water your plant needs, you may need to refill every few days to once every few weeks."

      "title": "Water travels through a wick and into the soil.",
      "content": "Water travels through a wick and into the soil. If your self-watering pot has a fabric wick, the bottom of the wick sits in the water in the reservoir. The moisture absorbs up through the wick into the bottom of the pot and into the soil. As long as there’s water in the reservoir, the wick will stay wet and keep the soil consistently moist.

      "title": "Part of the pot sits in the reservoir and absorbs water.",
      "content": "Part of the pot sits in the reservoir and absorbs water. Some pots have a portion that extends below the bottom and always sits in the water. The soil pulls the water up towards the plant’s roots and helps them grow deeper into the pot. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "More convenient to water If you have plants that normally need to be watered every day, finding the time to do it can be tough if you’ve got a busy schedule. With a self-watering pot, your plant will pull up water on its own and you only need to fill it when the reservoir gets low. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "More efficient use of water When you water from above, some of it may evaporate from the sun and dry out before it even reaches your plant. A self-watering pot waters from below, so your plant will only pull up as much water as it needs. You also reduce the risk of overwatering since any excess drains right back into the reservoir.

      "title": "Reduced chances of pests and fungus",
      "content": "Reduced chances of pests and fungus When the topsoil is moist around your plant, there’s a higher risk of fungus forming and attracting pests. Since the soil draws the water up from the bottom, the topsoil will stay dry and keep your plants healthy throughout the growing season. [7] X Research source"
