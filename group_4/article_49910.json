[1] X Research source If you rent an xFi Gateway, you can use the Xfinity app to restart it easily! Just sign into the app with your Xfinity username and password, then go to Connection Trouble > Restart Gateway . To restart the router on your Xfinity account page, log in, then go to Manage Internet > Restart Modem > Start Troubleshooting . To use the router's admin website, go to https://10.0.0.1/ in a web browser, and sign in using your modem or router's username and password (by default, the username is admin and the password is password ). Go to Troubleshooting > Reset/Restore Gateway > Reset . Resetting your router or modem this way is the same as unplugging it for a minute and then plugging it back in."
