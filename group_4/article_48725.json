Because of this, normal feelings of stress, grief, or worry can amplify and cause you to wake from even the deepest slumber. If you wake up feeling anxious, ease your mind by taking a calming deep breath in and out. Focus on what you can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch to bring yourself back to the present moment.
