      "content": "Your birth card outlines your core identity and approach to life. Despite the name, a tarot birth card is actually a combo of 2 or 3 major arcana tarot cards that reveal special insights and truths about who you really are and how you journey through life. There are 12 of these 2-3 card sets in total, similar to how there 12 different star signs in astrology. [1] X Research source Like star signs, each set of tarot birth cards highlights unchanging elements of your personality and how you journey through life. [2] X Research source Tarot birth cards, however, are calculated with numerology rather than a range of dates. Love tarot? Take this quiz to discover which tarot card truly matches your personality."

      "content": "Convert your birthday into an 8-digit number. Let’s say that you were born on May 8, 1995—to find your tarot birth cards, you’d write this number as 0-5-0-8-1-9-9-5. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Add the digits of your birthdate together, along with both digits in this sum. Take 0-5-0-8-1-9-9-5, for instance; when added together individually, you get a sum of 37. From there, add 3 and 7 together to get 10—your first birth card number."

      "title": "Add together both digits of your first card number to get your second card number.",
      "content": "Add together both digits of your first card number to get your second card number. Let’s take our previous sum, 10, for instance—we add the first and the second digit together, just like we did before. One plus 0 equals 1, which makes 1 your second number. [4] X Research source What if your first number only adds up to 1 digit? No worries! Create a simple addition problem using 1 and the other number that adds up to your single-digit sum. Let’s say your first number added up to 3: 1 plus 2 equals 3, which makes your second number 12 (1 and 2 combined). The number 4 would give you 13 (1 + 3), 5 would give you 14 (1 + 4), 6 would give you 15 (1 + 5), 7 would give you 16 (1 + 6), 8 would give you 17 (1 + 7), and 9 would give you 18 (1 + 8). If your original birthday sum was 19, you actually have 3 birth card numbers. Adding 1 and 9 gives you 10, which can be further simplified to 1 (since 1 + 0 = 1). In this unique case, your birth card numbers are 19, 10, and 1."
