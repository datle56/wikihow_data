      "content": "Outline the guardian's responsibilities. Your court clerk or family law facilitator may have a checklist you can use to review the basic responsibilities of a guardian under your state's law and determine how they apply to your situation. Generally, guardianship enables other adults such as grandparents to care for children without terminating parental rights, as would occur if the child were adopted. Guardianship can provide stability for children while their parents or other custodial family are in the midst of change or upheaval. For example, if a single parent goes to jail, the child's grandparents may want legal guardianship of the child. Once the parent is released from prison, she may desire to have that guardianship transferred back to her. Legal guardians essentially act as a parent for the child, making all the basic decisions such as schooling and medical treatment for that child.

      "content": "Interview potential candidates. After you've made a preliminary decision regarding who is best suited to take care of the child, have an extended conversation with each one to make sure they understand and are capable of fulfilling all of a guardian's responsibilities. As a basic matter, a guardian must be of legal age in your state – typically 18, but sometimes older. She also must have a genuine interest in your child's welfare and be mentally and physically capable of caring for the child. [6] X Research source You also want to make sure that you're comfortable with the guardian's cultural background and beliefs. [7] X Research source For example, if the child is being raised in an Orthodox Jewish household and tradition, you may not want to transfer guardianship to someone who is an avowed atheist."

Each state typically has forms that are pre-approved by the state's court system for a guardianship petition, which you can get from the court clerk or at a legal aid or family law clinic. Since each court may require different forms, make sure you check at the specific court where you intend to ask for a transfer of guardianship. Typically, you want to use the court in the county where the child lives. [8] X Trustworthy Source Pine Tree Legal Association Legal advocacy group providing public resources related to civil rights and and services and the justice system Go to source If you go to the clerk's office and explain that you want to transfer guardianship of the child, the clerk should be able to provide you with the appropriate forms. [9] X Trustworthy Source Pine Tree Legal Association Legal advocacy group providing public resources related to civil rights and and services and the justice system Go to source Along with the main petition for guardianship, you also may have to fill out other forms such as a child custody affidavit, through which you disclose where the child has been living for the past five years and the names and addresses of anyone else such as other close family members who may have a legal interest in your petition. [10] X Trustworthy Source Pine Tree Legal Association Legal advocacy group providing public resources related to civil rights and and services and the justice system Go to source Typically the forms come with step-by-step instructions for filling them out.

If you cannot afford filing fees, you should ask the clerk for an application to have the fees waived. You must disclose details about your income and finances, but if the judge approves your application you won't have to pay any filing fees for your guardianship case.

You provide legal notice by having a sheriff's deputy deliver the papers you filed to the party personally, or by mailing the papers using certified mail. Either method ensures you have proof that the required parties knew about your petition.
