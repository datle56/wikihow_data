      "content": "A “tower moment” is a period of sudden change, chaos, or upheaval. The term comes from the Tower card in the tarot deck, and it’s a common phrase among tarot readers. When you’re going through a tower moment, something in your life has been built on a shaky foundation, and it’s likely to come crashing down. An unexpected breakup, suddenly losing your job, or a major falling-out with a friend could all be tower moments. [1] X Research source This unexpected change may feel like a disaster at first, but it’s also necessary. The destruction clears the way for positive growth and transformation, allowing you to become the person you’re meant to be. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "The Tower card represents unexpected disaster. It's in the Major Arcana (the first 22 cards of the tarot), meaning it deals with major life events and overarching themes. [3] X Research source The traditional Rider-Waite deck illustration depicts a tower being struck by lightning. The lightning sets the tower ablaze, and people jump out of the windows to escape the flames. The tower had seemed to be strong and solid, but it sits on a shaky foundation, so it comes crumbling down with one lightning strike. [4] X Research source If you’re doing a tarot reading and draw the Tower upright, the card serves as a heads-up that a major life change could be coming your way. This change might seem like a catastrophe, but the Tower card suggests that it’s actually for your good. In the wake of the chaos and destruction, you’ll realize what aspects of your life were built on a shaky foundation, leaving you room to rebuild stronger and better. [5] X Research source Drawn reversed, the Tower may be letting you know that you have time to avert disaster. If something feels off in your life, trust your intuition and act quickly. You may be able to address things before you’re forced to go through your tower moment. [6] X Research source In a Yes or No tarot reading, the Tower card means “no.” [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Embrace change. Change is inevitable, and learning to deal with change can help you get through a tower moment. [8] X Research source When things start to come crumbling down, focus your energy one what you’ll do to rebuild, rather than trying to keep things from falling apart. Letting go of something familiar can be scary, but it also clears the way for you to build up something better. [9] X Research source If you’re struggling to embrace change, try reframing. This involves shifting your perspective to focus on the positive in a situation, rather than the negative, which can help you manage difficult emotions.

Ask yourself what this chaotic period is trying to teach you, and trust that the universe is looking out for you."
