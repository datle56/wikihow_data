      "title": "Slip into the dress like you would if it were a jacket.",
      "content": "Slip into the dress like you would if it were a jacket. Raise your right arm and insert it into the right arm hole of the dress. Then, insert your left arm into the left arm hole of the jacket. It is just like shrugging on a light cardigan. The two front panels will hang at your sides."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the left side of the dress across your body.",
      "content": "Wrap the left side of the dress across your body. Pull it snug against your body so it covers most of your chest. Adjust the way it sits on you by tugging gently at the fabric if you aren’t happy with it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Open the dress and locate the hole in the seam on the right side.",
      "content": "Open the dress and locate the hole in the seam on the right side. Use your right hand to hold the right side of the dress open and look for a small hole in the seam. This is where you feed the longer string through. Make sure that your dress has a longer string on the left hand side and a shorter string on the right hand side. The hole that you feed the string through is commonly found about 15 cm (5.9 in) below the armpit. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Feed the longer string on the left side through the hole on the right.",
      "content": "Feed the longer string on the left side through the hole on the right. Insert the tip of the longer string (attached to the left panel of the dress) in the hole, and pull it through with your other hand. This will cause the dress to cinch up at the waistline. Pull it until it’s tight, but still comfortable. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the left side of the dress over to the right side of your body.",
      "content": "Pull the left side of the dress over to the right side of your body. Use your left hand to bring the left half of the dress across your body, covering most of the right half of the dress. Pull up gently on the neckline if you feel like the dress is sitting too low on your chest."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the longer string around your back and tie it to secure it.",
      "content": "Wrap the longer string around your back and tie it to secure it. Bring the string you pulled through the hole all the way around your back until it meets the other string. Tie the longer string with the shorter string attached to the right half of the dress in a basic, firm bow. Make sure that your knot is tight enough, as this is what keeps the dress from coming undone! [3] X Research source Double-knotting may be a good idea here."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the left half of the dress across your chest.",
      "content": "Wrap the left half of the dress across your chest. Wrap the dress snugly across your body toward the right side. Make sure that the dress is giving you the amount of coverage that you want by adjusting the neckline. [4] X Research source Wrap dresses can be great if you have a larger bust, because the sharp neckline can help give the illusion of a smaller bust ."

    {
      "title": "Pin the left half of the dress to the inside seam on the right side.",
      "content": "Pin the left half of the dress to the inside seam on the right side. Use a medium-sized safety pin to attach the left side of the dress to the inner seam under your right armpit. Insert the pin vertically through both pieces of fabric from the inside. The pin will sit right on the seam. [5] X Research source This stops the dress from falling down. Insert your pin higher up on the seam (closer to your armpit, and just below your bustline) to accentuate the smallest part of your waist. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wrap the right half of the dress over the left half.",
      "content": "Wrap the right half of the dress over the left half. You can now cover the left side of the dress with the right side. Pull the right half of the dress across your chest so the seam sits on the side of your midsection. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use another safety pin or a belt to secure the dress.",
      "content": "Use another safety pin or a belt to secure the dress. Once the dress is pulled tight enough (but is still comfortable!), secure the right side of the dress with a safety pin. Place the pin parallel with your belly button. Alternatively, some dresses have an attached sash that you can wrap around your waist and tie in a knot. Your wrap dress may have little loops on the sides that you can run a belt or tie through. [8] X Research source If this is not the case, find a belt that styles well with your dress."

      "title": "Choose accessories in muted tones to complement patterns.",
      "content": "Choose accessories in muted tones to complement patterns. Balance a wrap dress that comes in a beautiful bright color or print with accessories that are more neutral. Nude, gray, and shades of brown often work best. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pair your dress with heels for a more formal look.",
      "content": "Pair your dress with heels for a more formal look. To dress up your wrap dress, wear strappy or chunky open-toed heels. This can also help to create the illusion of longer legs. Black, brown, or nude heels usually pair well with colored or patterned dresses. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wear flats or sneakers with your dress for a more casual vibe.",
      "content": "Wear flats or sneakers with your dress for a more casual vibe. Alternatively, if you are dressing for a more casual occasion, opt for ballet-style flats or sneakers. Clean, white sneakers look great with a brightly-colored wrap dress."

    {
      "title": "Add a light jacket or cardigan if the weather is cool.",
      "content": "Add a light jacket or cardigan if the weather is cool. If it’s too chilly to wear your wrap dress by itself, pair it with a light jacket or cardigan to make sure you stay warm. Pick out a jacket that complements the color of your wrap dress. For example, a blue jean jacket would look nice with a yellow wrap dress."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick no more than 2 jewelry pieces to add to the look.",
      "content": "Pick no more than 2 jewelry pieces to add to the look. Choose accessories that are not going to pull too much attention away from your dress — especially if your dress is patterned. Shorter necklaces pair well with the typical wrap dress plunge neckline, and simple rings or bracelets can complement necklaces nicely. For example, you probably don’t need to wear earrings , a necklace, and a ring for jewelry. Pick 2 out of the 3, and make sure your choices are somewhat matching."
