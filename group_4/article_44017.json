      "content": "Tie a knot in the back of the loop if the apron has a single bib loop. Place the loop over your head. Find the right height for your bib. Tie a knot at the back of the loop to shorten it so your apron hangs where you want it to hang. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the neck loop and tie a knot if you have a long single neck loop. Start by cutting the neck look in half at the midpoint. Position your bib, then tie the two strings in a knot behind your neck. Make sure you can get the apron on and off over your head before you cut the strings. Cut the extra, dangling parts of the strings so they don’t look sloppy or interfere with your work."

      "content": "Tie them together using a knot or a bow. Pull the ties together before you start your knot so that your apron is tight. Don’t make it so tight that you can’t breathe or you feel like you’re cutting off circulation. [3] X Research source Tie the strings in a shoelace knot or a half-shoelace knot."

If you have a half apron, hold it at your waist where you plan to wear it. Look in a mirror and see if your apron hangs below your knees. If your apron hangs below your knees, you can hem it with some scissors and a sewing machine or hemming tape. [4] X Research source If you don’t want to sew or you don’t have time, just grab the apron at the hips and fold a section up. Hold this in place while you tie and you have shortened your apron."
