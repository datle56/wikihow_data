      "content": "Gather your ripe acorns. Look for and only use brown acorns, as these are ripe; green acorns are unripe and are unsuitable for eating (but mature green acorns can ripen in a clean, dry place). Avoid any acorns that appear mildewed, dusty, blackened, etc. Quality nutmeat will be yellowish in colour. [2] X Research source Unprocessed, natural nuts of various kinds of oaks: White oaks produce bland tasting acorns. The best for harvesting are the swamp white oak, Oregon white oak, and the burr oak. [3] X Research source Generally, these won't need leaching. Red oaks produce bitter tasting acorns. The Emory oak's acorns are mild enough to not require processing. [4] X Research source Black oaks produce very bitter tasting acorns and need a lot of leaching to overcome this."

      "title": "Leach the acorns of tannins.",
      "content": "Leach the acorns of tannins. Untreated raw acorns contain high concentrations of tannic acid, causing their taste to be bitter and them to be toxic to humans if eaten in large quantities. [5] X Research source It is possible to remove the tannic acid by simply leaching it out of acorns in a pot of boiling water, [6] X Research source pouring out the hot water and having repeated changes of water. Continue doing this until the water does not turn brown after you have strained and replaced it. Another method for leaching: place one tablespoon of baking soda into one litre of water. Leave the acorns to soak in the baking soda infused water for 12-15 hours. A Native American or rustic method is bagging the nuts and allowing them to soak in a clean, flowing stream for a few days until no brown-colored water is seen when checking their progress.

      "content": "Remove the acorns once leached and leave to simply dry or to make roasted nuts after drying, as desired. Raw acorns can be stored for months without spoiling; this dramatically increases their value, being a \"process as needed food resource\", however, they must be dry or otherwise they can get moldy and mildewed. But only when leached are they ready to use."

Once roasted (light, medium or dark), grind. The resulting mixture can be blended into commercial coffee -- or used on its own to make acorn coffee."

Use the flour to make breads, muffins, etc. Korean cooking is largely the only cuisine that features acorn starch. Some Korean noodles and jellies are made of acorn starch. As acorn starch is a favorite part of this cuisine, many Asian grocery markets sell it. [8] X Research source"

They can replace many legumes and other nuts, such as chickpeas, peanuts, macadamias, etc. Follow your usual recipe and substitute acorn pieces instead. Like most nuts, they are a nutritious, dense food to use freely. Make acorn dukkah, a dry spicy mixed dip, which has many uses, but is mainly used to dip bread that has been basted with olive oil or butter. Sprinkle chopped, roasted acorns over a fresh salad."
