      "content": "Use a beveled-edge chisel if you need to remove wood from a flat surface. A beveled-edge, or bench, chisel is one of the most common chisels. It is typically short and stocky, which allows it to take a lot of impact from a mallet. If you're taking chunks out of a surface of wood, this is likely the tool you'll need. A beveled-edge chisel is best for removing areas of wood that don’t need to be finessed, such as notching out a stud so a pipe can be run through a wall."

      "title": "Choose a firmer chisel if you need to work down into a pocket of wood.",
      "content": "Choose a firmer chisel if you need to work down into a pocket of wood. Beveled-edge and firmer chisels are both used with a mallet to remove large areas of wood. However, a firmer chisel, which has 90-degree flat sides, is best if you need to get down into a tight crevice. The cutting edge of a firmer chisel is straight and square, its stock is thick and strong, and its angle is typically sharpened to 20 degrees. A firmer chisel is used for deeper cuts in both heavy and light woodwork, such as shaping a mortise."

      "title": "Secure the wood you are chiseling.",
      "content": "Secure the wood you are chiseling. In most cases you will need to use a vise or clamp to hold the wood in place. Attach it to a heavy work bench or other secure surface. However, if you are working on a large, heavy piece of wood, you may be able to simply set it on the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Position the flat side of the chisel flush against the wood.",
      "content": "Position the flat side of the chisel flush against the wood. If you are removing wood to make a level surface, use the back of the chisel as a guide. Focus on keeping the chisel against the wood as you move it. This will help ensure that you are making a smooth cut that is level with the rest of the surface. [1] X Research source If you can't put the flat side of the chisel against a smooth surface at first, as you move the chisel you will make a flat surface to use."

      "title": "Use a mallet or hammer to drive the chisel through thick areas.",
      "content": "Use a mallet or hammer to drive the chisel through thick areas. Hold the chisel firmly with your less-dominant hand and the mallet or hammer with your dominant hand. Make firm, strong strikes onto the end of the chisel. [2] X Research source If the chisel begins to have trouble going thorough the wood, it may need to be sharpened ."

      "title": "Push the chisel through thin sections of wood by hand.",
      "content": "Push the chisel through thin sections of wood by hand. Hold the chisel with both hands, using your dominant hand to push from the end of the handle. Your less dominant hand can be positioned close to the cutting end, guiding it as you push. [3] X Research source This is a good technique to use to clean up larger cuts you've already made. Move the chisel in a sliding or shearing motion when cutting across the end grain of wood. This motion is almost like wiggling, so that each grain gets cut from multiple angles as you go."

      "title": "Pick a paring chisel for fine, detailed woodwork.",
      "content": "Pick a paring chisel for fine, detailed woodwork. The term “paring” refers to smoothing or removing layers off the surface. This type of chisel is great for projects that require delicate shaving or sculpting. [4] X Research source A paring chisel typically has a thin blade beveled at an angle of 15 degrees. Paring uses the knife-like edge of a paring chisel to slice off small amounts of wood with each stroke."

      "title": "Secure the woodwork firmly on your workbench or in your vise.",
      "content": "Secure the woodwork firmly on your workbench or in your vise. It’s important that you don’t need to use your hands to steady the wood. The more secure the wood you are cutting is, the more control you will have when pushing with force into the wood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place one hand on the chisel's blade and one on the handle.",
      "content": "Place one hand on the chisel's blade and one on the handle. The front hand, usually your less dominant hand, controls the forward movement and steering of the chisel. The rear hand gives the force to move the chisel through the wood. Because you are not taking off a lot of wood, your pushing hand will not have to exert a lot of force."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep the bottom of the chisel in contact with the wood as you move.",
      "content": "Keep the bottom of the chisel in contact with the wood as you move. When paring, push the paring chisel into the wood while the wood lies flat on a surface. This will keep your cuts smooth and level."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the cuts slowly until you have removed enough wood.",
      "content": "Repeat the cuts slowly until you have removed enough wood. Paring is a controlled and slow process when done right. Take your time, remove thin slices of wood with each stroke, and aim for a very smooth surface when you are done. [5] X Research source If you find that your blade gets dull, sharpen it as needed."

      "title": "Use a gouge for fine woodwork, such as carving or sculpting.",
      "content": "Use a gouge for fine woodwork, such as carving or sculpting. Gouges can be used to carve into wood or to remove wood around a design to bring the design into relief. Gouges have curved points and long handles, but they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Pick a couple that will work for your project. [6] X Research source There are 8 standards of degrees to the curves of gouge chisels. These vary from a very slight curve to a chisel tip the is a half circle. Each curve also comes in a variety of widths, so you will have a wide variety of chisels to choose from."

      "title": "Firmly attach your wood to a solid surface.",
      "content": "Firmly attach your wood to a solid surface. Use clamps or a vise to hold it to a strong work surface, such as a workbench. Using gouges can create a lot of force, so make sure that the wood is really secure when pushed from a variety of directions."

    {
      "title": "Hold the gouge with both hands and push it though the wood.",
      "content": "Hold the gouge with both hands and push it though the wood. Place the forefinger of your less dominant hand near the sharp end of the chisel and the rest of the hand at the place where the metal blade meets the handle. This will give you control over where the tip moves as you push it. Your other hand should be back on the handle, so that you can use its strength to push through the wood. As you push with your dominant hand, direct the tool with your less dominant hand. It will take practice to master how to move the chisel to get the effect you want."

    {
      "title": "Push the gouge with the grain of the wood or across the end grain.",
      "content": "Push the gouge with the grain of the wood or across the end grain. Moving the gouge across the grain risks damaging the wood and chipping out areas that you don’t want removed. As you practice and become more skilled with the gouge, the way you should move the tool across the wood will become more natural. To identify the grain, look closely at the wood. Look for lines going across the wood. These are the grain lines and you should move the gouge with them or across the very end of them. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Raise, lower, or turn the handle to achieve the desired effect.",
      "content": "Raise, lower, or turn the handle to achieve the desired effect. Gouges are versatile chisels that can make a wide variety of cuts. Play with your gouges to make patterns and remove wood in any shape you like. For deep cuts, you can even hold the gouge perpendicular to the wood and hit the handle sharply with a mallet. Repeat your action, change the size of your gouge as needed for the design, and sharpen blades as required until your project is complete."

      "content": "Pick the right masonry chisel to score, trim, or shape brick or stone. Masonry chisels come in many shapes, including bolster, pitcher, and sculpting chisels. Pick one that is the right width and shape for your job, and is made to chisel the material you are shaping. [8] X Research source A bolster chisel is beveled on one-side of the blade and is used to break off large pieces or sections. A pitcher chisel is beveled on both sides of the blade and is used to cut straight lines. Sculpting or engraving stone requires a wide variety of specialized tools and chisels."

      "content": "Mark the stone clearly with paver's chalk or a dark pencil. Making a line where you want to break the stone or brick will help you keep on track as you chisel. You will make scoring marks along this line before trying to break the brick or stone in half. However, chiseling into stone and brick is not always exact, so be prepared to work with pieces that don’t break right on the line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the masonry chisel perpendicular to the surface you are chiseling.",
      "content": "Set the masonry chisel perpendicular to the surface you are chiseling. You want to hold the chisel so that it is at 90 degrees and will go straight into the brick or stone. If you hold it at an angle, the cut will go off at an angle as well. It can take some practice to be able to hold the chisel perfectly upright while hammering it. Try making some practice cuts before chiseling into pieces that need to be cut correctly."

      "title": "Make a score line along the brick or stone.",
      "content": "Make a score line along the brick or stone. Gently tap the end of the chisel with a hammer, mallet, or sledgehammer along the line you want to cut away. After you score one part of the line, move the chisel down the line and continue scoring the entire length. The score line doesn't need to be very deep. You are just aiming to make the line weaker than the surrounding material, so that the stone naturally wants to break there. The goal here is to make a line that the stone or brick will break cleanly along. If you don’t make a score line, a piece of brick or stone wider than your chisel can break jaggedly."

    {
      "title": "Make a hard strike in the middle of your score line.",
      "content": "Make a hard strike in the middle of your score line. Strike the handle of the chisel sharply with your hammer, mallet, or sledgehammer. Use as much force as you can, so that the chisel is driven down into the stone or brick. Repeat your strikes all along the score line on either side of the first strike until the break occurs."
