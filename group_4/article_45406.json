      "title": "Run the garbage disposal if the clogged side has one.",
      "content": "Run the garbage disposal if the clogged side has one. If there’s no standing water in your sink, turn on a slow stream of hot water from your faucet. Turn on your garbage disposal and let it run for 10 seconds. Turn the disposal off and watch the water level to see if it drains. If it does, then you may have broken apart the clog. Keep running your faucet to make sure it continues to drain at a steady pace. [1] X Research source If the sink doesn’t drain, turn off the water since the clog may be deeper in the pipes. If you hear something solid knocking around when you run the garbage disposal, unplug it and shine a flashlight into the drain. Use a pair of tongs to remove anything stuck in the garbage disposal."

      "title": "Try using baking soda and vinegar to break apart small clogs.",
      "content": "Try using baking soda and vinegar to break apart small clogs. Slowly pour 1 cup (230 g) of baking soda directly into the clogged side of the sink and wait for about 3–4 minutes. After that, add 1 cup (240 ml) of distilled white vinegar to the same drain. Plug the drain and let the baking soda and vinegar fizz for about 10 minutes so it can break apart the blockage. Run hot water in the sink to flush out the baking soda and vinegar to see if it broke the clog. [2] X Research source Push the baking soda deeper into the drain with a wooden spoon or utensil if it didn’t all go into the drain. Baking soda and vinegar usually only works to break apart smaller food particles."

      "title": "Pour boiling water into the drain to force or melt the clog.",
      "content": "Pour boiling water into the drain to force or melt the clog. Carefully dump a full pot of boiling water into the clogged side of the sink so it goes directly into the drain. If the water starts draining, then the heat may have melted solidified residue or pushed the clog out from the pipes. [3] X Research source If the water doesn’t drain, wait for it to cool down so you don’t burn yourself trying other methods."
    },
    {
      "title": "Block the drain on the unclogged side of the sink.",
      "content": "Block the drain on the unclogged side of the sink. Use the drain plug that came with your sink if you have one, or stuff a towel into the drain. Make sure you create a tight seal on the unclogged side, or else your plunger won’t work properly. [4] X Research source Since a plunger can cause pressure to build up, ask a helper to hold the drain plug in place so it doesn’t come loose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the clogged side of the sink with 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of water.",
      "content": "Fill the clogged side of the sink with 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of water. Use the warmest water than you can handle when you fill the clogged side of your sink. Make sure there’s at least 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm), or else the plunger won’t seal around the drain properly. [5] X Research source If you already have standing water in your sink, you can skip this step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a plunger around the clogged drain.",
      "content": "Place a plunger around the clogged drain. Use a cup plunger if you have one since they’re designed for sink drains. If you only have a toilet plunger, tuck the flange (the cylindrical part that sticks out of the cup) up into the cup so it's out of the way and you can get a tight seal around the drain. Whichever kind you use, press the rim of the cup around the drain and push down lightly so it forms a tight seal. Keep the plunger handle vertical or else you may cause the plunger to lose suction. [6] X Research source You may be able to find a plunger with a short handle so it’s easier to maneuver in your sink."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pump the plunger up and down for 30 seconds.",
      "content": "Pump the plunger up and down for 30 seconds. Hold the plunger’s handle so it stays vertical and push it straight down to create suction inside the drain. Pull the handle up quickly, but not so forcefully that you take the plunger out of the sink. Continue pushing the handle down repeatedly for at least 30 seconds to loosen the clog in your pipes. [7] X Research source If you’re worried about the plunger splashing you with water, wear gloves and an apron so you don’t get dirty."
    },
    {
      "title": "Remove the plunger to see if the sink drains.",
      "content": "Remove the plunger to see if the sink drains. Carefully lift the plunger out of the water so you don’t splash water out from the sink. Check if the water spirals or begins draining. If the water drains quickly, then you forced the clog out from the pipes. If it drains slowly or doesn’t empty, try plunging the drain again for another 30 seconds before checking again. [8] X Research source If the plunger didn’t work after the second time, you may need to check the sink’s trap or use a drain snake."

    {
      "title": "Place a bucket underneath the sink’s drainage pipe.",
      "content": "Place a bucket underneath the sink’s drainage pipe. Look for the U-shaped section of pipe under your sink, which is known as the trap. Use a bucket that’s large enough to hold all of the standing water in your sink and set it directly under the trap. Put cleaning rags around the outside of the bucket in case any water splashes out. [9] X Research source You may also use a garbage bag or garbage can if you have room underneath your sink."

    {
      "title": "Unscrew the nuts on each side of the trap.",
      "content": "Unscrew the nuts on each side of the trap. Locate the nuts or pipe connectors on both sides of the trap and try turning them counterclockwise by hand to see if they come loose. If they’re too tight, grip them with a pair of pliers and continue loosening them until the trap comes off of the pipes. Let any water or debris drain into the bucket. [10] X Research source If you’re worried about getting splashed with dirty water, wear rubber gloves."

      "title": "Try pushing a wire hanger through the trap to remove the blockage.",
      "content": "Try pushing a wire hanger through the trap to remove the blockage. Unbend a wire hanger so you have a long straight piece. Push one end of the wire into the trap and force it in as far as you can push it. If you meet resistance, push and pull the wire to break apart the clog. Let the clog fall into the bucket so you can easily dispose of it. [11] X Research source If you don’t feel any resistance, then the clog may be deeper in the pipe and you’ll need to use a snake to get rid of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the trap clean in a different sink.",
      "content": "Rinse the trap clean in a different sink. Hold the trap underneath a faucet with hot water and let it go through the pipe. Make sure to rinse out each side of the pipe so you can clean out any debris that may be stuck on the inside. If water flows through the trap easily, then you’ve removed the clog. [12] X Research source If water still gets stuck in the trap, then try using the wire hanger to break apart the clog or scrape the sides of the pipe. You can also use your garden hose with a jet attachment to forcefully clean out the trap."

    {
      "title": "Reattach the trap and try running water in the sink.",
      "content": "Reattach the trap and try running water in the sink. Position the pipe back underneath your sink so it lines up with the pipes leading to and away from your sink. Screw the nuts tightly back into place by hand or with your pliers so they don’t leak. Turn on your faucet with hot water and run it on each side of the sink for about 5 minutes. If it doesn’t back up, then you have cleaned out the clog. [13] X Research source If the sink still clogs on either side, then the blockage may be further down the pipe."

      "content": "Set a bucket under the sink’s trap. Make sure you use a bucket large enough to hold all of the standing water in your sink. Locate the U-shaped trap connected to the sink’s drains and place the bucket underneath it so the pipes can drain directly into it. [14] X Research source Put a bucket underneath your sink even if you don’t have standing water since there may still be some liquid that comes out from the pipes. You can also use a garbage bag or garbage can."

      "title": "Loosen the nuts on the trap with a wrench to remove it.",
      "content": "Loosen the nuts on the trap with a wrench to remove it. Locate the nuts or fasteners on each side of the trap and try turning them counterclockwise by hand. If they’re too tight to remove on your own, use a pair of pliers to loosen them. Unscrew the nuts or fasteners completely so the trap comes loose, and let the water drain into the bucket. [15] X Research source Hold the trap upside-down over the bucket since it may also have water stuck inside of it."

      "title": "Feed the end of a drain snake into the waste pipe until you hit the blockage.",
      "content": "Feed the end of a drain snake into the waste pipe until you hit the blockage. Take the round end of the drain snake and position it in the pipe that’s leading away from your sink. Push about 1 foot (30 cm) of the snake into the pipe by hand before turning the handle clockwise to extend it further. Keep unwinding the drain snake until you meet resistance or until you run out of wire. [16] X Research source A drain snake has a long wire stored inside of a drum so you can feed it in and out of your pipes without cutting them. You can buy drain snakes from hardware stores or online. If you’ve used the full length of the drain snake and you haven’t felt the blockage, then contact a plumber since you have problems further down in your pipes."

      "title": "Push and pull the snake back and forth if you feel a clog.",
      "content": "Push and pull the snake back and forth if you feel a clog. Wiggle the snake around the pipe for about 5 seconds before rotating the handle counterclockwise by a half turn. Forcefully turn the handle clockwise again to force the snake into the blockage. Continue pushing and pulling the end of the snake into the clog until you don’t feel any more resistance. [17] X Research source If you feel resistance even when you’re pulling the snake back toward you, the clog may have caught on the end."

      "title": "Turn the handle counterclockwise to retrieve the snake.",
      "content": "Turn the handle counterclockwise to retrieve the snake. Use a slow and steady pace in case the blockage caught on the end of the snake so it doesn’t fall off inside the pipe. Keep pulling the snake out until you reach the end, and clean off any debris stuck on it with a paper towel.M Make sure the snake is completely inside the drum so you don’t damage or break it. [18] X Research source Wipe the snake with a paper towel or cleaning rag as you retract it to help keep it clean."

      "title": "Reassemble the pipes and test the drain.",
      "content": "Reassemble the pipes and test the drain. Position the trap back onto the pipes and tighten the nuts or fasteners with your pliers. Turn your faucet to the hottest setting and run it in 1 side of the sink for 5 minutes to make sure it drains properly. Then move the faucet so the water runs on the other side of the sink to ensure it doesn’t clog. [19] X Research source If the water still backs up in the sink, contact a plumber to check your drain lines since they may have damage farther than what you’re able to reach."
