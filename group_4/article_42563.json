Set your phone with the front facing camera towards you on this surface and make sure it is standing completely upright. [1] X Research source If your phone is tilted forwards or backwards at all, it could throw off the depth of your selfie and make your face look distorted. You can set your phone on its side for a landscape selfie or keep it upright for a portrait selfie. Alternatively, you can turn the phone around and ask someone to take your photo because the camera at the back of the phone is of better quality than the selfie camera.
