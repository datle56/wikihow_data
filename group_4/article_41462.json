      "title": "Get a non-slip mattress pad to put between your mattress and bed frame.",
      "content": "Get a non-slip mattress pad to put between your mattress and bed frame. Many bed stores sell grippy pads made of PVC rubber that fit between a mattress and the bed frame to keep the mattress from sliding around. Purchase a model that suits your mattress and frame combo, then stick it between them and see if that solves the problem. If you can’t find a pad big enough for your bed, you can combine 2 smaller pads. Non-slip mattress pads are very thin, so you shouldn’t notice a difference in feeling when you sleep on the new bed setup."

      "content": "Buy rubber matting that goes under an area rug as a cheaper alternative. Purchase a pad designed for area rugs that is big enough to fit under your mattress. Cut it to fit if it is wider or longer than the mattress. Some gripping pads are sold as multi-use for both mattresses and area rugs, so it may not necessarily be a cheaper alternative, but it’s worth shopping around if you want to save a few bucks!"

      "title": "Use stick-on hook-and-loop fastener strips for a do-it-yourself remedy.",
      "content": "Use stick-on hook-and-loop fastener strips for a do-it-yourself remedy. Buy long strips of hook-and-loop fastener that have adhesive on 1 side and the hook-and-loop fastener on the other. Cut the strips to fit your bed, stick strips along the bottom of your mattress, and stick the opposing strips on the box spring or bed frame so that they line up and hold the mattress in place. Make sure to use “hook” and “loop” pieces of hook-and-loop fastener opposite of each other, or the hook-and-loop fastener won’t stick! You could also try using double-sided carpet tape in the same way if you can’t find hook-and-loop fastener strips."

      "title": "Wedge something between the sides of the frame and the mattress for a quick fix.",
      "content": "Wedge something between the sides of the frame and the mattress for a quick fix. Sometimes a mattress will slide around when it is not completely snug in the frame. Try wedging a towel or other soft material between the bed frame and the mattress to stop the mattress from sliding. This is a good way to temporarily stop sliding, however you will probably have to keep adjusting whatever you wedge in between the mattress and frame, so it is not a great permanent solution."

    {
      "title": "Change your bed frame for a tighter-fitting frame if you can’t stop the sliding.",
      "content": "Change your bed frame for a tighter-fitting frame if you can’t stop the sliding. Look at your bed frame and see if it is too big for your bed, or if the sides aren’t high enough to hold the mattress in place. Get a new bed frame that holds the mattress tighter if you can’t stop the mattress from sliding around with another method. A bed frame that has both a headboard and a footboard can help reduce sliding as well."

      "title": "Switch out your mattress for a 1-sided mattress as a last resort.",
      "content": "Switch out your mattress for a 1-sided mattress as a last resort. Many mattresses have 2 sides that are exactly the same, which means the bottom side is more prone to sliding. Buy a mattress that has 1 side for sleeping and 1 flat side that goes face down to decrease mattress slippage. 1-sided mattresses can also be more comfortable than 2-sided mattresses because they are built bottom-up for maximum comfort on the sleeping surface."

      "title": "Place a tight-fitting sheet over the mattress topper.",
      "content": "Place a tight-fitting sheet over the mattress topper. Your mattress topper is more likely to slide around if your sheets are loose. Get the tightest-fitting bottom sheet you can find that will fit your bed and put it on to secure the topper in place."

      "title": "Use sheet suspenders or straps to hold the sheet and topper in place.",
      "content": "Use sheet suspenders or straps to hold the sheet and topper in place. Clip the sheet straps to the bottom edges of the corners of the fitted sheet. Feed the straps under the mattress and clip them to the opposite corners. The sheet suspenders should look like an “X” underneath the mattress."

      "title": "Pin the topper in place with safety pins for a cheaper option.",
      "content": "Pin the topper in place with safety pins for a cheaper option. Pin the mattress topper to the mattress with at least 5 safety pins per side. This will distribute the pressure and hold the topper in place more securely. You can also use safety pins to hold the fitted bottom sheet in place which will keep the mattress topper more stable."

    {
      "title": "Use duct tape or spray adhesive to hold the topper in place if it still slips.",
      "content": "Use duct tape or spray adhesive to hold the topper in place if it still slips. Tape the corners and edges down tightly to the mattress with duct tape, or spray adhesive over the entire backside of the topper and stick it down to the mattress. Make sure to use a tight-fitting sheet as well. Note that if you use spray adhesive, there will be some residue left on the mattress if you ever want to rip off the topper. Duct tape can leave some residue on the mattress too if it is left on for a long time."
