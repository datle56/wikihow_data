      "title": "Practice mindfulness",
      "content": "Practice mindfulness to observe your thoughts and feelings. Set aside 10 minutes every day to sit and observe this present moment. Note the thoughts and judgments that arise and let them pass on by. Breathe and allow yourself to feel your thoughts and your body. [1] X Research source Be kind to yourself. Don’t judge yourself too harshly if your mind wanders; simply acknowledge that it has, and gently bring it back on track."

    {
      "title": "Examine the links between a situation, a thought, and a feeling.",
      "content": "Examine the links between a situation, a thought, and a feeling. You may believe that a bad situation leads to negative feelings. The CBT approach challenges this by stating that it is the thoughts we have that lead us to have those emotions. A situation gives rise to a thought which in turn leads to a feeling or action. [2] X Research source Here is an example of how a positive outcome is linked to thought: You went to the gym and exercised. You thought that you accomplished your fitness goal for the day. You felt satisfied and happy. Now here is an example of a negative outcome: You went to the gym and exercised. You thought that you didn't push yourself hard enough to meet your goal. You felt disappointed or not good enough."
    },
    {
      "title": "Recognize automatic thoughts.",
      "content": "Recognize automatic thoughts. You have brief thoughts throughout the day that are triggered by a situation. You may not notice or pay attention to these thoughts, but with CBT it is important to have awareness of these quick thoughts. Pay specific attention to negative (or maladaptive) thoughts that you have when reflecting on a situation. Maladaptive automatic thoughts are distorted reflections on an event, but you may accept them as true. These maladaptive thoughts may then trigger feelings of sadness, anxiety, frustration, or hopelessness. Maladaptive: \"I can't believe I got such a bad grade on this exam! I'm a failure, and I'll never amount to anything.\" This thought can lead to a spiral of negativity and hopelessness. Positive: \"This is just one exam. Everyone does badly on an exam sometimes. I can continue to work hard at this to bring my grades up.\" You are more likely to be hopeful with this thought."
    },
    {
      "title": "Link your automatic thoughts to your core beliefs.",
      "content": "Link your automatic thoughts to your core beliefs. Underneath your automatic thoughts, you may have core beliefs that are distorted reflections of reality. These core beliefs are what drive these maladaptive thoughts. Thinking about how your core beliefs may be skewed towards negative thinking will help you to understand why maladaptive thoughts occur. [3] X Research source Your core beliefs are related to your self-esteem or self-confidence. You may believe that you are unlovable or not good enough which leads to a pattern of obsessive behavior or continued feelings of anxiety or depression."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider the origin of your core beliefs.",
      "content": "Consider the origin of your core beliefs. If your core beliefs are founded on a falsehood, then those beliefs themselves might not be true. Even if they are true, pondering where your fundamental beliefs come from can give you a stronger understanding of yourself. For example, many people get their core beliefs from the people they’re raised by. If your parents mistreated you, you might have a core belief that you’re not worthy of love. Separating your parents’ behavior towards you from your actual worth will show you that your core belief—that you’re unworthy of love—isn’t true at all."

      "title": "Identify cognitive distortions.",
      "content": "Identify cognitive distortions. There are many different ways that you may distort your thoughts which lead to negative emotions or behaviors. Notice the ways that you think or talk about a problem, and how you may be doing one or more of the following: Catastrophizing by predicting only negative outcomes in the future Having all-or-nothing thinking Discounting the positive Labeling something or someone without knowing more about it or them Rationalizing based on emotions rather than facts Minimizing or magnifying the situation Having \"tunnel vision\" by seeing only the negatives Mind reading in which you believe you know what someone is thinking Overgeneralizing by making an overall negative conclusion beyond the current situation Personalizing the situation as something specifically wrong with you"

      "content": "Create a thought record. By putting your thoughts in writing, you will be able to see your thoughts and emotions a little differently. The thought record should include a section about the situation, the automatic thought, and the emotion, and a separate section that reflects on the pros-and-cons, and another possible way to think about the situation. Your thought record should help to answer all these questions: [4] X Research source What actually happened? Include where, what, when, and how. What thought went through your mind? Create rating scale of how much you believed it was true such as from 1-10 or 1-100. What emotion did you feel? Rate the intensity using a scale. What has happened to make you believe this thought is true? What has happened to disprove this thought? What is another way to look at this situation? How would you rate your mood after reviewing all these questions? Use a scale."

      "content": "Develop balanced thinking. Just like when making an argument, your thinking may have pros and cons, or different ways of seeing the same thing. Think about the alternative ways of seeing a situation, or how to imagine a different approach or reaction to the situation. Open your mind up to other possible outcomes or ways of thinking. Identify alternative ways of thinking about a situation that are possible or believable to you. Consider asking someone you trust to identify different ways of thinking about the situation. Does that other person understand the problem or situation in a different or more positive way? Listen closely to those alternatives."

      "content": "Identify pleasant activities. Think about something that you enjoy or enjoyed in the past, or something that you may want to accomplish but have not done yet. Consider activities that are possible or achievable possibly in the short term. Reimagine activities as small, doable goals. [5] X Research source Consider scheduling one pleasant activity a day. It can be a different one each day, the same, or combination of a few. Make these activities small, but something that you can look forward to doing. [6] X Research source If you used to play music in a band and want to be a musician again, think about activities to start with, such as playing music once a week at home. Set aside time when you can play with few distractions."

      "title": "Take action and engage in those activities.",
      "content": "Take action and engage in those activities. Create an action plan. Consider writing down your goal, and then writing out your small steps. Think about the steps you need to take in the next week, month, or year, and create a timeline of how each step follows the next one. Look for alternative options or behaviors to accomplish a goal if there are barriers. For example, maybe a successful businesswoman becomes disabled after an accident, and can no longer work her previous job. She may decide that she wants to find a better line of work. She could teach business students at a local university, run business seminars, volunteer at a website like wikiHow, or be productive by offering advice and guidance to her family and friends."

Consider making a \"schedule for your emotions\" by writing down what you are feeling every 3-4 hours. Look at any patterns that you see over time. [7] X Research source Do you always feel bad at the beginning of the day and then by 12 noon you're feeling good? Think about any triggers between those times. Or vice versa, do you feel good in the morning before work, but by 2pm each day you're feeling miserable? Identify if there were specific things or events that occurred."

When you have a lot of different emotions and thoughts in your head at once, you may need to focus on only one problem at a time. [9] X Research source Avoid attempting to solve multiple problems at once. Start small and focus on the one problem that is your primary concern.

Even if the problem is not fully \"solved,\" be thankful that you are headed in the right direction. If the plan still needs some tweaking and negative thoughts still arise, keep going and stay motivated.

Consider this abdominal breathing technique: [13] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen. Exhale with your mouth, and take a slow deep breath in with your nose. Inhale as deeply as you can and hold for 7 seconds. Slowly exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds.
