      "title": "eBay",
      "content": "eBay eBay is a popular online marketplace for selling collectibles. Look at eBay listings of other Funko Pops to see how much they’re selling for before you price your items. Use an auction-style listing for uncommon or in-demand Funko Pops so buyers can compete for them by placing bids. Or, list your Pops at a fixed price (what eBay calls the “Buy It Now” price). [1] X Research source Use the Funko app to directly list your collection items on eBay. Go to the page of a product you have. Press “List it on eBay” and fill out the listing details. [2] X Research source eBay will charge a fee that’s a percentage of the listing’s final value. Once you’ve listed more than 50 items, you must pay a nominal fee for listing. [3] X Research source To see what other Funko Pops have sold for on eBay, go to the website’s Advanced Search tool. In the keyword box, enter the name of the Funko Pop you’re trying to sell. Check the boxes for “Completed items” and “Sold items” and hit “Search.”"

      "content": "Facebook Marketplace Use Facebook Marketplace to sell Funko Pops to friends and potential buyers on the social media platform. To list your items, simply open Marketplace in your Facebook feed and click the “+” symbol to create a new listing. If you want to avoid paying shipping, try to sell to local buyers who can pick up their purchase in person. [4] X Research source If you meet someone from Facebook Marketplace in person, be sure to meet in a public place during the daytime. Tell others where you’re going and who you’re meeting. [5] X Research source Look for Funko Pop enthusiast groups on Facebook to find interested buyers. Make sure to read group rules about promoting items for sale—some may not allow you to mention or link to your listings in the group."

Unlike some other platforms, listing on Mercari is free—though they do charge fees once a sale is made. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that Mercari may have fewer users than eBay, meaning you reach a smaller potential customer base. [7] X Research source"

To become a live seller, create a Whatnot account and fill out the application. Wait 1-2 weeks for approval. [8] X Research source If you’d rather not sell via livestream, create a regular listing for your Funko Pops on the Whatnot marketplace. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Reddit On the social media platform Reddit, you can advertise your Funko Pops for sale or trade on the r/Funkoswap subreddit. Read the subreddit’s rules and advice before creating a listing. Vet potential buyers thoroughly before agreeing to a sale—unlike other marketplaces, there’s little you can do if you get scammed while selling on Reddit. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "7 Bucks A Pop If you’re trying to sell a large Funko Pop collection, consider contacting the dedicated Funko Pop buyer group 7 Bucks A Pop. They’re only interested in collections of 200+ Funko Pops, and require that you have Pops worth $200 or more (two high-value Pops for every 100 Pops) among other conditions. If you think they’d be interested in your collection, fill out their online form . [11] X Research source 7 Bucks A Pop won’t offer you the full market value for your collection since they have to sell it for a profit. However, they’re a useful service when you’re trying to sell a very large number of Pops, most of which aren’t worth more than $10 to $15 on their own."

      "content": "Toy Shows Unload your Funko Pop collection by becoming a vendor at a Toy Show. These conventions, usually held once or twice a year, draw toy and collectible enthusiasts to view and purchase toys. [12] X Research source Check local toy show websites to see how much it costs to rent a booth and become a vendor. Selling at a toy show lets you get paid instantly without worrying about shipping, sell to a captive audience of toy fans, and meet other Funko Pop collectors. Decide if the cost of selling at a toy show is worth the potential profit you might make if you sold at least half of your Funko Pop inventory. Factor in expenses like gas or plane tickets and taking time off work. If you’re only selling a few Pops, it’s probably cheaper to sell online."

    {
      "title": "Conventions",
      "content": "Conventions Conventions are similar to toy shows, except that their scope extends beyond toys. Because Funko Pop figurines are pop-culture-themed, a comic or anime convention attracts interested buyers. Look at major convention’s websites (like San Diego Comic Con and New York Comic Con) to see the cost of becoming a vendor. [13] X Research source Just before major Comic Cons (in July and October), many people may decide to sell Funko Pops to make space in their collections for convention-exclusive Pops. Try to avoid selling during these times, as the increased supply will lower prices. Conventions won’t allow you to sell Funko Pops that are not new and in-box. Some conventions may only allow licensed Funko resellers to sell at their event. Read through their vendor requirements to see if your collection can be sold at the con."

Hold a garage sale, displaying your Pops with price tags on a table in your yard. Advertise the garage sale by placing signs or posters around your community and posting on local Facebook groups. At a garage sale, many people expect to be able to haggle for a lower price than listed. Keep this in mind when setting your prices. To attract more customers, sell more than just Funko Pops. Clean out your house and see what else you’d like to get rid of for a reasonable price."

      "title": "Properly store and protect your Funko Pops.",
      "content": "Properly store and protect your Funko Pops. For your collectibles to be worth top dollar, they should be as close to new condition as possible. Keep them in-box and store them away from sunlight, which can fade them over time. Keep them in a cool space where the humidity is moderate—not in an attic or basement. Lightly dust the boxes as needed. [14] X Research source Invest in Pop protector cases if you’d like more secure protection for your collection—especially if you’ll be storing them for a long time. Funko Pop figurines that are still in-box will likely command more money than Pops that are open or missing their box."

Search for the Funko Pops you want to sell to view their current market value based on sales data from sites like eBay. You might have a Pop that’s worth a pretty penny without even knowing it! Research helps you price competitively and fairly. The Funko Pop market changes over time. Like any speculative investment, it’s not guaranteed to be profitable. While factors like exclusivity may indicate a Pop will go up in value over time, be prepared for your collection’s value to be stagnant or even decline over time. [15] X Research source"

If you’d like to use a global platform but only want to ship locally, specify that you’re only interested in buyers from your state/country in your listing.

Take photos from multiple angles. Try to fill the frame as much as you can. Closer pictures show more detail, so buyers feel confident that they know what they’re paying for. [16] X Research source If your Pops have any damage, be sure to highlight this in photos and in the listing description."

      "content": "Offer bundle deals to encourage bigger orders. Whether you’re selling online or in-person, offer deals to incentivize people to buy more of your Funko Pops at once. For example, price individual Pops as $15 each but offer three Pops for $40 (a savings of $5). Because you only have to ship to one location, you may save money on shipping costs compared to selling to multiple buyers."

When a celebrity passes away, the value of their Pop usually goes up. The same happens for pop-culture-themed Pops when the series they're from ends or is rebooted. When a Funko Pop is vaulted (retired), its value almost always goes up. [17] X Research source"

[18] X Research source View the sale history for specific Funko Pops on eBay or sites like Pop Price Guide to get insight on their current market value. Factors that affect price include condition, rarity, demand, and whether or not a Pop is vaulted (retired) or exclusive (manufactured and sold in limited quantities). Rare or “grailed” Pops have sold for tens and even hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, sales of this value are uncommon. [19] X Research source"
