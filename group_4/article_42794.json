      "content": "Stage 1: Inflammation and oozing (2-4 days after tattoo) From the moment you leave the chair to about 2-4 days later, your tattoo will ooze excess ink, plasma, and blood as your body reacts to the new wound. Your skin will also likely be red and feel somewhat sore, and a little redness and swelling are to be expected. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source It’s totally natural and nothing to worry about—just keep the initial bandage on for 1-2 days to keep your tattoo protected and to give its healing process a head start. [2] X Research source Typically, oozing, red, or raised skin lasts not longer than about 2 weeks if you keep your tattoo clean and cared for."

      "content": "Stage 2: Itching and irritation (1-2 weeks after tattoo) During stage 2, you'll experience itching and irritation and both are totally normal. About a week or 2 after you get your tattoo, your tattoo may become itchy or slightly flaky, which is a normal immune response and a sign your body is on-track for healing. Itching and irritation often recede after about 2 weeks. That said, large, raised hives or painful rashes aren’t typical, so see a doctor if you notice these.

      "content": "Stage 3: Scabbing and peeling (2-4 Weeks after Tattoo) During stage 3, you’ll develop dry patches of flaky skin, as well as scabs, both of which are also typical in the healing process. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Your tattoo will also start to peel as the top layer of skin sloughs off and reveals the fresh layer beneath it. This stage usually starts one to two weeks after you get your tattoo, peaks, and ends around four weeks after you get your tattoo. [5] X Research source It also often overlaps with stage 2. Let your skin peel off naturally and avoid picking those scabs . Allowing your skin to do its thing is important for proper healing."

      "content": "Stage 4: Long-term healing (4 weeks after tattoo and beyond) During stage 4, your tatted skin is considered fully healed after a minimum of 2 weeks, provided you’ve taken good care of it. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source That means no more redness, peeling, or other hallmarks of the tattoo healing process. That said, every tattoo and body are different, so it may even take 4 weeks or more to reach this stage. [7] X Research source By about 3 months after you get your tattoo, all layers of your skin should be fully healed with no lingering soreness, redness, irritation, or other complications. [8] X Research source Your tattoo journey isn’t over! Keep applying sunscreen and moisturizer regularly to keep your tattoo looking sharp and vivid for years to come."

      "content": "Most tattoos usually take about 2-4 weeks to fully heal. After about 3 weeks, your skin will likely look totally normal again (with the addition of a sick tat) and you can do all the stuff you couldn’t while it was healing, like swimming or intense exercise. [9] X Research source But that’s just an average, and everyone’s timeline is different. That’s why it’s vital to follow your tattoo artist’s advice for aftercare, as they can often personalize your routine for your skin type and tattoo. What’s more, your tattoo may take longer to heal depending on its size, location, and even the color of ink that was used. [10] X Research source It takes the lower layers of skin about 3-4 months to fully recover, but this is long after you have to be worried about your new ink. Healing may take longer if you experience complications like an allergic reaction, inflammation, or infection during your healing process."

Your artist wants to see their work preserved and looking fresh as much as you do, so follow their advice! Your artist will also likely have advice for how long to keep the initial wrap on, preferred ointment brands that they trust, and pain management strategies for tattoos in awkward places."

After you take off the initial bandage (usually 10-24 hours after sitting for the tattoo), wash your hands with warm water and mild hand soap. Then, wash your tattoo with warm water and mild, unscented hand soap, using just your fingertips. Gently pat it dry with a paper towel to make sure no moisture lingers on your skin. Repeat this 4-5 times a day (or however often your tattoo artist recommends) to keep your tattoo clean and sterile.

Once your tattoo is fully healed, apply a generous amount of sunscreen every time you plan to spend time outside to lessen any long-term fading. [14] X Research source SPF 50 will have you covered, but feel free to use a stronger formula (especially if you have fair skin). While your tattoo is healing, protect it from the sun by covering it with loose-fitting clothing, if possible."

      "content": "Avoid intense exercise or submerging your tattoo in water. During the first 3-4 weeks of healing, avoid dipping your tattoo in water (not including showers) or sweating profusely. Your new tattoo is essentially an open wound, and open water like pools, lakes, the ocean, or even baths are hotbeds for bacteria that may enter the tattoo and cause infections. The same goes for sweat you produce while exercising. [15] X Research source"

Resist! Your skin is naturally healing itself, and if you pick or itch the tattoo, you risk removing any scabs or dead skin before they’re ready to come off, possibly damaging your tattoo. [16] X Research source To stop your tattoo from itching, lightly tap it with 2-3 fingers for instant relief. Or, dampen a towel with cool water and lightly press it to the tattoo for 5 minutes.

[18] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Persistent redness or rashes may also be caused by an allergic reaction to the ink.

Similarly, open sores or persistent bleeding are also red flags. This is a sign of infection, so talk to a doctor as soon as you can to treat the infected skin . [19] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Note that if you have colored ink, your tattoo might peel away in various colors.

You may have an allergy relating to the tattoo pigment that’s causing your skin to react negatively to the ink, such as a carbon sensitivity or a cobalt allergy, which can be a complication when working with blue ink, especially. Red or yellow pigments are among the most likely to cause negative skin reactions. [20] X Research source In all likelihood, your body may recover from the reaction with little or no damage to the tattoo, but it’s important to see a healthcare provider to aid in recovery."
