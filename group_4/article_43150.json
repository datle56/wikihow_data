Reassuring yourself that the problem is anxiety-related and that it’s only temporary can help you regain your breath more easily. This isn’t to say what you’re going through isn’t a big deal; rather, it can help calm you down to remember that though anxiety and panic attacks are scary and uncomfortable, they aren’t life-threatening and are usually short-lived.
