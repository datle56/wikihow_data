Place a hand above the leg’s joint to stabilize it, and then use your other hand to move the lower portion of the limb. Gently bend your dog’s leg at the joint, and move it forward and backwards as far as it can naturally go. Repeat the exercise on the other hind leg, and then repeat it a few times each day. [8] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 19 August 2021. PROM exercises decrease inflammation, help in the production of joint fluid, and stretch out your dog’s muscles. When done regularly, they can help mitigate arthritis, and bring back mobility to your dog. [9] X Expert Source Ray Spragley, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 19 August 2021.

[11] X Research source Proper positioning is important for this exercise to be most effective. While sitting, your dog should be in a ‘sphinx’ position, with its body on the floor and paws close to it. Then, to stand, it should keep its front feet planted, while moving its hind legs forward.

A short walk, even for 5 minutes, can help your dog regain strength. Keep an eye on your dog to make sure it isn't pushing itself too hard. Collapsing or showing signs of pain means your dog should take a rest. [13] X Research source Walking on an uneven surface can help your dog regain coordination and balance. Try getting your dog to walk on a mattress, which will allow it to use a different set of muscles while moving. [14] X Research source If your dog enjoys swimming, this can be a great way for it to build strength without putting pressure on the joints. Take your dog for a swim in a pool or non-moving body of water, but be sure to watch it carefully, in case it overexerts itself. If you see your dog struggling to stay afloat, immediately pull it out of the water.
