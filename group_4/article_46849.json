      "content": "Choose the right auger for the job. You need to consider what kind of soil you'll be digging in, how many holes you will dig and whether you have someone to help you run the auger. A hand auger can be operated by 1 or 2 people. This is best if you only have 1 or 2 holes to dig, because it takes a lot of work to turn the handle. [1] X Research source A power auger uses a gasoline engine to turn the auger, but it can be dangerous if it runs into a rock or other obstruction. The auger will stop suddenly, which can cause the top to jerk, knocking you off your feet or even breaking your arm. [2] X Research source A wheeled auger is a power auger mounted on a wheeled frame, so there is less chance you'll be injured if it stops. A tractor auger is safest because you operate it from the tractor seat. If something goes wrong, you are at safe distance. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Break up the soil if it's especially hard. Your auger will work best if the first few inches or centimeters is easy to dig into. Use a spade, digging tool or clamshell post-hole digger. If the ground is still too hard, soak the area with water."

      "content": "Dig down about 12 inches (30 cm). Raise the auger out of the hole and dump the dirt off the blades. If you don't regularly dump off the dirt, the auger will become too heavy to raise easily. It may even get stuck in the hole.

      "content": "Return the auger to the hole and continue digging and dumping the dirt. Most post-holes are about 3 feet (1 meter) deep. Augers can dig much deeper, however, if you use extension rods."

      "content": "Choose an auger, also called a pipe snake. Consider factors such as the age of the house and what plumbing problems you've had before. While a simple auger may not be adequate for every situation, a power auger requires you to lug a heavy spool around to clear the smallest drain clogs. [7] X Research source A hand-cranked auger is a long cable with a threaded bit that pushes down into the drain until it contacts the obstruction. A hand-crank turns the bit, which bores into the obstruction A power auger may come with its own motor or it may be attached to a drill that uses a motor to spin the bit. The motor makes getting through the obstruction easier and faster. You can reverse the motor to help pull the obstruction out of the pipe."

      "content": "Push the cable into the drain until it hits the obstruction and stops. Leave 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) between the drain and the crank so you can operate it easily. If you have too much cable between the drain and the crank, it may kink. [8] X Research source"
