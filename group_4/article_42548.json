      "content": "Choose a partner who wants to take things slow to avoid conflict. Your choice of partner is the most important factor in practically any relationship. However, when you're set on taking a relationship slowly, it's even more important than normal. Look for someone who can respect your choice to limit your intimacy. [1] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Relationship Advisor Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. This should be a person who isn't only focused on the physical aspects of a relationship. You want someone who's more interested in your thoughts than your body. [2] X Research source You can find people who meet these criteria anywhere. However, you may have the most success if you try places where people like this are likely to gather. For example, since many religions teach that sex before marriage should be avoided, you may find good potential partners in religious youth groups or places of worship."

      "content": "Be clear about what you’re comfortable with to avoid confusion. Set physical boundaries early on. Be clear and explicit about what you are (and aren't) comfortable with. It can be alarming if your physical limits come as a surprise to your partner in the \"heat of the moment,\" so take the opportunity to be up-front before you start getting affectionate. [3] X Research source Also discuss what you’re comfortable with emotionally or how serious you’d like to get. Say something like, “Just so you know, it’s important that I wait until marriage before having sex.” Or, “I’m not looking for a serious relationship right now, but I’d really love to keep seeing each other casually.” Or, “I really like you, but I’d prefer if we didn’t have sex until we’re in an exclusive relationship.” Don't be afraid to tell your partner \"no\" if they get too \"touchy-feely\" for you. If your partner won't listen to repeated warnings, have a serious discussion about respecting your boundaries.

      "content": "Keep up with other aspects of your life while dating at the same time. Part of a slow relationship means not seeing each other every single day. Instead of hanging out all the time, plan dates a few times a week (or even less, if you’d prefer). That way, you can both live your lives outside of the relationship without dedicating all your time to it. [4] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. The same thing goes for texting and calling each other, too. Give each other space by not talking 24/7."

      "content": "Plan chill outings to focus on having fun. Take time to go out, explore the world, and treat each other to small luxuries. Whatever you and your partner enjoy doing together is fair game. The good news is that there are many, many things to do that don't involve physical intimacy. Enjoy traditional dates like dinner and a movie, or get creative with dates like rock climbing. [5] X Research source Splashing out on big, expensive dates can make the relationship feel more serious than it is. Keep things casual with fun, relaxed dates, like picnicking in the park or going for a bike ride."

      "content": "Slow things down by doing things without each other. Since you trust your partner to respect your pace for the relationship, trust your partner when they aren’t with you. Don't try to restrict your partner's time with friends, family, or other people who are important to them. Give your partner enough space to have some alone time when they want it. [8] X Research source Remember that respect is a two-way street. When you’re taking a relationship slowly, you probably won’t see your partner every day. Get comfortable with that, and make peace with the fact that your partner has their own life outside of the relationship."

If you really want to take things slow, don’t give each other labels or call each other “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.” [9] X Research source You can still be exclusive if you want, but it’s possible to be in an exclusive relationship without labels. For instance, you might say, “I’ve been having a lot of fun getting to know you, but I don’t want to label our relationship just yet. I’d like to wait and feel it out for a couple more weeks before I’m ready to make that commitment.”"

While it might be convenient to visit your partner’s parents on a road trip or see their family on vacation, that doesn’t mesh with a relationship you’re trying to take slowly. There’s no specific timeline for how long you need to wait, but try to avoid meeting your partner’s family until you’re sure you want to be in a long-term, committed relationship with them. [10] X Research source Explain this to your partner by saying something like, “I’m sure your family is wonderful, and I’ll definitely want to meet them eventually. I think I’d be more comfortable if I waited until we’ve been dating for at least a year.”"

The things you've done with your partner, especially when it comes to physical affection and sex, aren't measures of how \"good\" your relationship is. At this stage, the most important thing is how you and your partner feel. If you both enjoy each others' company, you're affectionate, and you have open, caring attitudes towards each other, you're doing fine. [11] X Research source Keep in mind that not everyone will agree with this. Some people have different priorities for their relationships. It's OK to disagree with these people. If you're happy with your relationship, you don't need to let them pressure you into things you're not comfortable with."

Let your partner know that while you’re committed to this relationship, you need to feel more secure before you take that next step.

      "content": "Think about your relationship’s future so you can plan ahead. It's a good idea to have an idea of where you want your relationship to be eventually, even if you're not there yet. You can gradually work towards this goal, making week-by-week progress as you take small steps toward it. If you don't have an end in mind for your relationship, it can be harder to justify your slow pace to a partner. [15] X Research source If you are a teen or pre-teen, having an end goal of \"spending lots of time being affectionate with each other\" is fine. There's no need to worry about \"the L word\" or marriage for a long time. If you're older, it's wise to know whether you plan to end up married, cohabiting, having children, and so on. This makes it easier to find a partner who's right for you (and get rid of ones who aren't). Plus, most adults who are willing to wait a long time to become physically intimate are interested in marriage or life-long relationships."

If you find yourself frequently stressing out about whether or not you should take things to the next level, relax. These changes will happen naturally after you've decided that you're ready and you have discussed them with your partner. They aren't \"checkboxes\" to mark off as quickly as possible on the way to a \"real\" relationship. [16] X Research source If you suspect that your partner is unhappy with how slowly the relationship is progressing, have a serious conversation about it. It's best to address these problems head-on rather than pretending that they do not exist."
