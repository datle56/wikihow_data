      "content": "Form words as you would with your own voice. Most of the work in changing your voice should be done with your mouth, not your vocal cords. If you are feeling any soreness in your throat you should take a break. Talking like Donald, especially attempting a long Donald Duck rant, takes a lot of breath and can make you light-headed. Even the voice actor that plays Donald needs a break after a long rant [3] X Research source so be sure you don't overdo it. To make the angry Donald sound make the normal Donald noise while shaking your head so your cheeks flap and vibrate the sound. Some letters are easier to say than others. For example, when Donald Duck says the word little, it sounds like widdle. Changes to letter pronunciation will come naturally as a limitation to speaking in his voice."
