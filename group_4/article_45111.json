If it’s not active, check if your Roomba is on its charging station, and if it’s not, find where it stopped in your home. Your Roomba will play an audio alert if it’s stuck or unable to get back to its charging station. [1] X Research source If the audio alert doesn’t play, check under your furniture or in tight spaces where the Roomba may have become stuck."

Hold this button down for 15 seconds until your Roomba plays a tone, indicating it’s been placed on standby. [5] X Research source Standby Mode pauses all cleaning, so that your Roomba stays at its station and charges, which saves power and stops the Roomba from any unnecessary cleaning. Make sure the Light Touch Sensor at the front of the Roomba is touching the IR Sensor on the charging station, so that the Roomba can charge. You’ll know the Roomba is charging when the ring around the “CLEAN/Power” button pulses with light. The Roomba is fully charged when the ring no longer pulses but shines solid. [6] X Research source It’ll take about 2 hours to complete a full charge. [7] X Research source"

If your Roomba’s brushes are clogged or too dirty, your Roomba has to work extra hard to clean your home, and uses more battery power in the process. Keeping the brushes clear of hair and debris cuts down on battery usage. [10] X Research source"
