[2] X Research source A fraction is a type of ratio called “part-to-whole.” The numerator tells you the number of parts you have, the denominator tells you the number of parts in the whole. If you have 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} of a pizza, you have three parts or slices and the entire pizza is made of four of them. If you have 4 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{4}}} of a pizza, though, you have an entire pizza! The other type of ratio is called “part-to-part.” This type of ratio tells you how many parts of a whole one group is, compared with how many parts another group is. For example, the ratio of girls to boys in a classroom might be 2:1. This means that for every 2 girls in the classroom, there is 1 boy.

[3] X Research source To divide by a fraction , you take the reciprocal of one of the numbers and multiply. A reciprocal is found by “flipping” a fraction: the numerator becomes the denominator, and the denominator becomes the numerator. [4] X Research source For example, the reciprocal of 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} is 4 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{3}}} . As an example, to divide 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} by 1 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{4}}} , take the reciprocal of 1 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{4}}} and multiply: 3 4 ÷ 1 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}\\div {\\frac {1}{4}}} 3 4 × 4 1 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}\\times {\\frac {4}{1}}} = 3 × 4 4 × 1 {\\displaystyle ={\\frac {3\\times 4}{4\\times 1}}} = 12 4 {\\displaystyle ={\\frac {12}{4}}} = 3 {\\displaystyle =3}"

      "content": "Learn how to use variables. In sixth grade you will begin learning basic algebra skills involving variables. A variable is a letter that stands for an unknown value in a math equation. [5] X Research source You will need to understand what variables mean, as well as how to solve for them . For example, the variable 4 y {\\displaystyle 4y} is equal to y + y + y + y {\\displaystyle y+y+y+y} . It is also equal to 4 × y {\\displaystyle 4\\times y} and 2 × 2 × y {\\displaystyle 2\\times 2\\times y} . To solve the equation y + 3 = 11 {\\displaystyle y+3=11} , you need to find the value of y {\\displaystyle y} . To find the value of y {\\displaystyle y} , subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: y + 3 = 11 {\\displaystyle y+3=11} y + 3 − 3 = 11 − 3 {\\displaystyle y+3-3=11-3} y = 8 {\\displaystyle y=8}"

It is natural to make mistakes, and in fact, mistakes help us learn and do better. If you avoid math work because you are afraid of looking stupid and making mistakes, you will likely not fulfill your potential."

Math practice can be boring, so make it fun by practicing while playing games. Just make sure you are also completing your regular classwork. Take advantage of math games, programs, and apps you use at school, such as iReady, Prodigy, IXL, or STMath. When your teacher gives you time to use the computer to practice math, make sure you stay on task. You can use free computer time to go on math game websites. Some popular ones include Cool Math [8] X Research source and Math Playground. [9] X Research source Play games that relate to the current topics you are learning in math. Your teacher may be able to pick out appropriate games for you to play. According to one study, the majority of men pursuing a career in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) became interested in the subject through games and toys they played when they were younger.

If your teacher tells you to write something down, or says that something is important or will be on a test, write it down. Write down formulas, terms, and definitions. Don’t try to write down everything, or else your notes will not be helpful. Just write down what you think seems important. You might also miss out on important information your teacher is giving while you are trying to keep up. However, make sure you write down all the steps you need to solve the problems on your assignment or else you might get stuck later on.

Many students get poor grades in math simply because they lose their work and don’t turn it in. Take the time to put your math work in your math folder. If you put it in a different folder, you will likely forget where it is. Keep your folder neat. Keep graded work in the right pocket, and work you need to turn in or complete in the left pocket."

Even if you are the only one who is confused, having others thinking you are dumb is not worth the risk of not learning. Not asking questions about something you don’t understand is a sure way to keep misunderstanding. Since math topics build upon one another, if you don’t master skills taught today, you likely won’t master skills taught tomorrow, either. So it is important to ask questions right away."

Teachers usually give full or partial credit if you complete all the requirements of the assignment and show your work. If you don’t turn in your work at all, you will get no credit for your assignment. [17] X Research source It is very hard to raise your grade once you receive a few zeros on assignments. Even though a D isn’t a passing grade, it is much easier to recover from than a zero or an F. For example, if you have two assignments, and you earn a 0% on the first assignment because you didn’t complete it, and a 100% on the second assignment, your average grade is only 50%, which is an F. On the other hand, if you have a 60% (D) on your first assignment, and a 100% on your second assignment, your average grade is 80%, which is a B."
