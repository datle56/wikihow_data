If not, research some existing wiki software options and find a web host that supports it. You can also install the most popular wiki software manually if you have a dedicated web server or a virtual private server. Some common wiki software options: MediaWiki is one of the most popular wiki platforms (used by Wikipedia and wikiHow) and is supported by popular web hosts like DreamHost, HostGator, SiteGround, and dozens more. [3] X Research source You can also easily install it on any dedicated or virtual private serverâ€”for the latest installation requirements, see [4] X Research source . TikiWiki is another popular option supported by many popular web hosts out of the box, including Bluehost, Hostmonster, Inmotion, and Web Hosting UK. TikiWiki has strong plugin support, allowing you to add features like forums, image galleries, calendars, and more. If you have your own server, you can install TikiWiki from [5] X Research source .

If you are running MySQL, create a new database called \"wikidb\" and user \"wikiuser\" using the following commands: CREATE DATABASE wikidb; CREATE USER 'wikiuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wikidb.* TO 'wikiuser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION; If the database and web server are on different servers, use the appropriate hostname in place of localhost (e.g., mediawiki.example.com ).

Wikis can be personal pages, sprawling communities, or anything in between. You can use a wiki to track your life goals , create a product manual for your business, collaborate with coworkers on a project, create a neighborhood newsletter, create a discussion place for a hobby, and much more. Wikis work best when they have a broad focus that allows as many knowledgeable writers and editors to contribute as possible. If you are trying to build a popular wiki with lots of community involvement, the focus should be open-ended enough to allow for lots of expansion. For example, it would be better to start a wiki about a game company and all their games than just one of their games."

As more people come, other visitors will begin contributing their own articles and edits to your wiki. It will take some time, but you'll have a community before you know it! Remember, when you're starting out, it's up to YOU to create the content that will bring people to your wiki.

You don't have to be rigid while creating the policies; try to make them flexible, as people won't be able to easily work or contribute well to a wiki with overly strict rules. You may want to write standards on how weaving the web of links should be done, and on article noteworthiness standards. Not all of your contributors will follow the style guide you create, but it will aid in patrolling and editing articles. A guide is more friendly than verbally reprimanding. It's more social to be corrected by a text than by a person."

The more people who come to your wiki, the higher your chances of being vandalized. Luckily, almost all wiki software allows for quick rollbacks of articles to their previous versions. Be as tolerant as possible. If both your version and the new version are correct, keep the contributor version. It will broaden the wiki's point of view and welcome contributors."

If people are enthusiastic about your wiki, give the dedicated ones more control over the site. Be supportive and nice to your editors. It is important that they have a helping hand to guide them and to motivate them to work on the wiki. By creating admins from your community, you relieve a lot of the pressure you face when patrolling and maintaining your content. Set up forums and talk pages for your community members to discuss the wiki's rules and style. Allow your admins to vote on policy and style changes.
