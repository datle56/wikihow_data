      "content": "Speak to your teacher. If you have a test coming up on a topic that you feel like you don't understand or are really struggling with, the best thing to do is to talk to your teacher about the difficulties you are having. They know the syllabus of the course and are best-placed to remind you about what you have been covering in class and how you should go about your studying . [1] X Research source Always be polite and don't blame your teacher for your lack of understanding. Say something like \"I don't feel like I understand the topic, can you recommend some reading I can do to help?\" Be sure to show that you are not looking for short-cuts, but that you genuinely want to study and learn. You could say, \"I know we have the test coming up and I was hoping you could help me identify which areas I need to work more on?\""

      "content": "Look through your course books. A good way to determine the material in the course that you do and don't understand is simply to look back through all your notes and books for the subject. Read through and think about what you know and what you don't know. Provided that you have taken good notes in class, they will be one of the best resources for reviewing what has been covered. Mark down any areas that you have particular trouble with and try to rank them by difficulty. When you go through the notes and books make it an active exercise. Underline, highlight and annotate key passages to make sure you are actively engaging with your notes. Try using sticky notes to take notes and mark important passages in your textbooks. [2] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Doing this will help you avoid passively glossing over material. If you don't take an active approach, there is a danger that what you are reading won't sink in."

      "title": "Try to teach someone else.",
      "content": "Try to teach someone else. One of the best ways to see what you do and don't understand is to try and teach the material to someone else. This tactic forces you to put ideas into your own words, so it will be very clear what you have a handle on and what you don't. [3] X Research source For example, if you're in history class and the test will cover \"causes of the American Revolution,\" ask a family member or friend if you can explain the causes to them. Give the other person your textbook or class notes. When you find a place that you have difficulty explaining, or \"teaching,\" ask them to make a note of it. Then you will know what you need to study for the test. Talking with someone else about issues you're having studying can also be very helpful. A fresh perspective may be just what you need to clarify those last few points."

      "content": "Find some past exam papers. An excellent way to see what type of questions you will be asked in an upcoming exam is to obtain past exams through your teacher. If your teacher gives you a past exam, you can use it as a way to test your knowledge and conduct practice tests. Having a good understanding of the type of question and the format of the exam will be useful for your studying. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source This is especially the case when you feel like you don't understand the material. Seeing questions written down on a past test will help to get to grips with the sort of knowledge that the exam is testing. The questions will be different but the past test can help you determine what kind of questions you will be asked. You may be asked general questions which require a broader but less detailed understanding, more specific questions which require fuller understanding of a more limited topic, or both."

      "content": "Act quickly. If you are taking a class and are struggling with the material, don't wait until the exam comes around before taking steps to improve your understanding and your work. It's important to be an active learner rather than a passive learner. This means actively working through your notes from class and seeking extra help or clarification at the time rather than putting it off. [5] X Research source By being active you are using the information and material that you are learning more frequently. More frequent use of information will make it easier for you to access it in your memory when the test arrives. Try to spend ten minutes looking over your notes from each class within 24 hours of the class."

This may not be useful to you the night before the big test, but participating in your class will make it far easier for you to really get a grip on the material being covered.

      "content": "Organise your study schedule. Once you have a clearer picture of the material you need to study it's important that you get down to it and don't waste any time. You really don't want to be trying to cram at the last minute if you can avoid it. Ideally you should start serious studying at least a week or two before the test. Of course this will vary depending on how much you need to cover, but it's better to have extra time than not enough. [6] X Research source You may have to experiment a little to find the right schedule for you. Some people will find they can keep their concentration for longer than others. Try to study for between 40 and 90 minutes at a time before taking a short break of 10 or 15 minutes. Keep the break relatively short so you don't get completely out of the studying mindset. Having a clear and visual schedule written up will help you keep track of your work and visualise your progress as you can tick off the parts as you do them."

There are no fixed rules for this and what works for you might not for somebody else. [7] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Ensure it is free of electronic devices and other obvious distractions. You can break your working environment down into sounds, sights, smells, and comfort. Find the right level of quietness for you. Some people work well with some light background noise, others prefer total silence. Find what works for you. You need good lighting to avoid eye-strain and fatigue. Try to avoid working somewhere with potentially distracting sights and lights. You have to find a place and way to work that is comfortable, but not so comfortable that you lose focus and relax completely. For example, choose a desk chair rather than a recliner. Although it may not come to mind immediately, smells can be distracting so try to steer clear of areas that have strong smells, good or bad. Many people believe they're good at multitasking, but it's a myth that you can successfully study and do something else. Find a study space that isn't blaring a TV or loud music, and stay off of IM and Facebook. Trying to \"multitask\" will only end up damaging your concentration and making it even harder to understand the material."

      "content": "Try to connect new information to things you already know. One reason people may not understand information is that it seems completely foreign and unlinked to things you already know. This makes it a lot harder to connect to the material. [8] X Research source It can be helpful to ask your teacher or your classmates for their perspectives on the material. This may help you make links to things you already know. Try searching online. You may find a better example or explanation that \"clicks\" with you than the one in the textbook. Look at the context of information. If you're finding it challenging to understand what you're reading, try looking for contextual clues. Sometimes, this can help you decipher what the text is really getting at. For example, if you're baffled by a chapter that keeps mentioning \"semiotics,\" look at the examples given. You might notice a lot of references to signs, symbols, or meanings, which will give you a clue that semiotics is the study of relationships between signs/symbols (such as language) and what they communicate."

There is simply no alternative to hard work, but if you spend time working efficiently and effectively you can achieve the results you want. Set reminders on your phone to avoid forgetting about any study sessions. If you do miss one, it's not a disaster, just be sure to make up the time elsewhere. [9] X Research source It can be difficult to stick to your schedule so consider asking someone to help you if you find it hard. A gentle reminder that you ought to be studying from parents or siblings can do the job. Having a clear schedule and putting it up in kitchen is one way to make it clear to everyone in the house when you are supposed to be studying."

Break up your work and be sure to reward yourself for sticking to your timetable. [10] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020.

Bring your books and take notes on what she tells you to focus on. [13] X Research source You should bring your own study materials to show that you have been trying and aren't looking for a quick fix. Showing that you are committed and hard working will encourage the teacher to put in extra time with you to help. Be honest with your teacher when you talk to her. If you are really stressed and anxious, tell her that and she will try to help.

Studying with friends can be a great way to prepare for an exam as you can use the knowledge each of you has gained and help each other work through difficult material. You will each bring your own ideas, and this can expand your understanding of a topic. If you are going to try a study group be sure to plan out what you will cover beforehand so everyone is prepared and you don't waste any time. [17] X Research source Remember that your friend may be very confident, but she is not necessarily right. Be sure to keep referring to course texts and materials in your study sessions. If you find that you just end up chatting with your friends you should rethink whether or not the study group is helping you learn and prepare for the test."

This is especially the case if you have an older brother or sister who has already done the class you are doing. Your sibling might have notes you can borrow or might be able to help explain a tricky topic to you more clearly. Similarly, your parents can work with you and help you stick to your schedule. Flash cards are a very effective way to study, and you can ask your parents or sibling to use these to test you on what you have worked on. Sometimes trying to explain something to someone else will help you get it clearer in your own mind, or highlight areas where you are still uncertain."
