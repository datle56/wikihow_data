      "content": "Always wear a wedding ring on your left hand. Wedding rings are traditionally worn on the left hand’s ring finger. Many believe the left ring finger is connected to the “vein of love” or Vena Amoris vein, which flows from the hand up the arm and directly to the heart. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Therefore, wearing a wedding ring on this finger symbolizes a couple’s love. In some cultures, the wedding ring is actually worn on the right hand as it’s believed to be the most trustworthy hand. This custom can be found in countries such as Greece, Russia, Portugal, Poland, Spain, and India. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "For fashion purposes, it doesn’t matter which hand you wear a ring on. Aside from a wedding band, what hand you wear rings on doesn’t necessarily matter–do whatever’s best for you! If you’re more comfortable wearing rings on your right hand, go for it. If you prefer the left, that’s fine too. Keep in mind that your most dominant hand will draw the most attraction to rings, especially if you talk with your hands."

      "content": "Wear a signet or association ring on your pinky. More often than not, family, association, or signet rings are worn on the pinky finger to represent loyalty or devotion to a family, business, or cause.

      "content": "Wear a ring on your ring finger if you’re married. In most cultures, a ring on the left ring finger means you’re in a committed relationship.

      "title": "Wear bigger rings on your middle fingers.",
      "content": "Wear bigger rings on your middle fingers. Being one of the larger and longer fingers on the hand, the middle finger is perfect for bigger jewelry. This finger is perfect for statement pieces. In other words, wear a ring on a middle finger if you want a ring to be seen. [4] X Research source The middle finger is also great for stacking rings because of its length. If you want to wear more than one ring at once, consider layering a small band under or above a statement ring."

      "content": "Wear family and prominent rings on your index finger. Traditionally, signet rings and family crests are worn on the index finger. The rings on this finger are meant to make a bold statement of nobility or pride. [5] X Research source Similarly, large or chunky rings are also worn on the pointer finger to make an equally bold fashion statement. For instance, a ring passed down from your grandfather or a class ring is typically worn on the index finger. From a fashion standpoint, large skull rings can be worn on the index finger to represent a confident attitude."

      "content": "Wear bold, fashionable rings on your thumb. If you have a larger-than-life ring, put it on your thumb. The thumb is the widest and strongest finger, meaning it can hold heavier jewelry. Because of this, you can wear a single bulky ring on the thumb to make a bold fashion choice. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Match metals for a harmonious look. When you wear jewelry, do your best to avoid mismatching metals. In other words, wear a silver watch if you’re wearing a silver ring. If you have a gold chain necklace, opt for gold rings. Some experts say mixing metals is okay if they’re in the same family. For instance, a platinum gold bracelet can make a diamond embellished ring pop."

      "title": "Balance your jewelry across both hands.",
      "content": "Balance your jewelry across both hands. While it’s possible to wear multiple rings on 1 hand or finger, it’s also important to balance out your look. Wearing all your rings on 1 hand may make you look lopsided. For example, if you wear 3 rings on the left hand, opt for 2 more on the right. When in doubt, opt for symmetry. [11] X Research source Similarly, say you have a wedding band on your left hand and want to wear a larger ring. Put your statement ring on the right middle finger to prevent the rings from knocking together and balance your look."

      "title": "Wear rings that match your proportions.",
      "content": "Wear rings that match your proportions. If you have wider hands, wear larger rings. If you have smaller fingers, wear thinner rings. Don’t let the rings overpower you. Instead, work with them. Think of it like this: You wouldn’t put on a shirt that looks too big or too small on you—rings are the same."

      "title": "Think about your lifestyle.",
      "content": "Think about your lifestyle. Before you put on a ring, consider what you have planned for the day. If you have a business meeting, a wedding band and a couple of statement pieces can show that you’re in control. Meanwhile, wearing rings that can easily be taken off is probably best if you have a pick-up game after work. Similarly, consider your profession before sporting fashion or zodiac rings. As with anything, what you wear can say a lot about you, so think twice before sporting a skull and crossbones ring (for example) if you work in a high corporate business. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap a string around your finger to find your ring size. Finding your ring size is a piece of cake! Simply take a piece of floss or string and wrap it once around the base of your finger, marking where the string overlaps. Then, measure the length of the marked string with a ruler in millimeters. Once you have the measurement, compare it to the sizing chart from the jeweler’s company. [13] X Research source When buying rings online, most will come with a size chart so you can find your exact size. In stores, the jeweler may have a ring sizer to accurately measure your finger(s)."

Women’s rings are typically more narrow, whereas men’s are thicker and wider. Because of this, the size range can vary, so always refer to a men’s ring chart if you’re looking for a male ring."
