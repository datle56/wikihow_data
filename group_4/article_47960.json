      "content": "“In transit” means your package is on its way to the final destination. It indicates the courier company has picked up your package, and it’s moving within the shipping network to reach your shipping address. Sometimes, this means your package is physically traveling between hubs, but it could just be sitting in a shipment facility, awaiting transportation. [1] X Research source For example, if your package has left the retailer and it’s currently located at a FedEx, UPS, or USPS warehouse, the status “in transit” still applies. The shipping process includes order placement, the retailer packing your order (\" processing \"), the package being picked up by the courier (“ shipped ”), the package making its way through the shipping network (\" in transit \"), and the courier delivering the package to your address (“ out for delivery ”)."

      "content": "It usually takes 1-5 days for “in transit” packages to be delivered. However, the best way to determine your delivery date is to look at the estimated arrival date provided by the merchant. Delivery times depend on the courier, shipping method, delivery distance, and several other factors, so it might take longer than 5 days in certain cases. While these times aren’t guaranteed, here’s how long most major shipping services take: UPS Ground: 1-5 business days [2] X Research source UPS 2nd Day Air: 2 business days USPS Ground: 2-5 business days [3] X Research source USPS Priority: 1-3 business days FedEx Ground: 1-7 business days [4] X Research source FedEx Express: 1-3 business days DHL Ground: 6-9 business days [5] X Research source DHL Expedited: 2-5 business days"

      "content": "A package that's out for delivery is heading directly to your address. If a package is marked “in transit,” it could be at a distribution center or warehouse waiting to be picked up for delivery. The status “out for delivery,” on the other hand, means the package has been picked up from your local distribution center (such as the post office), has been loaded onto a delivery truck, and is now heading to your shipping address—you’ll most likely receive the package by the end of the day. [7] X Research source “Out for delivery” is typically the last step of the shipping process, right before you receive your package and it’s marked as “delivered.”"
