      "title": "Write a card with a note of appreciation.",
      "content": "Write a card with a note of appreciation. A nice teacher appreciation gift doesn’t have to cost anything at all—a heartfelt and personalized card will be treasured by a teacher forever. Pick out a teacher appreciation card that you think your teacher would like or make the card yourself. Inside the card, write a letter of appreciation to the teacher from both the parent/guardian and the student. [1] X Research source If you're the parent or guardian of a younger student, ask them questions to fill in their portion of the card, e.g., “What makes [your teacher] the best?” and “What does [your teacher] do to make you happy?” Write in quotes of what the student particularly likes about their teacher. Some sample messages of appreciation for teachers include: “Thank you for making learning so fun and engaging. I love being in your class and always look forward to it!” “Thank you for having our backs and always pushing us to be better. Your support as a teacher means more than I can even say.” “You’re a great teacher because you’re so kind and positive, and you always go above and beyond for us students. Can you PLEASEE be my teacher again next year??” “Thank you for believing in Jack and giving him the confidence to try new things and pursue his dreams.” “We’re so happy that Maribel is in your class. She speaks so highly of you and is always excited about the interesting and creative projects you assign.”"

      "title": "Give a cash gift.",
      "content": "Give a cash gift. While cash may seem like an impersonal gift, it’s usually the most requested appreciation gift by teachers. On average, teachers make a pretty low salary and use a lot of their own income to fund their classroom supplies, decor, and activities. By giving your teacher a cash gift, they can either allocate that money to their classroom (instead of their personal funds) or use it on some much-needed self-care and personal necessities. Tuck a cash bill into a card with a handwritten thank you note that’s signed by your student."

      "title": "Give a generic gift card.",
      "content": "Give a generic gift card. Unless you know a specific local store that your teacher likes, get them something generic like a Target, Amazon, Starbucks, or Visa gift card. If you want to make your gift card a little bit more fun and personalized, consider gifting it inside a cute, funny, or pun ny gift card holder. [2] X Research source For example, slip a Peets gift card inside a card that looks like a coffee and write puns like “Have coffee on us to espresso our gratitude” or “Thanks a latte for everything you do!” Or, buy an ice-cream-loving teacher a gift card to your local scoopery and pair it with an ice-cream-shaped card that says “Thanks for making school so cool ” or “ Ice cream , we all scream for amazing teachers like you!” [3] X Research source You can make these cards yourselves or use online templates: here is a tutorial and template for ice cream gift card holders, and a tutorial and template for coffee gift card holders!"

      "content": "Make a word cloud with adjectives that describe your teacher. Open a word cloud generator website and follow their prompts to create your word cloud. Typically, you’ll input words that describe the teacher, like “nice,” “funny,” “dedicated,” “talented,” “helpful,” etc. If you feel really strongly about some of the words or adjectives, add them more than once to make them bigger. [4] X Research source Then, you can edit the shape, color, layout, and style of your overall word cloud until you’re happy with it. If possible, give your word cloud a title with your teacher’s name (or add it as the biggest word in the cloud!). Print out your word cloud and frame it for your teacher, or glue it inside of a card with a heartfelt appreciation letter ."

You could draw them a mini portrait , turn some of their favorite objects into magnets with air dry clay , or paint them a mug at your local pottery painting studio! [5] X Research source Whatever you make your teacher, don’t worry about it being perfect. Teachers just love to see that you’ve gone the extra mile to show your appreciation!"

      "content": "Make a gratitude jar for your teacher to keep in their classroom. Of course, it’s nice for you to write a note of gratitude to your teacher, but why not give them a way to receive appreciation all year? Take a large mason jar and decorate it however you’d like. Label the glass with paint or permanent marker, writing something like “Mrs. Tadmor’s Gratitude Jar” or “Reasons We Love Ms. White.” Add stickers, doodles, or other decor to the outside of the glass. [6] X Research source Put some colorful pens and sticky notes inside the jar for other students to use throughout the year. And, of course, leave a few notes in there that express your gratitude for your teacher."

      "content": "Make your teacher a dry-erase marker bouquet. If you know anything about teachers, it’s that they love dry-erase markers! Get a small metal planter pot and fill the bottom with pieces of foam . Cut small holes into the foam and stick the dry-erase markers into the holes so that they’re of varying heights. Finally, stick foam flower stickers onto the heads of the markers and cover the foam with colorful confetti grass . [8] X Research source Opt for Expo-brand markers if you can—teachers often prefer this brand since they work the best but are typically more expensive. If your school has chalkboards or Smartboards installed in classrooms (instead of whiteboards), this may not be your best option."

      "content": "Gift your teacher a spa or massage certificate. If you’re comfortable enough with your teacher (or your child’s teacher), give a gift certificate for a one-hour massage or other spa service at a local business. Teachers work super hard and don’t get a lot of time to relax during the school year, so it’s nice to give them a reason to indulge in a luxurious experience such as a massage."

If you do, it’s nice to get them a gift that perfectly fits them. For example, maybe you know that your English teacher has been trying to learn German. Get them a copy of a book that’s been translated to German, like The Little Prince , Harry Potter , or Alice in Wonderland . Bonus points if it’s a book you’ve read in their class or one that you know they love! If you’re not sure what your teacher will like, pay close attention throughout the year for anything they mention that they love doing or wish they could do."

Despite being college-educated working professionals, teachers often don’t get the professional respect given to other careers at a similar level. To make your teachers feel a little more professional and cared for, consider making them professional business cards with their name, title, and the name of your school. [10] X Research source If making professional business cards is out of your budget, enlist the help of your school’s art or technology teachers to make and print them yourself.

Sometimes, students need a little reminder (or help) putting together a show of gratitude for their teachers—but nothing makes teachers happier than hearing from their students! When you have the chance to speak in front of a school assembly or other public address, take a moment to remind students to show appreciation for their teachers whenever they can.

If going off-campus for the class isn’t feasible, hire a painting instructor to come to the school for a couple of hours and lead the course.

If you’re a principal or school administrator, the best way to show that you care is by spending time in classrooms and getting face time with teachers. When you’re able, it’s also important to take over classes or duties to give teachers a much-needed break. Choose one teacher a month and let them choose a class or duty for you to take over that month. You can also offer this to teachers who have recently gone above and beyond to do something amazing for their students. [16] X Research source Alternatively, hold a lottery drawing for class or duty coverage at each faculty meeting.

One idea is to ask families to donate any theater or sports tickets that they can’t use. Then, hold a staff lottery to give out the tickets to lucky teachers. Or, you could organize a bimonthly Casserole Night where families donate homemade casseroles or store-bought frozen dishes to be divided up among the teachers."

However, one of the most stressful times of years for teachers in terms of workload is the end of each grading period—which can happen multiple times a year, depending on your school system. Prioritize sending small thank you notes to teachers during these times to recognize all the hard work that your staff is doing."

Do provide pick-me-ups and shows of gratitude throughout the entire year—not just over one week. Don’t buy generic gifts like candles or mugs. While teachers definitely appreciate these gifts, they get a lot of them. If you really want to get your teacher one of these items, try to personalize it to them. Don’t only show appreciation as an incentivization tool. If you’re a principal, for instance, avoid only rewarding the staff when you want them to do something specific for you. Don’t feel like you have to go crazy coming up with some over-the-top gift or event. While effort is always nice, most teachers love nothing more than a sweet card from their students (and maybe a gift card)."
