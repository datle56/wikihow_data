      "title": "Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) is cannabis extract with up to 90% of THC.",
      "content": "Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) is cannabis extract with up to 90% of THC. RSO is extracted from the cannabis plant and cooked in a solvent like grain alcohol to create a potent oil concentrate. It was developed by Canadian Engineer Rick Simpson, who experienced tinnitus and dizzy spells after a work injury. Simpson used medical marijuana against the advice of his doctor and eventually found a study where THC helped kill cancer cells in mice. With this knowledge, he created RSO, claiming it “cured” the cancerous growths on his arm. [1] X Research source While RSO is widely discussed online, little evidence supports Simpson's claim. However, THC may help alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

He claims his concoction has “shown its ability to fight skin cancer lesions when applied topically.” [5] X Research source Through his case studies, researchers found his sources were not credible. Instead, they came from news articles and blogs, and researchers found little evidence to support his claim.

      "content": "RSO uses all the components of a marijuana plant. Unlike other cannabis oils, like CBD or distillate oils with 60% THC, RSO contains very little CBD and up to 90% THC. [7] X Research source While RSO may share similar properties as other oils, the breakdown process is where they differ. Distillate oils remove all of the added elements of a cannabis plant, like the terpenes, until only THC or CBD remains. RSO uses all of the plants to create a potent oil. [8] X Research source Cannabidiol (CBD) oils are found in food, drink, and beauty products. They don’t contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which produces the “high” effect marijuana is known for.

      "content": "Cannabis oils come in full spectrum, broad-spectrum, or isolate. While RSO is technically considered a full-spectrum oil (FSO), its extraction process differs slightly from an FSO's. RSO consists of a certain selection of cannabinoids—typically, users use the indica strain—and extract the THC and CBD at a high temperature to burn off the terpenes and other compounds in the process. [10] X Research source Broad-spectrum oil contains a selection of cannabinoids and compounds but may contain less THC. Isolate, or raw oil, extracts one specific cannabinoid and strips away all others, like CBD."

Mix 1-2 drops of Rick Simpson Oil into a skin cream, medical salve, or directly onto the skin, depending on the alignment you seek to treat. This may be ideal for injuries, wounds, or muscle pain. RSO can be consumed straight from the syringe, in capsule form, or mixed into food or beverages. [11] X Research source For consumption, ensure you use an edible solvent, like food-grade alcohol. Avoid smoking RSO if it's extracted with a flammable solvent. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Rick Simpson’s method is designed to be completed in 90 days. Rick Simpson suggests starting with a slow and small dose when first starting his treatment method. This will help you discover how much the oil affects you and may prevent a green-out. Give it 30 to 60 minutes and see how you feel. Allow your body to relax. Eventually, you’ll build a higher tolerance. [13] X Research source Week 1: Start with a drop half the size of a grain of rice every 8 hours, in the morning, in the afternoon, and one hour before bed. Week 2-5: Double your dose every four days and continue to take it every 8 hours. Week 5-12: Consume 9 drops (1 ml) daily every 8 hours."

[14] X Research source However, due to its high THC content, it’s important to go slowly and start with a low dosage to build up tolerance. If you plan on using RSO, avoid driving or operating machinery.

To make RSO at home , break up large chunks of cannabis with a wooden spoon. Then, pour the solvent of your choice until the plant is completely covered. Stir and crush the cannabis while you add the solvent for about 3 minutes. [18] X Research source You can also use 99% isopropyl alcohol, butane, ethanol, or similar solvents.
