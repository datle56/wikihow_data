      "content": "Use the showers at a shelter when you find yourself staying at one. Most shelters do have shower facilities for their residents. Whether you’re staying somewhere for a single night or for a longer period of time, take advantage of that shower every day if possible. [1] X Research source Some facilities have specific times when you can shower, so make sure to check out the rules so you don’t miss your opportunity."

      "content": "Visit the bathrooms at beaches and use the showers available there. If you live in an area where there are public beaches, there’s a good chance you can access showers there. These are usually public showers, so it’s a good idea to keep your clothes on or wear a swimsuit if you have one. After showering, go to a bathroom stall to change into dry clothes. [2] X Research source After changing into dry clothes, you could lay out your wet clothes to dry if the weather is nice. If not, try to keep them in a plastic bag until you can dry them so they don’t get the rest of your belongings wet."

      "title": "Take advantage of public showers at campgrounds, parks, and rest areas.",
      "content": "Take advantage of public showers at campgrounds, parks, and rest areas. Depending on where you live, you may be able to shower regularly at a state park or local campground. Rest areas that cater to long-haul truckers are also a great option, though you may have to pay a small fee to access their showers. [3] X Research source Try to use the facilities early in the morning or later in the evening for the most privacy."

      "title": "Purchase a gym membership so you can use their shower facilities.",
      "content": "Purchase a gym membership so you can use their shower facilities. Depending on your financial situation and access to transportation, this may or may not work for you. If it does, take advantage of the showers to clean up as often as possible. If possible, choose a 24-hour gym so you can shower late at night and have some privacy. [4] X Research source Some gyms allow you to pay month-by-month while others require you to sign a contract. Depending on the gym, you may have to have a bank account for them to pull out your monthly fee. Some YMCAs will let you shower for free or offer free shower passes to people who are experiencing homelessness."

      "content": "Wash up in public bathrooms with water and wet wipes. If you can’t access an actual shower, using public restrooms is a good alternative. You won’t get as clean, but you’ll be able to freshen up a little on a daily basis. [5] X Research source Gas stations, fast food restaurants, big box stores, and libraries are pretty safe places to try and use their restrooms. Avoid going into upscale restaurants, office buildings, hotel lobbies, banks, or schools. If you do use public restrooms, try to find ones that are single-person. It’ll be much more comfortable for you if there isn’t a chance of someone walking in on you while you’re washing up. If you do choose this option, make sure to dry up any water you may splash on the floor, out of courtesy for any patrons who may come after you. If the floor is excessively wet and there are no paper towels, see an employee before you leave. You do not need to admit that it was you who made the mess, simply that the floor is wet. Reader Poll: We asked 233 wikiHow readers if they shower every day, and 70% of them said Yes. [Take Poll] However, even a shower every few days can help you stay clean and feel better."

Taking care of your dental health is a good way to prevent cavities or gum disease, and it’ll also help you feel a little more confident and clean on a daily basis. If you can, keep a toothbrush and small container of toothpaste with your belongings. [6] X Research source When you use the restroom, take a moment to brush your teeth at least once a day. If you don’t have the chance to use a restroom with running water during the day, use bottled water to wet your toothbrush and clean your teeth that way."

Part of staying clean is having access to basic hygiene products, which can be difficult when you’re dealing with homelessness. Many local shelters and churches offer free supplies to people who can’t afford to buy them. Check out what’s available in your area, or if you have a few dollars, consider buying a few things at a dollar store when you have the chance. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Asking other people where you can get free supplies is a great way to learn what’s available. Others may know of different programs or times of year that certain places run charity drives."

      "content": "Do your best to maintain your hygiene while on your period. It can be really hard to gain access to pads or tampons while dealing with homelessness, especially if you don’t have the funds to go into a store and buy products for yourself. Many shelters and programs are aware of this problem and offer free tampons, pads, and wipes. [11] X Research source If you can’t get pads or tampons, try using folded up toilet paper and changing it as often as possible. Some people use rags or socks and dispose of them once they’ve been used. The important thing is to try to change out the used material as frequently as you can to help prevent infections."
