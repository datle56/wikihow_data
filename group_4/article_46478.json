DisplayPort - Similar to a USB port, but with one crimped corner. Transmits both audio and video. VGA - A blue trapezoid with holes in it. VGA transmits video, but you will need a separate audio cable (such as A/V cables) to transmit sound. Mac HDMI - Found most often on Macs manufactured between 2012 and 2016. Also found on the backs of iMac computers. [1] X Research source Thunderbolt 3 (also known as \"USB-C\") - Found on the sides of modern MacBooks and the backs of iMacs. You can't connect a USB-C cable directly to a TV, but you can buy a USB-C to HDMI adapter. [2] X Research source"

If you are connecting your computer to your TV using HDMI-to-HDMI or DisplayPort-to-HDMI, you don't need any extra cables to send audio to the TV. If you're using a different connection, including something like VGA-to-HDMI, you'll need to use a separate audio cable to send audio from your computer to your TV. Use a standard 3.5mm stereo cable to connect the Audio Out port on your computer to the Audio In port that matches the input you're connected to on the TV. The Audio Out port on your computer is usually green, and may have a symbol indicating that it is sending signal out."
