      "title": "Bring an edge piece and a corresponding corner piece into the top layer.",
      "content": "Bring an edge piece and a corresponding corner piece into the top layer. Just put a corner and edge piece which correspond into the top layer. You should be able to do this easily if you are an intermediate solver. At this stage, there is no need to put them together or reorient anything. Just make sure they are in the top layer."

      "title": "Get the pieces across from each other.",
      "content": "Get the pieces across from each other. If they are together, break them apart, unless they are correctly paired. What you have to do is get them parallel from each other using the directions below. To get a corner and an edge across from each other, find an empty slot and put it behind your corner piece. Then turn the face the corner piece is on down, making sure that it’s the empty slot that gets put into the top layer, not something you’ve solved. Move the edge piece so it is across from the corner piece. More help on this can be found at the bottom of this article. If they are already across from each other, you can skip this step."

      "title": "Determine whether the colors are different or the same.",
      "content": "Determine whether the colors are different or the same. Either the colors facing up on your edge and corner piece will be the same, or different. Or your corner will have white facing up. Determining this is the most important for the next part of F2L."

      "title": "Know what to do if your top colors are matching.",
      "content": "Know what to do if your top colors are matching. For example, if you have a blue and red edge piece and its corner and blue is facing up both times, you have this case. This is one of the hardest to solve, so we will cover it first. Find an empty slot on the Rubik’s cube, and put your corner in front of it. Now turn that face down so that the empty slot comes into the top layer. This is called hiding, and will allow you to hide away your corner piece so that you can move your edge where you will have formed a matching pair after the corner piece comes back up. The hiding process is explained step by step at the bottom of this article."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know what to do if the corner has white facing up.",
      "content": "Know what to do if the corner has white facing up. This is the second case, and you will have to change it to another case by moving your corner. With your corner in the front-left, move the left face up, turn your top layer so both the corner and edge are out of the way, and then bring the left side back down in order to change to one of the other cases in this article."

      "title": "Know what to do if your colors are not matching.",
      "content": "Know what to do if your colors are not matching. This is the easiest case in this step. What you have to do is explained below. Take the corner piece, put it in the front left or front right, then move the left or right face up to join them. Then move the top layer so that the pair is now in line with the face you moved up, and bring it back down. For other cases, inserting the pair is coming in the next step."

      "content": "Don’t mess up because of three F2L pairs solved and inserted. When you get into the next step, you will insert your pair into its slot. But once you are three-quarters of the way done, this is where you can mess up. In order to prevent yourself from ruining the already solved pairs, always make sure the slot behind where you are hiding your corner piece is empty."
