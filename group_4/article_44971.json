In this case, the source of the low water pressure is likely a clogged faucet or aerator. [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Dave Jones Master Plumber, Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Water Cleanup Expert Interview. 29 March 2021. Remove the end of the faucet. Examine your aerator. [5] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Check to make sure there are no debris or buildup. If the aerator needs to be cleaned, soak it in a water-vinegar solution. If that doesn't work, buy a replacement. These are very inexpensive. [6] X Research source Aerators are sold with different rates of water flow, so you can also try buying one with a higher rate of flow. Turn the water on before you replace the aerator. If the water flow is not restored to normal, the source of low water pressure is likely not the specific faucet but an overall problem."

      "title": "Look at the Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV).",
      "content": "Look at the Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV). Shaped like a bell, the PRV is usually located on the line where it enters the home or office. Adjust it to see if it affects your overall water pressure. There will be a screw on the valve. To increase water pressure, tighten it by turning it clockwise. To decrease water pressure, loosen the adjusting screw by turning it counterclockwise. Replacement may be necessary if the valve has failed or broken. These can be purchased at hardware or plumbing supply stores."

[8] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. Most homes and buildings have a master shut-off valve. This is located near the PRV valve or in a separate box near the water meter. This valve can shut off water to the entire home, and restrict flow if it is slightly closed. Turn the valve so it is completely open."

      "content": "Check the toilet in each bathroom. Running or leaking toilets are one of the most common source of water leaks in a home. This can cause very high water bills, so it is a good idea to determine if this is the root cause of a water pressure problem. Start by removing the lid from the tank of the toilet. Put a few drops of food coloring or a dye tablet into the tank. Do not flush the toilet for at least one hour. If color has leaked into the bowl, your toilet has a leak. This can usually be fixed by replacing the toilet flapper or filling mechanism."

      "title": "Check your service meter.",
      "content": "Check your service meter. This can help you determine if you have a service line leak. Locate your service meter. Take a reading of the meter and check to see if the indicator gear is turning. The leak indicator can be a small triangle shaped dial or disk that rotates when water is flowing. If the leak indicator is turning, you likely have a leak. If it is not turning, it does not mean there isn't a leak. A slow leak may not register on the leak indicator. Don't run any water for 2 hours and do another service meter reading. If the numbers have changed you are losing water and have a leak Call your water company or a plumber to help you find the source of a leak and to arrange repairs."
