      "content": "“Over the hill” is a metaphor that means someone is past their “prime.” There’s no set age that defines “over the hill,” but it refers to an age at which someone might be considered past their prime—usually around middle age. [1] X Research source The phrase is a metaphor that refers to the idea of someone climbing a hill—symbolizing youth—and pausing at the top before descending—symbolizing the peak before old age."

      "content": "You're often considered \"over the hill\" around 40 or 50. Since perceptions of your “prime” vary from culture to culture and individual to individual, the exact definition of “over the hill” varies, too. But the phrase is usually used in a tongue-in-cheek way to celebrate someone getting older, especially on or around a milestone birthday like 40 or 50. The phrase essentially describes the age at which a person’s mental and physical abilities begin to decline. While this is often deemed middle age, some people define “over the hill” as being even older—even 60 or 70—since everyone’s health and wellness doesn’t decline at the same rate. Definitions of \"over the hill\" may vary depending on the age of the person saying it: millennials (people born between 1981 and 1996) may consider someone in their 50s \"over the hill,\" while Gen X-ers (1965-1980) and Boomers (1946-1965) may view someone in their 70s as \"over the hill.\""

      "content": "Say someone is “over the hill” to celebrate a milestone middle age birthday. When someone you know—like a parent or grandparent or friend—reaches a milestone birthday that solidifies them as middle age or older (like 40 or 50), congratulate them on being officially “over the hill.” Or even give them a birthday card that says so! While some people might take offense to being referred to as “old,” “over the hill” is typically used in a fun and casual way to acknowledge that someone is beyond their prime and to honor the years they’ve lived. Better over the hill than under it! Congrats, Lisa! You’re officially over the hill this year!"

      "content": "Call yourself “over the hill” when you feel the effects of aging. “Over the hill” is a simple and playful way to explain that you’re not as youthful as you once were, whether you're 40 or 80. Next time someone invites you to do something you feel “too old” for (like staying out all night partying), tell them you’re over the hill. A midnight movie? Fellas, I’m over the hill. My bedtime is 9 p.m. Stay up and watch the sunrise? Ask me again 10 years ago—I’m too over the hill for that!"

Aging doesn’t just mean you’re not as energetic as you used to be—it also means missing out on the jokes and culture of younger generations. Next time a 20-year-old tries to share a meme with you that you don’t get, tell them you’re over the hill. Skibidi what now? Charles, I am over the hill. My nephew says I have something called “rizz.” I told him I’m over the hill and don’t know what that means."

      "content": "“Over the hill” first appeared in England in the mid-1900s. The phrase’s exact origins are uncertain, but it refers to the idea of a climber or skier ascending a hill—symbolizing youth and growth—and pausing at the top before the final descent—symbolizing the decline that inevitably comes with age. [2] X Research source The phrase is a common one, but it's still fairly new, and likely came into use as medical technology advanced and people began to live much longer. In other words, it's a privilege to be \"over the hill,\" as past generations had much shorter lifespans!"

Despite what ads and the media tell us about the latest anti-aging skincare craze or botox or how to get the perfect body “past your prime,” remember that aging isn’t a crime—in fact, it’s unavoidable! Try to ignore anti-aging messaging and embrace the beauty of getting older . Focus on feeling good rather than looking or acting younger, and remember that “age is just a number” at the end of the day. More and more celebrities are joining the aging gracefully revolution, including Pamela Anderson, Jameela Jamil, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who have all spoken out against the pressure to succumb to Hollywood’s unrealistic and unhealthy beauty standards. In fact, research suggests that there’s a link between our perception of aging and our quality of life: people who embrace aging and take it in stride are more likely to stay healthy longer, while those with negative perceptions of aging are more susceptible to illness and poor health.
