      "content": "Gather the necessary building materials. In order to craft a hopper, you will need the following items: 5 iron ore - Iron ore is grey rock with orange/peach spots on it, most commonly found in caves or cliff faces. You will need at least a stone pickaxe to mine iron. 2 wood blocks - Chop two blocks of literally any wood from a tree in Minecraft. This will yield eight wooden planks, which will allow you to make one chest. A fuel source - You can use coal, which is found by mining the grey rock with black spots on it, or you can use wood planks. A furnace - Furnaces are crafted using eight blocks of cobblestone around the border of a crafting table. A crafting table - Crafting tables are created using a two-by-two grid of wood planks in your inventory's \"Crafting\" section."
