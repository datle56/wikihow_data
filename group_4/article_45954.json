      "title": "Measure out your ingredients.",
      "content": "Measure out your ingredients. Each substitution is a little different; make sure you know what kind of chocolate your recipe needs. For the record, bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate can be used interchangeably. As they are pretty much the same, only different names. If you're trying to substitute for chocolate chips, you may be fighting an uphill battle. It won't taste the same as you're envisioning, but it is technically possible. To work backwards, a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips is 2 cups. 1 oz of baking chocolate is usually 1 or 2 squares. If using butter or margarine, soften it before beginning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try substituting for unsweetened baking chocolate.",
      "content": "Try substituting for unsweetened baking chocolate. Combine 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) cocoa powder with 1 tablespoon of butter, margarine or vegetable oil. Mix it up until it's a uniform consistency. This will make the equivalent of 1 ounce of unsweetened baking chocolate. [1] X Research source This is to make un sweetened baking chocolate. If you're using sweetened cocoa, the taste will not be the same; it'll be much, much sweeter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Substitute semisweet chocolate.",
      "content": "Substitute semisweet chocolate. Combine 1 tablespoon cocoa, 3 1/2 tsp sugar, and 2 tsp shortening (butter, margarine, or vegetable oil work, too), mixing well. This will make the equivalent of 1 ounce of semisweet chocolate. You could try it instead of chocolate chips, but it will more like a semi-sweet chocolate cookie than anything. This recipe works for bittersweet chocolate, too."

    {
      "title": "Use cocoa to substitute for sweet baking chocolate as an alternative.",
      "content": "Use cocoa to substitute for sweet baking chocolate as an alternative. Combine 4 tsp sugar, 3 tbsp cocoa, and 1 tbsp vegetable shortening. This will make the equivalent of 1 ounce of sweet baking chocolate when mixed up well. Again, be wary of using this in a chocolate chip cookie as this is not in chip form."

    {
      "title": "Mix it in with the liquid already in the recipe.",
      "content": "Mix it in with the liquid already in the recipe. If you're unsure of what to do with your cocoa-sugar-shortening mixture, just add it into your bowl full of wet ingredients. It'll mix right in, no harm, no foul. It can also work drizzled on top and then put into the oven. It's best to avoid using it as a dipping sauce, however."

      "title": "Make a chocolate ganache",
      "content": "Make a chocolate ganache . Who knew that such a fancy word like \"ganache\" was really just chocolate and cream? Don't be fooled; this is not an intimidating recipe. For this one, you'll need to multiply the above by 12 (to get 12 ounces of chocolate). Just remember that there are 3 teaspoons per every tablespoon; that's just about all the math there is."

      "title": "Make chocolate whipped cream",
      "content": "Make chocolate whipped cream . If you're skeptical of substituting out chocolate for cocoa in an actual recipe, why not try it in your topping? That way your dessert won't be compromised if it all turns out less than desirable. And, really, how bad can chocolate whipped cream be, cocoa or not? The best thing about this substitution is that cocoa is already in powder form; no need to bust out the food processor; it's already done for you."

      "title": "Make chocolate frosting",
      "content": "Make chocolate frosting . Alright, so this recipe doesn't require chocolate per se ; it actually just requires cocoa from the get-go. But it's an easy recipe to see that cocoa is delicious and you don't need chocolate to make something adequately chocolate-y and convincing. The article above has four different varieties of chocolate. There's even a dairy-free version (which cocoa totally is). Score."

      "content": "Make vegan chocolate frosting . Alright, so dairy-free wasn't enough? You want a chocolate frosting that's healthier, too? Challenge accepted with this recipe. Grapeseed oil and agave nectar instead of vegetable oil or sugar, and dark chocolate instead of regular chocolate. And yes, dark chocolate cocoa powder is a thing. Cocoa is great to use for most diets. It's practically no-carb and dairy free â€“ what's not to like?"
