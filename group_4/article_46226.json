      "title": "Follow the instructions for assembly.",
      "content": "Follow the instructions for assembly. If you haven’t done so yet, your blender needs to be assembled before use. Consult the instructions that came with the package for instructions that are specific to your Ninja model. Typically, you will need to attach the pitcher to the base and then place the stacked blade assembly onto the shaft."

      "content": "Plug in the Ninja Blender. Your blender will not work unless it is plugged in. Find the cord and plug it into a socket in your kitchen. Make sure that it can not be easily unplugged in its location."

      "content": "Open up the lid. Look for a rectangular button on top of the lid. This button should say “release.” Press the button to open up and remove the lid. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your ingredients.",
      "content": "Add your ingredients. Fruits and vegetables are ideal to use in the blender. You can create any combination of ingredients that are tasty to you. If you are using a fruit such as a banana or orange, make sure to peel it before putting it in the blender. Most fruits and vegetables don’t necessarily have to be chopped up unless they are too large to fit in the blender, but chopping them up first helps to measure out portions. Make sure the lid is locked down before you choose a setting. You should not, however, use any hot ingredients in the blender. You can put cubes of ice or frozen fruit in the blender, but they may dull the blades. Let fruit thaw out for a few minutes before adding it to the blender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose a setting.",
      "content": "Choose a setting. You can choose the Pulse setting for chopping and processing. Or, you can choose speed 1, 2, or 3. Speed 1 mixes, speed 2 blends, and speed 3 chops ice. Hold down the button to activate the blender. Hold it down until you’re satisfied with the consistency of your ingredients. The Pulse setting means that the blender will work at its fastest speed, but it will stop blending when you release the button for the Pulse setting."

    {
      "title": "Use the single serve option.",
      "content": "Use the single serve option. Some Ninja models have a single serve option. The single serve option means that it will produce enough just for one serving of whatever you wish to make. If yours does, remove the pitcher and insert the cup. Then, add your ingredients. Press the single serve option to blend."

      "title": "Rinse off the lids and blades under hot water.",
      "content": "Rinse off the lids and blades under hot water. Food can get stuck in the lids and blades over time, which will cause mold. Rinse off the lids and blade assembly under hot water after every use. Be extra cautious when handling the blades. They are very sharp."

      "title": "Wash out the pitcher by hand.",
      "content": "Wash out the pitcher by hand. Use hot water and mild dish soap to clean out the pitcher and/or cups. Use a sponge to scrub off any food particles. Then, rinse off the soap residue with warm water."

    {
      "title": "Use the dishwasher.",
      "content": "Use the dishwasher. Although it’s recommended to wash your blender by hand, the pitcher, cups, lids, and blade assemblies are safe for dishwasher use. Put the blades and lids on the top rack of your dishwasher. It does not matter where you put the pitcher or cups. The cups, lids, and blade assemblies are dishwasher safe, but it is recommended to wash them by hand because this is the gentlest method of cleaning."

To fix this problem, first check to see if the lid is locked. The blender will not work unless it is closed and locked. The blender is not locked until it has been pushed all the way down on the container. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure the white arrows on your blender are aligned.",
      "content": "Make sure the white arrows on your blender are aligned. If the lid is locked, but the red light is still blinking, look at the arrows on your blender. There should be a white arrow on the lid and handle. These arrows need to be aligned for the blender to work. Move the lid until the white arrow on the lid aligns with the arrow on the handle. Then, check to see if the red light has stopped blinking. If it has, you can use the blender. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fit the pitcher on the base of the blender.",
      "content": "Fit the pitcher on the base of the blender. Another potential reason for a blinking red light is if the pitcher is not properly aligned on the base. If it has been aligned correctly, it should be able to rotate. The pitcher will not easily rotate if it has not been placed properly on the base. Remove the pitcher and place it back on the base again to check if this is the problem. [5] X Research source If the red light still does not go away, call Ninja Blender customer service for advice."
