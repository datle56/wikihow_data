      "content": "Don't pay a third-party service to unlock your phone. While many providers used to make unlocking mobile phones so difficult that users resorted to paying third-party services, it's now extremely rare that a carrier will refuse to unlock your phone as long as your contract is fulfilled. If your contract is not fulfilled or your account is not in good standing, it's very unlikely that a third-party unlocking service can unlock your phone—even if you pay them money to do so. If they do manage to unlock your phone, your IMEI may be blacklisted, which will make your phone unusable on any network."

Contact your carrier to find out how long you must use the phone on their network before you can unlock it.

Before terminating your service with your current provider, make sure you've settled on a provider that supports your phone. Many carriers offer a \"Bring Your Own Device\" feature on their websites. You can use this feature to enter your IMEI, which can tell you if you can bring your unlocked device to their service. If the carrier you're interested in doesn't have an online BYOD feature, just give them a call. They'll ask for your IMEI to confirm eligibility. In most cases, you'll be able to port your current phone number to your new phone upon transferring to a new mobile provider."
