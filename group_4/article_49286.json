    {
      "title": "Address the guest.",
      "content": "Address the guest. Open your thank you note with a friendly greeting to whoever you’re writing to. Make sure to include all the names of those who gave you the gift. Address the guest(s) in whatever way feels best. For instance, you may address a card to your brother and his girlfriend with only first names, while you address your elderly neighbors as Mr. and Mrs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say thank you.",
      "content": "Say thank you. Begin the bulk of your message with “Thank you for…” There’s no need to get too fancy. Simply put your gratitude into words. [1] X Research source For example, you might write, “Thank you so much for…” or “We greatly appreciate the gift—thank you!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Name the gift.",
      "content": "Name the gift. Make sure you state what you were given in your message. Typically, you can do this right after saying thank you. This way, the guest(s) can recall what they gave you. [2] X Research source You could write something like, “Thank you so much for the toaster oven,” or “We greatly appreciate the embroidered towels.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Say something about the gift.",
      "content": "Say something about the gift. Add a bit of personal flare to your thank you card by explaining what you’ll use the gift for. This is an excellent way to express gratitude and make the gift-giver(s) feel special. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, “Thank you so much for the toaster oven. We can’t wait to set it up in our new home!” or “We greatly appreciate the embroidered towels. I’ve always dreamed of having a fancy set to lay out when guests are over.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "End with an appreciative sign-off.",
      "content": "End with an appreciative sign-off. Close the letter with another “thank you” and a warm goodbye. Keep it short and sweet, and make sure your closing matches your relationship with the guest(s). [4] X Research source For instance, you may say, “Thanks again! See you soon!” if you’re writing to a sibling you see often, but you could write, “Thank you again for thinking of us! Sending you the best,” to a neighbor or distant relative."
    },
    {
      "title": "Handwrite your cards.",
      "content": "Handwrite your cards. While typing up a thank you card may be easier and quicker, a handwritten note shows that you put in an effort. A digital or typed card can come across as impersonal, so add that extra loving touch by handwriting all your cards. [5] X Research source Know that it’s okay if you can’t physically handwrite your cards. Do what’s best for you and your abilities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include all contributing names in the card.",
      "content": "Include all contributing names in the card. Put all the names of the gifters on the card if there’s more than one. While the exterior of the card can be addressed to a “family,” make sure to write out every family member’s name on the inside. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mail your thank-you notes within 3 months.",
      "content": "Mail your thank-you notes within 3 months. Aim to send out your wedding thank you cards within 3 months of the wedding. The sooner, the better, so plan on getting the cards ready after your honeymoon. If you receive gifts before the wedding, aim to send out thank you cards 2 weeks before the big day."

    {
      "title": "Do prepare everything in advance.",
      "content": "Do prepare everything in advance. Have your stationery ready to go even before the wedding. This way, you can find something you love that matches your theme. Plus, this ensures you won’t be scrambling to piece everything together at the last minute. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Do work in batches.",
      "content": "Do work in batches. There’s no need to get every card done at once! Set yourself a goal to work on a handful of cards each night. This way, you won’t feel overwhelmed. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Do keep detailed notes.",
      "content": "Do keep detailed notes. The more organized you are, the easier writing the cards will be. When you and your partner open presents, keep a list of who gave you what. Make sure this list is in a safe place to reference later, like your phone or on your desk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t mention monetary values.",
      "content": "Don’t mention monetary values. If you were gifted money for your special day, avoid mentioning in your note how much you were given. This can come across as braggy. Instead, do mention how you’ll use the money instead. Maybe you plan on taking a fun trip with your spouse or making a down payment on a home. There’s some controversy about this within the wedding community. Some experts recommend avoiding a sum in your thank you card, while others suggest including it. Do whatever feels right to you."

    {
      "title": "Don’t forget those who helped you plan.",
      "content": "Don’t forget those who helped you plan. Wedding thank you cards don’t have to be just for those who sent you presents! Send your wedding planner, photographer, and/or caterer a card. If someone helped you on your special day, send them a token of your appreciation. Also, send thank-you notes to guests who attended the ceremony and/or reception, even if they didn't get you a gift."

      "title": "Don’t do it alone.",
      "content": "Don’t do it alone. Who says thank you card writing is a one-person job? Ask your spouse, friends, or family members to help you get the job done. You and your spouse can write the cards, and your friends and family can help you organize and mail everything out. [9] X Research source"
