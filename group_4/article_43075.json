You and her could end up liking the same thing, and not even have had the slightest clue because she's been hiding it so well. If you don't talk often, try and get her to initiate conversation. Hang out with her and her friends, sit next to her at class, and put yourself in a place to chat.

You might write down a few lines, get together a quick \"practice line,\" or rehearse the conversation in the mirror. \"I think you're great, and would love a chance to get to know you more.\" \"I really enjoy our friendship, and I was hoping we could go on a date or two to see where things go.\" \"Let's go out on a date sometime.\""

      "content": "Don't rely too much on canned lines. Preparation aside, you have to be ready to improvise when the actual conversation starts. This can be difficult if you are naturally shy, so don't try and overdo it. Say what you want to say quickly, then let her talk from there. Your response doesn't have to be planned, and it will come off more naturally if it is not."

Pick a spot that you know well to ease any nervousness or talkative. Good spots generally have few people, are quiet, and are easy to get to naturally. Don't make a big spectacle by asking her to follow you to a romantic spot. A quiet hallway or corner after school is just as good a spot to talk about your feelings as any other.

Keep it short and to the point. \"I really like you, and I'd love to go out on a date sometime,\" is all you need to say. Some tricks to get it all out include: Count to 3 in your head-- when you get to zero, you have to say it. Avoid chit-chatting beforehand. Say hello, ask how she is doing, then launch right in."
