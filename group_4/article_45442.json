      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the meaning of \"debit\" and \"credit.\" In bookkeeping, the words \"debit\" and \"credit\" have very distinct meanings and a close relationship. [2] X Research source Debits and credits balance each other out —if a debit is added to one account, then a credit must be added to the an opposite account. Two related terms are \"equity\" and \"liability.\" Equity is what is left over after subtracting all assets, and liability is how much is owed to other parties. [3] X Expert Source Ara Oghoorian, CPA Certified Financial Planner & Accountant Expert Interview. 11 March 2020. In accounting, the debit column is on the left of an accounting entry, while credits are on the right. [4] X Research source Debits increase asset or expense accounts and decrease liability or equity. Credits do the opposite — decrease assets and expenses and increase liability and equity. [5] X Research source To make sense of this, take a look at the basic accounting equation, which is Assets = Equity + Liabilities. Assets are paid for by equity and/or liability —you cannot have one without the other. [6] X Research source So if you complete a transaction that increases assets (and you debit the asset account), you must also increase the equity or liability (by crediting the equity or liability account) so that Assets remain equal to Equity and/or Liability.

Generally, these types of accounts are increased with a debit: Dividends, Expenses, Assets, Losses (DEAL). [8] X Research source Generally, these types of accounts are increased with a credit: Gains, Income, Revenues, Liabilities, Stockholders' Equity (GIRLS). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Remember that the books must be kept in balance. Remember that if you debit one account, you're going to need to credit the opposite account. [10] X Research source Whenever there is an accounting transaction, at least two accounts will always be impacted. [11] X Research source The total amount of debits in a single transaction must equal the total amount of credits. [12] X Research source For example, if you pay down your Accounts Payable account (a liability) with $20,000 in cash (an asset), you'll need to adjust both accounts. In that case, you'll credit Cash for $20,000. That will reduce your cash amount by $20,000. To keep your books in balance, you'll need to debit Accounts Payable by $20,000. That will likewise reduce your Accounts Payable amount by $20,000."

      "title": "Consider what is being exchanged when entering a transaction.",
      "content": "Consider what is being exchanged when entering a transaction. Whenever a transaction occurs, something is being exchanged for something else. For example: Does the transaction change the amount of cash, the amount of receivables, the inventory value, or add to an expense? Suppose the company in our example has subsequently sold on credit $4,000, which cost it $2,800, and incurred various expenses totaling $500 paid in cash. So this transaction impacted the following accounts: Accounts Receivables, Inventory, Cash, and Surplus (for simplicity, all all profit and loss as credit or debit will be logged in the Surplus account). If the transaction increases a debit account, record a debit entry in that debit account, and simultaneously a credit entry in an appropriate credit account. Continuing with our example, you would debit Accounts Receivables $4,000, then credit Surplus with a corresponding $4,000. If the transaction decreases a debit account, record a credit entry in that debit account, and simultaneously a debit entry in an appropriate credit account. The cost of goods sold of $2,800 decreases the inventory, and is therefore a credit entry. It will have a corresponding $2,800 debit entry from Surplus. The $500 expenses paid in cash decreases the debit account Cash, so you would enter $500 credit in the Cash account. It will have a corresponding $500 debit entry from Surplus."
