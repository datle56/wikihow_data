      "title": "Take in-person Korean language courses.",
      "content": "Take in-person Korean language courses. Before you start studying, you’ll have to learn the foundations of the Korean language. The best way to do this is by taking Korean language or writing courses. You may be able to take classes at a local college or community center. Search online for Korean classes close to you and register before the deadline. [2] X Research source If you are learning for the first time, you should pick basic or introductory classes."

      "content": "Learn the letters in Hangeul. Hangeul has 24 letters, or jamo, with 10 vowels and 14 consonants. Before you can move onto more complex words and phrases, you must memorize the Hangeul alphabet. For example, to write the word \"Hangeul,\" you must know all of the letters. These include ᄒ for h,ᅡ for a, ᄂ for n, ᄀ for g, ᅳ for e and u, and ᄅ for l. The final word looks like 한글. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn common Korean phrases. Knowing common phrases will help you communicate if you are visiting Korea and don’t know the language fluently. Learning common phrases like “Hello, how are you?” and “What time is it?” will help you survive if you're in a mostly Korean speaking place. [5] X Research source For instance, to say “Hello” or “Goodbye” you’d say \"Anyoung haseyo\" (AN-NYEONG-ha-se-yo). The spelling in Hangeul is 안녕하세요. To ask for the time you can say \"Jigeum myeoshiyeyo?\" (SE-GOON-moi-shia) It's written like \"지금 몇시에요?\" Learn how to count to 10 so that you know how to write and say numbers."

      "title": "Study Korean sentence structure.",
      "content": "Study Korean sentence structure. The basic Korean sentence structure is the subject first, then object, then verb. For example, instead of writing or saying “I rode the horse,” you would say \"I horse rode.” Each Korean sentence must end in either an adjective or verb. For example, to say “I am a student,” you’d say “I student” followed by the verb “to be.” It's written like 저는 학생이에요 and you pronounced, Jeoneun haksaengiyeyo."

      "title": "Keep detailed notes as you learn.",
      "content": "Keep detailed notes as you learn. As you go through Korean lessons, write down notes so that you can study after instruction. Notes can include important details, grammar rules, and pronunciations of certain words. Actively writing while you learn will help you retain Korean and will also give you more material to review when you study it. [6] X Research source Concentrate on words and phrases that you have trouble remembering or pronouncing. Good notes will include the pronunciations next to your Korean words."

      "title": "Record and listen to yourself.",
      "content": "Record and listen to yourself. How you sound in your head may be different than how you actually sound to other people. Recording your own voice while you practice will help you refine your Korean speaking skills. Listen to your recording along with the proper Korean pronunciation and see where you make mistakes. Try to go back and pronounce the word or phrase properly. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Create and follow a study schedule. In order to grow your Korean reading and writing skills, you’ll have to practice regularly. Carve out at least an hour or more every day around the same time to practice your Korean. Break each study section into parts so that you don’t feel overwhelmed. If you stay on a regimented schedule, you’ll be able to develop your skills much faster. For example, you can schedule 20 minutes to learn new Korean words, 20 minutes on translating Korean to English, and 20 minutes reading a Korean book."

      "title": "Save difficult portions for later on in your studies.",
      "content": "Save difficult portions for later on in your studies. Korean has honorifics, which means that there are different words you should say depending on who you’re speaking to. There are also specific conjugations for past, present, and future tense. Instead of concentrating on these aspects of the language, save them for after you become more accustomed to Korean words and phrases. Honorifics are determined by the age of the person you’re talking with and the type of relationship that you have with them."
