      "content": "Head to a bar or restaurant and let a man approach you. Bars are some of the best places to meet single men. Plus, having a few drinks can help everyone loosen up and shed some of the anxiety that comes with meeting new people. Matchmaker Christina Jay says, “Sometimes you're best off just going by yourself and having a meal by yourself at the bar.” Let someone approach you. You’re more likely to be approached alone than in a group. Event specialist Kevin Wang (from Amiccio, a social events organization) says that the most important thing when meeting new people is to take initiative and put yourself out there when you can. Wang says that if you’re in a major city, meet people at bars, parks, concerts, yoga classes, and other social events, as it’s easier for everyone to be open and put themselves out there. To attract someone at the bar, drop hints. Jay says being direct is the best approach for telling someone you like them. According to Jay, “Subtle hints, like giving them compliments here and there, can be more than enough for them to know that you're interested.”"

      "content": "Concerts help you find men who like the same music as you. Concerts and live music are a great way to meet men you share interests with. Plus, concerts are already social events. Whether you’re into hip-hop, pop, techno, rock, or another genre, there’s typically a concert or music gig going on somewhere near you. So, grab some tickets and head to a local venue. If you’re enjoying the music and notice a guy enjoying it just as much, approach him and ask to dance. [1] X Research source From there, start a conversation and see if they’d like to see you sometime after the show."

      "content": "When a guy catches your eye at the gym, introduce yourself. If you take your fitness seriously, meeting guys at the gym is a great way to find someone who takes their fitness just as seriously as you. If you notice a guy always comes to the gym at the same time as you and consistently does the same workouts, slowly introduce yourself. Start with eye contact and a smile in between workouts, then say hey to him a few days later. If he’s receptive, find an excuse to talk to him. [2] X Research source Ask him to spot you or help with a workout, then make conversation while you exercise together. Jay says that joining a gym or doing other active activities you enjoy can help you meet men."

      "content": "Join a running group or boxing class to meet new guys. If you love to get your run on or like to blow off steam with boxing or karate classes, join a fitness group! You’ll get the opportunity to consistently see the same people (which is rare, especially as you get older), take on new challenges and obstacles together, and stay fit all at the same time! Don’t be shy, either. Some casual competition can help break the ice and introduce you to your future partner. [3] X Research source If you’re getting ready for a race, look at the guy you’re interested in and say something like “Let’s see you try to beat me!” to playfully tease him. Wang says that being active, finding hobbies, and going to social events can help you meet new people. Find common ground through interests and activities to help solidify new bonds."

      "content": "Find someone who’s into the same sport as you. Whether you’re a basketball player or a volleyball fanatic, going to sports meet-ups lets you meet like-minded people. For example, if you’re into tennis and looking for a guy who’s interested in it, too, matchmaker Abby Rosenblum suggests attending a tennis meetup. You’ll meet people with common interests and get the opportunity to build bonds with them, whether it be friendships, relationships, or something deeper. Even if the first guy you meet doesn’t turn out to be the right match, at least you have a new teammate!"

Check out Facebook and join groups related to your hobbies to see if they have any meetups in your area. Alternatively, sign up for an online service like Meetup and join hobby-related groups in your area. Many of them have regular in-person meetups where you just might meet your next partner. [4] X Research source If you enjoy yoga or other mindful activities, join a yoga or pilates class. If you’re in your thirties, Wang suggests trying to meet people through your hobbies, especially if they’re social in nature. Wang also suggests joining dance classes, running clubs, and book clubs if you’re looking to meet new men."

When you meet a man at church, the odds are already in your favor, as you know you have shared values. Shared values are a part of the foundation for a strong and happy relationship. If you’re nervous, talk to your pastor, priest, or minister and ask for advice. They’ll likely be happy to help! [5] X Research source"

Although a wedding is dedicated to celebrating the loving union of two long-lasting partners, it’s also full of single people who are friends or family to the bride or groom. So, don’t be afraid to shoot your shot! Try to look your best and, if you’re close to the bride or groom, ask them what single friends are going to be at the wedding. They can help you find the right guy and set you up for the same love they’re experiencing. [6] X Research source Try to be respectful when you’re looking to meet new people.

Plenty of guys are into people who read, and even though bookstores aren’t as common as they once were, plenty of them still frequent. If you’re into reading, take a trip to your local bookstore and set up there. Meeting someone at a bookstore already tells you that you have a common interest (books), so that’s a good start! Post up on the couch, grab a coffee and a good book, and leave room for a guy to sit next to you! [8] X Research source If a guy sits next to you, introduce yourself and talk about what you’re reading. Ask what he’s reading too, and if you sense that he’s interested in you, try to get his number ."

If you’re looking to meet new men in an area that’s low stakes, head to your local cafe. If you notice a sitting by themselves, ask if you can sit with them and strike up a conversation. If they’re receptive, continue the conversation and ask for their number to see them again. [9] X Research source If a guy is working, it’s best to approach them when they seem less busy. They may be on the clock or too busy with work to hold a conversation."

Cooking classes are hands-on, language classes are great ways to stimulate your brain, and art classes help you express your creativity. If you want to meet a single guy who’s also learning new things and interested in expanding his mind, sign up for a class.

Let your dogs introduce themselves to each other, and while they do, introduce yourself to the owner. If he ends up being taken, that’s okay! If not, suggest a play date or a friendly joint walk between the dogs. Then, get to know him and see where things go! [11] X Research source This only works if you have a dog. Going to a dog park without a dog may cause people to wonder what you’re doing there."
