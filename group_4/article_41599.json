Space out 2 pegs at approximately the same length as the Nerf gun and hang the gun over the pegs, repeating this process for each Nerf gun. Using pegboards is the most popular way to store Nerf guns. If you have other play weapons, like swords or lightsabers, hang them up on the pegboard for better organization."

Choose a shoe organizer with pockets approximately the same width as your Nerf guns to make sure they will fit in the spaces. You can also designate a pocket to Nerf darts to keep them organized and off of the floor."
