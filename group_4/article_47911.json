      "content": "This dream represents abandoning something you’ve put work into. In our dreams, buildings are often representatives of the structures we’ve built up for ourselves: our career and personal projects, our relationships, our skills. If you’re dreaming of falling out of a building, you may be thinking of moving on from some of these projects. If you feel anxiety during this dream, this may indicate that you aren’t ready to leave behind these things you’ve put work into in the past. On the flip-side, if you feel oddly calm about falling out of a building, you may be ready to move on with your life. Reader Poll: We asked 133 wikiHow readers what they find most effective for dealing with nightmares, and 51% of them said I talk about them with friends or family to process my feelings. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "This dream means that a big change is in the works. This kind of dream is a particularly dramatic and vivid one—it’s hard to think of a more arresting view than one from miles above the ground. With this dream, you know you’re heading somewhere fast, and that exciting changes are afoot. [1] X Research source The speed of your descent can indicate how you’re approaching this change in your life. If you’re falling slowly, you’re likely approaching this life shift in a prudent and careful way. If you’re falling really fast, you may be feeling rushed into this big change."

      "title": "This dream indicates that you’re feeling overwhelmed and a lack of control.",
      "content": "This dream indicates that you’re feeling overwhelmed and a lack of control. In this dream, you can no longer hang onto the stability and security of hard land, and are forced into a free-fall with nothing to hold onto. You may be feeling anxiety and a lack of agency in your life. [2] X Research source If you’ve been feeling overwhelmed take a deep breath and try to come up with a plan to get yourself to a more sustainable life rhythm.

      "title": "Having this dream signifies that you’re feeling unsupported.",
      "content": "Having this dream signifies that you’re feeling unsupported. Here, you’ve ended up falling because that which you’re supposed to be able to rely on has suddenly abandoned you. You may be feeling a similar sense of abandonment in your personal relationships. [3] X Research source If you come from a religious background, this dream may also be a metaphor for a “fall from grace.” You may be feeling guilt over some of your previous actions."

      "title": "This dream represents anxiety over losing status.",
      "content": "This dream represents anxiety over losing status. In dreams, vehicles and forms of transportation that we’re in are often extensions of ourselves. With this dream, your subconscious might be reenacting a fear you have over having made it far in your journey for success, only to lose it suddenly. [4] X Research source Depending on the details of your own life, this dream could also indicate anxiety over finances. If you are an investor, for example, you may be anxious over a bad bet."

      "title": "In dreams, water is a powerful sign of our repressed emotions.",
      "content": "In dreams, water is a powerful sign of our repressed emotions. If you’re dreaming of falling into water, you may be at a moment in your life where you’re about to make yourself more emotionally vulnerable to others. You may have grown up having to hide your true self and desires from other people, but are now ready to embrace your fullest self. Sigmund Freud, one of the most important figures in the study of dream interpretation, viewed water in dreams as representing our deepest and hidden selves."

      "title": "This dream indicates you’re moving past your comfort zone.",
      "content": "This dream indicates you’re moving past your comfort zone. If you know the person pushing you, this could be an indication that they’re forcing you to act in a way that you normally wouldn’t, for good or for bad. This could also indicate that you’re in a “people-pleasing” mentality and are looking to assert yourself . [5] X Research source If you don’t know who is pushing you, this may be the hidden or “shadow” side of your personality asking you to expand your boundaries."

      "title": "This position at the end of your fall indicates you need help from others.",
      "content": "This position at the end of your fall indicates you need help from others. Your subconscious is asking for there to be other people to catch you when you fall. This might mean that you’ve been feeling unsupported, or you simply haven’t gotten around to asking others for the help you need. This kind of help can take a lot of forms: this dream might be about seeking support from colleagues, classmates, romantic partner, family, or friends."

    {
      "title": "This dream indicates you need help giving others support.",
      "content": "This dream indicates you need help giving others support. Our hands are symbolic representatives of our capacity to help others in need. If you’ve landed on your hands in a dream, this is an indication that you might not feel capable giving others the support that you want to. [6] X Research source In moments like this, it’s a good idea to cultivate a larger social support network. Who else can you reach out to in order to make a difference in the lives of people you care about?"

      "title": "This dream demonstrates a fear of losing someone.",
      "content": "This dream demonstrates a fear of losing someone. If you’ve dreamed about some close to you falling, you may be feeling anxiety about their health, safety, or current life circumstances. This is your subconscious working on an empathetic level, showing concern for the people in your life. So, check-in with the person who you’re dreaming about, if only just to say hi. [7] X Research source This dream could also indicate that you have a fear of losing your relationship to this person. Whether you’re concerned about their welfare or about your relationship, open communication is key."

      "title": "Dreams about tripping, especially in front of others, indicate social anxiety.",
      "content": "Dreams about tripping, especially in front of others, indicate social anxiety. If you’re experiencing a dream of tripping or slipping, your subconscious may be playing through a repressed fear of embarrassing yourself in front of others. You may be worried about losing face in front of people whose respect you want. [8] X Research source This dream may not be quite so literal. You might be less worried about tripping at a party than you are about, say, an upcoming presentation."

    {
      "title": "This dream shows your closeness to someone else.",
      "content": "This dream shows your closeness to someone else. With a dream like this, your subconscious is letting you know that you see the person you’re tripping with as someone who can be there for you in good and bad times. This dream is a special indication of the role this person plays in your life. [9] X Research source If you’re tripping with a romantic partner, this dream is a sign that you’re in it for the long haul. Things will work out well between you two because you feel that you can support one another."

      "content": "This dream demonstrates resilience. If your dream involves a fall, but also you picking yourself up from the ground, it indicates that you have a sense of inner courage and a willingness to grow from your mistakes and hardships.
