This helps the person learn how to handle the needs or difficult emotions that triggered the behavior. Acting out is usually a sign that someone doesn't know how to handle their emotions. The best way to handle this isn't to enforce an immediate punishment, but to help the person label the feeling, cope, and find a constructive way to take action. [46] X Research source For example, if a little girl cries when her crayon breaks, a bad therapist might try to control her behavior and make her stop crying. A good therapist might show empathy, help her find words to describe how she's feeling, and then show her what she can do (like asking an adult to help her tape the crayon back together)."

In extreme cases, bad therapists have tried to train children to overcome medical conditions outside the child's control.
