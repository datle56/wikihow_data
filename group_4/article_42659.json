      "content": "The meme shows the “proper” way for tall people to communicate with short people. The original “how to talk to short people” meme is based off of a comic strip showing 2 figures—one tall, one short—speaking to each other in 2 different ways. In the first image, the figures are facing each other and standing at their normal heights with “Yes” printed between them. In the next image, the taller figure is squatting down and making a condescending face with “Leave” printed (meaning this is not the right way). [1] X Research source The original meme’s purpose was to call out tall people for slouching or squatting down to talk to shorter people, which can feel patronizing or condescending to short folks (hence the “Leave” part). You can view an image of the original meme on KnowYourMeme.com here ."

      "content": "The original comic strip debuted on Tumblr in 2014. Before it became prime meme material, “How to Talk to Short People” was a simple comic strip showing the dislike short people have for the ways taller folks bend or crouch down to speak to them. [2] X Research source The post was uploaded by user the-grin-reaper in March of 2014 and received over 234,700 notes within 6 years. The comic was instantly popular and inspired some imitations (like this one illustrated in the Chibi animation style and posted to Rebloggy) within the same year. Not all imitations were so wholesome, though. This variation that first appeared on a Russian website shows the same images but with reversed “Yes” and “Leave” text that mocks short people."

      "content": "By 2017, the comic had blown up and become a popular meme. After a few years of circulation, people began making their own memes about short and tall people to suit their own sense of humor. This is called an “exploitable” meme template—AKA, a meme where the original image or text can be manipulated or replaced to put a new spin on the joke. [3] X Research source Most of these variations show comically ridiculous or violent ways for the figures to get on eye level with each other, usually at the short person’s expense (but not always). One of the first popular variations was this one , where the taller person is holding the short person up by the throat to bring them to eye level. In another example here , the tall person is lifting the short person up with a crane. The short person isn’t the only one who always has to “suffer.” In this meme from Imgur, the short person is forcing the tall person to sit down at gunpoint. Keep in mind that encouraging violence against short people is not the point of the meme. These variations explore creatively absurd ways to match height for fun."

      "content": "“How to talk to short people” is still a popular joke today. While the memes may not be circulating online as much as they used to, the idea of communicating across big height differences is still ripe for humor. For example: This YouTube video from 2024 by the creator Cherdleys shows a comical tutorial about how to talk to a short person (and shows the short person’s outraged response). Standup comedian Drew Lynch has a whole bit on how tall people speak to shorter people and the word choice they use. You can watch it on YouTube here ."

      "title": "Stand slightly farther apart so no one’s head is angled up or down to talk.",
      "content": "Stand slightly farther apart so no one’s head is angled up or down to talk. If a tall and short person are standing too close, the tall person has to literally “look down on” the short person, while the short person has to crane their head upward to be heard. This can be physically uncomfortable for both people and feel condescending to the shorter person. So, next time you’re struggling to hear a shorter person, take a step or two back so both of your faces are at a comfortable, more natural angle. Constantly bending down or slouching can also negatively impact a tall person’s posture, so this solution is beneficial for both people."

      "content": "Sit down together if possible. Most chairs are around the same height, so sitting down is a great way to put both people on fairly equal footing. This is especially nice for folks who can’t stand up to their full height because of an injury, being in a wheelchair, or other reasons that make it difficult to stand."

      "title": "Get down to eye level when you’re talking with children.",
      "content": "Get down to eye level when you’re talking with children . This is the one time when it’s not condescending to crouch or kneel down to speak to someone shorter than you. Young kids can be intimidated by towering adults with loud voices, so feel free to get on a knee, squat down, or sit on the floor with them to have a conversation. [4] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source Getting on a child’s level (literally) makes them feel more included in the conversation. Depending on where you are, you could also stand on a lower step or help a child stand or sit on something taller, like a piece of playground equipment."

      "title": "Short people may be sensitive to jokes since shortness is “less desired.”",
      "content": "Short people may be sensitive to jokes since shortness is “less desired.” In Western cultures, being tall is viewed as a good thing (especially for men). Unfortunately, short people can be overlooked for leadership positions, dates, and even fair salaries (it’s estimated that every inch of height translates to an extra $789 per year in salary—again, especially for men) all because of their height. [5] X Research source So, a joke about a physical feature they can’t control might be offensive, especially since shortness is a challenge in other areas of life. This doesn’t mean every short person is uncomfortable with their height or can’t take a joke, though. Some use humor to compensate for their height or showcase their personality—it all just depends on the person. Ultimately, consider your relationship to the person before cracking a joke. If you’re close and they seem secure in their height, a friendly jab or comment here and there probably isn’t a huge issue. If they have a problem with your jokes, though, respect their preferences."

      "title": "Tall people may also get tired of constant height comments and jokes.",
      "content": "Tall people may also get tired of constant height comments and jokes. On the flip side, tall people’s height is considered desirable and people tend to associate qualities like leadership and confidence with them. However, height being a “good thing” invites plenty of strangers to make unsolicited comments and questions (How’s the weather up there? Do you play basketball? Shoes must be hard to find!). [6] X Research source This can feel invasive or just plain annoying, and many tall people have stories about strangers saying bizarre things to them or asking personal questions about their body. Just like shortness, tallness is a physical feature you can’t control. So, consider your relationship with a tall person and their security with their height before cracking a joke."
