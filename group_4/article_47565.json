      "title": "Pick a style.",
      "content": "Pick a style. When people think of Uggs, the first image that comes to mind is the classic monochrome sheepskin boot. Comfy and soft, the original Uggs come in two styles – essential tall and classic short. Though these are great options, the Ugg company now makes a variety of different boots that suit different needs. Choose a style that best compliments your wardrobe and lifestyle. If you’re looking for a boot that is simply comfortable and warm, one of the classic styles might be the best choice. The classic short is a bit more subtle if you don’t want your boots to be immediately noticeable, while the essential tall is a more visible addition to your outfit. If you want a boot that’s waterproof and a bit more durable in harsh weather, Ugg has lots of options to offer. While their alternative boots don’t have the classic, recognizable sheepskin Ugg look, they’re both fashionable and functional. For example, the Adirondack boot is made of waterproof leather and suede with wool lining on the inside for super low temps. Check out the Ugg website, http://www.ugg.com/women-boots/, for a full list of alternative styles."

      "title": "Choose the right color.",
      "content": "Choose the right color. When it comes to choosing the color of your Uggs, you should consider how this will complement your complexion, hair color and wardrobe. Lighter hair colors and complexions tend to pair well with a natural earth tone such as chestnut or brown, whereas a darker hair color or complexion looks great with deeper colors such as black, grey, or blue. Most importantly, pick a color that you love! If you have a lot of warm colors (red, yellow, orange) in your wardrobe, consider a tan or brown boot. The combination of warm colors and tan/brown boots gives you a natural look. If you’re more into neutral colors (black, grey, white) a more neutral boot would pair nicely with your wardrobe.

      "content": "Select an appropriate material. Snow and rain will ruin your classic sheepskin Ugg boots. While meant for cold weather, this style of Uggs is not waterproof. In places that have chilly winters but not a whole lot of snow, a classic sheepskin boot could be a great choice, since they won’t have as many opportunities to get wet. If you live in a place with consistent snowfall such as the Northeast or Midwest, it might be worth it to look into Ugg boots made with durable waterproof materials."

      "content": "Wear Uggs with long pants. Uggs are meant to be worn in cold weather, which means they go best with fall or winter clothes. Try tucking trendy jeans into your Uggs if you want the boots to be the star of your outfit. For a more subtle look, wear flared pants over your Uggs. Be bold and try out a pair of dark red or green skinny jeans, but be sure to color coordinate with your boots!

      "content": "Sport a pair of leggings. If you’re more into leggings than pants, wear your Uggs over a pair of warm leggings. You can wear single shade leggings in an earth tone for a classy look, or a patterned pair to spice things up. Combine with a loose sweater or top and you’re good to go!"

      "content": "Feel free to wear a skirt or cute dress. As long as you’re also wearing tights or leggings, go ahead and wear a blouse and skirt or winter dress with your Uggs. As a rule of thumb, though, make sure your outfit is relatively casual. Uggs aren’t meant to be worn with ball gowns.

      "title": "Avoid wearing Uggs with formal clothing.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing Uggs with formal clothing. Uggs, though trendy and high end, are meant to be a casual accessory. They’re generally not appropriate for work, or a formal dress event such as a wedding. Wearing Uggs with fancy clothing will look unnatural and will make the boots stick out in an unpleasant way. Instead, wear when hanging out with friends, to a casual meal, to university, or to work (depending on the accepted dress code of your job). One of the best things about Uggs – you can wear them with sweatpants! Tuck a pair of sweats into Uggs when you’re running errands on a lazy winter day. Pair with a tight long sleeve shirt and you’ll be warm, comfortable, and casually fashionable. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t wear Uggs in warm weather.",
      "content": "Don’t wear Uggs in warm weather. No matter how much you love your Uggs, try not to wear them in warm weather. Though comfortable, Uggs are sheepskin boots designed to keep your feet warm. If you wear them in warm weather, you not only run the risk of making a fashion faux pas, but also ruining your boots with excess sweat."

      "title": "Wear socks.",
      "content": "Wear socks. Though it may be tempting to wear Uggs barefoot, the sweat and bacteria on your feet will shorten the lifespan of your boots. Perspiration and bacteria get into the wool lining, damaging the boots and creating an unfriendly odor. Wearing socks will keep your boots looking and smelling fresh for longer. [8] X Research source If you do get an unwanted odor, try sprinkling some baking powder into your Uggs and let sit overnight. Baking powder kills bacteria and removes bad smells. Even if your boots don’t have a particularly pungent odor, putting some baking powder in the lining over the summer will keep them fresh for next season. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid getting wet.",
      "content": "Avoid getting wet. Classic Uggs are, unfortunately, not waterproof. Wearing your boots in the rain or snow will inevitably lead to the formation of bacteria, which causes bad odor. If you’re dying to wear your Uggs in wet weather, make sure to buy a waterproofing spray to protect your boots."

      "content": "Treat stains and keep your boots clean. If your boots become stained or water damaged, use a leather or suede shampoo that you can pick up from your local pharmacy. Scrub your boots down and let sit overnight. Stuff with newspaper to help with drying and to retain shape. Be aware that some shampoos lightly change the color of your boots, but will leave them looking good as new. [10] X Research source If you have a particularly nasty grease or oil stain, sprinkle with talcum powder, cornstarch, or chalk and let sit overnight. If you have a harder stain, such as wine or marker, try spraying a little hairspray on the trouble spot and let sit for a few hours. Then coat with a bit of dish soap and allow to dry. You can repeat this process as many times as necessary until the stain is gone. [11] X Research source"
