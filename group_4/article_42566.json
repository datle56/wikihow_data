After your operation, your doctor provides specific instructions on how to care for your wound, including when it’s safe to get your stitches wet. These directions vary depending on your surgery type and the way the incision was closed.

      "content": "Ask your surgeon about how your incision was closed. Determining the method used to close your wound can help you prevent infection and navigate the healing process better. The most common incision closures include stitches (surgical sutures), staples, wound closure strips (Steri-Strips or butterfly band-aids), and tissue glue. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Many surgeons apply a waterproof dressing or bandage over the wound site, allowing you to shower normally, but call your doctor and confirm this information if you’re unsure. In general, you can wash the incision site 24-48 hours after surgery, but take showers, instead of baths, to avoid submerging the area in water. For incisions closed with tissue glue, keep them dry and out of direct sunlight, especially during the first 5 days after surgery. You can still shower normally, but avoid soaking your wound; within 5-10 days, the glue will dry out and fall off. [3] X Research source"

Wash the incision gently, and avoid rubbing the area with a washcloth (which can irritate the incision and delay the healing process). To rinse off the soap, let clean water run over the area until there aren’t any remaining suds. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Depending on your dressing, your doctor may advise you to remove it before showering, leaving the incision site uncovered. Try not to let other bath products (like shampoo or conditioner) seep into the incision site. To prevent surgical site infections, your doctor might recommend an antiseptic soap like Hibiclens . Since it’s a strong disinfectant, avoid applying the product on your face, and do not wash with normal soap after using it. [5] X Research source"

If your incision is still covered with a dressing when you get out of the shower, remove it to ensure the area is completely dry. With clean hands, gently dry the incision with a clean towel (even if it didn’t get wet), and check the area for any bleeding, swelling, odor, or white discharge. [6] X Research source Avoid rubbing the area, and do not remove any visible stitches, staples, or wound closure strips that are still in place. Even if your incision area is itchy, try not to pick at it to prevent bleeding. Allow any scab to remain until they naturally fall off, which typically takes around 1-2 weeks. If your incision bleeds (or you notice any possible signs of infection), apply direct, constant pressure over the area and contact your doctor for further instructions.

You can tape a plastic bag or glove over the wound while showering, but gently pat the area dry when they’re in place. [9] X Research source After this time period, you can wet the wound closure strips, but avoid submerging them in water. If the edges of the strips become loose, trim them with a pair of scissors. But, do not pull on the edges or attempt to remove the strips until they fall off naturally (usually within 2 weeks)."

Wrap the incision site with cling wrap or a plastic bag, then use medical tape to secure the edges in place. For hard to reach areas, ask a family member or friend to help you cover it so water doesn’t seep into the wound. [11] X Research source Alternatively, you can purchase a waterproof dressing to place directly over the wound and keep the area dry. If the wound is on your shoulder or upper back, drape a garbage bag like a cape to keep water away from the area. You can also drape the bag like a bib to protect chest incisions."
