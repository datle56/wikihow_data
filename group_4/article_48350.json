Put your phone away, and maintain eye contact when he speaks; it shows him that you genuinely care and increases intimacy in the relationship. [1] X Research source Remember small details that he shares with you, and try to bring them up in future conversations. Follow up with engaging, open-ended questions to make him feel understood. Avoid being judgmental–he’s more likely to open up to you if he feels safe and secure. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Move beyond surface-level topics and share personal experiences. One of the best ways to increase emotional attraction with a man is to be vulnerable . Share your dreams, fears, and beliefs to build trust in the relationship, but avoid sharing all your worries and concerns in one conversation–you don’t want to overwhelm him. Most men view vulnerability as weakness, so don’t expect your partner to open up to you immediately. Be patient and reassure him that it’s okay to feel uncertain or afraid. [3] X Research source When he’s comfortable, connect with your partner on a deeper level by asking him questions about his past experiences and childhood."

By adjusting your affection to meet his needs, you’re triggering his emotional attraction toward you and setting the foundation for an intimate, lasting relationship. Words of affirmation: leave him surprise notes, or offer words of encouragement during tough times. Physical touch: lightly touch your partner during regular interactions, or give him a long hug at the end of the day. Quality time: plan a spontaneous date, or try a new activity together. Receiving gifts: give him a special present that aligns with his interests or hobbies. Acts of service: find small chores you can complete on his behalf, or run an errand for him without asking.

Space is emotionally attractive because it demonstrates self-esteem, so work on being independent in your relationship . If you’re living with your partner, create a space that’s entirely your own. Clearly communicate when and why you need space, and carve out times for him not to disturb you. Take a mental health day away from your partner: visit a museum, read in the park, or watch a movie to rest and recharge. Start a passion project to maintain your sense of self. If you don’t know where to start, find your passion by exploring the things you’ve always wanted to try."

Be mysterious to leave him wanting more; it forces him to invest his time and energy in you, developing a deeper emotional attachment. Even if you’re in a relationship, ditch your normal routine to keep things exciting: wear a new perfume, send him a flirty text , or spice things up in the bedroom . Don’t change who you are to appeal to the male gaze, but step out of your comfort zone to feel more attractive to yourself."

Thrilling activities increase emotional attraction because they’re intimate bonding experiences. Organize fun activity-based dates to leave a positive, lasting impression on him. Attend a comedy show, concert, or sports event–anything that will boost his heart rate and energize him. If you want to plan a more physical date, sign up for a kickboxing class, visit an amusement park, or enjoy a night at TopGolf.
