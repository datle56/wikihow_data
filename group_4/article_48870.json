      "content": "Grief and mourning Also known as weeping willows, these trees look like they’re crying when raindrops roll down their leaves. For this reason, many cultures associate them with death and mourning. Willows are often planted in graveyards and engraved on tombstones. [4] X Research source This is not necessarily a negative connotation, however. Because willows are also associated with immortality, they often represent the endurance of love after death. Part of this association may come from the Bible. Psalms 137:1 states, “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.” In the 16th and 17th centuries, willows were also associated with the grief and heartbreak of scorned lovers."

They represented chastity for Saint Gregory the Great. In Morals on the Book of Job , he states, “For the children of Holy Church spring up as willows among the grass, when amidst the withering life of carnal men, they last on in manifold numbers and perpetual greenness of mind.” [11] X Research source"

      "content": "The willow appears in a 15th century English Christmas carol. The Watersons song “The Bitter Withy” is likely based on apocryphal tales of Christ’s childhood, in which he builds a bridge of sunbeams and forms pools of water on the banks of the River Jordan to show his powers to the other children, and he ends up harming them in the process. When Mary finds out, she delivers 3 blows with a handful of willow twigs. [12] X Research source In the carol’s final verse, Jesus says, “Oh, the withy, it shall be the very first tree that perishes at heart!” This is an explanation for the crack-willow’s tendency to split and collapse under its own weight."
