      "content": "Grab an upper corner in each hand. Make sure your skirt is facing out first--some wraparounds aren’t reversible. Grab the left upper corner in your left hand and the right upper corner in your right hand. Be sure to grab the corners, not the ties!"

      "content": "Line up the skirt with your waist or hips. Some people prefer to wear wrap skirts at their natural waist, while others like to secure them around their hips. Depending on your preference, line the top hem of the skirt up so that it’s even along your waist or hip line. [2] X Research source"

Slide the right corner tie through the buttonhole and pull it taut. Continue holding onto the tie after you slide the tie through. [3] X Research source Most wraparound skirts have the buttonhole on the right, but if yours is on the left, simply switch the corners around so that your left hand is in front of your right hip. Some wraparound skirts don't have a buttonhole. For these, you'll need to secure it with additional wrapping or a pin."

      "title": "Pull the left corner around your body until it reaches the buttonhole.",
      "content": "Pull the left corner around your body until it reaches the buttonhole. Take your left hand and pull the other corner of the skirt around your body until the base of the left tie is at the buttonhole. Depending on your size and the size of your skirt, you might only go across the front of your body, or you might have to wrap the skirt all the way around more than once. As long as you can hold both ties in one hand easily, you’re fine!"

      "content": "Secure the tie with a double bow or pin. Tie the ties in a double bow to keep them secured. To tie a double bow, first tie an ordinary bow and then knot the bow loops one more time. If you aren’t comfortable relying on a bow, you can use a safety pin or even a fun decorative brooch to help secure your skirt. Just make sure any pin you use goes through every layer of the waistband."
