      "title": "Growth of the testicles is often the first sign of puberty in boys.",
      "content": "Growth of the testicles is often the first sign of puberty in boys. When puberty starts, hormones from your brain send messages to the rest of your body that cause physical and emotional changes. One of the first physical changes that happens is to your testicles, the sack-like growth at the base of the penis. They’ll get larger, and by the end of puberty, they usually double in size. [1] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source The testicles make sperm, the male reproductive cell. They also produce the hormone testosterone, which causes male sexual development. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source It’s completely normal for one testicle (usually the left) to grow larger than the other and hang lower, but either one can do this. [3] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source For some, puberty can start earlier (before age 9) or later (after age 14). The key sign of delayed puberty is that the testicles and penis haven’t grown by the age of 14.

Go to source While early or delayed puberty usually doesn’t cause a major issue for many people, talk to your doctor if you believe you’re experiencing puberty too early or late."

      "title": "As your testicles grow, the skin around them will start to thin.",
      "content": "As your testicles grow, the skin around them will start to thin. Before puberty, the skin around your testicles, which is called the scrotum, is usually tight and thick. Puberty causes the skin to loosen up and get thinner, so your testicles have more room to grow. You might also notice tiny bumps starting to dot the skin on your scrotum. These are hair follicles that’ll eventually sprout pubic hair, and they’re completely normal to have. [5] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source It’s also normal for the scrotum to get darker or take on a reddish color during this time. As your testicles continue to grow, your scrotum will also start hanging lower from the base of your penis."

      "content": "Hair growing around your penis is a common sign of puberty. Another early sign of puberty in boys is thick, curly hair (known as pubic hair) growing at the base of your penis and near your scrotum. As you grow older, this pubic hair will start to cover the entire pubic region and spread upward toward your thighs and stomach—it’s normal! [6] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source When pubic hair first starts to grow, it’ll likely be soft. As you continue to develop, it can get darker and coarser. [7] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source"

      "content": "Your arms, legs, hands, and feet might grow faster than the rest of your body. At the start and throughout puberty, you’ll likely start getting taller and find that your hands and feet are bigger. You might also experience some aches in your arms or legs called “growing pains,” which are common among boys going through puberty. [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source From ages 9 to 14, boys will usually gain about 2 to 2.5 in (5.1 to 6.4 cm) of height each year. At the peak of your growth spurt, which may occur between ages 11 and 16, you could grow up to 4 in (10 cm) each year. You might feel clumsy while you grow , and that’s normal. Don’t worry—your body will even out, and you’ll feel more balanced with time.

      "content": "As your penis grows, it may start getting harder and more erect. An erection is when your penis gets harder, bigger, and points upwards. This physical reaction may create a noticeable “tent” in your pants. Erections are completely normal and are caused by hormonal changes. They may happen for no reason at all at first, but can also occur when fantasizing about sexual things. [12] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Spontaneous erections are quite common during mid-puberty, as your body is still figuring out how to make them work. Eventually, they will become less common. [13] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

      "title": "As you develop, a sticky fluid may shoot out of your erect penis.",
      "content": "As you develop, a sticky fluid may shoot out of your erect penis. This event is called ejaculation. The white fluid that comes out after you ejaculate is called semen, ejaculate, or cum and is not the same as urine. Semen has sperm in it, and when it gets inside a vagina, it can cause pregnancy. [15] X Research source Sometimes, a thin, slippery liquid comes out before ejaculation. This liquid is called “pre-cum” or “pre-ejaculate” and is very normal. Your first few ejaculations may be more jelly-like in consistency, clear in color, and have a lower sperm content. In a year or two, your ejaculations will gradually change and become more liquid and white."

      "content": "When you go through puberty, you may have accidental ejaculations while sleeping. These are known as “wet dreams” and are a completely normal part of growing up and developing. You might wake up with sticky underwear or sheets. This situation happens involuntarily and is often caused by sexy dreams or if your penis rubs against your sheets. [16] X Research source As you get older, you’ll likely have fewer wet dreams or stop having them altogether. While you can’t fully stop wet dreams from happening, keeping a towel or pair of spare underwear nearby can make clean-up easier. [17] X Research source Know that not every boy gets wet dreams, and that’s okay! If you don’t have wet dreams, don’t be discouraged—you’re likely still developing normally."

      "content": "When you mature, your vocal cords grow and change how you sound. Your voice will likely start cracking and sounding a bit squeaky during puberty. These changes happen because your vocal cords are getting longer and thicker, so you’ll eventually have a deep, lower voice. In the meantime, your voice may involuntarily break. [18] X Research source Similarly, you may also notice you develop an Adam’s apple during this time, as this can happen while your vocal cords change. [19] X Research source"

Dr. David Nazarian explains that as you continue to go through puberty, you’ll likely notice hair growing on other parts of your body, such as your armpits, legs, face, chest, or back. This is entirely normal as your body develops. You may even start learning how to shave at this time! [20] X Research source For some boys, body hair can be very thick and dark, but it may be very light and soft for others.

      "content": "Acne may form on your face, shoulders, or back during puberty. Pimples are a common side effect of puberty, thanks to all of the hormones being released in your body. These hormones cause your skin to produce more oil, which can clog your pores and lead to acne. [22] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The best way to fight acne is to wash your face and other parts of your body regularly to prevent buildups of oil and dead skin. [23] X Research source Another way to combat acne is by using over-the-counter (OTC) products. Products that contain benzoyl peroxide are some of the most popular and effective. If your acne is severe, talk to a dermatologist or doctor to see if they can write you a prescription for special acne creams or pills."

Dr. Nazarian explains that it’s a normal symptom of puberty and is usually because your shoulders are widening and you’re gaining muscle. You’ll likely notice that most of the growth is happening around your torso and shoulders, but you might also start developing muscles in your arms and legs, too. [24] X Research source Some boys can suddenly put on a ton of muscle, while others may only gain a small amount of weight. Everyone is different and will go through puberty at their own speed, so don’t feel embarrassed or ashamed if you don’t look exactly like your friends."

About half of all people going through male puberty can develop temporary breast tissue, which usually feels like a button-like bump under one or both nipples. These growths may also be tender or painful, especially if you accidentally hit them. This swelling will often go away after a few months or longer.

For example, you might get irritated, upset, or frustrated more easily than you used to.

Just know that you’re not alone and that you can always talk to friends and family about what you’re going through. [27] X Research source It’s also completely normal to start having more sexual thoughts about others or developing a crush on someone you find attractive."
