      "title": "Dry your bangs with a hair dryer to flatten them out.",
      "content": "Dry your bangs with a hair dryer to flatten them out. After washing your hair, use a round brush and a blow-dryer to dry your bangs to perfection. Roll the brush under the bangs and pull them away from your face (on the heavy side of your part) to ensure that they are dried in the right direction. [1] X Research source If you have a cowlick in your hair where it doesn’t lie flat, focus the dryer on that area and brush it down until it’s smooth."

      "title": "Blow dry your bangs straight down for a silky, shiny finish.",
      "content": "Blow dry your bangs straight down for a silky, shiny finish. Towel dry your hair out of the shower until it’s not dripping wet anymore. Hold a paddle brush underneath your bangs and set your hair dryer to a low setting to get your bangs styled without unwanted curls or waves. Use a light misting of hairspray to set your bangs after blow-drying them. [2] X Research source If you want a slight curl to your bangs, use a round brush instead of a paddle brush. You can dry the rest of your hair for an overall sleek finish."

      "title": "Use a flat iron to straighten your bangs for a silky, smooth look.",
      "content": "Use a flat iron to straighten your bangs for a silky, smooth look. Once your bangs are dry, run a paddle brush through them to get out any tangles. Grab your flat iron and run it over your bangs 3 to 4 times from the roots to the ends. Brush your bangs in between each time to keep them looking silky and smooth. [3] X Research source Try straightening the rest of your hair for a sleek overall look."

      "title": "Add some beachy waves with a curling iron.",
      "content": "Add some beachy waves with a curling iron. After your bangs are dry, grab a curling iron and separate your bangs into 1 in (2.5 cm) wide sections. Wrap 1 section around your curling iron away from your face, then hold it for about 3 seconds. Let the curl go, then use the curling iron on the rest of your bangs. [4] X Research source If your curls are too tight, use your fingers to gently comb through your bangs once you’re done. This looks great with crimped or curled hair."

      "title": "Try an easy twist-and-pin to keep your bangs out of your face.",
      "content": "Try an easy twist-and-pin to keep your bangs out of your face. Gather your bangs in one hand, and twist them away from your face along your hairline. Pin them on top of your hair using bobby pins going parallel to your bangs. To keep fine fly-aways at bay, use a misting of hairspray over your twisted bangs. [5] X Research source For an up-do, you can continue twisting hair beyond your bangs before pulling it all up into an elastic or pinning it at the back of your head."

      "title": "Create a curtain fringe with a middle part.",
      "content": "Create a curtain fringe with a middle part. Brush out your bangs until they lie flat on your forehead, then use a small comb to part them directly down the middle. Use a curling iron to curl each side away from your face so your bangs have a small gap in the middle. [6] X Research source This style mimics curtain bangs or french bangs. This is a great style to try if your bangs are getting so long that they’re touching your eyes."

      "title": "Sweep your bangs to the side for a swooped look.",
      "content": "Sweep your bangs to the side for a swooped look. While your hair is wet, push your bangs over to one side of your forehead, essentially making them short side bangs. Point your hair dryer in the direction you’d like them to swoop, then use a paddle brush to keep them in place as you dry. Comb through your bangs with your fingers to push them into place for a tousled, messy look. [7] X Research source Try adding small waves to the rest of your hair with a curling iron to match the texture in your bangs."

    {
      "title": "Go with a pompadour if you have short hair.",
      "content": "Go with a pompadour if you have short hair. With your hair wet, dry your bangs while brushing them backwards on top of your head. Then, grab a styling gel and run it through your bangs, pushing them backwards as you do. Add 2 to 3 bobby pins at the back of your bangs to keep them in place, then spray a thin layer of hairspray all over to discourage flyaways. [8] X Research source This technique works great if you have an undercut or a pixie cut."

      "title": "Braid",
      "content": "Braid your bangs to the side for a sophisticated look. Separate your bangs out from the front section of your hair, and pull the rest of your hair up with an elastic band. Split your bangs into 3 even sections, then grab each section in your hands. Pull one of the outside sections over to the center, then pull the other outside section over to the center. Keep going down your bangs until you reach the end, then secure the end of the braid to the side of your head with a bobby pin. [9] X Research source Braiding is an easy way to keep your bangs out of your face while making them look a little more visually appealing."

      "title": "Pin your bangs straight back to open up your face.",
      "content": "Pin your bangs straight back to open up your face. Style your entire head of hair as you normally would and leave it loose around your shoulders. Grab a 5 in (13 cm) wide section of hair on top of your forehead and brush it backwards with a brush. Lay the section flat on the top of your head, then use 2 to 3 bobby pins to secure the ends of your hair to your head. Spray a thin layer of hairspray to tamp down any flyaways. [10] X Research source This is an easy style to do for long bangs that are getting to be an annoying length. Try adding a headband or a decorative hair barrette to make this style a little more fancy. For extra volume, try teasing your bangs with a rat tail comb before you pull them back."

      "title": "Pull your bangs into a top knot to get them off your forehead.",
      "content": "Pull your bangs into a top knot to get them off your forehead. While your bangs are wet, push them back over the top of your forehead and blow dry them straight back. Pull back your bangs and the top section of your hair from your forehead upwards into a ponytail. Twist your hair into a messy bun on the top of your head, then pin the base of the bun into place with 2 to 3 bobby pins. [11] X Research source This is a great style to try if your bangs are dirty or you’re trying to grow them out. Top knots are a great summery style."

      "title": "Make your bangs disappear by tucking them under other hairs.",
      "content": "Make your bangs disappear by tucking them under other hairs. Part your hair deep to one side just above your ear and brush it over the top of your bangs. You can pin your hair back if too much of it is hanging in your face, but leaving it down should allow you to maintain the illusion as well. [12] X Research source Try curling your hair and your bangs to make them look a little more seamless. This style may only work for very long hair, as shorter hair doesn’t have the necessary weight to hold down the bangs and cover them up."
