Once you’re done downloading it, click on it to set it up and access the voice effect options. You also have the ability to edit effects or create your own if you want to change your voice in a different way. [1] X Research source Voxal can be downloaded at https://www.nchsoftware.com/voicechanger/index.html . The program isn’t available for phones, although there are similar apps that work the same way."

      "content": "Select a voice to use by clicking on it. Look through the voice list on the left panel. Once you find the one you want, press it once. It will be highlighted when it is active. Don’t open any other applications until you’re done selecting your voice effect. [2] X Research source Check the bottom of the screen for a status update. You may see something like “Voxal is waiting for application to use the microphone” if you set it up correctly."

      "content": "Press the options button if you want to apply the effect right away. The options button is at the end of the toolbar near the top of the screen. Voxal’s default setting lets you speak normally and then add the voice effect afterward. You can change this so the program applies the effect while you’re speaking. It’s worth switching if you want to hear the effect right away. [3] X Research source For example, you could use the second option when you’re talking to someone or playing games. It causes the program to actively change your voice instead of forcing you to save and replay a clip."

      "title": "Open the other program you plan on using.",
      "content": "Open the other program you plan on using. Voxal works for all sorts of different applications, including games, phone calls, voice chat, TeamSpeak , presentations, and more. The program you plan on using has to be closed until you have Voxal set up. When you’re ready, run the program and navigate to a point where you can use your microphone. [4] X Research source For example, try using Voxal during a Skype call. Open Skype and call someone. Then, speak to hear the voice change in action. Note that Voxal always has to be opened first or else it won’t be able to detect the second program you opened."

      "title": "Start speaking so Voxal changes your voice.",
      "content": "Start speaking so Voxal changes your voice. Talk into your microphone. If everything works, you will hear the effect right away. Look for the microphone meter on the screen to move. Also, check the status bar for a message like, “Status: Successfully processing!” to confirm that everyone else can hear your new voice. [5] X Research source If the microphone meter doesn’t activate, your microphone isn’t picking up audio. It is often because your microphone isn’t plugged in, active, or recognized by your computer. If you don’t see the status message, then Voxal may not have synced up to the second program you opened. Close the program and then reopen it after making sure you clicked on the voice in Voxal."

The long panel on the left side will have a list of different voice effects, such as robot, chipmunk, and AM radio. Click on one of them to select it. The display will change to show you the effect you chose and the settings used to create it. [6] X Research source When you’re first using Voxal, check the premade voice changes.

Click the stop button when you’re done recording, then press the listen button to play back the sample. [7] X Research source If you don’t see the display changing to green, your microphone likely isn’t picking up sound. Make sure it is plugged in and active first, then access your computer’s volume settings to see if it is muted."

The effects will be listed as green boxes in the middle of the screen. Open them using the edit button, then make use of the available options to alter them. [8] X Research source For instance, edit the voice’s pitch to make it lower or higher. Other options include things like echo and amplification.

[9] X Research source You can add as many effects as you want, but keep in mind that your computer has a limited amount of power available. If it slows down or Voxal isn’t working properly, you may need to use fewer effects. The new voice will be listed on the left panel underneath the premade ones.

Fortunately, they are easy to find by using the open button in the window that pops up after you click the recording button. The open command opens the default folder the program uses to store files. [11] X Research source The open button is most useful when you’re trying to track down a single recording you just made. The recordings are listed by recording date. Use it to listen to a recording. Keep in mind that you can also move the recordings out of the folder. If you do this, they won’t show up when you click the open button. You will have to navigate to them to listen to them."

[13] X Research source Voxal enables you to add voice effects to existing files by using the preview file option. It is most useful for changing your own pre-recorded clips, but it can also be used to change clips from other people. The process file option acts almost the same as the preview file one. Select it if you already know what effect you want to add to the file. You won’t get a chance to listen to the file, so you will have to save it and then open it with the preview file button."

Voxal’s text to speech option gives you an opportunity to work with text files, such as an eBook or a post on your favorite website. Press the button, then navigate to the file on your computer. The program will use your computer’s text to speech function to read the text out loud. You can then edit it by applying voice effects. [14] X Research source Text to speech is most useful if you don’t feel like reading or aren’t able to read something. For example, you could use it to listen to an eBook while you’re traveling or just relaxing. If you want to change your own voice, try recording yourself reading the text and then adding effects."
