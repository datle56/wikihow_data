Vegetable, grapeseed, peanut, and soybean oil all have a high smoke point. Other oils, like olive oil, have a low smoke point and aren’t ideal to use in a deep fryer.

Find the minimum and maximum fill line in your deep fryer and make sure not to overfill or underfill it. If your fryer doesn’t have these lines, do not fill it more than halfway.

If you have a built-in thermostat, turn the dial to the correct temperature. If your fryer doesn’t have one, you can use a cooking thermometer to test the temperature. If you see or smell smoke coming from the deep fryer, it means that you’ve heated up your oil too much. Turn down the heat on the fryer or your food may taste burnt. Some fryers will have a light that will turn on when your oil is at the right temperature."
