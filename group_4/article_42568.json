[1] X Research source For now, go and turn on the shower. Get the water nice and warm and think about how good it would feel to climb inside. You'll probably find it much easier to shower once you're actually in the bathroom and have everything all ready to go. The hardest part often lies in simply taking the first step, but with that out of the way, nothing can stop you. If you struggle to physically go to the shower, imagine how good it would feel standing under warm, running water to help motivate yourself."

At this point, it’ll probably feel silly to have gone to all that trouble just to shut off the water and put your clothes back on. Since you're already in position, and it requires just as much effort to get dressed again, you might as well hop in the shower.

Give yourself encouraging advice and words of affirmation. You'll start feeling more capable as soon as you shift your attitude from \"I don't want to\" to \"I can do this.\" [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, tell yourself, “There will always be things that I don’t want to do, but I must do them, because I owe it to myself to take care of me, and I deserve to feel clean and refreshed.” Saying your name can make you feel more empowered by allowing you to step outside of yourself momentarily and creating a sense of personal accountability.

After a week or so, your inertia will disappear, and showering will become another part of your normal routine. There's no need to shower every day.

Instruct your helper to be as intrusive and annoying as they need to be to push you. If you're serious about getting a friend to help keep you accountable, hand over the money in your wallet and tell them not to give it back to you until you've showered.

If you are stubborn, the alarms will serve as a stern, persistent voice demanding that you take care of business. Do you want the alarms to win? Didn't think so. Take a shower! Make the alarms sporadic at first, then set subsequent alarms closer together as it gets closer to whatever time limit you've imposed on yourself (going to bed, getting ready for a date, etc.). Similarly, turn down the thermostat in your home, so that a shower feels like a nice, warm alternative to your cold surroundings."
