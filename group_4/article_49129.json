      "content": "Measure all sides of the box with measuring tape or a ruler. Knowing the exact size of the box will inform you of how much wrapping paper you'll need. Place your ruler at the bottom of the box first, taking its measurement lengthwise. Measure its width second. Measure the height of the box last. Perform these measurements in the same order for every side. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Check the measurements of your wrapping paper with a ruler. If the wrapping paper is at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the box on the left and right sides, proceed with using the paper. Use a second roll of wrapping paper if the wrapping is too short to fit all the way around the box. [3] X Research source"

If the box is too heavy to stand up without wobbling, have someone stand nearby to hold the box up while you spread the wrapping paper out. Make sure the wrapping paper is completely smooth. Do not cut the wrapping paper just yet; you may still need to unfurl more paper as you work. [4] X Research source"
