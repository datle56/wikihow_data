      "title": "Clean your rabbit's eye gently.",
      "content": "Clean your rabbit's eye gently. Use a soft cloth moistened with warm water to clean your rabbit's eye and the area around it. If the eye is closed or crusted over, hold the warm cloth over the eye for a minute to soften the crusty discharge before wiping. [1] X Research source When you've wiped away the discharge, look at your rabbit's eye to see if it looks red or irritated. Red eyes could be a sign of conjunctivitis. The skin around your rabbit's eye may also be red and moist. Check the surface of your rabbit’s eye to ensure that it looks shiny and smooth. If it looks jagged or there is a matte appearance, then the rabbit may have a corneal ulcer. This requires immediate veterinary attention."

      "title": "Inspect your rabbit's face for any injuries.",
      "content": "Inspect your rabbit's face for any injuries. Trauma to your rabbit's face, particularly near its eye, can lead to weepy eye. If your rabbit has scratches or other injuries, they may be blocking a tear duct, causing weepy eye. If your rabbit does have injuries on its face, infections could also lead to weepy eye, particularly if the injuries are swollen or inflamed. It is also possible that the rabbit has a piece of hay or other debris trapped under its eyelid. Look to see if anything is rubbing against the rabbit’s eye."

      "title": "Monitor your rabbit's behavior closely.",
      "content": "Monitor your rabbit's behavior closely. Since rabbits are prey animals, they are pretty adept at hiding signs that they are sick or injured. If your rabbit is laying low, seems lethargic, or doesn't want to come out of its hutch, that combined with discharge from its eyes could indicate that it has weepy eye. [2] X Research source If you have several rabbits, separate the one you think has weepy eye from the others. If the rabbit has conjunctivitis, your other rabbits might catch it. Let your rabbit out of its hutch and watch it as it plays. Rabbits are fairly active by nature, so if your rabbit doesn't want to run around and stays close to the hutch, that's an indication that it's not feeling well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine your rabbit's face and mouth for swelling or inflammation.",
      "content": "Examine your rabbit's face and mouth for swelling or inflammation. Inflammation from another condition, such as an upper respiratory infection, can cause your rabbit to have weepy eyes. Any abnormal growth or swelling, such as an abscess, can also cause weepy eyes by putting pressure on the tear duct. If your rabbit has an abscess or other growth, your veterinarian can safely drain it and give you antibiotics to clear the infection. Weepy eye caused by another condition typically will clear when the underlying condition is resolved."

      "title": "Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your rabbit's eye is red or weepy, it needs prompt medical attention. This is especially true for younger rabbits, which tend to suffer more from weepy eye. [3] X Research source Your vet will examine your rabbit thoroughly and attempt to isolate the cause of your rabbit's symptoms. Typically, your vet will prescribe antibiotic eye drops and some pain medication. You may also have oral antibiotics to give your rabbit."

    {
      "title": "Keep your rabbit's eye clean of discharge as needed.",
      "content": "Keep your rabbit's eye clean of discharge as needed. During treatment, your rabbit's eye will likely continue to run. Dab at the eye with a soft cloth dampened with warm water. Hold the cloth against your rabbit's eye if necessary to soften and loosen any crust around the eye. [4] X Research source Initially, you may need to clean your rabbit's eye several times a day. However, as treatment progresses the weepy eye will start to clear up. Your veterinarian may also give you a saline wash to use to rinse your rabbit's eye out. Follow your veterinarian's instructions regarding the use of this wash."

    {
      "title": "Feed your rabbit with a syringe if it will not eat on its own.",
      "content": "Feed your rabbit with a syringe if it will not eat on its own. Often a rabbit with weepy eye will stop eating. This is particularly common with younger rabbits. Buy a syringe at a pet store or farm and feed store to feed your rabbit. Your veterinarian will let you know what types of liquid food and nutrition to put in the syringe. [5] X Research source If your rabbit has not been eating for several days, your veterinarian may prescribe a particular nutrient blend to help nurse your rabbit back to health."

    {
      "title": "Isolate your rabbit from other rabbits during treatment.",
      "content": "Isolate your rabbit from other rabbits during treatment. If you have more than one rabbit, house your infected rabbit apart from the others. This will keep the infection from potentially spreading to your other rabbits, and also keeps your infected rabbit safe and clean. House your infected rabbit in a quiet spot to help reduce its stress. The infected rabbit's hutch or cage should be away from bright lights and loud noises, preferably inside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your rabbit all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian.",
      "content": "Give your rabbit all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will likely give you antibiotic drops to put in your rabbit's eyes. You may also get oral antibiotics or other medications. Depending on your rabbit's condition or other injuries, the vet may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications or other medications to relieve pain. [6] X Research source If your veterinarian prescribes antibiotics for your rabbit, continue to give your rabbit the entire cycle of antibiotics – even if the condition clears up and your rabbit appears better. If you stop the cycle early, the infection may return."

    {
      "title": "Take your rabbit back for additional scans if the condition returns.",
      "content": "Take your rabbit back for additional scans if the condition returns. If your rabbit gets better for a couple days, then has weepy eye again, your vet may want to do x-rays or CT scans to determine if a dental problem is causing the recurring weepy eye. X-rays can help identify injuries to the bones of your rabbit's skull, while CT scans can help your veterinarian locate obstructions to your rabbit's tear duct. [7] X Research source Your veterinarian may perform a nasal duct flush to confirm any obstruction. The flush may also dislodge any foreign material obstructing your rabbit's tear duct. If your rabbit's weepy eye is caused by dental problems, surgery to the tooth may be necessary."

      "title": "Use a solid-sided food hopper to reduce dust during feedings.",
      "content": "Use a solid-sided food hopper to reduce dust during feedings. Solid-sided food hoppers, available at farm and feed stores, keep your rabbit from being exposed to hay dust. Rabbits often get weepy eye when hay dust from feedings gets into their eyes. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Hay dust can cause tiny scratches on your rabbit's eyes that become inflamed or infected, leading to weepy eye. A buildup of hay dust may also block your rabbit's tear duct causing an excess production of tears. Feeding your rabbit a high-fiber diet that includes hay may also help to prevent weepy eye. Fibrous foods help to keep your rabbit's teeth worn down and prevent the roots from growing into the tear ducts."

      "title": "Keep your rabbit's face clean and dry.",
      "content": "Keep your rabbit's face clean and dry. Check on your rabbit several times a day and clean its eyes and face as necessary. If your rabbit's face is clean, it's less likely that dust and debris will get into your rabbit's eyes, possibly leading to weepy eyes. [9] X Research source If your rabbit's eyes are runny, carefully clean away the tears with a soft cloth dampened with warm water. Use another dry cloth to dry your rabbit's fur."

      "title": "Isolate the rabbit from other rabbits if necessary.",
      "content": "Isolate the rabbit from other rabbits if necessary. If a rabbit gets weepy eye once, it's more likely to have it again. Because rabbits groom one another, your rabbit is more likely to get weepy eye again if it's housed with other rabbits it has bonded with. Keep in mind that rabbits are social creatures. Even if you choose to isolate your rabbit to prevent further infection, allow it to play with the other rabbits at least once a day."

      "title": "Keep your rabbit's housing clean and dry.",
      "content": "Keep your rabbit's housing clean and dry. Spot-clean your rabbit's housing daily to remove any contaminated bedding or feces, which could be a source of bacteria. Dry any wet spots, particularly under the water bottle. Avoid using harsh chemical cleaners or other household cleaners. Your rabbit may get weepy eye if exposed to the chemicals. Make sure all soap residue is thoroughly rinsed from items you clean. [10] X Research source"
