      "content": "Turn chores into a service. One of the simplest ways for teenagers to start a business is to turn assigned tasks around the house, in to a service that can be offered to others. Chances are if your parents find value in you doing a particular task, others will too. Start a pet walking service. There are many people who are not able to come home during the day to let their pets out. By offering to walk their dog (or another pet) for a small fee, you will not only be providing a valuable service, but will get exercise in the process. Clean houses. You're probably already a pro at keeping your room tidy, so why not help others organize and clean their own houses. Start small, by offering to clean or organize one room, before moving on to the whole house. Do yard work. Every season provides an opportunity to work outside. Whether it's shoveling snow in the winter, raking leaves in the fall or planting flowers in the spring, there are no shortages of outdoor tasks that you can do for a fee."

[2] X Research source Brainstorm potential names for your product or service, remembering that, the more your name communicates to consumers about your business, the less effort you must exert to explain it.

      "content": "Research your market. Find out who your competitors are and what the need is for your chosen product/service. Remember to be specific when doing your research. Even if your product or service fills a unique gap in the market, there are always other companies offering something similar, or there are other ways to satisfy the same customer’s need. The key when thinking about your competition is to learn what makes the customer choose one product or service over another Spend some time online looking for initial information regarding your competition and also the market as a whole. For example, do a quick Google search for, “dog walkers near me,” and see what comes up. You’ll get a fairly good idea of how popular the idea is, based on the results. Once you’ve determined who your competitors are, don’t be shy about reaching out to them, as they can be a valuable resource for gaining a better understanding as to what to expect and what the actual need is in the market."
