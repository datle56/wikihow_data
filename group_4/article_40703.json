  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Decide what you want your group to be about.",
      "content": "Decide what you want your group to be about. Before you get started with making the YouTube group itself, you should have some idea what you would like to accomplish with it. The more specific, the better. If you choose to specialize in something, you'll have a much better chance of standing out from all the other groups on YouTube."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a YouTube account.",
      "content": "Make a YouTube account. Chances are you already have a YouTube account if you're reading this. If not, then do so before you think of making a group. It's easy and free."
    },
    {
      "title": "Click Accounts -> Groups -> Create a Group.",
      "content": "Click Accounts -> Groups -> Create a Group. Once you're logged into your spiffy YouTube account, it's pretty easy to get to creating a group. Put your cursor over 'Account' at the top of the screen. From there, click on the 'more...' option that becomes available. From there, go to the Groups tab, and lastly, 'Create a Group'."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill out your group information.",
      "content": "Fill out your group information. From here, you can fill in a form that will forge the basis of your group. Fill in the requested data. Picking out a great name in particular can make or break your group. Pick something witty that aptly describes in a few characters what your group is going to be all about."
    },
    {
      "title": "Invite your friends.",
      "content": "Invite your friends. Once you have the basic group set up, it's time to lure others to the fold. While some may recommend you invite as many people as possible for the best results, it's generally better to be selective at first, adding people you think will be just as interested in the topic as you are. A group with fewer people to start will make those invitees feel more exclusive, and thus more likely to keep returning."
    },
    {
      "title": "Collaborate on content.",
      "content": "Collaborate on content. The most enjoyable thing about being in a YouTube group is the fact that you can collaborate with people with the same interests as yourself. What kind of stuff are you guys mutually into? Better yet, what do each of you bring to the table? How might it be translated into top-notch content for your particular area? Get together and decide what you're going to want to do together. If you're doing a Let's Play video for example, maybe get two people to write and perform the dialogue, and a third person to do the editing magic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Upload videos regularly.",
      "content": "Upload videos regularly. Once you've got a strong core of members, it's just as important you keep your group consistently busy and active. Uploading at least weekly is a good idea. Getting that rate up to daily is even better once you have a steady following, but might not be worth the time or effort if you don't have many subscribers yet. Above all, give viewers the impression that your group is alive and well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make your group known.",
      "content": "Make your group known. Now that you've got the basics of your group built up, it's time to get a following! You and the other members of your group should share and promote the group via social media and other available outlets. Once you reach a certain threshold of active subscribers and gain a reputation for high quality (or at least engaging) material, you'll find your following will increase naturally."
