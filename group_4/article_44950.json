      "content": "Trim damaged leaves at the base with shears or a knife. Carefully move the healthy leaves aside to find any leaves that are mushy, brown, or dead. You may be able to pull these withering leaves out easily from the central stalk, or you may need to use a sharp knife or gardening shears to cut them at the base. Be careful where you trim so you don't accidentally break or cut any healthy leaves. [1] X Research source Aloe vera leaves can rot or dry out for several different reasons, including pests or plant disease, poor lighting, a lack of hydration, or too much watering. Once they show signs of decay, it's best to remove them for the health of the plant – and to make it look better!"

      "content": "Cut off any excess outer leaves, causing the plant to look overgrown. Use your knife or shears to remove enough healthy leaves to make the plant fit in the pot. Cut each leaf at the base where it grows out of the central plant in one clean slice. The outer leaves are the oldest on the plant and contain the most aloe vera gel. If they're not rotting, sick, or dead, try to preserve them so you can use the gel later in cooking or for medicinal purposes. Avoid cutting leaves closest to the plant's main stem. These leaves are young and are needed to replace the old leaves. According to the plant specialists at Artemisia Nursery, an aloe vera plant will shed its lower leaves over time anyway. For that reason, they say, these are the ideal leaves to trim when you want to prune your plant. [2] X Expert Source Artemisia Nursery Plant Nursery & Garden Shop Expert Interview. 7 August 2020."

      "content": "Cut out the pups and replant or discard them. Pups are small aloe vera plants that offshoot from the big one in the center. These new growths take energy away from your plant and crowd the pot. Most of the time, you can pull the shoots up out of the dirt with no harm to the plants. [3] X Research source If the edge of your aloe vera plant pot is crowded with pups, pull the plant out of the pot so it's easier for you to access the pups and remove them. Then, place the plant back in its pot with new soil. (Remember not to disturb the roots!) Artemisia Nursery suggests planting the pups in their own containers to grow them into whole aloe vera plants. Then you can keep the new ones and add them to your growing aloe vera garden or gift them to friends and family.

      "content": "Remove old, decaying blossoms to give your plant a cleaner look. Cut the blossoms at the stem the same way you cut the leaves. Once the flowers on the plant blossom, they soon drop seeds. While they die, they use nutrients that the plant could be putting towards new, healthy leaves. Since flowers rarely occur on aloe grown as a houseplant, if you grow your aloe vera indoors, you will likely not have to deal with blossoms. Dead flowers attract bugs and can drop into the plant’s pot, absorbing water and creating a mess."

With the thorny edges and the ends of the leaf cut off, and the leaf softened from soaking in water, this should be a quick and easy process!

Pour the blended gel into an airtight container (like a glass mason jar) and store it in the refrigerator for up to a week. If you plan on using it for face and hair masks, strain it to remove the white residue. To keep the aloe vera gel longer, pour it into an ice cube tray, let it freeze overnight, and then transfer the gel cubes into individual plastic bags. Put the bags back in the freezer and store them for up to 1 year. Then, when you're ready to use some, just pop out a frozen aloe vera gel cube and let it melt on the countertop in its bag."

      "content": "Trim aloe vera plants when you see damaged leaves or overgrowth. If you notice some of the leaves in your aloe vera plant look brown, dry, or mushy, those are good signs you need to remove them. Similarly, if your plant is looking overgrown with pups and blossoms crowding the edges and a lot of leaves hanging over the pot, get to work and cut back some of that excess growth. Aloe vera plants are fast-growing (they reach maturity in only 3-4 years), so expect to have to trim them at least once every 1-2 months. [7] X Research source"

If your aloe vera plant will be inside, you can put it in the pantry or place it in a shadowy corner of your kitchen countertop. Letting it sit will give it a chance to form a callus and start growing roots. [8] X Research source"

Once it takes root and is attached to the soil, you can remove the skewers or stones and watch it bloom into a fully grown aloe vera plant! [9] X Research source Fertilizer can help your aloe vera plant take off, but apply it sparingly. Aloe vera plants don't need a lot of maintenance to thrive. If you do decide to fertilize it, only do so once every 1-2 months, starting in March or April and ending when the temperature cools down in the fall. Use a 10-40-10 liquid fertilizer and follow the manufacturer's instructions for how much to add at a time. [10] X Research source"
