      "content": "Give your hedgehog a well-balanced diet that’s high in protein. The best way to do this is to feed your little friend dry commercial hedgehog food . These kibble-like pieces are packed with everything your hedgehog needs on a daily basis. [1] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Dry cat food that’s high in protein and contains primarily chicken is a great alternative to commercial hedgehog food. Try giving your hedgehog canned dog or cat food that’s primarily chicken as a treat every now and then. Pick a food that’s below 15% fat, around 32 to 35% protein, and has no by-products. Provide about 1–2 tablespoon (15–30 ml) of dry food every day. The amount of food you give your hedgehog depends on their activity level, size, and age. Talk with your veterinarian to see what amount is best for your hedgehog."

      "content": "Toss in an insect once in a while. If your hedgehog’s being extra good, reward them with a special treat: bugs. Hedgehogs love mealworms and crickets—just make sure you purchase these treats at a pet store rather than catch them outside to avoid unwanted parasites or pesticides. [5] X Research source Pick up a live mealworm with a pair of tweezers and dangle it in front of your hedgehog to “hunt.” Try freezing live insects on a baking sheet, so they’re easier to give to your hedgehog."

Setting up or building an enclosure that’s big enough to house all their toys, burrows, and needs is crucial to their happiness. Opt for an enclosure that’s at least 2 ft × 4 ft (0.61 m × 1.22 m), but consider aiming for something even bigger. [7] X Trustworthy Source Animal Humane Society Leading animal welfare nonprofit organization providing medical care, training education, and resources for animal owners Go to source Make sure the enclosure has a solid floor, as wire flooring could damage your little hedgehog’s feet. Think about buying an enclosure with multiple levels. This way, your little friend will have plenty of places to explore and hide. Consider using an unlidded, large plastic bin for a cheaper enclosure option. [8] X Research source"

Layer the bottom of the enclosure with a paper bedding to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) think. This will give your hedgehog plenty of cushion. Try using fleece blankets or fabric as substrate—just make sure there are no loose strings or tears. [11] X Research source Never put wood shavings in your hedgehog’s enclosure as it could cause cancer and respiratory illness. [12] X Research source Some hedgehog owners like to use commercial bedding products like Carefresh; however, experts advise against it as the particles of this material can easily get lodged in a hedgehog’s genitals and quills.

Gently grab your little friend’s foot and wait a few seconds for them to relax. Then, use hedgehog nail clippers to trim off the tiniest amount of nail.

If you notice spines sprinkled around their enclosure, consider taking some of these measures to help comfort your hedgehog through the process: [17] X Research source Give them an oatmeal bath by filling a sock with old fashioned oats and placing it in their bath water [18] X Research source Let your hedgehog crawl around your hands rather than being snuggled or pet Monitor their behavior and leave them be if they’re irritable"
