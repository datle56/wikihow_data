[3] X Research source This metric is different from others mainly because “slice” moves (any turn of a middle layer on the cube) count as 2 turns, and half-turns count as 1 move."

Solution algorithms for the Rubik’s cube are often written in Singmaster notation, a code where each letter or symbol denotes a move on the Rubik’s Cube. The Singmaster code for the solution above is U R2 F B R B2 R U2 L B2 R U' D' R2 F R' L B2 U2 F2. [6] X Research source Here’s what that means: R (Right) : The side facing to the right. L (Left) : The side facing to the left. U (Up) : The side facing up on the cube. D (Down) : The side facing downwards. F (Front) : The side facing you. B (Back) : The side facing away from you. Apostrophes denote a counterclockwise turn, so a counterclockwise right spin is R’. 2 turns of the cube (or 180-degree spins) are denoted with “2,” so turning the left side twice would look like F2."
