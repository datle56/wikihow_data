      "content": "Doctors prescribe Dianabol to treat hormonal problems and muscle loss. Patients recovering from cancer or AIDS, for example, may benefit from Dianabol. Bodybuilders and athletes, who are otherwise healthy, take Dianabol to increase muscle mass. The drug can also give you more energy and generally improve performance. Since they're not taking the drug to correct an illness or deficiency, this is considered \"misuse.\" [3] X Trustworthy Source National Institute on Drug Abuse Leading U.S government agency supporting scientific research on drug use and its consequences. Go to source Bodybuilders and athletes typically take Dianabol in much larger dosages than a doctor would prescribe, which leads to more severe side effects."

      "content": "Dianabol comes primarily in pill or injectable form. You can also take Dianabol through transdermal patches, or by rubbing a gel directly on your skin. However, pills and injections are by far the most common way to take the drug. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You'll most commonly see Dianabol sold as a blue heart-shaped pill. These pills are illegal in the US and many other countries, even though they are common on the black market. [5] X Research source"

In other countries, such as the UK, Dianabol is a controlled substance only available by prescription. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you're thinking about taking Dianabol, find out the drug's legal status in your country ahead of time. Dianabol is banned in competitive sports by national and international organizations. Even if it's legal in your country, don't take it if you participate in competitive sports. [7] X Research source While there's plenty of Dianabol available on the black market, this isn't a very smart thing to pursue. You can never be sure that the drug is pure or contains the dosage specified, and you won't have medical support while taking it. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Penalties for illegally using Dianabol include hefty fines and jail time. If you're caught with Dianabol, the criminal penalties are similar to those for any other illegal drug in the same class (the classification, though, differs among countries). The penalties are typically more severe if you get caught with a larger quantity or if you're illegally selling the drug as well as taking it yourself. If you're in competitive sports, testing positive for Dianabol can result in fines, suspension, or even a permanent ban from the sport. [9] X Research source"

While the female body may get some of the same benefits as the male body, including increased muscle mass and energy, side effects are often different. Women take Dianabol for the same reason men do, to build muscle and improve athletic performance.

Both men and women might also experience hair loss, high blood pressure, fluid retention, blood clots, and high cholesterol. Dianabol can also cause psychological side effects such as aggression, mood swings, paranoia, and hallucinations. Other side effects are different for men and women. [12] X Research source Women may also experience facial hair growth and body hair, loss of breasts, swelling of the clitoris, a deepened voice, an increased sex drive, and problems with periods. Men may also experience reduced sperm count, shrunken testicles, erectile dysfunction, baldness, breast development, and an increased risk of prostate cancer."

[13] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The practice of taking other drugs along with Dianabol is known as \"stacking.\" There is no scientific evidence that stacking or any other dosage practice reduces the medical harm caused by taking Dianabol.

Studies have shown that in as little as 8 weeks, even a relatively low dosage of 15 mg a day can decrease testosterone production by 69%. Many users take supplemental testosterone to alleviate this side effect. [15] X Research source As a result of lowered testosterone, men who take Dianabol for longer periods may have related side effects, including gynecomastia (the development of breasts), shrunken testicles, and erectile dysfunction. If you take Dianabol for an extended period, it can take as long as 4 months for your body's testosterone levels to return to normal. [16] X Research source"

Users often become reliant on Dianabol to build their confidence and self-esteem, so that they end up feeling unworthy without the drug. Long-term users often experience depression and suicidal thoughts when they're no longer taking the drug. [17] X Research source It's not uncommon for Dianabol users to combine the steroid with other drugs, such as testosterone, and anavar. Common withdrawal symptoms for people who stop using Dianabol include fatigue, restlessness, loss of appetite, sleep problems, depression, and decreased sex drive. [18] X Research source"
