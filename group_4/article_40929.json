      "content": "Boil 2–3 inches (51–76 mm) of water in a pot over high heat. As the water boils, it forms steam. The steam rises and gently warms your hot dog buns without letting them get soggy. [1] X Research source If you’re interested, try steaming hot dogs to save yourself a few dishes! You can use the same pot and steaming basket for both the dogs and the buns. Be careful while working with boiling water! Never touch the pot with your bare hands."

      "title": "Position a steaming basket over the boiling water.",
      "content": "Position a steaming basket over the boiling water. Make sure the basket fits in the pot without touching the water; otherwise, you’ll end up with very soggy buns. If you don’t have a steaming basket, try one of these faux-steamer methods: [2] X Research source Put multiple hot dog buns on a sheet tray in your oven with a dish of hot water at the bottom rack. You can even put a cooling rack on top of the sheet tray and then place the hot dog buns on that. Use a colander placed inside the pot; check that the water is low enough that it won’t come through the holes and touch the buns. Place an oven-safe bowl upside down in the bottom of the pot. Then, set a plate on top of the bowl, making sure it’s about 2–3 inches (51–76 mm) above the water. [3] X Research source Lay a pair of chopsticks over the pot and set the buns on top of the chopsticks. [4] X Research source Hold the bun with a pair of tongs over the boiling water until it’s thoroughly warmed."

      "title": "Place 1-2 buns in the steamer for about 2 minutes.",
      "content": "Place 1-2 buns in the steamer for about 2 minutes. It doesn’t take long at all to warm hot dog buns using this method. Use this time to prep the toppings for your hot dogs or sausages so that you’re ready to eat once the buns are done. [5] X Research source You could open the buns and place them facedown in the steamer to get the insides warm. Warm the buns as the last step in your meal prep. If you steam them before you cook the dogs, the buns will cool off before you can enjoy them. While you might cover hot dogs or vegetables with a lid while they steam, skip that step with the hot dog buns. As steam hits the lid, it turns back into condensation and could drip down onto your buns, making them soggy rather than soft."

      "content": "Remove the buns with a pair of tongs and assemble your hot dog! Carefully remove the buns with a pair of tongs and set them aside on a clean plate. Don’t try to grab to buns with your bare hands—there’s too much of a chance you could get burned by the steam or accidentally touch the pot. [6] X Research source Steamed buns are best enjoyed before they cool off."

      "title": "Heat 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of water in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Heat 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of water in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute. The water creates steam in the microwave, which helps soften the hot dog buns. You could also use a microwave-safe mug instead of a bowl if you prefer. [7] X Research source Some microwave-steaming methods skip this step and still end up with great results! Try it with and without the mug of water to see which way you prefer. There’s no need to wash that bowl afterward! Simply dry it off and put it away once you’re done with your meal. Always be careful when removing items from the microwave. Use a kitchen towel or oven mitt so you don’t accidentally burn yourself."

      "title": "Layer a microwave-safe plate with 2 sheets of paper towels.",
      "content": "Layer a microwave-safe plate with 2 sheets of paper towels. As the hot dog bun steams in the microwave, condensation will form and accumulate on the plate. The paper towels will absorb the water and keep the bottom of the bun from getting soggy. [8] X Research source Soggy buns are no fun—they tend to fall apart and don’t have a pleasing texture."

      "title": "Put the bun on the plate and cover it with a lightly dampened paper towel.",
      "content": "Put the bun on the plate and cover it with a lightly dampened paper towel. The paper towel shouldn’t be dripping wet—just lightly spritz or splash it with a few drops of water. The damp paper towel helps the bun retain its moisture and not get dried out. [9] X Research source You can cook more than 1 bun simultaneously; just make sure the buns aren’t touching so that they warm evenly."

      "title": "Microwave the bun along with the hot water for 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave the bun along with the hot water for 10 seconds. Leave the bowl of warm water in the microwave so that the atmosphere remains steamy. If you have the option, use a low power setting to reduce the risk of drying out the bun. [10] X Research source This is a super-quick method! You can have buns prepared for your hot dogs in less than 2 minutes."

      "content": "Flip the bun over and cook it for an extra 10 seconds. Open the microwave, lift the damp paper towel and turn the bun over. Replace the paper towel, and then steam the bun for 10 more seconds. Once it’s done, the bun should be pleasantly warm. [11] X Research source Depending on your microwave, you may need to add 5 seconds to the cooking time if the bun doesn’t feel warm enough."
