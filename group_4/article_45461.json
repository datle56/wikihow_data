      "content": "Check reliable websites for information on your country’s system. If you want to know who your elected representative is, what powers your president or prime minister has, or who’s allowed to vote, you might want to start by browsing your government’s websites. For information on a specific topic, like “how does a bill become law,” use a search engine and focus on sites operated by governmental, educational, charitable, or civic-minded groups. You can, for instance, get a very quick rundown on the Australian system of government on the Oxfam Australia website. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Read textbooks, key political texts, and books on political history. Visit your local library, head to a local bookseller or college bookstore, or shop online for introductory texts on your country’s government. You might think it’s odd to buy a textbook on American government, for instance, it you’re not taking a class in it, but this can be a great way to cover the basics quickly. Read key texts from your nation’s political history—in the U.S., for instance, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and so on. Book-length collections with annotations and introductory/explanatory essays may prove especially helpful."

      "title": "Take a class on civics, government, or introductory politics.",
      "content": "Take a class on civics, government, or introductory politics. If a civics class is required or optional in your high school, take the class—and pay attention! You can always find courses on politics in college, but even if you’re not in school, you may be able to at least sit in on an introductory course on politics at a nearby community college. You can also find open, free online courses on politics with some quick internet searching."

      "title": "Contact individuals",
      "content": "Contact individuals in your government. Many people think of writing a letter or sending an email to their elected officials only when they have a complaint or specifically support a piece of legislation. But, it’s also perfectly acceptable to ask questions about their role in governance and how the larger system works. You might be sent some helpful reading materials, or even invited for a quick meeting or tour! If you’re looking to contact a member of the Scottish Parliament, for instance, you can use wikiHow to find info on how to get in touch and the best way to format your communication. Write government officials respectfully, but also get to your point quickly and clearly. This will make it much more likely that you’ll receive a useful reply."

      "title": "Get involved",
      "content": "Get involved in politics. Perhaps the best way to truly understand your government is to become actively engaged with it. If there’s a candidate you support, volunteer for their campaign. If you’re undecided, go to debates or open forums and ask questions. Although national politics usually takes center stage, local politics often has a greater immediate impact on the lives of people in your community. Consider becoming more actively engaged locally, or even running for office yourself! [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Read and watch",
      "content": "Read and watch political news reports. There are more ways to access and consume political news than ever before. You can read a local newspaper or watch your local evening news. You can check-in regularly with websites from recognizable news organizations. You can also have alerts sent right to your phone so the news finds you! Today, the issue isn’t as much about the availability of political news as it is the quality of the news. Try to consume news from multiple, reputable news sources to get a fuller picture of the issues and reduce your likelihood of falling for \"fake news.\""

      "title": "Consider the issues from multiple points of view.",
      "content": "Consider the issues from multiple points of view. Along with getting your news from several reliable sources, it’s helpful to evaluate political debates by honestly examining the issue from different perspectives. For any contentious political topic—taxes, gun control, healthcare, etc.—seek out opinions from various sources and angles in order to be better informed overall. Even if you already think you know where you stand on an issue, it’s never a bad idea to step into the other side’s shoes. You’ll either strengthen your own stance or find valid reasons to question it. Many political scientists like to think of politics (when functioning properly) as a marketplace where different ideas and interests are offered and a general “equilibrium” of compromise occurs. Reality may not often meet this ideal, but becoming more informed certainly can’t hurt in reaching it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Consider the influences on your political views.",
      "content": "Consider the influences on your political views. Do you hold a political perspective because your parents or friends do, because you believe it benefits you economically, or because you think it is best for the globe at large? We all have political influences and even biases, so they’re nothing to be ashamed of. [4] X Research source However, by taking the time to critically examine your political views—or even lack of political views—you’ll become more knowledgeable about your own politics and the larger political scene."

      "title": "Put yourself to the test when you vote or get involved.",
      "content": "Put yourself to the test when you vote or get involved. Many representative democracies around the world are based on the ideal that all citizens should have an equal voice and vote. This is meant to be true even if some voters are under-informed or even misinformed when they go to the ballot box. It's left up to you, the individual citizen, to make sure you're a knowledgeable voter. [5] X Research source Before you vote or get active in politics, take the time to ask yourself what you know about the candidate or issues at hand. If you feel like your knowledge comes up short, take the time to get yourself up to speed so you can be an informed contributor."

      "title": "Consider why politics can be so polarizing.",
      "content": "Consider why politics can be so polarizing. It’s common wisdom that you shouldn’t bring up politics or religion at dinner parties, since they tend to elicit strong opinions and disagreements. Politics strikes right at the core of your individual worldview, on topics like the proper structuring of society, individual rights and responsibilities, and the power of government over your life. So it shouldn’t be surprising that people get worked up or even angry discussing politics. [6] X Research source Because it’s now much easier to express opinions more widely, it may seem that politics is “angrier” than ever before. But, even if it is, you shouldn’t throw up your hands and say you want nothing to do with it. Instead, become more informed and involved and be part of the solution."

      "title": "Evaluate how global forces and changes impact politics on all levels.",
      "content": "Evaluate how global forces and changes impact politics on all levels. It can be easier to perceive how major geopolitical events, like World War II or the fall of the Soviet Union, cause ripple effects on international, national, and even local levels of politics. However, you should also consider the lasting political impacts of long-term global forces, such as the spread of internet access, economic globalization, and climate change. For instance, economic globalization has improved the lives of millions, but also caused some to feel “left out” or “left behind.” This can lead to resentments that might fuel support for “outside the box” political candidates or populist and/or nationalist views. [7] X Research source So, to better understand current politics, take some time to consider the larger changes happening in the world around you."

    {
      "title": "Think about how you view the role of government.",
      "content": "Think about how you view the role of government. Do you believe that government can solve problems, or that it just causes them? Do you want more from your government, but want to pay less to it? Being uncertain or even a bit contradictory about your views on government is normal. [8] X Research source But taking the time to read, observe, learn, and get involved in politics will help you develop your own clarified perspective on what your government can and should do. Do a bit of research and reading to familiarize yourself with some of the classics of political and economic theory—for example, Adam Smith on capitalism and Karl Marx on communism, or Alexis de Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America.” But also stay in tune with current events and your own experiences, and how these shape your views on government."
