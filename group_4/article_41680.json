Quickly comb your hair a second time to distribute the heat protectant evenly. Damp hair absorbs heat protectant more effectively, but you can still apply it to dry hair. You may use argan oil or other natural heat protectants instead, but set the iron to a low temperature to protect your hair further. This will make it less effective."

[5] X Research source Choose a temperature setting based on your hair: For thin hair, use the lowest heat setting. For average hair thickness, use medium heat (about 300–350ºF / 150–177ºC). For thick hair, use high heat (400–450ºF / 200–232ºC). To be safe, you may want to start lower and work your way up until you can straighten the hair in one pass. If you aren't using heat protectant, use low temperatures only. Be aware that there is a high risk of burning.

People with thin hair can skip this step or divide it into two to four sections, while people with thick hair may need many more. Clip every section out of your way, except for one section of the lowest layer. [7] X Research source You'll be working with locks of hair 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) thick. Each section can include several locks of hair, as long as it's convenient and easy to separate and hold one lock at a time. Section off the top section of your hair by lifting it and tying or clipping it in a half ponytail. You'll need total access to the lower layers of hair."

      "content": "Clamp the iron above the roots. Place your flat iron 1–3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) above your scalp. Close the two heated sides together, with the hair between them. Straightening too close to your scalp may damage the roots or burn your scalp. Be sure not to clamp too firmly, as this will create a ridge at the top of your hair. Leaving the iron in one place for too long will also cause a ridge. If there is excess hair falling out of the iron, open the iron and try again with a smaller amount of hair."

Don't twist or move the iron from its path, or you may end up with crimps in your hair. It is normal to see steam coming from your hair and the iron. Your hair is not burning; this is just the heat protectant evaporating a little. If you see a lot of steam, or smell burning hair, move the iron more quickly. If your hair is particularly curly or frizzy, start with a few short strokes near the top, before dragging slowly as described."
