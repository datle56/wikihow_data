      "content": "Wrap and secure the belly band around your midsection. After birth, take the belly band and wrap it around your abdominal area so that it’s snug, but not constricting. [2] X Expert Source Jami Yaeger Parenting Specialist Expert Interview. 29 September 2020. Most belly bands use hook-and-loop fastener closures or other simple fasteners, so adjust these until the band sits securely around your belly and supplies light-moderate pressure, without restricting your mobility or ability to breathe. There are a number of different belly bands on the market, so consult your model’s packaging for specific application instructions. Wearing the wrap too tight may actually slow healing or lead to other postpartum complications, like back pain. On the other hand, wearing a loose band won’t provide effective support. Note that full-sized bands that cover and apply pressure to your entire belly are only for use after giving birth. If you’re still pregnant, opt for a similar maternity support belt and fasten it securely on your hips, on the under curve of your belly.

      "title": "Put the belly band under or over your clothing, to your preference.",
      "content": "Put the belly band under or over your clothing, to your preference. Some belly bands are thin and discreet enough to be worn under your usual clothing. Others are a bit bulkier (these usually provide more pressure and support), and may feel more natural worn over your shirt. [6] X Research source Wearing a band over your clothes might not give you the same level of direct support as having the band pressed up against your skin, but may provide a more comfortable layer of padding between you and the band. Try both ways for 10-20 minutes, and use whichever feels most comfortable for you. If you are recuperating from a C-section, applying the band to your skin (but over a bandage) may help support and protect your incision. Consult the care label on your band for washing instructions. When in doubt, soak the band in mild detergent and cool water for about an hour, rinse it thoroughly, then let it air dry for 4-5 hours."

Wraps are perhaps the most common type, and cover your entire midsection, offering the most support.

Belts are thinner than wraps and are often meant to support weight during pregnancy, but may be worn postpartum for support, as well. Some bands are multi-part and have straps that can be adjusted for more customizable pressure and support. Pregnancy shapewear is often more discreet and comfortable, but may provide less support. Avoid cinchers or corsets, which are primarily aesthetic and don’t do much to offer meaningful support."
