      "content": "Choose your necktie and set the length before making the knot . Select the necktie you think that goes best with your outfit. Line the blade and tail up over your shoulders to set the length. Then, begin to assemble the knot. A dimple is easily added to any kind of knot, so it doesn’t matter which particular knot you choose. [1] X Research source The blade refers to the larger piece of fabric that hangs in front. The tail is the skinnier piece of the tie that sits behind the blade."

      "content": "Stop tying the tie at the point where you’re about to secure the knot. When you get to the part where you pull the blade down all the way through the knot to tighten the tie, stop. Slide the blade 3/4 of the way through the knot and gently let the tie hang. Leave at least 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of space between the portion of the blade looped over the knot and the top of the knot itself. [2] X Research source Maintain enough slack in the blade and knot to reach in between the space where the front portion of the knot covers the blade."

      "title": "Line your tie up and check the length before adding the dimple.",
      "content": "Line your tie up and check the length before adding the dimple. Make sure that the knot is assembled perfectly and that the blade is at the perfect length before proceeding. The bottom of the blade should rest over your belt buckle, so if there is 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of space remaining between the top of the blade and the knot, your blade should be hanging roughly 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) above the belt buckle. [3] X Research source You cannot add a dimple after tightening your necktie, and the dimple won’t look nearly as good if you loosen the knot after adding it to adjust the length of your tie. If you need to reassemble the knot or adjust the length, repeat these steps to create a new knot."

      "title": "Slide your thumbs under the loop on top of the knot.",
      "content": "Slide your thumbs under the loop on top of the knot. Insert your thumbs underneath the portion of the blade that is loosely sticking out the top of the knot. Orient your palms to face up so that you’re holding the loop with the pads of your thumbs. Keep your hands as symmetrical as possible for an even dimple. [4] X Research source Folding the dimple from above is a little easier than adding it from below, but you have less control over the size of the dimple."

Transfer your grip on the loop to your nondominant hand and hold the loop in place. [5] X Research source You don’t need to squeeze hard to hold the dimple in place."

Slide the dimple through the front of the knot. The dimple will slide behind the front of the knot and emerge underneath it. Pull the blade all the way through to tighten your tie and secure the dimple. [7] X Research source The dimple should sit in the middle of your tie. If it isn’t, you may be able to adjust the tie by pulling the indentation in the dimple to the left or the right."

Use your index finger to apply pressure to the center of the fabric and add your dimple. Hold the fabric in place with your thumb and middle finger while maintaining the dimple with the index finger on the same hand. [8] X Research source Some people use their nondominant hand to do this while other people prefer their dominant hand. Do whatever feels most comfortable to you. Adding the dimple from below requires a little more dexterity, but you have more control over the location and the size of the dimple."

      "content": "Grip the sides of the knot gently with your other hand. Use your free hand to grab the edges of the knot by the bottom edge of the fabric. Do not squeeze or pull on the knot—the goal here is to simply stabilize it while you tighten your tie. [9] X Research source Most people naturally squeeze the knot a little when they normally their tie. Resist the urge to do this, since the dimple will be harder to hold in place if you don’t leave yourself some room inside of the knot."
