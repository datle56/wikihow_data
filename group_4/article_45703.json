      "title": "Soak your tucking tape in warm water to break down the adhesive.",
      "content": "Soak your tucking tape in warm water to break down the adhesive. Use a wet washcloth to dampen the tape, or try sitting in a warm bath for a few minutes. Make sure the entire length of tape is thoroughly soaked for a faster, less painful peel. If you’re in public, it’s not always possible to soak your tape before removing. Don’t worry! Most tapes will peel off fairly easily without a soak."

      "title": "Peel the tape away slowly to reduce pain and skin irritation.",
      "content": "Peel the tape away slowly to reduce pain and skin irritation. Grab one end of the tape and gently start to pull the strip away. Keep your grip on the tape firm and pull slightly downward, away from the skin. The phrase “rip the bandaid off” does not apply here! Some tapes peel off more easily than others. Medical tape or specialized tucking tape are your best options. Duct tape should never be used. [1] X Research source For the smoothest peel, shave your skin 1 to 2 days before applying your tucking tape. Pulling tape off of body hair can be painful and cause red bumps or irritation.

      "title": "Use medical adhesive remover if your skin is sensitive or the peeling is painful.",
      "content": "Use medical adhesive remover if your skin is sensitive or the peeling is painful. Adhesive removers are inexpensive and can be found at many drug stores, general merchandise stores, or online. Apply the remover according to the instructions to remove your tape and any remaining residue. Cooking oil, dish washing detergent, or nail polish remover can also soften or remove tape residue from your skin. Use these sparingly since they can be harsh, and thoroughly wash afterward."

      "title": "Relax your abdominal muscles to ease your testicles into your scrotum.",
      "content": "Relax your abdominal muscles to ease your testicles into your scrotum. If you’re new to untucking, try laying on your back or performing a deep breathing exercise to loosen up the muscles around your inguinal canals. Your testicles might lower on their own once the tension is gone. [3] X Research source Try a hot shower or bath to help you relax. The heat will loosen things up and encourage your balls to drop on their own."

      "title": "Use your fingers to guide your testicles to their resting position.",
      "content": "Use your fingers to guide your testicles to their resting position. Sometimes, your balls just need a little help returning to their usual spot. If leftover adhesive or muscle tension is holding them in their tucked position, gently pull your penis to its usual position first. Next, carefully use 2 or 3 fingers to reach inside the inguinal canals and nudge your testicles back down into the scrotum. Take your time with this step. This is a sensitive area, and rushed or jerky motions can be painful. Listen to and trust your body."

      "title": "Take a shower after untucking to thoroughly clean your genitals.",
      "content": "Take a shower after untucking to thoroughly clean your genitals. Tucking causes excess moisture to form in your crotch, which can lead to odor, infection, or irritation. Give your genitals a good scrub to prevent these side effects and remove any remaining adhesive and dampness. Dry thoroughly before putting your clothes back on. [4] X Research source Try an antifungal powder on your genitals while you’re tucked to prevent excess moisture buildup."

      "title": "Take your time to untuck carefully and safely.",
      "content": "Take your time to untuck carefully and safely. Try not to rush or untuck “on the go,” and make sure you have all of the supplies you need to do it safely and pain free, like adhesive remover or access to warm water. In the case of your balls, slow and steady wins the race. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Untuck after 4 to 8 hours to give your balls a break and avoid injury.",
      "content": "Untuck after 4 to 8 hours to give your balls a break and avoid injury. It can feel amazing and affirming, but a tuck is not meant to last 24/7. Listen to your body and untuck when you feel discomfort, you’re doing an activity that causes you pain, or your drag show is over (if you’re tucking to perform). Excess tucking increases your risk of conditions like testicular torsion, epididymitis, or orchitis. [6] X Research source It’s important to take tucking breaks to pee, too. Drinking less or holding in your pee for long periods of time can lead to dehydration or UTIs."

      "title": "Untuck immediately if you feel pain.",
      "content": "Untuck immediately if you feel pain. Some discomfort is normal, but a tuck should not hurt you. Untuck right away if you feel pain in your testicles or abdomen, nausea, or dizziness. Take a break and wait until the pain subsides before tucking again. If your tuck is consistently painful, try a different method or see a gender-affirming doctor for more solutions. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for signs of irritation on your penis, scrotum, and inner thighs.",
      "content": "Check for signs of irritation on your penis, scrotum, and inner thighs. Frequent tucking might cause rashes, sores, red patches, bumps, or sensitive skin. If your skin is consistently irritated after tucking with tape, try a different method (like gaffs or tight underwear) next time or see a gender-affirming doctor for other options. [8] X Research source Allow your skin to heal as much as possible before applying tape or tucking again."
