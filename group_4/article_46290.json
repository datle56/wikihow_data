      "title": "Open the ratchet all the way using the release catch.",
      "content": "Open the ratchet all the way using the release catch. The release catch, also known as the release lever, is a smaller handle that disengages the ratcheting handle. It’s located in the center of the top movable piece of the ratchet. Pull up the release catch and flip the ratchet fully open. Set the open ratchet on a table before you so that the spiked wheels (cogs) are facing upwards. [1] X Research source Does the handle move freely without pressing the release catch? If so, you unlock your ratchet by opening it all the way so that the handle is perfectly in line with the portion of the ratchet attached to the strap. Note: The “strap” part of the ratchet strap is the side with only fabric. The “ratchet” refers to the side with the actual locking mechanism. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Thread the strap through the middle of the mandrel.",
      "content": "Thread the strap through the middle of the mandrel. The key part of the ratchet strap system is the mandrel. The mandrel refers to the two metal strips at the bottom of the ratchet where the two metal components meet. To thread the strap, slide the fabric through the opening in the middle of the mandrel. [3] X Research source Pro tip if you’re loading a truck or trailer: Put a single twist in the strap before feeding it through the mandrel so that the topside of the strap on one side is the underside of the strap on the other side. This will capture a bit of the wind and keep the strap from sliding off the item. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Flip the end of the strap and pull it over the top of the mandrel.",
      "content": "Flip the end of the strap and pull it over the top of the mandrel. Once you’ve threaded the strap through the middle of the mandrel, flip the end of the strap over. Pull this end back through the ratchet using the slot in between the top of the mandrel and the bottom of the release catch. [5] X Research source The strap should now be doubled over on the strap side of the ratchet strap."

      "title": "Continue feeding the strap through the mandrel until it feels taut.",
      "content": "Continue feeding the strap through the mandrel until it feels taut. Remember that you can always tighten the entire thing using the ratchet later, so don’t worry if you’ve got slack in your strap. [6] X Research source If you need help picturing what’s going on here, the strap is now wrapped around the top bar of the mandrel in a U-shape. When you eventually tighten the strap using the ratchet, the mandrel will spin and bundle up all the excess strap fabric to make everything taut."

      "title": "Secure the cargo with the S-shaped strap hooks.",
      "content": "Secure the cargo with the S-shaped strap hooks. Ratchet straps can easily secure cargo in a truck bed, moving van, or wherever you need to tie something down. Move your cargo where you want it to stay, then place the ratchet strap across your cargo. Loop the S-hooks anywhere where they’ll stay in place. [7] X Research source There are typically dedicated hooks or grooves for ratchet straps in truck beds and van walls. You can also hook the S-hooks to themselves. Simply wrap the ends of the ratchet straps entirely around your cargo and connect the two S-hooks together. To hold multiple objects together and keep them in place, you’ll need two ratchet straps. Use one strap to secure the objects together and the other strap to wrap around them."

      "title": "Crank the ratchet to tighten the strap until the cargo feels secure.",
      "content": "Crank the ratchet to tighten the strap until the cargo feels secure. Pull the ratchet back and forth to shorten the length of the strap through and tighten it. Once it feels taut and secure around your cargo, stop ratcheting. Tug at the strap and check it for give—it should feel tight and secure. [8] X Research source Be careful not to over-tighten. Too much pressure could damage your ratchet strap or your cargo."

      "title": "Lock the strap securely in the folded (closed) position.",
      "content": "Lock the strap securely in the folded (closed) position. The ratchet is unlocked when it is laid flat in a straight line, and locked when it is folded on top of itself. Flip the ratchet into the closed position by applying pressure until you hear a click. This means that the strap is locked into place and should hold your cargo securely. [9] X Research source If you don’t hear the click, tug on the strap and buckle to make sure it’s secure. If it comes loose, you may have a faulty ratchet strap."

    {
      "title": "Pull and hold the release tab to unlock the strap.",
      "content": "Pull and hold the release tab to unlock the strap. This will override the ratcheting function and release the lock. The release tab should be easy to access and located on the top of the ratchet. [10] X Research source If you can’t locate the release tab, check your ratchet strap’s operation instruction manual. Don’t see a release tab? Some ratchet straps don’t have a manual unlocking feature. To unlock these straps, simply push down on the handle and pull the handle up."

      "title": "Open up the ratchet all the way and pull the strap loose by hand.",
      "content": "Open up the ratchet all the way and pull the strap loose by hand. Flip the ratchet completely open so it lays flat, then pull on the non-fixed side of the strap. This will release the strap from the ratchet’s hold and allow you to completely remove it. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Fold the ratchet together to close it for storage.",
      "content": "Fold the ratchet together to close it for storage. Locate the release tab once again and hold it down while you flip the ratchet closed. This will keep the ratchet in the locked position until it is ready to be used again. If you don’t have a release tab, just close the strap until you hear a click."
