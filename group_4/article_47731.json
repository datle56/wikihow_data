      "title": "“Welcome on board” is more formal than “Welcome aboard.”",
      "content": "“Welcome on board” is more formal than “Welcome aboard.” Although both mean the same thing, it’s more common to see “Welcome aboard” because it tends to be more casual and friendly than “Welcome on board.” That’s why you might see “on board” more in written communication, like in an email, informational packet, or message. Similarly, you might have colleagues and friends say “aboard” more than “on board” because it’s less formal. You might also hear the phrase “onboarding,” which means to make sure a new employee is familiar with the team, its tools, and its methods of doing things. [4] X Research source Both “welcome aboard” and “welcome on board” are technically grammatically correct, but “welcome aboard” is generally considered to be more accepted and common."
