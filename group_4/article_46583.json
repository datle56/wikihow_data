      "content": "Remove the fire blanket by pulling down sharply on the tabs hanging from the bottom of the package. Fire blankets are generally stored in small bags with two white tabs hanging down. Pulling on the tabs will quickly release the blanket, allowing for quick access in the event of an emergency."
    },
    {
      "title": "Protect your hands.",
      "content": "Protect your hands. You do not want any flame or smoke to hurt your hands. Roll the corners of the blanket over your hands to protect them. You can also use flame retardant gloves if you can get them on time to deal with the situation promptly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the blanket over the fire.",
      "content": "Place the blanket over the fire. Once you have the blanket secured over your hands, place it over the flames. Do not throw it, but lay it down gently. Start with the nearside of the flames and move in. Throwing the bottom of the blanket on the far side first can cause flames to creep up over the blanket, worsening the situation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off any heat source, such as a stove burner.",
      "content": "Turn off any heat source, such as a stove burner. If the flame was started by any heat source, such as an oven, stove burner, or space heater, turn the heat source off. This will decrease the amount of time it takes for the fire to suffocate. Expect some smoke to run through the blanket. This is normal. It is not a sign the blanket itself is on fire or not working properly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the blanket in place for at least 15 minutes.",
      "content": "Leave the blanket in place for at least 15 minutes. Leave the blanket at the heat source until flame is suffocated. This should take about 15 minutes. Do not attempt to move or touch the blanket until it's cool again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Call the fire department.",
      "content": "Call the fire department. Call the fire department. If you can't get the fire out yourself, you need emergency assistance. Even if you do get the fire out, you need to contact the fire department to make sure the flame is fully extinguished and there's no chance lingering embers or heat could cause another fire."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap someone whose clothes are burning in the fire blanket.",
      "content": "Wrap someone whose clothes are burning in the fire blanket. If someone's clothes are on fire, wrap him or her in a fire blanket. Once again, use the edges of the blanket to protect your own hands to prevent getting burned. Roll them in the blanket until it's securely in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Have the person stop, drop, and roll.",
      "content": "Have the person stop, drop, and roll. Instruct the person in danger to stop, drop, and roll. This is a classic safety technique used to diminish fire. A person stop moving, drops to the ground, and rolls until the fire suffocates."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seek medical assistance.",
      "content": "Seek medical assistance. Burns caused by fire should be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible. Even if you think the burns look minor, any injury caused by fire should be evaluated by a medical professional. Take the person whose clothes were on fire to the ER immediately."

      "title": "Make certain the fire blanket is stored in an easily accessible quick-release container.",
      "content": "Make certain the fire blanket is stored in an easily accessible quick-release container. You want to make sure you have quick access to a fire blanket in the event of an emergency. Store it in an easy-to-reach place that you can access without too much trouble. It's best to store fire blankets in the kitchen, as this is where most home fires break out. The sooner you can get to, and use, a fire blanket, the better the chances are of containing the fire."

    {
      "title": "Dispose of a fire blanket after use.",
      "content": "Dispose of a fire blanket after use. Fire blankets are not designed to be reused. It can be dangerous to use a fire blanket again if it's already been used to fight a fire. Wait until a fire blanket is room temperature to the touch before disposing it. Just to be safe, it might not be a bad idea to douse the fire blanket in water before disposal."

      "title": "Replace a fire blanket as soon as possible.",
      "content": "Replace a fire blanket as soon as possible. You should never be without a fire blanket or extinguisher in the event of an emergency. As soon as possible, replace any fire blankets in your home."
