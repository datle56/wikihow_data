      "content": "Rule out allergies. Allergies can be a common cause of watery eyes in cats. Like humans, cats can be allergic to certain allergens that cause a histamine reaction in the body. In turn, that can cause symptoms like watery eyes. [1] X Research source The vet can run an allergy test on your cat to determine if that's the cause. Cats can be allergic to pollen, trees, and grass, just like humans. They can also be allergic to things like milk, rubber, dust, flea bites, certain foods, and some fabrics (wool, nylon).

      "title": "Ask about a cold.",
      "content": "Ask about a cold. Before you can alleviate the effects of the virus that’s causing your cat's cold, including the watery eyes, you need an expert opinion. The two main viruses that cause colds are herpes and calici. Three bacteria can cause cold-like symptoms, too: mycoplasma, bordetella, and chlamydia. While even a vet may find it difficult to determine what virus or bacteria is causing the problem, they may be able to narrow down the options to determine the best treatment."

      "title": "Discuss conjunctivitis.",
      "content": "Discuss conjunctivitis. If your cat has a \"cold,\" they may have developed a more serious eye condition called conjunctivitis. Typically, the treatment for this condition is the same as treatment for the infection, but it's important to take your cat to the veterinarian for a diagnosis if they think your cat has developed conjunctivitis."

      "title": "Expect a stain test.",
      "content": "Expect a stain test. This test lets the veterinarian see your cat's eyes better. Basically, the vet adds a dye to the cat’s eye which can illuminate problems in the cornea. The vet will then use a blue light to check out the eye more closely. [3] X Research source A stain test can show an ulcer or erosion on the cornea."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be ready for other tests.",
      "content": "Be ready for other tests. Your veterinarian will likely perform other tests to determine the cause of your cat's watery eyes. For example, they may flush the tear duct system to see if it has good flow. They may also do a pressure test on the eye to rule out glaucoma (which is high pressure in the eye that can damage the optic nerve). [4] X Research source Cat scans, MRIs, or radiographs may also be needed."

    {
      "title": "Look for symptoms of a \"cold.\"",
      "content": "Look for symptoms of a \"cold.\" Cat colds are much like human colds. That is, you'll see things like a runny nose, runny eyes, and sneezing. Your cat may also be a bit more lethargic than normal. These symptoms in tandem may indicate your cat has a cold. However, a cold in a cat can be caused by a number of viruses or bacteria, so it's important for your cat to see the veterinarian. You shouldn't try to wait it out. Your cat can't pass a cold to you, and you can't pass a cold to a cat. However, they can pass cold viruses or bacteria to each other. Just like with humans, you won't find a \"cure\" for a viral cold. Rather, your can give your cat some medications to help alleviate some of the effects of the virus. Other medications may keep the virus from recurring. Colds can also lead to conjunctivitis, particularly if the cold is caused by herpes, chlamydia, or mycoplasma. With conjunctivitis, your cat will squint more and have watery eyes, but the discharge from your cat's eyes may be green, yellow, gray, dark, or rusty looking rather than clear. The cornea and iris may turn colors, as well: the cornea may redden, while the iris may look dull. These symptoms may not show up in both eyes."

      "title": "Treat other colds with the antibiotics.",
      "content": "Treat other colds with the antibiotics. Bacterial colds are slightly easier to treat than viral infections. That is, your cat can actually be given medications that will eradicate the bacteria, rather than just treat the symptoms. See your veterinarian to get the proper antibiotic medication to treat your cat's particular infection. Feline calicivirus is also treated with antibiotics since no particular drug helps with the virus itself. You'll just be giving medications to alleviate the problems it causes. Antibiotics keep the cat from developing other infections. With this virus, your cat will also likely receive pain medications."

    {
      "title": "Use eye drops.",
      "content": "Use eye drops. Eye drops are needed when the eye is showing problems because of the virus. Betadine eye drops are a relatively gentle antiviral eye drop, and can be administered at a veterinary office. For more severe infections, your veterinarian will likely prescribe cidofovir."

      "title": "Alleviate stress.",
      "content": "Alleviate stress. Besides treating the underlying infection, eliminating stress in your cat's life can also help suppress the infection, particularly if it's caused by the herpes virus. The herpes virus can go into remission, but it will still be in your cat's system. It can be brought to the surface again if the cat is under stress. Try isolating your cat in its own room, diffusing pheromone sprays in the area where they spend most of their time, and/or bringing more toys into their environment to help reduce stress. [5] X Research source The main stresses in a cat's life are things like a new pet in your home, you being gone for extended periods (on vacation), the cat being boarded, and changes in the routine or environment (such as moving or remodeling). While you can't eliminate all of your cat's stressors, you can try to keep them to a minimum."

      "content": "Use antihistamines for allergies. Cat allergies are treated much like human allergies. That is, most of the time, your cat will be prescribed an antihistamine to help deal with the body's reaction to an allergen. [7] X Research source The main antihistamines used for cats are Chlor-Trimeton, Benadryl, Atarax, and Tavist. [8] X Research source Steroids may also be helpful when your cat has a particularly bad allergy attack, but they should only be used for a short period. Ask your vet if it's a good option for your cat."

If you have a board certified veterinary dermatologist do an allergy test, they will be able to tell you what things your cat is allergic to so that you can limit exposure. For instance, if your cat is allergic to pollen, grass, trees, or some bugs, you can keep the cat inside and keep the windows closed as much as possible. You can make sure dust is minimized around the house and switch foods to find one your cat isn't allergic to. [9] X Research source"

Use a feline shampoo that’s recommended by a veterinary physician, and use it as frequently as they recommend to use it. You can also give your cat a bath using a colloidal oatmeal, hypoallergenic, or hydrocortisone shampoo (made for cats) to help alleviate some of the itchiness your cat is experiencing.

It could also be something like sand, glass, metal, or really any small object that attaches to the cat's eye. [12] X Research source You'll see watering, of course, as well as redness and swelling. The cat may try to scratch at its eye, and the eye might twitch a bit. It’s best to see a board certified veterinary ophthalmologist if there’s something wrong with your cat's eye."

      "content": "Watch for signs of a scratch. Cats are sometimes able to get scratches or ulcers in their eyes. They can accidentally catch their eyes with one of their own claws, or an eye could be scratched by another cat (either in play or in a fight). They can also catch their eye on other objects. Even not enough tears can cause a cat to get an ulcer in its eye, as the eyelid rubs against the eye without lubrication. [13] X Research source"

In some cases, the eye may need to be sewn up. The vet will also likely prescribe antibiotics, either in eye drop form or a pill. [14] X Research source In some cases, the eyelid may need to be sewn closed for a period to heal."
