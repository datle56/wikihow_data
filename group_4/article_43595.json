To learn how to type quickly on a computer keyboard, most people need time to become accustomed to it, and the same is true for your phone's texting software. You might find that the swiping style is quickest and most reliable, or you may find that you touch type your messages quickest. [1] X Research source If there are a few different styles for texting on your phone, you'll likely want to give each a try for at least a couple of days.

      "content": "Train your dictionary. Most cell phone texting software allows you to customize your dictionary so it doesn't auto-correct certain words or so that it learns new words it wasn't initially programmed with. This feature can usually be accessed in the system/settings app of your phone, which is often represented by a gear icon. Select this, and find your language/keyboard options. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Phones notoriously have difficulty telling names and other proper nouns apart from ordinary words. For example, you may have to put the name \"Tere\" in your phone to prevent it from auto-correcting the name to the word \"there.\""

If you find that you frequently use certain expressions, you can save yourself from typing out the whole phrase by teaching your texting software the expression. Much like training your dictionary, you'll have to go to the system/settings of your phone (often represented by a gear), and set this up in the language/keyboard options. Some phrases to consider include... What are you up to? Sorry, I'm busy right now. Where are you? I'll be right there. I'm running late. Let's catch up soon. [8] X Research source"

Some texting software comes with a tutorial that teaches you the basic workings of your phone's texting app. However, these often leave out unique or advanced features, some of which might help you text even faster! To learn the ins and outs of your phone's texting software, you should read a detailed description of its features online. A common feature that you might find helpful, especially for larger phones, is a split keyboard layout. This aligns half of your keyboard to either side of your screen. This may make it easier, and quicker, for your thumbs to reach keys that would have otherwise been hard to reach in the middle of your screen. [9] X Research source [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Experiment with different styles of texting for touchscreen phones. The two main styles of texting for touchscreen phones are generally called \"swiping\" and \"touch type.\" These two techniques are a matter of preference, and you may find that one works best for you over another. You may also find that your phone only supports one and not the other. You'll have to experiment to see which works best for you and check the user manual of your phone to see what style of texting is supported. Swiping involves touching the first letter of the word you want to type on the touchscreen of your phone and pathing your finger through the rest of the letters of the word without taking your finger off the screen. Once you have finished your word, you should remove your finger from the screen. Touch type is much like the typing you would do on a keyboard. For each letter of the word you are trying to type, you should tap your screen where the letter appears on your on-screen keyboard."

      "title": "Use predictive or manual texting for non-touchscreen phones.",
      "content": "Use predictive or manual texting for non-touchscreen phones. Non-touchscreen phones rely on a button based keypad, where each number of your pad generally corresponds to a set of letters of the alphabet. Some phones may also have small keyboards, which you can use as you would a normal computer keyboard, pressing each letter on the keyboard to type words. Phones that use a number pad with corresponding letters often have predictive texting software, like... T9 predictive text. T9 stands for \"text on 9 keys,\" with the 9 keys being the numerals 1 through 9 on your keyboard. Zero is often used for punctuation. By pressing the numbers that correspond to the letters you need for the word you are trying to text, T9 software should suggest likely options. For example, on many T9 keypads, \"43556\" will suggest the word \"hello.\" Once you have pressed the keys that contain the letters you need to spell your word, you may have many suggested words to choose from. Generally, you'll have to select from among these options by using a directional pad on your phone. Manual texting involves pushing the numbers on your number pad to cycle through the letters associated with that particular number. To manually type the \"h\" in \"hello,\" you'd have first to press the number 4 two times in rapid succession. The first press would suggest \"g\" and the second \"h.\" In this fashion, you'll have to type your words to text. With manual texting, you may have to press a select key, like a button in the center of your directional pad, to select the letter after rapidly pushing the number key. In some cases, your phone will interpret a long pause after pressing the key as the selection of the letter. Some predictive software will offer suggestions for likely words before you finish typing. This can speed up your text time, removing unnecessary keystrokes. To make the most of this feature, you may have to practice using your texting software to develop an intuition for it.
