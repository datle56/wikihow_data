The letters themselves do not mean anything, but the hashtag is believed to boost visibility on the app, helping someone’s content reach a wider audience. Users often put #xyzbca in their captions because they think it will “trick” the algorithm into prioritizing their video so more people see it (and they can possibly go viral). [1] X Research source TikTok hasn’t publicly revealed how their algorithm curates content for the For You Page, so there’s no guarantee that using #xyzbca will help you gain more views. Most users think the app analyzes your likes and activity, then uses that information to recommend videos on the page."
