The langot works much like a jock strap, so it can be used in contact sports like football, soccer, or cricket, where your genitalia could potentially be hurt. It's often worn in traditional forms of wrestling. To protect this area, insert a cup under the langot. [8] X Research source Make sure your athletic cup fits properly. It should cover your genitalia completely and fit up against your body. Once you have the langot in place, slip the cup underneath the fabric, positioning it over your genitalia, which should be up against your body and pointed toward the back. The rounded end of the cup should be toward the front."
