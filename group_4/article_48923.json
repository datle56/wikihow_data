      "title": "Choose a topic that you have passion or interest in.",
      "content": "Choose a topic that you have passion or interest in. Judges and your audience will notice when you’re excited about a specific topic while you present it. Do initial research and brainstorming about a variety of topics in order to find one that you enjoy learning about. [1] X Research source Check with the competition you’re entering since they may have a list of prompts you need to choose from. Look at the guidelines for the competition to figure out how long to make your speech. How much information you include depends on if you need to give a 5-minute or 10-minute speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a hook related to your topic.",
      "content": "Create a hook related to your topic. Start your speech with a surprising fact, personal anecdote, or rhetorical question to get your audience interested in your topic. Following the hook, state the purpose of your speech, why it’s important, and the main points you’ll be talking about. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re writing a speech about climate change, you may start with, “According to NASA, the last 136 years, 17 of the 18 warmest have occurred since 2001.” [3] X Research source Keep your introduction to 4-5 sentences so you have time to expand on your points in the body of your speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide your speech into main points of emphasis.",
      "content": "Divide your speech into main points of emphasis. Think about the arguments and points you want to discuss on your subject and organize them in a way that flows naturally. Aim to have 2-3 main talking points in your speech that are well-researched so your audience knows you’re an expert on the subject. [4] X Research source For example, you may start with a personal story, talk about the issues of the point you’re discussing, and then offer recommendations or methods that could help. Breaking your speech into smaller parts helps your audience remember what you’re talking about. Make sure all the parts of your speech are related to the main topic. Otherwise, the judges and audience will get distracted by your tangents."
    },
    {
      "title": "End the speech on a question for your audience to leave a lasting impression.",
      "content": "End the speech on a question for your audience to leave a lasting impression. Start by reemphasizing why the topic you’re speaking about is important so it sticks with the audience. Summarize the main points of your speech before your last statement. When you’re finished, try to ask a question or pose a challenge to the audience to keep them interested and engaged. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Practice your speech multiple times before the competition.",
      "content": "Practice your speech multiple times before the competition. Try reading your speech out loud in front of a mirror to watch yourself as you deliver it. If you can, ask friends or family members to sit down and listen to your speech and ask for feedback. Make adjustments to your speech’s content based on the feedback you receive. [6] X Research source Ask a teacher at school to look over your speech or listen to you present so you can get academic feedback. It’s okay to reference notecards while you’re presenting, but don’t rely on other visuals, such as slideshows or graphs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dress professionally.",
      "content": "Dress professionally. Wear black, grey, dark blue, or any other conservatively colored button-up shirt that’s not too flashy. Make sure to wear either dress pants or a dress that’s at least knee length. If you have one, wear a blazer that matches your pants. Wear comfortable, but nice shoes, such as loafers or pumps. Avoid wearing clothes that are wrinkled or something that you would wear while you go out with your friends. Wear a red tie to show that you are business-oriented."
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak clearly and loud enough for everyone to hear.",
      "content": "Speak clearly and loud enough for everyone to hear. Speaking in a clear voice helps portray that you are confident and makes it easier for your audience to understand you. Make sure you project your voice by speaking loudly, but not so much that you’re shouting at the audience. [7] X Research source Smaller public speaking competitions may not have a microphone, so be sure to practice what volume you use while you’re speaking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use good posture and body language while presenting.",
      "content": "Use good posture and body language while presenting. Stand up straight and keep your shoulders relaxed so you look more confident. Avoid slouching or crossing your arms while you’re talking since it will look like you aren’t interested in what you’re speaking about. [8] X Research source Use your hands while you speak so you avoid nervous fidgets, such as fiddling with your clothes or touching your hair. Move around while you’re presenting rather than staying in one place so you seem more engaging and confident."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smile often.",
      "content": "Smile often. Smiling not only helps hide any nervousness while you give your speech, but it also makes your voice sound happier. If you smile while you present, the audience will see you as a friendly, approachable, and confident presenter. [9] X Research source Only smile if it’s appropriate for your speech topic. For example, if your topic is about climate change, you may keep a more serious tone, but you may smile while talking about ways to prevent it. Try using humor in your speech if it’s an appropriate topic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain eye contact with the audience to form a connection.",
      "content": "Maintain eye contact with the audience to form a connection. Avoid looking at your feet or at the walls since your audience will notice that you’re nervous. Instead, choose 3 or 4 places in the crowd to focus on so other’s feel connected to you while you’re presenting. Don’t focus on anyone for too long or they may start getting uncomfortable. Remember to make eye contact with the judges of the competition as well since they’ll be scoring your performance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change the speed you’re talking to add emphasis to points.",
      "content": "Change the speed you’re talking to add emphasis to points. Take time to pause after you pose a question or hit an impactful moment of your speech. If you need to make your point sound urgent, start speaking faster so the audience can still understand what you’re saying. When you present data or statistics, slow down to add emphasis. Changing the pace of how you talk will make you seem less monotone and keep the audience interested. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank the audience at the end of your speech.",
      "content": "Thank the audience at the end of your speech. Once you’ve finished your speech, thank the audience for taking the time to listen to you. That way, they feel appreciated and you end on a lasting impression so they can remember you. [12] X Research source For example, after you give your closing line, you may say something as simple as, “Thank you all for listening.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Brainstorm your prompt if the competition gives you time.",
      "content": "Brainstorm your prompt if the competition gives you time. Many impromptu speeches during competitions give you a few minutes to prepare material. Think about the prompt you’ve been given and write down the main points you want to address on notecards. Make sure to keep all your points succinct and related to the prompt. [13] X Research source Some competitions may let you split your time differently. For example, if you're given 7 minutes, you may use 1 minute to prepare and 6 to speak, or you can prepare for 3 minutes and present for 4."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a simple structure to organize your points in a clear way.",
      "content": "Use a simple structure to organize your points in a clear way. Since you don’t have a lot of time to prepare an impromptu speech, stick to a 3-4 point structure to address the issue. Even though the structures are simple, you can adapt them to many prompts and situations. [14] X Research source Use the PREP method to explain your Point, give a primary Reason for your point, share an Example, and reiterate your Point a final time. Talk about the pros and cons of the point you’re addressing before coming to your own conclusion about what would work best."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give a direct response to the prompt.",
      "content": "Give a direct response to the prompt. Judges for the competition will look first and foremost to see if you’ve addressed the prompt you’re given. Make sure to discuss the point of your speech right away in the beginning so your audience knows what you’ll be talking about. [15] X Research source For example, if your prompt is why manners are important, you may start off with, “Using manners shows how much you respect another person and establishes what you expect in return.” Since impromptu speeches tend to run for a shorter time than prepared speeches, keep your intro short and too the point."
    },
    {
      "title": "Elaborate your response with arguments.",
      "content": "Elaborate your response with arguments. Expand on the main point of your speech in 1-2 talking points. Make sure they are directly related to your topic and explain the argument you’re making. [16] X Research source For example, if you’re arguing why manners are important, you may make the argument that treating someone rudely will make others lose respect for you and that you don’t care about their time. Avoid rambling about your point since you’ll have a strict time limit."
    },
    {
      "title": "Conclude your speech with a question for your audience to think about.",
      "content": "Conclude your speech with a question for your audience to think about. Leave a lasting impression with your audience by reiterating your point, and asking a rhetorical question. This can make your speech more cohesive and it engages the audience so they’re more likely to remember your speech. [17] X Research source Make sure to thank the audience when you’re finished."
