    {
      "title": "Wait a few days.",
      "content": "Wait a few days. When new neighbors are moving into their home, they likely have a lot on their plate. Instead of interrupting them as they’re carrying boxes and unpacking, wait a few days to let them settle in before stopping by to introduce yourself. Feel free to introduce yourself if you happen to bump into your neighbors as they’re moving in, but be considerate of their situation and keep it brief. People usually like having peace to clear their minds, so know it's ok to not start a conversation everytime you see your neighbors. Sometimes, a smile and a wave are more than enough. Try simply saying hello, giving your name and saying, “I’ll stop by another time to talk when you aren’t busy.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring other neighbors with you.",
      "content": "Bring other neighbors with you. When you go to introduce yourself to new neighbors, you may want to bring some other neighbors with you. This can reduce any possible awkwardness that may arise in conversation by incorporating more people into that conversation. You may want to open by saying something like, “welcome to the neighborhood, I’m (provide your name) and these are some of the people that live in the neighborhood.” Then introduce your fellow members of the community. Bringing a group of neighbors with you can limit the number of times different neighbors stop in to meet the new people in the neighborhood. If you participate in a neighborhood organization like a neighborhood watch, your group may want to go introduce yourselves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be courteous and respect their privacy.",
      "content": "Be courteous and respect their privacy. Not everyone enjoys interacting with new people, and your new neighbors may be hesitant to have a lengthy conversation with you or a group of people. Keep your meeting brief, and if your new neighbor seems uncomfortable, politely introduce yourself and leave. If your new neighbor suggests that it isn’t a good time, respect their wishes and come back another time. Don’t take offense if your neighbors aren’t welcoming. It is difficult for some people to meet strangers. If your neighbor seems busy or uninterested in talking right now, you may want to ask when would be a better time. Try saying something like, “I can tell you’re busy. Is there a better time for me/us to stop by?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Form a neighborhood welcoming committee.",
      "content": "Form a neighborhood welcoming committee. You may want to gather a group of your neighbors together to establish a committee that can aid in welcoming new members of your community. You can ask your neighbors if they would be willing to share in some of the responsibilities of assembling a welcome basket or care package and plan to introduce yourselves as a group. Welcome committees can allow you to extend a positive gesture to new neighbors while sharing the work load and limiting how much each person has to do. You may want to ask your new neighbor if they would be interested in joining the committee in order to get to know the other members better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave a note.",
      "content": "Leave a note. You may also be a bit uncomfortable introducing yourself to new people, but still wish to let your new next-door neighbor know that they’re welcome in the neighborhood. If this is the case, you may want to leave a polite note to introduce yourself. Write a brief note that introduces yourself and identifies which house you live in. Try writing something simple like, “Welcome to the neighborhood from your new friends next door! Let us know if you need anything!”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Include baked goods.",
      "content": "Include baked goods. Baking a treat for your new neighbors is a traditional gesture that many people may really appreciate. It’s important that you are considerate of possible allergies when doing so, however and don’t leave something you cook with your neighbor’s children in case there are ingredients in it that they shouldn’t eat. [1] X Research source You may want to include a note with a list of the ingredients in what you make so your neighbors can avoid anything they may be allergic to. Purchasing baked goods may not be as traditional, but is certainly still a nice gesture."

    {
      "title": "Share contact information for local businesses.",
      "content": "Share contact information for local businesses. Moving to a new neighborhood often includes finding local businesses to use for things like utilities, trash pickup, and emergency repairs. You can help your new neighbors settle in by providing them with fliers or a simple list of services offered in the area and who to contact to take advantage of them. Some services you may want to provide contact information for are: Local plumbers or electricians that can respond to emergency calls. Local law enforcement and fire services. Cable and satellite television providers. Internet service providers. Trash pickup or removal services."

    {
      "title": "Add a local specialty.",
      "content": "Add a local specialty. Many places have locally known specialties and treats that you can include in your welcome basket. Providing some samples of local specialties can help new neighbors learn about their new home in a delicious way. If your town is known for its dairy farms, you may want to include some locally made cheese, for instance. Gift certificates are also a nice way to incorporate local specialties."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide local takeout and delivery menus.",
      "content": "Provide local takeout and delivery menus. Everybody doesn’t feel like cooking from time to time, especially when they haven’t been able to unpack their kitchen yet. New members of the community likely won’t know which restaurants are nearby and which ones can deliver to your neighborhood. Help them out by providing delivery and takeout menus from restaurants you use. You can offer a simple list of local delivery places instead of a collection of menus."

    {
      "title": "Bring a bottle of wine.",
      "content": "Bring a bottle of wine. A bottle of wine can be a nice gesture when welcoming new neighbors to the area. While not everyone enjoys wine, they may choose to simply set it aside to share with guests in the future. Wine is considered to be a traditional housewarming gift and can serve as a great accent to some of the food you may include in your welcome basket. Choose a bottle of wine that you enjoy, as it can also serve as a way to get to know each other if they invite you to share it. You may want to find a wine that pairs well with foods or snacks you have included in your welcome basket. You can find suggestions of what kinds of wine go well with certain snacks here: https://www.foodandwine.com/wine/15-rules-great-wine-and-food-pairings"

      "title": "Throw a block party.",
      "content": "Throw a block party. You may want to organize a block party and invite your new neighbors so they can meet one another in a comfortable environment. By throwing the party yourself, you alleviate the stress new members of your neighborhood may have about having people over before they have their house completely unpacked. Make sure to invite the rest of your neighbors to the block party so they all have a chance to meet the new neighbors. Block parties are also a great way for your new neighbor’s children to meet other neighborhood kids."

      "title": "Invite your new neighbor to join community groups.",
      "content": "Invite your new neighbor to join community groups. If you are a member of a community-based group like a neighborhood watch, you may want to invite your new neighbors to attend a meeting with you to get to know other member of the community. Bring your new neighbor to the meeting and introduce them to the group. Other groups you may want to invite your new neighbors to join may include book clubs or school-oriented groups like the PTA (if they have children)."

    {
      "title": "Throw a cocktail party.",
      "content": "Throw a cocktail party. Depending on the time of year and your neighborhood, you may want to throw a cocktail party instead of an outdoor block party. You may want to plan your cocktail party for the evening and offer enough advanced notice for your neighbors to find a babysitter if they need one. If your new neighbors have children, you can suggest a babysitter you trust to them for them to be able to attend. Like a block party, throwing a cocktail party can alleviate the stress of having people over for your new neighbors while still allowing them to meet the neighborhood. Hosting a dinner party at your place is also a great low-key way to welcome the new neighbors. [2] X Research source"
