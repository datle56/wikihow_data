Don’t overthink the title, just describe the experiment. Do not make it longer than ten words. A good example for a title would be: \"Effects of various chemicals on the growth of Escherichia coli.\""

These are the results that you expect to observe over the course of the experiment. The hypothesis is not always going to be confirmed by the results, rather it is just the prediction made prior to performing the experiment. A good hypothesis will begin with \"We hypothesized...\" and end with the anticipated outcome of the experiment, \"that X affects Y.\""

This is usually accomplished by a literature review of published, peer-reviewed, primary materials. [4] X Research source Define terminology. If your report uses any specific terminology or jargon, explain it in the introduction. Use the appropriate vocabulary to explain what you are doing. You are likely trying to test, document, or describe something. You cannot prove, verify, or demonstrate the truth about something as this is not possible within the realm of science. Make sure your word choices reflect this within your report."

They prefer that you paraphrase all your sources and present the ideas in your own words. You can weave the information into your text with a simple lead in phrase and by adding a parenthetical note. Paraphrasing can be confusing. You can't just change a few words. For example, \"Most professors do not want to see quotations in a lab report,\" can be paraphrased as \"Using quotations to quote sources for your lab report is frowned upon by many professors.\" The idea is still clear, though the sentence is unique and original."
