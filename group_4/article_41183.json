However, if you're more specific by choosing something measurable, you're more likely to be able to commit. The SMART method is helpful here, which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and time-bound. This step covers \"specific.\" For instance, your goal could be \"Start running 20 minutes a day to improve my health and work towards running a 5K in one year's time.\" Be sure to break your goals into small steps. If you commit to running a half marathon tomorrow when you've never run a day in your life, you're going to fail. You have to start small enough that you can actually accomplish your goals, such as saying you will start by running in 5 minute stretches. [1] X Research source"

In the instance above, you have made it your goal to run a 5K by a certain date, which is measurable. It's also small enough to be achievable. If it's not, you won't work towards it.

      "content": "Learn to tolerate uncertainty. If you can't tolerate any uncertainty in your life, you'll spend a lot of time hesitating and trying to rid yourself of the inevitable uncertainty you face. It's better to learn to tolerate that uncertainty, so you can spend your energy on moving forward with your goals. [10] X Research source Start by noting what behaviors you practice to reduce uncertainty. For instance, maybe you double-check emails to friends to make sure they're perfect or maybe you only go to restaurants you know you like because you don't want to be caught trying something new that you may not like. Once you figure out the behaviors, make a list of which ones would cause you the most anxiety to stop doing. Starting on the lower anxiety end, work on stopping or changing some of the behaviors on your list. Try letting someone else plan an evening for you or sending a text to your friend that you didn't double-check for errors. Take note of the times you are able to accomplish stopping these behaviors, and how it made you feel. You may find that it makes you excited or that you still feel anxious. Nonetheless, you'll likely find that the result is still fine, even if everything didn't go as smoothly as you would have liked. Keep working on your behaviors to ensure you keep tolerating uncertainty in your life."

The problem with this type of thinking is that sometimes it stops you from acting. The first step is recognizing that you're trying to be a perfectionist, to the detriment of your actions, and trying to change how you think. Start by listing all the ways that perfectionism has helped you in the past. Maybe it has helped you get good grades, for instance. Next, list the ways that not being a perfectionist could hurt you. Think about what the worst thing that could happen is. For instance, maybe your fear is that you would lose your job. For each fear, put in a reality check, such as \"It's unlikely that I would lose my job over one mistake.\""

When you catch yourself thinking something should be all or nothing, ask yourself if you're hurting yourself or helping yourself. For instance, say you are putting together cookies for your kid's class. If you are trying to make each cookie perfect and failing, to the point that you want to throw them in the trash, stop and think. Would the kids prefer slightly imperfect cookies or no cookies at all?"

Instead, you need an intrinsic sense of self-worth. Make another list. This time, write down things you like about yourself, such as \"kind to animals\" or \"fun to be around.\" Part of putting less value on accomplishments is learning to love yourself. To love yourself, you need to practice self-care, meaning that you value yourself as much as you value you others. That means talking to yourself in the same way you would talk to a friend, rather than the negative voice you may sometimes use. For instance, instead of saying, \"Wow, I look ugly today,\" you could say, \"Wow, my hair looks nice today.\" You have to learn to find the positive in yourself. It also means accepting yourself as you are. Yes, you have both positive and negative qualities, but so does everyone. You have to learn that all of it is a part of you, and you need to be able to love all of it, even as you may want to improve yourself."
