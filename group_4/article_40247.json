The consonants Samoan uses are the following: F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, V, and R. The \"g\" sound makes an \"ng\" sound, such as \"sing\" or \"fling.\" K, H, and R aren't used as much as other letters; they mostly show up in words borrowed from other languages.

      "title": "Add words like \"te\" to change the tense of verbs.",
      "content": "Add words like \"te\" to change the tense of verbs. In Samoan, verbs don't change tense. Rather, you add words to show whether you're speaking about the present, past, or future. When speaking about the present, add \"te\" before the verb. \"Te\" is the only tense that's added directly before the verb; otherwise, it comes at the beginning of the sentence. [11] X Research source For instance, to say \"I dance,\" you'd say, \"'Ou te siva,\" where \"Ou\" is \"I\" and \"siva\" is \"dance.\" To say \"I've danced,\" use \" 'Ua 'ou siva,\" where \" 'Ua\" is added at the beginning to make this tense. With past tense, put the extra word at the beginning of the sentence. For instance, to say \"I danced,\" you'd write \"Na 'ou siva.\" Similarly, to say \"I was dancing,\" you'd write \"Sā 'ou siva.\" The \"Na\" and the \"Sā\" place it in the past tense. For future, add \" 'Ole'ā,\" such as \" 'Ole'ā 'ou siva,\" meaning \"I will dance.\" To make the verb negative, add \"lē\" before it: \"Ou lē siva,\" which means \"I don't dance.\""
