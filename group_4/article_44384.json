      "title": "Use the inside of your foot to stop the ball with an inside trap.",
      "content": "Use the inside of your foot to stop the ball with an inside trap. The inside trap is the easiest trap to master and also the most common one in soccer. As the ball moves toward you, rotate your foot toward the ball so that the inside of your foot is facing it. Let the ball hit you and move your foot back slightly, cushioning the blow and keeping the ball close to you. [1] X Research source If the ball is coming at you from an angle, you’ll need to be able to adjust your footing on the fly. You should always trap the ball with the foot furthest from it, as this will be easier to rotate to face the ball. You shouldn’t kick the ball as you go to stop it. The ball should move your foot rather than your foot moving the ball."

    {
      "title": "Put your foot on the ball to perfect the step trap.",
      "content": "Put your foot on the ball to perfect the step trap. Placing one foot on the ball will stop it completely, allowing you to get your next shot exactly right. As the ball moves toward you, lift up your dominant foot over the ball and let it hit your heel. The ball should bounce forward slightly and stop right in front of you. If you bring your foot down on the ball just as it hits your heel, you can stop it completely. This is great for lining up a new shot to send the ball to the other end of the field! Getting the timing of the step trap perfect is the most difficult part. Keep an eye on the speed of the ball as it comes toward you to make sure you trap it. As always, practice makes perfect!"

    {
      "title": "Practice leaning back slightly for a chest trap.",
      "content": "Practice leaning back slightly for a chest trap. A chest trap will stop a ball coming toward your torso and drop it down toward your feet. Stay on your toes so you can move around, and keep your knees slightly bent as the ball comes toward you. Lean back slightly as the ball hits your chest, letting it bounce forward and land near your feet. [2] X Research source As with any type of trap or drill in soccer, getting the chest trap right will take a lot of practice. Find someone who can throw the ball to you and help you adjust to the movement needed to get the trap perfect. Make sure the ball hits you in the chest rather than in the stomach or abdomen. Don’t push back against the ball as it hits you. A trap should keep the ball where it is rather than pushing it away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lift your dominant leg to catch the ball for a thigh trap.",
      "content": "Lift your dominant leg to catch the ball for a thigh trap. A thigh trap involves bouncing the ball off the middle of your upper leg to gain control of it quickly. As the ball comes toward you, lift one of your legs so your thigh is slightly diagonal. Let the ball hit the middle of your thigh and begin straightening your legs as it falls toward your feet. [3] X Research source Make sure the ball hits in the softer part of your thigh near the middle. If it hits your knee it will bounce off at an unpredictable angle, and if it hits too high up on your leg you might catch it in your gut instead. Your thigh should be at an angle of around 110-degrees from your torso. This will help the ball drop in front of you, rather than bouncing straight up or sending it too far away."

      "title": "Stay calm when attempting a head trap.",
      "content": "Stay calm when attempting a head trap. If you can move past your instinct to duck out of the way, trapping the ball with your head can stop more difficult shots. Stay on your toes to move into the path of the ball and let it bounce off of your forehead. The ball should lose momentum against your head and drop down in front of you. [4] X Research source This is a different move than heading a soccer ball . You should allow the ball to move your head back slightly, rather than pushing against the ball to move it forward. Heading the ball will send it far away rather than giving you better control of it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move into the path of the ball.",
      "content": "Move into the path of the ball. Keep your eye on the ball as it moves in your direction to work out where you can intercept it. Stay on the balls of your feet and move quickly so you can get into the balls path when it's coming your way. [5] X Research source Be ready to adjust your positioning if someone else touches the ball and changes its path. Don’t assume you’re in the right place to trap the ball until you’ve touched it."

      "title": "Choose between the step trap for more control and the inside trap for more agility.",
      "content": "Choose between the step trap for more control and the inside trap for more agility. Both the step trap and the inside trap have their pros and cons, so you’ll need to be able to quickly chose the right one for the situation you’re in. Use the step trap if you have time to gain control of the ball, and go with the inside trap to get control of the ball more quickly. If you’ve practiced both types of ground trap for long enough, you should be able to make this choice almost without thinking. Go with whatever seems best for the moment rather than overthinking what you’ll do."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trap the ball and keep on moving.",
      "content": "Trap the ball and keep on moving. Using whichever trap you think is best for the situation, trap the ball to slow it down and bring it under your control. Once you’ve got it, keep the ball moving by passing it to a teammate or dribble it past the other team. Don’t worry if you make a mistake or have the ball taken off of you; it just gives you another chance to practice trapping the ball."

    {
      "title": "Anticipate where the ball will land and where you need to be.",
      "content": "Anticipate where the ball will land and where you need to be. If the ball is flying through the air toward you, you’ll need to be able to move quickly to where you think the ball will be. Stay on the balls of your feet and watch the ball as it travels. Focus on the arc of the ball and try to position yourself where you think it will land. [6] X Research source It can take some practice to be able to work out where you need to be to trap a ball. Don’t worry if you don’t get it exactly right the first time. It’s always better to be behind the ball than in front of it when you’re trying to trap it. If you’re too far back to trap the ball in the air, you may still be able to trap it on the ground."

    {
      "title": "Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lean back slightly.",
      "content": "Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lean back slightly. When you’ve found the right place to stand to trap the ball, get in a comfortable stance to intercept it. Keep your feet apart so that you can keep your balance. Lean back slightly to keep an eye on the ball as it comes toward you. [7] X Research source Over time, you should find yourself standing in this position naturally. If you’re still learning, move into a stance that you’re comfortable with - it’s much better to be in the right place and looking at the ball than trying to get your stance exactly right!"

      "title": "Trap the ball with your head, chest or thigh.",
      "content": "Trap the ball with your head, chest or thigh. Watch the ball as it comes closer to you and judge the height it will be at when you intercept it. Let the ball hit your head, chest, or thigh and move your body back softly to cushion its momentum. [8] X Research source If the ball seems too high to trap it with your head, take a step or two backward to get into a better position. Similarly, if the ball is too low for a thigh trap, you should either move forward to get a better position or move backward to attempt a ground trap instead. It’s safer to move forward or backward to trap the ball, rather than trying to duck or jump to catch it. Ducking or jumping will likely make you lose control of the ball and your body. It might be difficult to focus on getting the trap exactly right if you’re under the pressure of a big game. Try not to overthink it. Let the instincts you built up when practicing kick in to help trap the ball."

      "title": "Drop the ball toward your feet and follow its movement.",
      "content": "Drop the ball toward your feet and follow its movement. The ball should bounce lightly away from you and fall toward your feet. Keep watching its motion and start moving in the direction that it’s going. Once you have control of the ball, you can pass it to someone else or continue dribbling it toward the goal!
