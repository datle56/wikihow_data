      "content": "Urge delivery alerts Shein to prioritize and expedite a delayed order. “Urge Delivery” or “Urging Dispatch” is a free option that appears on your package’s tracking page. By clicking the button, you inform dispatchers that you’d like for them to speed up the shipping process, if possible. This is dependent on Shein’s assessment, however, and does not always guarantee you’ll receive the package more quickly. [1] X Research source Unlike expedited shipping, which it is sometimes mistaken for, urge delivery is only available after you purchase an item, as it isn’t a shipping option but a way to attempt to speed up processing and shipping. “Urge Delivery” and “Urging Dispatch” mean the same thing—the option you’re presented with simply depends on your region. Urge delivery is available to request for most items and orders."

      "title": "Click “Track,” then locate “Urge Delivery.”",
      "content": "Click “Track,” then locate “Urge Delivery.” Once you’ve found the order you’re looking for, double-check that the shipping address is correct, then click “Track.” Click the button that says “Urge Delivery” or “Urging Dispatch.” This is usually located near the shipping details or order status. These options mean the same thing and will notify Shein’s team of your request. [3] X Research source When you click “Urge Delivery,” Shein will typically respond with a message letting you know they’ve received your request and will contact the logistics provider."

      "title": "Use urge dispatch if you aren’t receiving shipment updates.",
      "content": "Use urge dispatch if you aren’t receiving shipment updates. Most commonly, Shein customers urge delivery if they notice their package hasn’t been processed or appears to be stuck somewhere in the supply chain with no updates. If you’re worried your package is stuck, click “Urge Delivery” to hopefully give it the push it needs to move on to the next shipment stage. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for urge delivery if you need the item by a specific date.",
      "content": "Opt for urge delivery if you need the item by a specific date. If you’re purchasing a gift, an item for an event or holiday, or anything else you need immediately, try urging dispatch to let them know it’s important for you to receive your package in a timely manner. Even if it’s set to arrive on time, urging delivery might give it an additional boost."

    {
      "title": "Use urge delivery if you’re buying an item with limited stock.",
      "content": "Use urge delivery if you’re buying an item with limited stock. It can be really disappointing when you find an item you love only for it to sell out right when you tried to purchase it. On Shein, items with limited stock sell out quickly, so if you see something you want, order it as soon as possible and click “Urge Delivery” to reduce the chances of it selling out before your order is processed.

      "title": "Urging delivery doesn’t guarantee your package will arrive faster.",
      "content": "Urging delivery doesn’t guarantee your package will arrive faster. Because selecting “Urge Delivery” or “Urge Dispatcher” only sends the dispatcher a request to speed up the delivery process, it doesn’t always mean they’ll be able to. Some Shein users report that they’ve received packages within a few hours of clicking “Urge Delivery” while others state that they didn’t notice a difference in delivery times. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "No, urge delivery doesn’t cost anything.",
      "content": "No, urge delivery doesn’t cost anything. The urge delivery option isn’t a shipping method, so it doesn’t cost extra. Instead, clicking “Urge Delivery” or “Urge Dispatcher” simply lets the dispatcher know they should try to speed up delivery times if at all possible. This option usually becomes available when a package is already running behind schedule. [7] X Research source Some sources outside Shein seem to confuse urge delivery with expedited shipping. Unlike expedited shipping, the urge delivery option isn’t available at checkout and instead becomes available for some orders after they’ve shipped. Expedited shipping does cost extra."

    {
      "title": "Select express shipping at checkout.",
      "content": "Select express shipping at checkout. The easiest way to make sure your Shein package will arrive more quickly is to opt for express shipping. In general, an expedited package will arrive a few days to a week earlier than a package with standard shipping, though the exact time frame depends on what and when you order. Be aware that express shipping can be quite costly, however. [8] X Research source Note that express shipping is not available for P.O. boxes and APO/FPO addresses. Currently, Shein’s express shipping costs $12.90 USD for orders under $129.00. It’s free for orders over that price. Standard shipping currently costs $3.99 and is free for orders over $29.00."

      "content": "Opt for the free On-Time Delivery Guarantee service. While this option doesn’t necessarily help your package arrive faster, it does give the company an incentive to ensure it arrives by the promised date. If you select this option at checkout and your package does not arrive by the expected date, you’re entitled to 500 free Shein points. [9] X Research source On-Time Delivery Guarantee is available with both standard and express shipping, as well as orders eligible for free shipping."

      "title": "Order your packages earlier in the week.",
      "content": "Order your packages earlier in the week. In general, shipping companies operate Monday through Friday, so orders placed late in the week or over the weekend might not get processed until the following week. By ordering on a Monday or Tuesday, your order will likely be processed more quickly, which means it should be shipped sooner. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Shop during off-peak seasons.",
      "content": "Shop during off-peak seasons. Like most online retailers, Shein receives more orders during holidays or special sales events. Because more orders are being placed, processing and shipping times might be delayed. If possible, try to avoid ordering during these times so your order can be shipped more quickly.

      "content": "Contact customer service. If your order seems to be taking longer than it should, reach out to Shein’s customer service and explain the situation. Depending on where your order is in the shipping process, they may be able to speed it up, explain the situation, or offer another solution. [12] X Research source In general, it’s best to wait until after the promised delivery date has passed to contact customer support about the status of your package."
