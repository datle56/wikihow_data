    {
      "title": "Start the synopsis after you have finished the project.",
      "content": "Start the synopsis after you have finished the project. In most cases, agents and publishers will only be interested in completed manuscripts. Writing your synopsis after you finish the manuscript will help you identify the main characters, plot points, and conflict. [1] X Research source Established authors who have published before may be able to get away with submitting an incomplete book proposal, but most new authors will need a full manuscript. You will need to know how the story ends to write the synopsis, as a synopsis will include the resolution of the story. Re-read the first sentence of every chapter or scene to refresh your memory on the plot points. [2] X Expert Source Richard Perkins Writing Coach Expert Interview. 1 September 2021."

    {
      "title": "Make a list of your main characters.",
      "content": "Make a list of your main characters. This may include the protagonist, a love interest, a villain, or a sidekick. Only the most important characters should be mentioned in a synopsis. Take a minute to write out who your main characters are. [3] X Expert Source Richard Perkins Writing Coach Expert Interview. 1 September 2021. Make sure each of your characters is dynamic, rather than flat. They all need to be well-rounded and capable of change. Additionally, each character should impact the story in a significant way."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sketch out the major plot points in your story.",
      "content": "Sketch out the major plot points in your story. The synopsis will cover the main narrative arc of your story. This arc usually does not include subplots, unless the subplot is important to the overall conclusion of the main arc. Try to outline the main conflict, rising action, and conclusion of your story. [4] X Expert Source Richard Perkins Writing Coach Expert Interview. 1 September 2021. If you wrote a novel or memoir, you may want to write down a one sentence summary of each chapter. For example, you might write, “Rory looks for his father and meets an old friend.” [5] X Expert Source Richard Perkins Writing Coach Expert Interview. 1 September 2021. If you wrote a screenplay or play, make a list of what happens in each act. You can write, \"Rory enters the warehouse, and a shootout ensues.\" If you have a collection of short stories or poetry, identify the main themes of each work. For example, you might state, \"This collection explores memory, childhood, and innocence.\""

    {
      "title": "Identify what is unique about your story.",
      "content": "Identify what is unique about your story. Publishers and agents read hundreds of synopses a week. To make yours stand out, highlight what is unique in your own story. Use this angle to make your synopsis different or interesting. Does your story have an interesting point of view? If so, be sure to mention it. You can say, “This story centers around the last dwarf in the underground kingdom.” Does your story have a unique twist? You can mention the twist while still leaving some mystery. For example, you might say, “Jean Paul soon realizes that the murderer may be closer to him than he thinks.” Does your story fulfill a certain niche in the market? You might want to demonstrate who might be interested in this story. For example, you can write, “This memoir explores what it means to be a member of the lost generation.”"

    {
      "title": "Research how long the synopsis must be.",
      "content": "Research how long the synopsis must be. Every publishing house and agent will have different requirements for synopsis length. Before writing your synopsis, look up a few publishing houses, film production companies, or agents. They should list their requirements on their website. [6] X Research source Novel synopses are usually between two and twelve pages long. Screenplay synopses are usually one page long. Most are no more than 400 words long."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write in third person.",
      "content": "Write in third person. Even if you are writing a memoir or a book in first-person, always write the synopsis in third person, using \"he,\" \"she,\" \"it,\" and \"they\" as pronouns. Throughout the synopsis, restate the main characters' names frequently. [7] X Research source Most film production companies and some book publishers may ask you to capitalize every letter of a character's name. For example, you would write \"JENNA\" instead of \"Jenna.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Introduce your main characters and conflict at the beginning.",
      "content": "Introduce your main characters and conflict at the beginning. The first paragraph should introduce all of the main characters while giving a general summary of the entire plot. The first paragraph should hook your readers without being too specific. [8] X Research source For example, you might start the paragraph by saying, “When her plane crashes in the isolated reaches of the Amazon rainforest, Laura realizes that to survive, she must first overcome her inner demons.” As you introduce other characters, you should introduce them in relation to the main character. For example, you might write, “Laura is joined by the only other survivor, a mysterious archaeologist named Terry.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Summarize the main events of the plot.",
      "content": "Summarize the main events of the plot. Include any obstacles that the character faces and describe how they overcome these obstacles. Avoid subplots and any backstories in your synopsis unless they are crucial to understanding the main plot. [9] X Research source Don't go into too much detail about subplots and minor actions. You don't want your synopsis to be confusing, so focus on the main story line. For example, you might write, \"After James beats the river monster, he continues on to find the magic crystal. When he locates the cave, he finds it blocked. He agrees to trade his sword to a goblin in exchange for help.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "End with resolution of the book.",
      "content": "End with resolution of the book. Your reader should understand exactly how the plot resolves. This is not a good time to introduce any new information about the book. It is never a good idea to leave out the ending in a synopsis. A publisher or agent needs to know exactly how it ends. [10] X Research source You might say, \"Jun discovers that Ginny had stolen the diamond. The movie concludes with the police arresting Ginny.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Include only necessary information.",
      "content": "Include only necessary information. A good synopsis includes what the character does, feels, and confronts, but it does not include every detail of the plot. Leave out side characters whenever possible, and only write about the major events of the novel. Don’t include dialogue in your synopsis. Instead, just summarize what the characters said. Refer to minor characters by their role, not by their name. Instead of saying, “Lewis, a saxophonist who Joe encounters one night” you might write, “Joe meets a saxophonist.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Demonstrate character development and emotion.",
      "content": "Demonstrate character development and emotion. As you advance the plot, you should describe what your character learns and feels throughout the novel. Explore the mental and emotional state of your protagonist with every new plot twist or event. For example, you might write, “Invigorated by her new discovery, Cecilia rushes to contact Horatio, only to be shocked when she learns that he is already dead.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid complimenting your own writing.",
      "content": "Avoid complimenting your own writing. While you want to make your synopsis sound interesting, avoid commenting on the quality of your own work. Instead, let the plot speak for itself. Do not use phrases like “in one tear jerking scene” or “in a stunning flashback.” Simply describe the scenes as they happen. If you want to describe emotions you're hoping to convey in your work, focus on how your characters react to certain events, not how you expect the reader to react. For example, \"When Claire realizes the truth, she becomes disillusioned.\" Don’t assume what readers will feel. For example, don't say “Readers will gasp as they discover what Lord Melvin has in store for Lady Betty.” Instead, you might write, “As Lady Betty travels through the castle, she slowly realizes Lord Melvin’s intentions.”"

    {
      "title": "Format your synopsis according to the publisher's guidelines.",
      "content": "Format your synopsis according to the publisher's guidelines. While each publisher or agent may have their own guidelines for formatting, generally you will need to double-space your work. Use a 12-point font such as Times New Roman. [11] X Research source If you don't have guidelines, you should include your name and the title of your work at the top of every page. Always use one-inch margins when submitting work for publication."
    },
    {
      "title": "Proofread your synopsis.",
      "content": "Proofread your synopsis. Whatever you submit to a publisher or agent needs to be pristine. Carefully read through your work to eliminate any typos, misspellings, grammatical mistakes, or missing words. Edit for conciseness as well. Remove any unnecessary words, phrases, or clichés. [12] X Research source Try reading your entire synopsis out loud to catch any mistakes. You can hire a copyeditor to proofread it for you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask someone else to read over it for you.",
      "content": "Ask someone else to read over it for you. Get a friend or professional copyeditor to look over the synopsis for you. They can give you suggestions about what you may need to change before submitting it to an agent or publisher."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tailor the synopsis to each publishing house or agent you send it to.",
      "content": "Tailor the synopsis to each publishing house or agent you send it to. Do not just send the same synopsis out to every publisher. Instead, identify the submission guidelines of each agent or house, and change the synopsis to fit their guidelines. [13] X Research source For example, one publishing house may require you to cut down your synopsis to one page. In this case, focus on just the main conflict. Another may ask for four pages. In this one, you can go into more detail. If you do not tailor your synopsis to a publisher, they may not read your submission."
    },
    {
      "title": "Send out your synopsis with a query letter and samples.",
      "content": "Send out your synopsis with a query letter and samples. Usually, the synopsis is part of a proposal that may also include a query letter and a sample of your written work. Every publisher and agent has their own guidelines for these submissions, so read their author submission rules carefully. [14] X Research source A query letter should contain a short summary of your work, a brief paragraph explaining your credentials, and a reason why the agent should accept your submission. A sample may include one or two chapters, one act of a screenplay, or one short story out of a collection. In most cases, it will be the first scene or chapter."
