      "title": "Cut each orange in half.",
      "content": "Cut each orange in half. Slice the oranges crosswise around the middle (not on the stem ends). Do this for the Seville oranges and navel orange."

      "content": "Separate the seeds from the fruit. Nestle a non-reactive mesh strainer into a bowl. Remove the orange’s seeds as you squeeze the oranges over the strainer. Tie the seeds securely in cheesecloth or muslin, and set the pouch aside. [1] X Research source Seeds are high in pectin, which will give your marmalade the texture of a rich jelly."

    {
      "title": "Slice the oranges thinly.",
      "content": "Slice the oranges thinly. With a chef’s knife, cut each piece of orange into three parts. Leave the rinds on. Dice the parts into cubes as thinly as you can. Slice and dice the navel orange the same way. [2] X Research source The pieces should be no bigger than 1/3 of an inch (0.85 cm) long. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Boil the oranges.",
      "content": "Boil the oranges. Add the orange pieces to a pot of water, and bring the water to a boil. Continue simmering until the oranges are cooked through. Drain the water out of the pot. [4] X Research source Certain sour orange varieties are more resistant to cooking. Pre-boiling the orange pieces ensures that they will be fully cooked. The oranges should be covered with water; an exact measurement is not needed."

    {
      "title": "Cook the oranges and seeds in lightly salted water.",
      "content": "Cook the oranges and seeds in lightly salted water. Pour into the pot with the oranges 10 cups (2.5L) of water, the squeezed juice, and a pinch of salt. Add the pouch with the seeds in it to the pot. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce it to a simmer. Continue cooking for twenty to thirty minutes, or until the peels are translucent. [5] X Research source Once the peels are translucent, you can set the mixture aside overnight, if desired, to encourage the release of extra pectin."

      "title": "Boil the mixture with sugar.",
      "content": "Boil the mixture with sugar. Stir 8 cups (1.6 kg) of sugar, then bring the mixture to a full boil. Reduce the heat so that the water maintains a gentle boil. Stir the mixture occasionally. [6] X Research source Occasional stirring prevents the bottom of the mixture from adhering to the bottom of the pot and burning."

      "content": "Remove the seed pouch and chill a saucer in the freezer. Place a saucer in the freezer. After twenty minutes of the mixture boiling, remove the seed pouch with tongs and discard the pouch. Allow the mixture to boil for about twenty more minutes, stirring occasionally. [7] X Research source Chilling a saucer will assist you with checking how well the mixture will gel."

    {
      "title": "Check for doneness.",
      "content": "Check for doneness. Check the mixture with a candy thermometer for a jelling point of 220°F (104°C). With a cooking spoon, put a bit of the stirred mixture on your chilled saucer. Place the saucer back into the freezer. After a few minutes, observe whether the mixture is slightly jelled. If not, cook the mixture a bit longer until it gels properly. [8] X Research source After a few minutes in the freezer, the mixture should thicken somewhat, and wrinkle slightly to the touch. The saucer is just to test a small amount of the marmalade to verify that it’s finished cooking."

      "content": "Peel the oranges. Remove the orange part of the peel only by carving it away with a chef’s knife. You may find it easiest to peel in large, long pieces. Avoid picking up the white pith as much as possible. [15] X Research source The white pith is bitter, thus you want to cut as much of the orange part only as you can."

[17] X Research source Keep the oven door cracked open, and check the peels frequently. Cook the peels until they stiffen and begin to curl. The peels can change from dry to burnt quickly, thus you need to keep a close eye on them. This process can take anywhere from twenty minutes to forty minutes or more. Alternately, you can dry the peels in a food dehydrator."
