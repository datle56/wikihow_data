Just because you have started to feel differently about your friend recently doesn’t mean that he has any clue what’s going on. He may be perfectly happy with how your friendship is going, and not have any inclination towards changing your relationship at all. On the other hand, he may very well feel exactly the same as you, and be wondering about your feelings toward him. Start noticing how he acts around you. If he seems suddenly fidgety or self-conscious around you, this could be a sign that his feelings toward you are evolving into something more. Notice his body language: does he open the door for you, touch the small of your back, or look at you more often? If so, your feelings for him might be reciprocated. [2] X Research source Does he talk to you about other girls, or does he treat you like one of the guys? If so, his feelings for you might be more platonic."

Before you tell your best friend that you want more out of the relationship and potentially lose a great friendship, make sure that your own feelings are genuine and not a passing fancy. Even if your friend does feel the same as you, make sure that you’re willing to risk losing your friendship to pursue the romantic relationship.

Just take good care of your body, stay fit, eat right, and make sure that you look well-rested and feel confident when you see your best friend.
