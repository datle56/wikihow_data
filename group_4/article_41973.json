      "title": "Look for the integer.",
      "content": "Look for the integer. A mixed number will contain a whole number and a fraction. The whole number should be positive, negative, or zero because it's an integer. [1] X Research source For example, in the mixed number 1 3/4, 1 is the integer."

      "title": "Recognize the numerator.",
      "content": "Recognize the numerator. Look at the fraction and find the number above the dividing line. This number is the numerator and it will tell you how many parts there are of the fraction. [2] X Research source In the example 1 3/4, 3 is the numerator."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the denominator.",
      "content": "Find the denominator. Identify the number below the dividing line to find the denominator. This tells you how many parts it takes to make the whole number. [3] X Research source For example, 4 is the denominator in the mixed fraction 1 3/4."

    {
      "title": "Change the mixed numbers into improper fractions.",
      "content": "Change the mixed numbers into improper fractions. Multiply the integer by the denominator and add the numerator to come up with an improper fraction. Do this for both of the mixed numbers in your equation so you get 2 improper fractions. [4] X Research source For example, to convert 3 3/4, 3 x 4 = 12 + 3 = 15/4. Another example, 1 1/2 would be 2 x 1 = 2 + 1 = 3/2."

      "title": "Find a lowest common denominator if necessary.",
      "content": "Find a lowest common denominator if necessary. If your improper fractions don't have the same denominators, convert the fractions so they do. To find the lowest common denominator, multiply each part of a fraction by the other fraction's denominator. [5] X Research source For example to find a lowest common denominator for 15/4 - 3/2, multiply the 15 and 4 by 2 and multiply the 3 and 2 by 4. You should get 30/8 - 12/8. Then you can subtract the fractions. If the denominators of both fractions are the same, you can skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Subtract the numerators.",
      "content": "Subtract the numerators. Once the denominators are the same, you can easily subtract the numerators to get your result. [6] X Research source For example, 30/8 - 12/8 = 18/8."

      "title": "Convert the result to a mixed number",
      "content": "Convert the result to a mixed number . Divide the numerator by the denominator to get an integer and remainder. [7] X Research source For example, 18 รท 8 = 2 with a remainder of 2. This can be written as 2 2/8. If you'd like to convert the improper fraction into a decimal, simply divide the numerator by the denominator."

      "title": "Simplify the result if necessary.",
      "content": "Simplify the result if necessary. Look at the fraction or mixed number you got after subtracting and decide if you can reduce the fraction further. This will give you the simplest result. [8] X Research source The fraction in the example 2 2/8 can be reduced by 2 to get 2 1/4. Keep in mind that in some cases, you may not have a remainder."

      "content": "Find a lowest common denominator for the fractions if necessary. Since you've already subtracted the whole numbers, you're ready to subtract the fractions. If they have a different denominator, multiply each part of a fraction by the other fraction's denominator. [10] X Research source For example, multiply 3 and 4 by 2 to get 6/8. For the other fraction, multiply 1 and 2 by 4 to get 4/8. If your fractions have the same denominator, you can skip this step."

[12] X Research source For 3 3/4 - 1 1/2, you'll get 2 2/8. Simplify 2/8 by 2 to get 1/4. Your finished answer will be 2 1/4."
