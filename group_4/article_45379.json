      "content": "Try to open up your fallopian tubes with a pelvic massage. This is the one natural, noninvasive remedy that might help clear blocked tubes. One small study showed that 20-hours’ worth of professional massage over the course of a week showed some success in opening up blocked fallopian tubes. This isn’t guaranteed to work, but it has worked for some women with fully or partially blocked tubes. You may want to try this before considering invasive surgery.

A regular masseuse may not know the right procedure."

      "content": "Clear small blockages with a selective tubal cannulation. If the blockage is relatively minor and close to your uterus, then the surgeon will probably try a tubal cannulation. This is the least invasive type of surgery. Using only tiny incisions and a small wire, the surgeon can clear out the blockage and open your fallopian tube. This minor surgery might be all you need to correct the blockage. [4] X Research source The recovery time after a tubal cannulation is shorter than other types of surgery. You'll probably only need 2 weeks before you're feeling normal again."

      "content": "Repair damage in the middle of the tube with a tubal reanastomosis. This is a common type of fallopian tube surgery, and is often used if your tubes are blocked from scar tissue or disease. It works best if the blocked part is around the middle of the tubes. A surgeon will remove the damaged portion of the tubes, then attach the healthy tube parts. After recovering, you have a better chance of getting pregnant naturally. [5] X Research source This is also the surgery you’d need if you had your tubes tied in the past. It reverses the procedure."

      "content": "Clear fluid buildup with a salpingostomy if you want to try IVF. Sometimes, fluid builds up at the ends of the fallopian tubes and blocks them. A salpingostomy opens a new path in the tube to bypass this blockage. It might help you conceive through IVF by allowing sperm to get around the fluid buildup. [6] X Research source Unfortuantely, this procedure is usually only a temporary fix. Scar tissue tends to build back up and block the tube again. A salpingostomy is usually used to make IVF more successful. If you want to conceive naturally, ask your doctor if this is right for you."
