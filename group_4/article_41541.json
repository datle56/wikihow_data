      "content": "Keep your extensions in their original packaging for quick and easy storage. Whether it’s a box or a bag, as long as that container is still in good condition, you can continue to reuse it to keep your extensions safe and tangle-free. Put the box in your bathroom, bedroom, or wherever it’s easiest for you to access it. [1] X Research source If you don’t have the original packaging, any small box or resealable plastic bag would also work. This method is great because it keeps dust off your extensions. It works well for both short- and long-term storage."

      "content": "Hang your extensions in hair extension bags to make them easy to browse. If you have a lot of hair extensions, it’ll be much simpler to find what you need if you commit a little bit of closet space to your extensions. You can buy hanging hair extension bags at any beauty supply store. Just attach the weft to the hanger, put the hanger in the bag, and zip it closed. [2] X Research source Many hair extensions bags are clear or have a clear section so you can easily see what’s inside. If you don’t want to buy something new, you could also use a shirt or pants hanger for the same result. Place the hanger in a garment bag to protect your extensions from dust and keep them from getting tangled. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a plastic tote to store multiple boxes of extensions in one place.",
      "content": "Use a plastic tote to store multiple boxes of extensions in one place. Buy a large lidded plastic tote, preferably one that is see-through, and put all your boxed extensions into it. When you need a new look, simply grab the tote and pull out the one you need. [4] X Research source This tends to be more helpful if you’re not switching your extensions out for different ones every day, though you could still do it even then. If the boxes aren’t labeled, go ahead and write a short description of the extension it holds on the front of it. This will make it much easier to find what you’re looking for. You could also use this method with extensions stored in resealable plastic bags."

      "title": "Protect the color of your extensions by keeping them in a cool, dark place.",
      "content": "Protect the color of your extensions by keeping them in a cool, dark place. Regardless of how you store your extensions, put them somewhere away from the sunlight, like a closet or drawer. [5] X Research source Sunlight can cause the coloring on your extensions to fade, which is one of the last things you want to happen!"

      "title": "Remove your extensions before bed to keep them in good shape.",
      "content": "Remove your extensions before bed to keep them in good shape. Make it a part of your nighttime routine to always take out your extensions. This will help prevent unwanted breakage and keep them from developing hard-to-remove tangles. [6] X Research source You might want to plop right into bed on late nights, but if you can, force yourself to take them out. You’ll be glad you did it when you don’t have to deal with messy tangles the next morning."

      "title": "Brush your extensions before putting them away or washing them.",
      "content": "Brush your extensions before putting them away or washing them. After removing your extensions, spend a few minutes gently brushing through them. Start brushing at the bottom and work your way up to the roots. [7] X Research source Use a wide-toothed comb for the gentlest detangling action. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash your extensions",
      "content": "Wash your extensions every 6-8 wears or before long-term storage. Use sulfate-free and paraben-free shampoos and conditioners. Wash your extensions in a sink, then lay them out to dry on a clean towel. [9] X Research source Too much oil buildup can make it harder for your extensions to stay in place. For short-term storage, use your best judgment. If you recently washed your extensions, you probably don’t need to rewash them before putting them away for a few weeks."

      "title": "Let your extensions dry completely before putting them away.",
      "content": "Let your extensions dry completely before putting them away. If you can, let your extensions air dry on a clean towel. If you need to speed things up, use a blow dryer on the lowest heat setting. It’s essential to make sure they’re fully dry before putting them away to keep them from getting moldy or developing a weird smell. [10] X Research source Also, wet extensions are much more likely to tangle, which is something you want to avoid at all costs!"

      "title": "Seal your wefts before long-term storage to prevent shedding.",
      "content": "Seal your wefts before long-term storage to prevent shedding. Go to your local cosmetic store or hair salon to buy a sealant made for hair extensions. Follow the directions to apply the sealant to both sides of your hair extension’s wefts, then let them dry completely before putting them into storage. [11] X Research source If your extensions shed too much, they’ll end up looking a lot thinner than they did when you first bought them. Sealing them helps keep as many hairs in place as possible."

      "title": "Fold and roll the wefts when you’re putting them in a box or small bag.",
      "content": "Fold and roll the wefts when you’re putting them in a box or small bag. Once the extensions are clean, dry, and detangled, fold the clip sections over on themselves several times. Then you can wrap the hair around your hand to form a kind of donut shape with the hair. You could also hold the bottom of the extension and twist it in one direction to roll it up. [12] X Research source The “fold and roll” option works best when you’re planning to put your extensions into a box or small bag rather than hanging them up. Double-check that the clips are all closed before you roll the wefts. Otherwise, they could get bent out of shape."

      "title": "Wrap the extensions in a scrunchie when you plan on hanging them.",
      "content": "Wrap the extensions in a scrunchie when you plan on hanging them. Fold the weft over on itself several times, then wrap a scrunchie around the hair beneath the weft 2-3 times. This process keeps the hair from getting tangled while it’s in storage. [13] X Research source If you have multiple sets of extensions, like one blonde set and one brown set, keep them separated so that it’s easier to grab what you want. If a set has multiple pieces, keep them all together so that nothing gets misplaced. Avoid using a hair elastic or wrapping the scrunchie around too many times, which could crease the hair. If you don’t have a scrunchie, a hair donut or something similar would also work."
