      "content": "In the Bible, the number 3 signifies completeness. In Hebrew, three or shelosh or sheloshah means new life, harmony, and wholeness. [1] X Research source The repetition of the number 3 is believed to hold symbolic spiritual and phonetic meanings. Phrases, objects, and people in groups of 3 are considered prominent and divinely important. If something is complete, perfect, or whole, it’ll be in a group of 3. For instance, there are many groups of 3 in the Bible, including the Holy Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit)."

      "content": "Jesus rose on the third day. One of the most significant uses of 3 in the Bible occurs in 1 Corinthians when Jesus is resurrected. No matter what version of scripture you read, Jesus is always crucified and resurrected on the third day (or Easter Sunday). [3] X Research source As 1 Corinthians 15:4 states, “that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures.” Similarly, Jonah spent 3 days in the belly of a giant fish to foreshadow Jesus’s crucifixion: “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth” (Matthew 12:40)."

      "content": "God says things 3 times. If God or Jesus repeats something 3 times in the Bible, it’s especially important. This happens several times in scripture, with the most notable being: Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane 3 times (Matthew 36). [4] X Research source God calling to Samuel 3 times (1 Samuel 3:8). [5] X Research source Jesus telling Peter to “feed my sheep” 3 times (John 21:15). [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Using the same word 3 times.",
      "content": "Using the same word 3 times. Repetition is extremely symbolic in the Bible. After all, if something’s repeated, you’re bound to remember it. This draws attention to the given passage, highlighting an overall importance or divine message. Jeremiah says “land” 3 times to emphasize God’s message (Jeremiah 22:29). [7] X Research source Isaiah says “holy” 3 times to express his devotion and love for the Lord (Isaiah 6:3). [8] X Research source"

These gifts symbolize Jesus’s life story: Gold shows Jesus’s kingship, frankincense represents his deity, and myrrh symbolizes his death. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "There are 3 angels in Revelation. In Revelation 14:6-16, 3 angels appear to deliver messages. The first tells the world to worship and believe in God. The second announces the fall of Babylon. The third declares that those who receive the Mark of the Beast will be a victim of God’s wrath. [10] X Research source This story describes beasts who try to gain power and leadership over the Hebrews. Those who worship the beast wear a mark on their head, showing disloyalty to the Lord.

      "title": "Christians can remember the number 3 is a sign that God is everywhere.",
      "content": "Christians can remember the number 3 is a sign that God is everywhere. Even the number 3 isn’t immune to the Lord’s will. His power is everywhere—He built the world you live in. Take the number 3 as a reminder that He is always with you, no matter what. While this number isn’t necessarily holy, its significance in Christian faith is powerful all because of God’s word. Here’s what you can remember: The Holy Trinity shows that God is all powerful. He doesn’t need you—He has the weight of the world in His hands—yet He still loves you unconditionally. God may not be dependent on you, but He still cherishes your love (as shown through the Trinity’s trials and tribulations). The number 3 isn’t always significant outside of scripture. While the number 3 has a strong spiritual meaning in the Bible, it doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing in the real world. For instance, just because something occurs in 3, doesn’t mean it’s important or harmonious."
