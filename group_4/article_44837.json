      "content": "Determine the severity of the sprain. Sprains come in 3 grades. A grade 1 sprain has slight tearing of the ligaments, and will result in mild tenderness and swelling. A grade 2 sprain has partial ligament tearing, and moderate tenderness and swelling. A grade 3 sprain is a complete tear of the ligament, and will have significant swelling and tenderness around the ankle. [2] X Research source A grade 1 sprain usually does not require medical attention. Usually, a grade 2 sprain heals well at home with proper care. A grade 3 sprain should almost always be seen by a doctor to make sure there is no other damage to the ankle. Home treatment and management for all 3 grades is the same, but the higher the grade the longer it will take for the ankle to heal."

If necessary, use crutches to help distribute your weight and keep your balance when you walk. Take turmeric topically and internally to reduce inflammation. Arnica gel can be found at most pharmacies and can help with bruising. However, do try to move your ankle as much as possible without stressing the injury or putting weight on it. For instance, while you're sitting, you might gently rotate your ankle in circles or trace the alphabet with your foot.

Wrap a handful of ice, an ice pack, or a bag of frozen peas in a dish towel or a thin piece of cloth. Apply the ice compress to the injured ankle, and hold it there for 15 to 20 minutes. Repeat this every 2-3 hours for as long as swelling persists. Apply ice to your ankle even if you plan to go to the doctor. Ice limits inflammation, especially during the first 24 hours of the injury. Applying ice to any sprain will help reduce overall swelling and bruising. Alternatively, you can fill a bucket with ice water and immerse your foot and ankle. Leave the ice off at least 20-30 minutes between applications. It can both numb pain and reduce swelling. Too much exposure to the ice could lead to frostbite. If you have diabetes or circulation issues, talk to your doctor before applying ice.

Be sure to keep the wrap dry by removing the bandage when you are icing your ankle, and reapplying it after you remove the ice. Wrap an elastic bandage from your toes to your mid-calf, using even pressure. Keep the bandage on until the swelling subsides. Loosen the wraps if your toes turn blue, feel cold or begin to feel numb. You don't want the wrap to be too loose, but you don't want it to be too tight, either. You can also get slip-up or pull-up style bandages and braces. These are often beneficial because they ensure the even application of pressure without cutting off circulation to your foot."

Taping your ankle when you experience minor stress such as a sore joint or a twist can help provide you with extra support while still allowing you to be mobile. You wrap the ankle tape in much the same way as you do a bandage, but there are a few extra steps you should take first. Put heel and lace pads on the top and backside of your ankle before adding the under dressing. Wrap the whole area in pre-wrap. Wrap the top and bottom of the pre-wrapped areas with athletic tape to create anchors. Apply stirrups by taping a U-shape from one side of the ankle to the other, going under the heel. Wrap the rest of the pre-wrapped area in tape, working in a triangular pattern that goes around the ankle and under the arch of the foot."
