      "title": "WindowServer manages all the graphics on your screen.",
      "content": "WindowServer manages all the graphics on your screen. This process keeps your Mac’s graphical user interface working like it should. It manages your open windows, app icons, visual effects—basically, everything you can see on the screen at any given time. While this is a very important process for your Mac, it can also slow your computer down if there are too many things on the screen for WindowServer to manage. Every time you move a window, edit an image or document, or open a new tab in your browser, WindowServer has to render those elements on your screen."

To launch Activity Monitor, press command + space bar and type in activity monitor . Or, click on the Launchpad in your Dock , then type activity monitor in the search bar. Click the app in the search results to open it. You can also find it in the Utilities subfolder inside your Applications folder."

      "content": "Look at the %CPU column. To tell how much core processing power WindowServer is using, look at the second column from the left, “%CPU.” Ideally, you should see a number between 10 and 30%. Anything higher may mean that something isn’t working the way it’s supposed to, or that WindowServer has too many active graphics to manage."

      "content": "Close any windows you’re not using. You might notice that your computer slows down when you have lots of windows open. If you’re getting lags and you see that WindowServer is using up a ton of CPU power, try closing windows you don’t need and quitting apps you aren’t using."

      "content": "Clean up clutter on your desktop. The more documents, folders, and app aliases you have lying around on your desktop, the more work WindowServer has to do. You can save a little CPU usage by cleaning it up. In addition to removing apps from your desktop , you can also organize your desktop files into folders or group them into stacks. [1] X Research source To create a stack, click the desktop and open the View menu at the top of the screen. Select Use Stacks . [2] X Research source Your files will be instantly bundled into related groups (such as Images, PDF Documents, and Screen Shots), with each group using only a single icon. Simply click on a stack to expand it and see everything in the group."

Turning off some of these effects, like transparency, may improve your computer’s performance and reduce WindowServer’s CPU usage. To change this setting: Click the Apple menu at the top of the screen. Select System Settings (or System Preferences if you’re using an older version of macOS). Click Accessibility , then select Display . Toggle on the switch next to Reduce transparency . This will turn off the transparent effect in elements like the Dock at the bottom of your screen. Some effects, like the drop shadows behind windows, are part of the operating system and cannot be turned off."

If you have a lot of separate workflows happening on your Mac at the same time, you might be using Spaces, which allows you to create multiple virtual desktops. Having lots of Spaces open at once can overload WindowServer and slow your system down. To close Spaces you aren’t using: [3] X Research source Swipe up on your trackpad with three fingers at once, or press the Mission Control key (which may be one of the Function keys, such as F3). The Mission Control key shows a group of three different-sized rectangles. Hover over the Space you want to delete in the Spaces bar at the top of the screen.

If WindowServer is still using way too much CPU power even after you try the most common troubleshooting steps, then malware might be to blame. If you know what to look for, you can manually remove malware while your computer is in Safe Mode . Mac has built-in tools that are supposed to automatically check for and remove malware and viruses. However, if you think some malware might have slipped past these protections, try scanning your Mac with a third-party tool like Avast, AVG Antivirus, or Kaspersky."
