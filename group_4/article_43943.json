      "content": "Use a square bandana to form an even headband. Bandanas can come in many shapes and sizes, but a square bandana works best to make a uniform fold to form your headband. The larger the bandana, the more fabric you’ll have to fold, which can mean a thicker or wider headband. So make sure you choose a bandana that is large enough to fold into a headband, but not so large that you have a bulky headband. [1] X Research source Choose material like cotton or other natural fibers that breathe because a headband can trap heat and make your head sweat. There are also many different patterns and designs you can choose from for your bandana."

      "content": "Lay the bandana flat and smooth out any wrinkles. Before you fold your bandana, you need to prepare the fabric by laying it flat on a table or other surface and position it so that looks like a diamond. Use your hands to smooth out any folds or wrinkles that may be in the fabric so that you have a flat and even bandana to work with. [2] X Research source If your bandana has a lot of wrinkles, you can iron them out with a clothes iron."

      "content": "Bring the bottom corner to meet the top corner to form a triangle. Make sure that all of the edges of the bandana line up when you fold it. Fold the bandana in half diagonally, bringing one corner to meet the other and form a large triangle. Smooth out the fabric with your hands to flatten it out. [3] X Research source Be sure the pattern is arranged so that it’s visible when you fold the bandana."

      "title": "Fold the long end of the triangle to make a long strip.",
      "content": "Fold the long end of the triangle to make a long strip. Take the bottom of the triangle and fold it to form a strip about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) wide. Then fold the strip over and over towards the point of the triangle until the fabric forms one strip. Smooth out the material after each fold to ensure a uniform size. [4] X Research source For a wider headband, make a wider strip. Roll the bandana rather than fold it to form a rounded headband."

      "title": "Spray the folded bandana with hairspray.",
      "content": "Spray the folded bandana with hairspray. Once you have the fabric folded to the width you want, you can make the headband adhere to your skin and hair better by spraying it with hairspray. This will prevent the headband from slipping around once it’s on your head. Spray an even layer of hairspray and wait 5 minutes to let it dry. [5] X Research source You can also use hair gel, but make sure the gel dries clear and only apply it to the side of the headband that will be against your hair and skin. If you don't want to use hair product, you can also use a hairpin on each side of the bandana to secure it to your hair.

      "content": "Place the center of the bandana against your forehead. Pick up the folded bandana strip by the ends and center your forehead against the middle of the strip. If you have long hair, place the bandana beneath your hair so it doesn’t get trapped between your forehead and your headband.

Make sure the bandana doesn’t unfold when you wrap it. Keep the entire length of the strip of bandana flush against your head. [9] X Research source You can also center the bandana on the base of the back of your head and bring the two ends around to the front of your head, above your forehead."

With the bandana flush against your head, tie the two ends into a secure knot, making sure it’s tight enough to stay in place, but not so tight that it’s uncomfortable. Then form another knot to keep the first knot firmly in place. [10] X Research source If you centered the bandana on the base of the back of your head, tie your knot on the upper part of your forehead, making sure it’s secure before you tie it into a double-knot."
