      "content": "This adage means that when you’re with the right person, you’ll know. In other words, when you’ve found the one you’re going to end up with, your intuition will make this clear and banish all your doubts. It’s a very sweet and romantic sentiment about true love and finding your soulmate . Thanks to the love song “Margaret (feat. Bleachers)” by Lana Del Rey, which recently went viral on TikTok, the phrase has become even more popular. In the chorus of the song, Lana repeatedly sings “when you know you know” to describe the certainty that the lead singer of Bleachers, Jack Antonoff, felt when he met his wife, Margaret Qualley.

      "content": "People use this phrase to convey their certainty that they've found “The One.” This certainty often goes beyond rational thought—it’s more of a “gut feeling,” or a strong wave of intuition. The people who use this adage simply know that they’ve found the right person, even if there aren’t any clear or obvious reasons for this belief. Here are some examples: “None of my friends could understand why I’d move across the country for someone I had just met, but when you know, you know. I took that leap of faith, and now we’ve been together for 5 years.” “Right after he proposed, we hopped in the car and drove to Las Vegas to elope. When you know, you know, and there’s no time to waste.” “I keep asking my mom how she knew that my dad was ‘The One,’ but she just says ‘when you know, you know.’ I guess I haven’t felt that sense of certainty about someone yet!” “When you know, you know! Saying ‘yes’ to him was the easiest decision I’ve ever made, and I’m so excited to marry my best friend.”"

      "content": "“When you know, you know” can be used in non-romantic contexts, too. Many people use the phrase to describe their gut instinct on a big decision, or their intuitive sense of certainty that something is meant to be. For example: “For a while, Georgetown was my dream school, but when I toured UCLA, I immediately felt like it was where I was meant to be. After that, I never thought about Georgetown again. I guess when you know, you know!” “A lot of people warned me about going into business with my best friend, but I had a great feeling about us working on the startup together, and now we’re thriving. When you know, you know, and I’m so glad I trusted my instincts.” “I toured a bunch of beautiful apartments, but for some reason, none of them felt quite right. I kept searching and when I stepped into a little condo on the west side, I immediately felt at home. I signed the lease right away. When you know, you know.”"

      "title": "This truly depends on the person.",
      "content": "This truly depends on the person. Many people swear by the wisdom of the adage and believe that it accurately describes their experience. For others, the phrase is anxiety-inducing and sparks difficult questions, like, “If I don’t feel 100% certain about my partner, does that mean they’re wrong for me?” Or, “How am I supposed to know if I’m with the right person?” If you fall into the latter camp, don’t worry! It’s completely normal to have doubts and questions sometimes, especially early on in the relationship. Your sense of certainty will likely build over time, with some effort and patience. As Lana Del Rey sings in “Margaret”: “If you don’t know, don’t give up ‘cause you never know what the new day might bring. Maybe tomorrow you’ll know.” [2] X Research source If you’re really concerned about whether or not you’re in the right relationship, there are some signs you can look out for, and we’ll cover them below."
