      "content": "Repeat your affirmation 3 times a day for about 5 minutes. Repetition is perhaps the most important thing about a self-affirmation practice. The more you repeat an affirmation, the more familiar and accessible it becomes in your mind. Over time, your mind will start to reach for that thought rather than the negative thought when a triggering situation comes up.
