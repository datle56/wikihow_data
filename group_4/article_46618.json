If you get a gym ball that’s too big, your feet might dangle; too small, and you could be hunched into an awkward position. [1] X Research source Under 5’3” (160 cm): get a ball that inflates to around 21.6 in (55 cm). Between 5’3” (160 cm) and 5’8” (172 cm): get a ball that inflates to 25.5 in (65 cm). Over 5’8” (172 cm): get a ball that inflates to 29.5 in (75 cm)."

      "content": "Make sure the ball is burst-resistant. Sitting down on a gym ball that pops can really hurt you or the people around you. When you’re buying a gym ball, make sure it’s labeled with “anti-burst” or “burst-resistant.” If you’re buying a ball specifically for pregnancy, it should be anti-burst automatically. You can also double check the weight limit to make sure the ball is the right size for you."

      "content": "Inflate the ball so it’s firm with a little give. If your ball is over inflated, it could pop. If it’s under inflated, it won’t give you as much benefit. Fill it up with the pump that comes with it until you can poke it just slightly. [2] X Research source If you’re unsure about your inflation, check the manufacturer’s instructions. Usually, inflating the ball to about 70% of its size is perfect."

      "content": "Place your ball on a carpeted floor for stability. Smooth floors, like tile and wood, can be slippery, and your gym ball could slide around. When you’re first starting out, put your ball on a carpet or a rug to give it a little bit of stability. [3] X Research source You should also make sure there aren’t any large objects nearby that you could hurt yourself on. Cabinets and tables can be a hazard if you fall backwards or to the side."

Slowly lower yourself down, using the person behind you to steady yourself and the ball so it doesn’t wiggle around. When you’re comfortable, you can have the person behind you move away, but keep them nearby in case you start to tip over.

This is a great workout to start out with since it’s so mild. You can do this during any trimester as long as your doctor gives you the okay. Just balancing yourself as you sit on the ball will help strengthen your core. [5] X Expert Source Wendy Powell Maternal Health & Exercise Specialist Expert Interview. 24 September 2020."
