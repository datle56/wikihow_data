    {
      "title": "Calculate your menstrual cycle.",
      "content": "Calculate your menstrual cycle. Your hormones have a lot to do with your monthly period, so it is important to take your cycle into account when beginning to use the cream to raise your progesterone levels. Your hormones are working as a team to trigger ovulation, so it's important to help balance the hormones. You can chart your cycle by identifying the expected first day of your next period, then counting backwards two weeks (14 days) from then. This would be day 14 for a woman with a cycle duration of 28 days, or day 21 for another woman with a cycle duration of 35 days. The exact day will differ from woman to woman according to her calculations and her cycle's usual duration."

    {
      "title": "Pick the right time of day.",
      "content": "Pick the right time of day. Generally, you will want to apply the cream twice a day, unless instructed otherwise by your doctor. Since you will likely want to apply the cream at home (so you don't have to tote it to work), you should choose two times when you are generally at home. Try to apply once in the morning, after your shower, and once at night, before bedtime."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be consistent.",
      "content": "Be consistent. As with any medication or supplement, it can be very helpful to get into a routine when applying your progesterone cream. Make it a habit to apply your cream at the same time each day. Soon, the application will be second nature, and you will be less likely to forget a dose. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep applying the cream if you become pregnant.",
      "content": "Keep applying the cream if you become pregnant. If you learn that you are pregnant while using the cream, keep applying your normal doses. It is important that your progesterone levels do not drop early in a pregnancy, as that could result in loss of the fetus. Make sure to consult your doctor before you stop applying the cream."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose the right spots.",
      "content": "Choose the right spots. Progesterone cream is a fat-soluble substance, which makes it easily absorbed through the skin. It is best to choose spots on your body that have the greatest amounts of capillary blood, because it will be absorbed most quickly. There are many different spots that will work. You can rub small amounts of the cream into your neck, face, breasts, chest, and the insides of your hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rotate application spots.",
      "content": "Rotate application spots. In order to avoid a particular area of your body becoming saturated, mix up the application spots each day. For example, do not apply to your neck both in the morning and the evening. If you have trouble remembering which spot you used last, just make a note and stick it to your bathroom mirror. That will serve as an easy reminder."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to dosage.",
      "content": "Pay attention to dosage. When trying to become pregnant, you will typically need 30-40 milligrams of progesterone per day. The cream can easily be used to supplement what your body is supplying. Most creams come with instructions to apply about 20 milligrams twice a day. That is an amount about the size of 1/4 of a teaspoon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask your doctor questions.",
      "content": "Ask your doctor questions. Make sure to discuss your specific fertility issues with your doctor to determine if progesterone cream will be right for you.Talk to your doctor if you have amenorrhea or a lack of a menstruation cycle. For women with amenorrhea (no period), it can be more difficult to use progesterone cream, as calculation of when to start the cream can be complicated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Research different creams.",
      "content": "Research different creams. Some progesterone creams are available over the counter, while others require a prescription from your doctor. You should ask your pharmacist about different options, and ask for details about the differences. When applying anything to your skin, make sure to read the ingredients and make sure that you do not have any known allergies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shop around.",
      "content": "Shop around. If you decide to go with an over the counter option, you might want to try your local natural health store. Homeopathic remedies can be very successful, and you can ask the staff at a small store any questions you may have. You might receive more personalized advice than at a large chain store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know the possible effects.",
      "content": "Know the possible effects. While generally considered safe, progesterone can cause some unwanted side effects. Some users have reported issues such as upset stomachs and weight gain. Others have noticed depression-like or PMS-like symptoms. Remember, this cream contains hormones, so it will affect you physically. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Talk to your doctor.",
      "content": "Talk to your doctor. Before you start using progesterone cream, discuss your options with your doctor. Explain your concerns, and what you hope to gain from using the cream. Ask all of the questions that you have, and gain a clear understanding of what the cream can do for you."
