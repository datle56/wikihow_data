      "content": "Notice how he treats you. If your boyfriend loves you, he will treat you with respect. That means that he listens to you and cares about what's going on in your life. He notices the little things that you like and goes out of his way to give them to you. He values you as a person, and he genuinely listens to your opinions. Doing these things shows he honestly cares about you . If your boyfriend always treats you with kindness, empathy, and understanding, then you likely have a deep emotional bond. Usually, this signifies that youâ€™re in a committed relationship based on mutual love.

      "content": "See how much you question his feelings. If a guy really loves you , it's doubtful you'll need to question it. That is, he's going to make you feel his love in one way or another, by showing you how he feels and saying it to you. [1] X Research source On the other hand, you have to make sure that maybe you're not letting your insecurities overrule the emotions of someone who obviously loves you. In other words, you may not feel like he loves you, but it could be just your anxieties talking. If past partners have said you get clingy sometimes, it may be a sign you're insecure. You may also notice yourself trying to be extra nice to win his love or trying to meet his needs all the time without thinking about your own. One way to combat this type of insecurity is to pay attention to what you're feeling instead of always focusing on others; take the time to identify each emotion. As you identify emotions, notice how it guides your behavior. If you're feeling upset and you start worrying that your boyfriend doesn't love you, you may find yourself trying to please him more. Often, these anxieties are unfounded, especially if he's finding ways to show his love all the time. Also, it's important to identify the source of your insecurity. Maybe you've internalized the critical voice of one of your parents, or maybe you've had rotten luck in past relationships with people who have mistreated you. Don't just let your inner critic run wild. Instead, talk back to it. When you catch yourself doubting the other person or yourself, try to turn it around. For instance, if you find yourself saying \"He didn't call me back, so he probably doesn't love me anymore,\" try to stop the thought. Say, \"No, that's not right. He tells me he loves me every day. He probably just got busy.\" [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Check to see how much time he spends with you. A guy who loves you is going to want to spend time with you. If he makes time for you on a regular basis and goes out of his way to see you, he's likely in love with you. [3] X Research source Watch to see if he blows you off . If your guy doesn't really care, he's more likely to blow you off. That means he won't make time for you as often as you'd like, and when he does, he may cancel at the last minute. If he's not consistently making time for you, then he probably doesn't love you. [4] X Research source Of course, sometimes, a guy is going to have a legitimate reason to cancel on you. However, he should try to give you as much notice in advance as possible. He should also be interested in rescheduling. If he's not, he may not be that into you."

If he's willing to take the lead at least part of the time, he probably cares for you. One way to make sure he's willing is to not plan everything. Give your guy a chance to plan dates for you. He should be willing to take the initiative if he cares about you."

      "content": "Make sure he's willing to compromise . Being in a relationship means making sacrifices sometimes by compromising with another person. That means sometimes he gives a little more, and sometimes you give a little more. For instance, it may mean he's willing to go see a movie that he knows he's not going to like, while you're willing to go to the sports bar sometimes, even if it's not your thing. If he's willing to participate in some give and take, then he's probably starting to fall in love with you."

That means that he's at least willing to introduce you to friends and family. If he doesn't want to introduce you, that may mean he's not sure about you yet. Though he could have other reasons not to want to introduce you (such as your religious differences), being embarrassed can be a red flag."

In other words, watch to see if he likes to pull you close in public or if he likes to publicly display his affection, such as by holding hands or giving you a hug. If he doesn't, it may be that he's not that into you, though it could also just be that he's shy in public. [6] X Research source"

However, if he spontaneously texts, emails, and calls on a regular basis, then he probably can't get you out of his mind, meaning he loves you. [7] X Research source However, every guy is different. Maybe he's an introvert, and he doesn't like to spend every minute with another person, even someone he loves. Make sure you try to figure out what kind of person he is before jumping to conclusions."

If he's not willing to fight or if he just brushes off arguments with a shrug, he may not care that deeply about you. You don't necessarily need to have knock-down, drag-out fights. But you both need to be able to express your opinions and thoughts, even if it leads to an argument. If he doesn't seem willing to engage, he may not be into you."
