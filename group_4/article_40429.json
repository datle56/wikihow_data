    {
      "title": "Look at the logo and lettering on the packaging.",
      "content": "Look at the logo and lettering on the packaging. MAC has a distinct logo and font used for all of their packaging, which is very sleek and stylized. Counterfeit products will have the same logo but it will either be stretched or manipulated in some way, or it will be placed in a different area of the packaging or casing than it would normally be. For example, the MAC logo is usually centered on its genuine products but a counterfeit may position the logo at the top or toward the bottom. Additionally, MAC uses capital letters for all of its packaging and lettering. Compare the lettering on the package to a MAC product you already have that you know is not counterfeit. If you observe obvious differences, you may have a counterfeit."

    {
      "title": "Study the casing.",
      "content": "Study the casing. MAC products come in a casing that has tiny glitter particles on the surface, giving it a subtle shimmer. Counterfeit products will usually manufacture casings that are dull or have a different sheen in comparison. They are also often a slightly different shape, usually bulkier and/or larger than its genuine counterparts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Study the labels.",
      "content": "Study the labels. The labels on the bottom of the casing is a great indicator of whether or not the product is genuine. MAC uses all caps on their labelling and labels are either gray with black print or white with a light gray print. The font used by counterfeit manufacturers tends to be bulkier and less sleek.

    {
      "title": "Sniff the product.",
      "content": "Sniff the product. MAC lipsticks have a faint sweet vanilla scent. The fakes will often smell like plastic or cheap perfume. If you’re unsure, take a whiff of the product; the smell should be able to give it away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the name of the product.",
      "content": "Check the name of the product. Some fakes will have a name, but it may not be the name of any genuine MAC items or products. To find out, simply go to www.maccosmetics.com and click on the magnifying glass symbol in the upper right hand corner. Search for the name of the product. If it does not appear, it may either be a discontinued product or it is fake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the pad of your finger on the product.",
      "content": "Rub the pad of your finger on the product. If you are swatching a pressed powder such as eyeshadow or blush, you should press the pad of your finger lightly on the surface of the makeup and rub it in circles a few times. This will lift the product from the casing onto your finger. Notice the consistency of the product. Sometimes fakes are creamier or softer than the genuine products. Don’t be fooled by this. If you are swatching lipstick or any other makeup that uses an applicator, rub the product directly onto the skin. For example, run the tip of a lipstick directly onto the surface of the skin to see how the color appears. If you do not want to use your fingers, you can also use a brush. Rub the brush on the product in order to coat the bristles with enough product to transfer it to your skin. Try a concealer or eyeshadow brush, which can be obtained at any beauty supply store."

    {
      "title": "Swipe your finger on the inside of your arm.",
      "content": "Swipe your finger on the inside of your arm. Once you have some of the product on your finger, gently swipe it along the inside of your arm, where the skin is soft and hairless. You can also do this on the back of your hand, whichever is easier for you. The goal is to see how the makeup appears on the skin. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Observe the pigmentation of the makeup.",
      "content": "Observe the pigmentation of the makeup. The counterfeit MAC products usually have less pigmentation than the genuine ones and will require you to go over the surface of your skin two or more times to be able to clearly see the color on the surface of the skin. Swatching it next to a similar or identical product should allow you to see the discrepancies between the two products."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look closely at the pictures.",
      "content": "Look closely at the pictures. When looking at an online posting for makeup, observe the pictures closely to see how much detail the seller is providing. If you can clearly see the labels and the product itself, it may safe to purchase. If you are unsure in any way, it may be best to avoid purchasing from that seller."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about the price.",
      "content": "Think about the price. If the deal is too good to be true, then chances are that it is a fake MAC product. For example, if an item is being sold for $10, and the retail price at the MAC counter is $30, you should be wary of purchasing that product. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider purchasing directly from the source.",
      "content": "Consider purchasing directly from the source. To save yourself the headache of purchasing fake MAC products, consider buying the makeup directly from the MAC makeup counter or ordering it online from MAC’s website. This will give you confidence that you will be receiving the genuine product, instead of inadvertently giving in to gimmicky fakes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Report counterfeits directly to MAC.",
      "content": "Report counterfeits directly to MAC. If you accidentally receive fake MAC makeup or notice fake makeup from an unauthorized seller or boutique, contact MAC to report the counterfeits. You can do this by visiting their website at www.maccosmetics.com and clicking “Counterfeit Education” in the menu at the bottom of the page. Call the 800-number provided on the website under “Counterfeit Education” and give the seller’s name and address (if you have that information), the type of location (i.e. whether it’s eBay, an independent boutique or other), the product(s) that are being sold, and the trademark details."
