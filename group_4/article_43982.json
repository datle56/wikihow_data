      "content": "Knot the scarf behind your head. Tie both sides of the scarf together under your hair, where the back of your head meets your neck, so that the scarf wraps snugly around your head. Pull the ends of the scarf out to make sure they don’t get caught in the knot.

      "content": "Wrap and tie your tichel atop your hair. Once you’ve finished the first knot, take the ends of the scarf and “twirl” them loosely to give the fabric some volume. Cross them over the top of your head, pull one end of the scarf through the gap to create a knot, and lower the knot until it’s resting on top of your bun or ponytail.

If you have enough fabric left over to wrap it over your “bun,” then wrap it over, and tuck it into the fabric on the side (near the base of your head).
