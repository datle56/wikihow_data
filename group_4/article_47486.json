      "content": "Get a pair with a shorter inseam if you are petite. The inseam, or length from the top of the inside of your thigh to the cuff, is important when it comes to bootcut jeans, especially for petite or shorter people. You do not want an inseam that is very long, as the jeans will be too long for your legs and you may need to hem off the bootcut portion of the pants to get them to fit. Instead, opt for an inseam that is made for petite people, usually around 29 to 30 inches (74 to 76 cm). You may need to still hem the jeans to fit your legs, but with a shorter inseam, you will have to take off less of the bootcut."

Make sure you get a nice long, lean look by getting a pair of bootcut jeans that have an inseam that is 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) longer than your usual inseam. A longer inseam will ensure the jeans hit 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your shoes. If you are petite, opt for a shorter inseam so the jeans sit above your shoes when you wear heels."

      "content": "Get a low-rise pair if you prefer less fabric over your stomach. You may opt for jeans that hit just above your hips if you don’t want to feel too constrained or covered up. Maybe you like showing off your stomach and want too much fabric over this area. Keep in mind you may expose your stomach or a bit of skin if you tend to wear crop tops or shorter tops with your jeans. Make sure the low-rise pair fits your hips snugly so you do not have to keep pulling them up when you sit or bend down. Wearing a belt with low-rise jeans can also help you avoid this problem."

      "title": "Try on the jeans before you buy them.",
      "content": "Try on the jeans before you buy them. The only way to confirm the jeans fit you properly is to try them on in the store before you buy. Walk around in them, and sit or bend down while wearing them to see how they feel. The inseam should hit you correctly and the waist should not feel too tight or constraining. If you prefer to shop for jeans online, read the measurements for the jeans carefully before you buy. Measure your inseam and waist with measuring tape to ensure the jeans will fit you properly. Bring someone with you when you try on jeans since you won't be able to see how the jeans look on you at all angles.
