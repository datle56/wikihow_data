  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Avoid language that is too casual.",
      "content": "Avoid language that is too casual. Generally speaking, your language should be straightforward and simple, yet professional. You should avoid taking too conversational of a tone in your memo, or else it won't sound as credible. [1] X Research source For example, avoid writing things like “Hey guys! TGIF, am I right? Anyway, I wanted to tell you about an important business matter.” Instead, get right to the point: “I'm writing to provide everyone with a progress report for Project Z”."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid using emotional language.",
      "content": "Avoid using emotional language. It's also best to try to take a neutral tone when you write and avoid using emotionally-charged language. Do your best to refer to facts and evidence to support your claims. For example, avoid claims like “I think we'll all be so much happier if we're allowed to dress casually on Friday.” Instead, research to see if there are any studies on whether office morale increases when employees are allowed more autonomy in their choice of attire, and cite that in your memo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use signal phrases.",
      "content": "Use signal phrases. When you are about to cite evidence or refer to a source, be sure to use language which lets the reader know what you're doing. [2] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, try the following: “According to our findings,...” or “Research completed by the EPA has indicated that...”."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose an appropriate font style and size.",
      "content": "Choose an appropriate font style and size. Your memo should be easy to read, so you should avoid using excessively small font—11 or 12 point is standard. [3] X Research source You should also choose a simple font style such as Times New Roman. This isn't the time to play around with “fun” fonts like Comic Sans (you'll be made fun of if you choose this one!)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use standard margins for your memo.",
      "content": "Use standard margins for your memo. 1-inch margins are typical for business memos, though some word-processing programs may include pre-formatted memo templates with slightly wider margins (for example, 1.25 inches)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Single-space your document.",
      "content": "Single-space your document. Business memos are usually not double-spaced. In order to keep the page number down, consider single-spacing, but leave spaces between individual paragraphs or sections. [4] X Research source There is usually no need for you to indent your paragraphs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decide if a memo needs to be sent.",
      "content": "Decide if a memo needs to be sent. If you need to update several people on your team about an important business matter, then sending a memo is an excellent idea. You may even want to send one if you're communicating with just one person if, for example, you want or need to have a written record of your correspondence. However, in some cases, it may be more efficient to just talk directly to those you need to. Also, some information may be too sensitive to send out in a memo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify your purpose for writing.",
      "content": "Identify your purpose for writing. Depending upon your specific purpose, the content and organization of your memo may change. Most types of memos are written for the following reasons: [5] X Research source To propose an idea or solution. For example, if you think you know how the scheduling problems for overtime can be worked out, you may want to write up your ideas in a memo, and send it to your superior(s). To issue an order. For example, sending a memo can be an efficient way to assign responsibilities for an upcoming conference that your department is hosting. To provide a report. You may also want to send a memo in order to update your colleagues about an event that's recently occurred, give an update on a project, provide a progress report, or report the findings of an investigation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Narrow your topic.",
      "content": "Narrow your topic. You may be juggling a lot of projects and be tempted to send a memo updating your colleagues, superiors, or clients on everything you're currently working on. Keep in mind though, that business memos should clearly focus on just one issue. [6] X Research source They should be concise, clear, and easy to read quickly by busy individuals; thus, you don't want important information to be overlooked. Keeping the memo focused will help ensure that your message is received and understood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider your audience.",
      "content": "Consider your audience. The content, style and tone of your business memo will all be affected by the intended audience, so think carefully about everyone who will receive your memo. [7] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, you'll write a different type of memo if you're writing to your colleagues about planning a surprise party for the people in the office with summer birthdays, as compared to when you're writing your supervisor about the results of your months-long investigation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Label your memo.",
      "content": "Label your memo. There are many different types of business correspondence. Standard practice for a memo is to explicitly title the document as such. [8] X Research source For example, type “Memo” or “Memorandum” at the top of the page. It's up to you as to whether you want to center or left-justify the title. A good rule of thumb is to examine the business memos you've received and copy the formatting."

[11] X Expert Source Elaine Lou Cartas Business & Career Coach Expert Interview. 18 May 2023. It is poor business practice to send your memo office-wide if only a few are concerned or affected.

      "title": "Use the appropriate names and titles for the people on your recipient list.",
      "content": "Use the appropriate names and titles for the people on your recipient list. Even if you're on a friendly first-name basis with your boss, it's best to keep your written correspondence more formal.

[12] X Research source Keep this in mind when you're filling out the information for everyone on the recipient list: include full names and business titles."

      "content": "Research the proper titles of people you are writing to in an external memo. If you are sending a memo to someone outside of your office, it's also important to determine the proper form of address. Take the time to research their profile; their information is probably outlined on their company's website. [13] X Research source For example, do they have a PhD? If so, it's generally a good idea to refer to them as Dr. So-and-So. What is their title? For example, are they a vice president or a dean? If so, be sure to refer them as such in your memo."

      "content": "Compose the subject line carefully. You want to be sure that your subject line, while short, is clear and not too general. [14] X Research source For example, “New Business” is pretty vague, and if someone is searching through their files a few weeks or days down the road, they may have a hard time pinpointing your memo.

      "content": "Consider skipping the salutation. It's up to you whether you want to preface your message with a salutation like “Dear Ms. Winters,” or “Dear Colleagues”. Keep in mind though, that these greetings are not expected in a business memo.

      "content": "Keep the introductory section brief. There is no need to provide all of the details and/or evidence in the first section of your memo. Keep it on the shorter side—a few sentences or a short paragraph will suffice."

      "content": "Include a closing section or paragraph. Even if you judge that it's not necessary to summarize the memo, you still need to end it on a concluding note. Think about the following: What is the take away from the memo? Do you need the recipients to do anything? Should they respond by a certain day? If so, clearly state it. If no further action is required, include a simple closing sentiment such as “I'm happy to discuss this further” or “Let me know if you have any questions or concerns”."
