      "content": "Only if you’re sending texts to another country. For most phone plans, you can send a text anywhere in your home country free of charge. If you’re texting someone in a different country, you may get charged extra depending on your phone plan. If you aren’t sure, contact your phone provider and ask them about the rates for international texting. [1] X Research source In most phone plans, if you have an unlimited data plan, you can send texts anywhere in the world without getting charged extra."

      "content": "Texts can be sent anywhere around the world. If you have a phone plan, you can send a text to anyone in any country. Unless they’re outside of cell range, the distance between you two shouldn’t matter. If you don’t have an unlimited phone plan, sending texts outside of your network may cost you a roaming charge. Roaming charges usually kick in anytime your cell phone connects to a network that isn’t yours—for instance, if you have Verizon but your phone connects to a Sprint tower to send your message."

      "title": "It depends on the phone plan you have.",
      "content": "It depends on the phone plan you have. Some phone plans cover international texting, while others charge you for it. If you do get charged, it will probably be around $0.25 per international text you send. [2] X Research source For pictures and videos, it’s usually around $0.50 each message. You can find the details of your phone plan on your carrier’s website."

      "content": "No, as long as you don’t reply. In general, most phone plans only charge for outgoing messages, not incoming ones. If you get a text from someone in another country, you won’t be charged as long as you don’t reply to it. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "No, iMessage uses WiFi. As long as you are connected to the internet, you can send an iMessage anywhere in the world. The receiver also has to be connected to WiFi to use iMessage, though. Keep in mind that the iMessage function is only for iOS users—if you have an Android, try downloading WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger to send messages via WiFi. [4] X Research source If your iMessage isn’t enabled, go to Settings > Messages > iMessage, then switch the toggle to “On.” You can also send an iMessage as an SMS or a normal text message if it’s not delivering. Simply tap and hold the message, then select “Send as text message.” Keep in mind that if your phone plan doesn’t cover international texting, you might be charged for sending an international text."

Some phone plans won’t let you send a text message that exceeds their maximum character count (the character count varies depending on your phone carrier). If that’s the case, your phone will probably show an error message, and you can split the message up yourself to send it in 2 parts. [6] X Research source"
