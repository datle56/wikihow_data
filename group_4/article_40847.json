      "content": "Get plenty of physical activity. Do cardio and strength training. Cardiovascular (or aerobic) exercise gets your heart pumping. These exercises usually involve the whole body. Strength training increases your muscle mass and helps you lose fat. In addition, try to integrate physical activity into your everyday schedule. Walk or ride your bike to school instead of driving, and take the stairs instead the elevator (unless you’re going up more than three flights). You can lift barbells, dumbbells, or kettlebells. The best strength training workout will set you on a circuit where you do 10 to 15 reps on a given machine before moving on to the next one. Swimming, running, or going for a bike ride are all great ways to keep your heart healthy. Teens should get at least one hour of exercise each day. Always warm up when you exercise.

Go to source Warming up helps your muscles stretch and can reduce the likelihood that you’ll pull a muscle or strain yourself. You should especially warm up your legs, back, neck, and arms. Know your limits. [2] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Don’t exercise to the point where you’re in pain or about to collapse, and don’t obsess over your weight.

Designate a few hours each day during which you can disengage from your computer and digital devices in order to go for a walk, run, bike ride, or do some other physical activity (as well as study and do homework). Unless you have your own weight set, you’ll probably need to hit the gym. If your school doesn’t have a gym, check for local gyms that allow teenage members. Don’t feel intimidated by going to the gym just because you aren’t strong or fit. Remember, people go to the gym to become strong and fit, not because they already are. Start out with a small weight limit of 10 – 20 pounds and perfect your technique before moving up to a larger weight limit. An improper technique or weights that are too heavy can lead to injury. Have a staff member or trainer show you how to use the machines before you start. They can also help you decide how much weight to start with. Add weight slowly in increments of 10 pounds or less. You’ll know when you’ve hit your lifting limit for a particular exercise or weightlifting machine when 15 reps produces significant strain. Ensure you always have a spotter to supervise your weightlifting exercise. [3] X Research source Cut back on your screen time to make time in your schedule for exercise. Instead of playing a video game or watching a show, join an extracurricular sports team or engage in a physical activity. Alternately, exercise while watching a show or listening to a podcast. You could do this while lifting weights, running on a treadmill, or riding a stationary bike."

Exercise comes in many forms, so find one that suits you and stick with it. Mix your exercise routine up from time to time to keep it from getting stale. Get your friends involved. Exercising with a friend makes it more fun. Join a team, or just challenge your friends to a quick game of basketball or tag."

With the changes going on in your body, and your early-morning school schedule, you might find yourself more and more tired as the school year goes on. Getting enough sleep contributes to both physical and mental health. If you don't get enough sleep you won't look good in the morning and you won't have the energy you need to do your best each day. Aim for at least nine hours of sleep each night. [4] X Research source Set a sleep schedule. Set an alarm to wake up up and go to bed at the same time each day. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Keep naps short. A quick 30-minute nap can help you feel more rested and relaxed for the rest of the day, but sleeping too long in the middle of the day can leave you feeling groggy when you wake up and make it difficult to fall asleep at night.

Brush with the bristles of your brush angled up on your upper teeth, and brush with the bristles angled down on your lower teeth. Additionally, you should floss once daily. If you don’t have time to do this in the morning, do it as part of your evening routine before bed. Drink lots of water. It helps wash out bits of food that might lodge in your teeth. As a busy teen, you might find it hard to brush your teeth regularly. Buy a toothbrush and toothpaste carrying kit so you can take them with you when you’re running late for school in the morning. See a dentist every six months for a dental cleaning and checkup."

Cocaine can lead to feelings of anger and anxiety, and can produce muscle spasms and convulsions. It can even lead to heart attacks and death. [9] X Research source Heroin is highly addictive. Heroin addicts increase their risk of contracting HIV and AIDS because they often share needles. When a friend offers you drugs, think twice. Not only are drugs harmful to your health and well-being, but if you’re caught using drugs by the police, you could be facing criminal charges.

If you choose to have sex, it is important to avoid STDs and pregnancy. Always use a condom . Do keep in mind that abstinence is the only 100% effective way to avoid these things. Talk to your parents or a trusted adult if you have questions about sex. It’s okay to feel uncomfortable talking about sex, but you should do it anyways to ensure you’re getting reliable information. Initiate the conversation by texting or emailing your parents a link to some sexual information you read online and asking them if it is accurate. You might also talk to them about their own sexual histories by asking, “When did you start dating?” and leading to more private questions like, “When did you first have sex?” If you are a girl, talk to your doctor about getting a long-acting reversible contraceptive or a birth control prescription. Never have sex just because your boyfriend or girlfriend is pressuring you to. If you aren’t ready, be calm but firm in your refusal. Explain that you are not ready to have sex and insist that if they really love you, they will respect your decision. Remember, having sex means that you run the risk of pregnancy. The safest sex is no sex at all. Sex includes the risk of pregnancy and infection with a sexually transmitted disease."

Instead, a high sugar content leads to an accumulation of fat. Limiting your sugar intake doesn’t mean you can never eat cake or drink soda. It just means that these things should not be regular elements in your daily diet. Think of them as special treats. Other high-sugar foods you should avoid include popsicles, candy, chocolate bars, ice cream, sweetened fruit juices, cookies, and sweetened cereals. Even some foods that might seem healthy like canned fruit and dried fruit have high sugar content.

If there are lots of ingredients with long names that you can’t define (for instance, monosodium glutamate and butylated hydroxyanisole), you’re looking at a processed food. Alternately, avoid foods whose nutrition labels list fat content and sodium levels that are through the roof, especially when the serving size is relatively small.
