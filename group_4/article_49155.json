      "content": "Choose the right wrap. There are many different types of wraps, and it's important to choose one the one that will work best for the size of your hands and the type of boxing you intend to do. Consider these options when you're picking out a wrap to buy: [1] X Research source Cotton wraps are a good choice for frequent training and sparring. They come in adult and junior lengths, and they are secured with velcro at the end. Mexican wraps are similar to cotton wraps but they are woven with elastic fibers, so they mold to the hand more easily. They aren't quite as durable as cotton wraps because the elastic gets worn out over time, but they're a good option for training. Gel wraps aren't actually woven onto the hand, but are slipped on like fingerless gloves. They are more expensive than cotton or Mexican wraps. They are convenient to slip on, but they don't provide as much wrist support as traditional wraps, and for that reason serious boxers don't usually opt for gels. Competition wraps are composed of gauze and tape. Boxing rulebooks specify the exact amount that can be used, to make sure each boxer has the same amount of padding. Since these wraps aren't reusable, they aren't practical for use during everyday training. The wrapping technique for competition wraps is also different and should be done with a partner or coach."
