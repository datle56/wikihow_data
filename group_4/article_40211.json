      "content": "Pashto is an IndoEuropean language spoken in Central Asia. Pashto is part of the Iranian group of IndoEuropean languages with about 40 million people speaking Pashto as a native language. Native speakers (referred to as Pashtuns) mostly live in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Pashto is heavily influenced by Dari (the lingua franca of Afghanistan). However, Pashto also uses many loanwords from Arabic and Urdu. [17] X Research source Linguistically, Pashto is an inflectional language with two grammatical genders. Instead of traditional tenses, it uses aspect (a completed or incomplete action) to communicate time. [18] X Research source The Pashto alphabet is largely based on the Perso-Arabic alphabet that’s used in Farsi and Dari. Like these Persian languages, Pashto is written and read from right to left and doesn’t have any defined capital letters. The alphabet consists of 44 letters and is written in the naskh style script. When attempting to learn the Pashto language as an English speaker, the original script must first be transliterated and studied alongside a pronunciation guide such as the one included on this page . For this reason, English spellings of Pashto words often differ. One of the best ways to learn to speak basic Pashto (or teach yourself any new language ) is with an app like Pashto (Afgh.) Basic Phrases , where you can hear the pronunciation of common Pashto words and phrases."
