      "content": "Talk to your doctor before beginning a workout regimen. If you're a rookie to the workout game, check with your doctor to see if there are any types of workouts or exercises that you need to avoid. This is especially important if you suffer from any chronic illnesses or have a physical disability. If this is the case, it's wise to consult a doctor. If you're a male over 45 or a woman over 55, do not start an exercise regimen without speaking to your doctor first. Your physician may even be able to suggest some specific exercises that you can safely perform."

This can be totally different for each person. Maybe you want to build muscle, maybe you want to lose weight, or maybe you want to keep your body fit and healthy. Having a clear goal will motivate you to continue exercising even when you don't feel like it. Aim for something specific: to run a half-marathon in 6 months, or to perform 30 push-ups per minute in 3 weeks. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Think about what you want to be good at. Maybe you don't have a weight goal or a waistline goal, but you want to be able to run a 5k, no problem. Many people exercise so they can lose a little weight. Do you want to be 4 inches (10 cm) thinner around the waist by summer? 15 pounds (7 kg) lighter in 6 months? Lose 5% of your body fat by next year? Make sure to set healthy goals for yourself. Don’t try to lose an excessive amount of weight in a short amount of time. If you’re uncertain whether an exercise or weight-loss goal is healthy or not, check with your doctor."

To avoid this situation, prioritize daily (or weekly) exercise over other inessential parts of your day. Making exercise your first priority will ensure that it doesn’t get put off as mundane obligations start to pile up during the day. [3] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview. 30 June 2020. For example, set your alarm an hour earlier and get in some time at the gym before work every morning. Or, let your friends know that you can’t make it out for happy hour, since you need to exercise right after work. Conversely, be careful not to obsess over exercising, or to cut off social ties for the sake of working out. Keep yourself motivated by interspersing exercise with other components of your life."

A gym’s main benefit is convenience: it has cardio machines, weight machines, and free weights (among other equipment) all in 1 place. If your main exercise goals are to improve your heart rate, lose weight, or bulk up on muscle, a gym is the best place to start. [4] X Research source Don’t worry about feeling intimidated by other gym members, either. Most people at gyms are supportive of one another and mind their own business. Average gym membership costs can range from $20-45 USD per month. If that’s more than you can afford, try looking around for a discount gym in your area. Discount gyms may have fewer machines and weights but can cost as little as $10 USD per month."

Depending on the gym you’re a member at, you may be entitled to a free session with a personal trainer just for signing up. Once the free sessions have expired, you’ll be looking at an average cost of $80-125 USD per session to work with the trainers. If you’d like a less-expensive option, see if trainers at the gym offer group-training sessions.

Have you been hiking that one trail without fail and with ease since you started? Time for the harder one. Or, lengthen the amount of time you work out. Instead of working out twice a week for 20 minutes, start working out 4 times a week for 30 minutes.
