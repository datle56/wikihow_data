      "content": "Covering up your skin will help prevent welts and bruises. Go with long sleeve shirts and long, athletic pants to reduce the impact of the paintballs. [1] X Research source Even if it's warm out, long sleeves with pants is the way to go. Your skin will thank you later! Wear shorts over a pair of pants for an added layer of protection for your upper legs and groin. Some paintball courses actually prohibit shorts for safety reasons. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Layers give you extra padding and keep you comfortable outdoors. Getting hit by a paintball can hurt and even cause light bruising. To protect yourself, dress in 2-3 layers of clothing to reduce the impact of paintballs. Layers are key for playing paintball in colder months because you can easily remove them if you start to feel hot. You might start the game feeling a little chilly, but running around will get you warmed up in no time. [3] X Research source However, when playing in the summer or on hot days, wear one layer to avoid overheating, and use lightweight, breathable, moisture-wicking clothing. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Natural colors will help you blend in with your surroundings. Earth tones like green, brown, and gray work great for paintball. Or, if you really want to go all out, you could wear camo clothing or a military-style camouflage suit, but that's definitely not necessary for first-time or hobby players. [5] X Research source Choose light colors like white, tan, and light green to avoid overheating during summer paintball. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Comfortable, sturdy shoes are crucial since you'll be running around a lot.",
      "content": "Comfortable, sturdy shoes are crucial since you'll be running around a lot. Paintball cleats or regular athletic cleats are a great option to get better traction. Wear athletic socks, too, since they provide extra cushioning to high-impact areas on your feet. Whether or not you’re allowed to wear cleats will depend on where you’re playing. Some paintball courses are made of turf and require turf-specific cleats and others may ban cleats with metal studs to avoid tearing up the terrain. Open-toed shoes lack the support you need and leave your feet vulnerable to getting hit by paintballs, which can really hurt. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Getting hit in the hand by a paintball can really hurt, but gloves help.",
      "content": "Getting hit in the hand by a paintball can really hurt, but gloves help. Wear gloves for extra protection. Just make sure the gloves aren't so thick or large that they make it hard to work the trigger of your gun. Fingerless gloves give your hands a layer of protection without impacting your ability to pull the trigger. While there are specialized gloves with extra padding on the market, other great options are golf gloves or weightlifting gloves."

      "content": "Safety goggles or a shield are a must to keep your eyes and face safe. Getting hit by a paintball anywhere on your body can sting a little, but getting hit in the eye or the teeth can actually cause damage. [8] X Research source Never adjust your safety mask on the course, even if you think you’re hidden and not at risk of being hit. If you need to fix your goggles or mask during the game, most places have a designated area outside of the course to do so. [9] X Research source Masks and goggles are typically provided by paintball courses since you can’t play without them."

Some people wear athletic supporters and cups that they use for football or hockey, but there are also padded shorts that provide protection to your hips and crotch that you can purchase. [10] X Research source People with breasts may want to wear a padded sports bra to provide some extra protection. [11] X Research source"

Products like neck protectors and chest padding are available online and in stores, but even just elbow pads , knee pads , or shin guards from other sports will work. Use removable protective gear to keep you from overheating. While most safety gear tends to be pretty breathable, playing on hot days may require taking it all off to air out between rounds.
