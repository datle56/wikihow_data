      "content": "Let the milk mixture sit for at least 5 minutes. Once the milk and acid have been mixed together completely, allow the mixture to stand at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. That will give it time to thicken up and curdle slightly so you’ll have sour milk. [3] X Research source The recipe makes 1 cup (237 cup) of sour milk.
