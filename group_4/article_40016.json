All you need to do is add detergent to the water drawn into the washing machine, then let the clothes soak for 20-30 minutes in the mix of detergent and standing water. [1] X Research source It will be easier to soak clothes in a top-loading washing machine than in a side-loading machine. Check your side-loading machine for an integrated pre-soak function. [2] X Research source Pre-soaking in the machine can be convenient because you won't need to transfer the fabric after the soak. However, you don't need to soak in the washing machine if you plan to hand-wash your clothes."

When the detergent is evenly distributed and the water is soapy, you are ready to add your clothing. The recommended dose of detergent should be listed on the bottle of the cleaning product. If there is a cap to the detergent, you can usually get by with filling the cap."

      "content": "Soak your clothes. Put all of the clothes you wish to wash into the chamber of the laundry machine. Make sure that all garments are completely submerged beneath the water-and-detergent mixture. Leave the fabrics to soak for up to an hour unless otherwise directed. Leave tough stains to soak for even longer. If the fabric is resilient—say, denim or canvas—you can soak for several hours to launch a more powerful attack on the stain. Don't soak for too long! Fragile fibers like wool and cotton may begin to come apart or dissolve with extended exposure to stain-removal agents. This is especially the case if you are using an industrial-strength product like bleach."

When the hour has passed, take the clothing out of the washing machine and rinse it thoroughly to remove the soaking detergent or stain-removal fluid.

      "content": "Fill the soaking container. Use a bucket, tub, or trough deep enough to submerge the entire garment underwater. Suitable soaking spaces may include a clean laundry sink, a clean bucket, or even a baby's bath. Add enough water that you can submerge all of the clothing, but not so much that the addition of the clothing will displace the water and make it spill over. To avoid this problem: try first filling the bucket with the clothes that you want to soak, and then pouring the water over the clothing. [3] X Research source You will need to locate a suitable container that can be filled with water and still take the added clothing size. Remember that the weight of the clothing will increase the water level!"

Push down any pieces of fabric that pop up above the waterline. If you are trying to remove a small, localized stain, then consider only soaking the stained corner of the fabric. This way, you won't need as much room. [4] X Research source If the water spills over, then you've added too many garments. Try soaking in stages, or soaking simultaneously in multiple buckets.

[6] X Research source Do a light soak (20-30 minutes) if you're just having a routine wash. Soak for longer if you're trying to intensively remove a heavy stain.

In general, heavy, durable fabrics are great to soak, whereas delicate garments might be better suited to a scrub. Be careful about soaking wool. It is a soft, delicate fabric, and a wool garment runs the risk of shrinking if you soak it for too long."

Run a web search to determine the best practice for a particular type of stain: e.g. grass, blood, food, urine."
