      "content": "Giving up control might be hard if you normally take care of yourself. When you’re used to doing everything on your own, it can be a challenge transitioning into a balanced relationship. If you don’t want to give up control, then you won’t trust your partner to do things for you. It may also lead to issues where your partner starts becoming more resistant as as you try controlling them more. [5] X Research source Remind yourself that you can’t force things to go absolutely perfect even if you have full control. Be willing to accept failure as an experience you can learn from. Take baby steps towards giving up if you recognize it in your relationship. You might start by trusting your partner doing small, household tasks without stepping in. As you get more comfortable, you can loosen the reins on larger tasks. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "You may have feelings of betrayal because others cut you out. If you have been betrayed or rejected in a previous relationship or friendship, it makes you fearful about building trust in the future.

      "content": "Holding your partner to such high standards causes them to break your trust. You may set higher expectations based on how you grew up and past relationships, but they can sometimes be impossible for your partner to reach. You may not even communicate your expectations, but assuming your partner knows sets them up to fail. When you or your partner don’t reach the expectations set by the other, it could affect how comfortable you feel in the relationship. [14] X Research source Tell your partner what you expect from them directly so they have a better understanding of what you need from the relationship. Imagine what you would say to a close friend or family member if they had the same ideals.
