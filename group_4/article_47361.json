Turn the water back on and use a paddle brush to gently brush out any tangles in the weave. Avoid using a paddle brush under running water on your weave. Paddle brushes can collect water, which makes them more prone to mold and mildew."

      "content": "Sit under a hair dryer for 45 minutes. When you wash a leave-in weave, it’s very important to dry it completely before you leave your home or go to bed. Turn off the water, brush any remaining tangles out of your weave, and sit underneath a hair dryer. Set a timer for 45 minutes and let your weave dry before you move onto doing anything else. [5] X Research source If you don’t have access to a hair dryer, use a blow dryer or air dry your weave. It’s extremely important that your weave and your natural hair underneath dry completely. Otherwise, mold and mildew may start to develop, which will create a bad smell. These microbes can also cause scalp problems and damage your hair."

Then, rinse out the deep conditioner with cold water and shampoo. Go back under the hair dryer until your weave is completely dry. [9] X Research source If you have a leave-out weave, apply the deep conditioner to the entire weave and put it in a plastic shower cap. Add a little bit of water and put it in the microwave for 3-4 minutes. Then, take it out, rinse out the conditioner in a sink with cold water, shampoo as normal, and lay it out to dry completely. If you don’t have a hair dryer, put a shower cap on and then wrap a towel around your head to trap in the heat. Then, let it sit for 15 minutes before you rinse it out and let it air dry."
