      "title": "Unroll the wrapping paper with the pattern facing down.",
      "content": "Unroll the wrapping paper with the pattern facing down. Work on a large flat surface, such as a cleared kitchen table or hardwood floor. Keep the wrapping paper on its roll, and unroll about an arm’s length of paper. Do not cut the wrapping paper from the roll yet. [1] X Research source You can grab a few lightweight objects, like scissors or a tape roll, to use as temporary paperweights. Place these on the corners of the wrapping paper and near the roll to hold the paper in place and prevent it from rolling back up."

    {
      "title": "Place the gift box upside-down on the wrapping paper.",
      "content": "Place the gift box upside-down on the wrapping paper. Put the gift box about halfway between the edge of the wrapping paper and the roll of wrapping paper, then flip the box over so the top lays on the inside of the wrapping paper (the side without the pattern). Position the longest sides of the box parallel to the edge of the wrapping paper, making sure the paper extends past all sides of the gift box. [2] X Research source For a standard box, leave about 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of paper on each side, or about 4 fingers worth of space. Leave extra wiggle room if you have a larger box. [3] X Research source If the sides of the gift box extend past the wrapping paper in this position, turn it 45 degrees so the short end of the box is perpendicular to the cut end of the paper. Don’t forget to remove the price tag on your gift or black out the price tag with a sharpie. If your gift is fragile, pad it with tissue paper or bubble wrap before wrapping it. If your box contains multiple items, wrap each one separately."

      "title": "Fold the paper around the box to determine how much paper to cut.",
      "content": "Fold the paper around the box to determine how much paper to cut. Take the edge of the wrapping paper and pull it over the width of the box, lining it up with the far edge of the box (closest to the wrapping paper tube). Make sure the edge of the wrapping paper meets the base of the box, then use a pen or pencil to mark this point. [4] X Research source Alternatively, you can use a ruler or tape measure to calculate the perimeter of the box, then add 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of paper on each side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Measure out 3 in (7.6 cm) from this point and draw a straight line.",
      "content": "Measure out 3 in (7.6 cm) from this point and draw a straight line. Give yourself about 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of additional wrapping paper for folding and overlapping. Use a ruler or yardstick to draw a straight line on the inside of the wrapping paper. [5] X Research source Some wrapping paper comes with lines marked on the inside. If your wrapping paper is lined, just follow the line that’s about 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) away from the mark you drew."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use scissors to cut along the marked line.",
      "content": "Use scissors to cut along the marked line . For a clean, smooth cut, simply slide the scissors across the entire length of the wrapping paper. Hold the end of the paper closest to your body taut and direct the scissors away from your body, with the blades relatively close together. [6] X Research source Super thin and stiff wrapping papers may snag and tear if you do this. Instead, you can cut the paper along the line in short, clean strokes."

      "title": "Wrap the paper over one of the long sides of the box and tape it down.",
      "content": "Wrap the paper over one of the long sides of the box and tape it down. Reposition the box so the long sides are parallel to the edges of the cut paper. Pick up one side of the wrapping paper, along the long side of the box, and wrap it over the box so it covers about 2 in (5.1 cm) of the upward-facing side of the box. Tape the edge of the paper directly onto the box, then use your fingers to create a crease along the edge of the box. [7] X Research source You can use 2 or 3 pieces of regular tape to keep the wrapping paper in place."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the remaining wrapping paper taut over the taped-down area.",
      "content": "Pull the remaining wrapping paper taut over the taped-down area. Fold the remaining length of paper over the box so it overlaps the taped-down area and completely covers the perimeter of the box. Use your fingers to crease the wrapping paper on each edge of the box. Then, fold the raw cut edge of the paper underneath so you’re left with a smooth, straight crease. Tape this edge onto the box with double-sided tape so it covers the part of the paper you already taped down. [8] X Research source By following this process, the folded edge should be aligned at or near the corner of your box. Even though this will be the bottom of your gift box, it will still have a neat and attractive finish."

    {
      "title": "Fold the left and right flaps of paper toward the middle of the box.",
      "content": "Fold the left and right flaps of paper toward the middle of the box. At this point, 2 sides of the box will have unfolded paper sticking out on the top and bottom. Starting on one side, push both ends of the paper inward so they hug the corners of the box. Crease these corners with your thumb and index finger, then repeat on the other side. [9] X Research source Now, you have triangular flaps on the top and bottom, with the paper folded at a 45-degree angle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tape the top flap down, then tape the bottom flap up.",
      "content": "Tape the top flap down, then tape the bottom flap up. Create a sharp crease with your fingers along the top edge of the box as you angle the top triangular flap down. It should completely cover the side of the box and overlap the left and right pieces you just folded inward. Use tape to secure the top flap in place. Then, tuck the raw edge of the bottom flap over to make a clean edge, crease the edges of the box, and fold the bottom flap over the top flap and secure it in place with double-sided tape. [10] X Research source If the top flap overlaps the bottom flap of paper significantly, you may trim off the excess paper from the top flap at this point. Repeat this process on the other side to finish wrapping your gift box."

      "title": "Lay the box face-down on a long piece of ribbon.",
      "content": "Lay the box face-down on a long piece of ribbon. Use a piece of ribbon that’s about 5 times as long as the gift box. Position the box in the middle of the ribbon, then draw the ends of the ribbon together so they meet in the horizontal and vertical center of the base of the box (which is facing upwards). [11] X Research source If you’re using curling ribbon , measure out a much longer length so that you can curl the ends into a bouncy ribbon bundle. Think outside the box when it comes to selecting your ribbon. Metallic ribbon can be eye-catching on jewel-toned or pastel wrapping paper. Twine can create a cozy, rustic appearance, especially when paired with simple brown kraft paper."

      "title": "Cross the ribbon ends and wrap them around the box in the other direction.",
      "content": "Cross the ribbon ends and wrap them around the box in the other direction. Crisscross the ribbon ends at the center of the box. Turn them at opposing right angles so that they interlock with each other. Then, wrap the ribbon around the box crosswise, flipping the box right-side up as you do so. [12] X Research source If you’ve already wrapped the ribbon around the box the long way, you’ll now wrap it around the short way."

      "title": "Pass the ribbon ends under the ribbon that’s flat against the box.",
      "content": "Pass the ribbon ends under the ribbon that’s flat against the box. Slide each end under the taut length of ribbon at the horizontal and vertical center of the box. The ribbon should now form a cross shape. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Knot the ribbon ends at the center and create a simple bow.",
      "content": "Knot the ribbon ends at the center and create a simple bow. Hold the loose ribbon ends upwards and tie them together, around the taut length of ribbon, with a single overhand knot. You can then tie a simple bow . Follow the same process as you would when tying your shoelaces. [14] X Research source For a nontraditional bow, arts and crafts specialist Amy Guerrero recommends “suspending a jingle bell from the center.” Or, she says you can tuck a “foraged plant foliage under the ribbon, add a pom pom or tassel, or a handmade clay tag” for a festive touch. If you’re using a wider ribbon, you can either trim the ends to a neat 45-degree angle or cut out a decorative V-shaped notch. If you plan to include a hanging gift tag in your wrapping, thread one of the ribbon ends through the hanging gift tag’s loop before you complete the overhand knot and bow."
