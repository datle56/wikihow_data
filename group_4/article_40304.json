      "title": "Adjust an incline bench to a 45° angle.",
      "content": "Adjust an incline bench to a 45° angle. The angle of the bench is important in a spider curl—you can drop the bench lower, if you want, but don’t raise it any higher than 45°. By leaning forward, you make it harder to use your back, shoulders, and abs to lift, so the effort is more isolated to your biceps. [1] X Research source Lowering the bench also makes it harder to “cheat” the move by using momentum to swing the weights upward. If you prefer, you can use the inclined side of a preacher bench instead of an incline bench."

      "title": "Place a straight bar, EZ-bar, or dumbbells in front of the bench.",
      "content": "Place a straight bar, EZ-bar, or dumbbells in front of the bench. Spider curls are versatile, so you can use whichever type of weight you’re most comfortable with. Place the weights on a stand or the floor just in front of the weight bench so you can easily grab them once you’re in place. [2] X Research source An EZ-bar may be a little easier on your wrists than a straight bar, while dumbbells will give you a little more control over your lift angle. When you’re doing spider curls, choose a weight that you can comfortably lift for 10–15 reps."

    {
      "title": "Lean forward so the top of the bench is around your armpits.",
      "content": "Lean forward so the top of the bench is around your armpits. If you’re using an incline bench, stand so you’re straddling the bench, then lean the front of your body against the bench. If you’re using a preacher bench, stand on the side without a bench and lean your chest against the slope. [3] X Research source In either case, rest your armpits against the top of the bench for stability. Keeping the top of your chest off of the bench will make it easier to breathe. It will also give you a better range of motion than if you were to slide further down the bench. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pick up the weight with your palms out.",
      "content": "Pick up the weight with your palms out. Let your arms hang straight down, then rotate them so your palms are facing away from you and your thumbs are out to the sides. This is known as a supinated grip. Grab your weight using this grip. [5] X Research source If you’re using a straight bar or EZ-bar, keep your hands about shoulder-width apart. [6] X Research source If you’re using dumbbells, it’s okay to start with a neutral grip (your palms facing each other), then rotate out to a supinated position as you curl. [7] X Research source If you’re on the shorter side, it may be easier to kneel with your knees on the bench."

    {
      "title": "Curl the weight straight up without moving your upper arms.",
      "content": "Curl the weight straight up without moving your upper arms. Concentrate on flexing your biceps to pull the weight up as high as you can towards your chin. At the very top of the lift, pause and clench your biceps to really isolate and work that muscle. [8] X Research source Don’t “row” your elbows backward as you lift. Only your forearms should move—there should be minimal movement above the elbows. Rowing works more of your back and shoulders, and spider curls are designed to isolate your biceps. [9] X Research source As you’re lifting the weights, flex your feet and press down into the ground. This will help keep you steady so you don’t slip. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower the weight slowly back down.",
      "content": "Lower the weight slowly back down. Try not to let momentum pull the weight down—focus on keeping your movements smooth and controlled during the entire downward motion. At the end of the move, your arms should be hanging straight down again. [11] X Research source Lifting the weight and lowering it back down is 1 complete rep."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.",
      "content": "Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps. Breathe deeply as you continue lifting and lowering the weight, and remember to squeeze at the top of every lift. Do a full set of somewhere between 10 and 15 reps, pause for a few deep breaths, then continue until you’ve done 3 full sets. [12] X Research source Some lifters prefer to do more sets with fewer reps—so you might do 5 sets of 10 reps instead of 3 reps of 15. Use steady, controlled movements and an even tempo when you’re doing spider curls—spider curls aren’t meant to be explosive. It may help to count your reps out loud [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Variation—Raise your arms:",
      "content": "Variation—Raise your arms: Instead of letting your arms hang straight down toward the floor, start with your arms at a 90° angle to your torso (or about 45° from the floor). In this variation, you start the move with your biceps already contracted, so you’ll spend more time activating the muscles you’re trying to isolate. [14] X Research source When to do this: Raising your arms will make the spider curls more challenging. Another bonus of this move is that it activates both the short and long heads of the bicep muscles, so you’re working them more completely."

      "title": "Variation—Spider hammer curl:",
      "content": "Variation—Spider hammer curl: Start in the same position you would for a spider curl—lean forward on an incline bench set to about 45°. Grip a pair of dumbbells in a neutral position, so your palms are facing each other. Then, curl the dumbbells up toward your chin, keeping your hands in a neutral position for the entire move. [15] X Research source When to do this: Try spider hammer curls to work your brachialis muscle, which helps control your elbow. Because you can’t use a neutral grip with an EZ-bar or a straight bar, spider hammer curls can only be done with dumbbells."

      "title": "Variation—Cable spider curl:",
      "content": "Variation—Cable spider curl: Place your incline bench or preacher bench about 3–4 ft (0.91–1.22 m) in front of a cable pulley and set the pulley a little higher than the lowest setting. Holding the cable, slowly curl your arms up toward your chin, squeezing your biceps at the top of the move. Maintain control of the pulley as you lower it back to the starting position. [16] X Research source When to do this: Use cables to get more control over your movements. The resistance of the cable will help you use the same amount of force throughout the entire curl.

      "content": "Alternative—Bicep curl: To perform a regular bicep curl, start either sitting or standing upright. Keeping your shoulders back, core tight, and chest high, curl a weight all the way up toward your chin, then lower it again until your arms are straight. When to do this: Basic bicep curls are a great option if you don't have access to a preacher bench or incline bench."

      "title": "Alternative—Preacher curl:",
      "content": "Alternative—Preacher curl: To do a preacher curl, sit on the bench side of a preacher bench. Lean forward and rest your arms on the outside of the top, inclined section of the bench bench, so your upper arms and elbows are supported on the pad. Using an underhand grip, curl the weights straight upward toward your chin. [18] X Research source When to do this: Preacher curls give you extra support under your elbow, which may make it easier to lift heavier weights. [19] X Research source"

      "title": "When should I do spider curls?",
      "content": "When should I do spider curls? Add spider curls to the end of an arm workout. When you’re targeting bigger arms, most of your exercises will probably be lifts and curls using heavier weights. Those are great for adding bulk, and finishing with an isolating exercise like spider curls will help add definition. [20] X Research source Spider curls are a great add-on to a workout that includes chin-ups , deadlifts , and rows . [21] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Should I incline the bench 30° or 45° for a spider curl?",
      "content": "Should I incline the bench 30° or 45° for a spider curl? The bench should be lowered to at least 45° for spider curls, but you can drop it lower if you want. Lowering the bench to 30° will make the curl more challenging because it will be harder to use your back and shoulder muscles to support the weight. [23] X Research source"
