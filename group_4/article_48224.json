      "content": "A crunchy mom refers to someone who practices a natural parenting style. Crunchy moms tend to be environmentally, societally, and health-conscious. They tend to go against the status quo and reject modern conveniences. They might limit their children’s dependency on technology, modern medicine, and processed food and prefer more natural alternatives. “I’m spending my Saturday night sewing cloth diapers for my baby and realizing that I’ll forever be known as a crunchy mom.” “My mom spends all her time homeschooling my brother and making him all-natural snacks. She’s definitely crunchy.” “I went hiking barefoot with my baby in a sling—my sister was right when she said I had crunchy mom vibes.” “I’m so glad I found a group of crunchy moms who embrace natural living, just like me.”"

      "content": "The term emerged in the 2010s and was inspired by “granola” parents. The term “crunchy mom” came about in the early 2010s on parenting and motherhood websites to describe mothers who followed a natural parenting style, similar to the hippie “granola” parents of the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, “crunchy” is believed to come from the crunchiness of “granola.” [4] X Research source Crunchy moms are also sometimes called “neo-hippies.” [5] X Research source While “crunchy mom” and the alternative terms “silky mom” and “scrunchy mom” have been used in parenting circles since the early 2010s, they became more popular in the 2020s due to social media platforms like TikTok. Although labels like “crunchy mom” are sometimes used negatively, many parents have embraced them to celebrate their own unique parenting styles."

      "content": "Silky moms embrace modern technology, science, and convenience. They rely on modern conveniences to combat modern burnout. The opposite of crunchy moms, silky moms might use disposable diapers, vaccinate their children, and let their kids eat fast food. [6] X Research source They may also allow their children to use screens for an extended amount of time. [7] X Research source Silky moms might have medicated or surgical births in hospitals, use baby formula or bottles, or feel unconcerned about artificial additives in food. [8] X Research source Crunchy moms aren’t better than silky moms, or vice versa. Each parent, family, and circumstance is different, and whatever parenting style you choose is completely valid."

      "content": "Scrunchy moms balance between crunchy and silky parenting styles. Scrunchy moms tend to fall somewhere in between the crunchy-silky mom spectrum. For example, a scrunchy mom might buy both wooden rather than plastic toys or use cloth diapers but opt to put their baby in a crib at night rather than co-sleeping (which crunchy moms tend to favor). [9] X Research source Scrunchy moms might feel like they don’t fully identify with either crunchy or silky moms or avoid limiting themselves to one category or the other. [10] X Research source"
