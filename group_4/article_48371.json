      "content": "Independence Water bearers tend to be free spirits who don't respond well to rigidity and limits—and they expect the same from their partner. They look for someone who's as independent-minded as they are, someone who's forging their own path and believes in doing things on their own. This doesn't mean that you never need any help with anything! Aquarians just prefer a lady who's capable of taking care of herself and isn't looking for anyone else to do it for her.

He needs a partner who can keep up with his quick and innovative mind as well as contribute to the process. As an air sign, Aquarian guys definitely have the gift for gab so they also need their partners to have great communication skills. Astrologer Angel Eyedealism agrees that to attract an Aquarius, \"you must engage mentally first.\""

Psychic astrologer Stina Garbis recommends that you \"wear something unique, be different and edgy to catch their attention.\" She adds that you could \"wear a hint of something wild with your outfit, like a bright scarf or brooch.\" Garbis also notes that \"Aquarians are a little odd at times to many people, so they need a partner that gets them enough to allow them to be who they are.\" If you're a little weird too, he'll probably feel a lot more comfortable around you."

That's why water bearers tend to go for ladies who have hope for the future and ideas about how to improve things for people—especially those who are less fortunate.

But at the same time, this is a special need for a water bearer because he wants a partner who is able to go their own way and take care of themselves. A great way to show him that you're confident is to ask him out first. He'll be flattered, and you'll also let him know that you're interested in him in a romantic way. He tends to focus on being friends first and might miss the romance cues."

He also likes to leave himself open to whatever opportunity might come his way. When it comes to his partner, he needs someone who's also willing to do something off-the-cuff or go in a different direction than planned if circumstances call for it. For example, if the two of you are talking about your favorite restaurants and you mention one about 2 hours away in a nearby town, you might suggest that the two of you drive there for dinner. Be honest about any limitations you might have so he knows what's off the table. For example, if you had to go to work early in the morning tomorrow, you probably wouldn't be down for a spontaneous overnight trip tonight."

It's great if you're interested in the same sports or activities, but it's not necessarily a dealbreaker if you're not—he also likes it when his lady has her own interests that are separate from his. The sign Aquarius has influence over the legs and calves, so many Aquarian guys really get going at the sight of a toned set of nice long legs.

Even though you might find it hard to trust him, you have to be willing to give your favorite water bearer a little space or he's likely to run for the hills.

He wants a partner who challenges conventions just as much as he does.

But romance is definitely not out of the cards and they can have a pretty profound sexual connection. [3] X Research source Aquarius gets along great with their fellow Aquarians, in particular.

At the same time, if they find a way for their differences to complement each other, they can form an unshakable bond.

Taurus might be the best Earth sign combo for Aquarius because Taurus appreciates just how honest and real a water bearer is. They can be great partners in some truly revolutionary ventures."

If Aquarius can learn to be a little more sensitive, though, they can form a strong romantic bond. Scorpio comes out best here with their natural tendency towards secrecy.

As an air sign, intellect and communication are super-important to any Aquarius guy—and nothing gets his motor running quite like a little verbal sparring. So go ahead and spin out your most outlandish, off-the-wall theory and see what he has to say. Just be ready for the sparks that will surely fly.

While each guy is going to have his own interests and beliefs, one thing you can be sure about is that your Aquarius guy is going to be passionate about something . He doesn't need you to share his specific passions (although it's great if you do) but he'll feel more connected to you if he knows there's something that you get worked up about. Talking about issues you're passionate about also helps him to see that you care about humanity as much as he does. You might also invite him to films or discussion groups dedicated to an interest that you're passionate about. This gives him the opportunity to learn more about the issue (and about you)."

The water bearer is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kind of guy in a lot of ways and he doesn't like his calendar to get filled up with engagements—what if something better comes along? If you try to make plans with him more than a week out, he's likely to decline (or forget about it and end up doing something else). To strengthen your connection with him, ask him how far in advance he usually plans or how much notice he needs for a certain type of date or activity. For example, he may need to give his employer 2 weeks' notice if he needs time off, so if you're planning a romantic getaway, you'd want to tell him at least 2 weeks before—but probably not any earlier than that."
