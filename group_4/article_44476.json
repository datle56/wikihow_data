      "title": "Use eucalyptus.",
      "content": "Use eucalyptus. Eucalyptus is typically available as an oil instead of an herb. However, it is also available in lozenges, cough medicines, rubs, and bath salves. It has a strong scent and decongestant properties that can help with mucus build up. Eucalyptus has been proven safe for pregnant and nursing women as well as children and it has the GRAS status in the US.. However, never use the oil on children under two years old and always follow dosage instructions. [1] X Research source Electronic Code of Federal Regulations. Title 21. Part 182 -- Substances Generally Recognized As Safe Use a small amount, as the oil is very strong. Try putting a few drops into a bowl of hot water for a steam treatment. Never ingest eucalyptus oil unless specifically told to by your doctor. There are cold and cough medicines that have eucalyptus oil in them, but they have been formulated for ingestion. The oil is very concentrated and can be very dangerous if too much is ingested. Always ask your doctor before taking any dosage of eucalyptus oil orally."

Cardamom has antibacterial properties, which can help you fight bacteria or infection involved with your congestion. Cardamom has not been tested in pregnant and nursing women nor in children.

Cayenne pepper works as a counterirritant, which means it irritates the mucous membranes with the result of increasing mucus production. Unlike with congestion, the mucus produced tends to be more liquid and easier to drain. [8] X Research source Cardamom is available as a spice, as seeds, and as an oil. All can be used in cooking to help with congestion. The dosing depends on taste. Cayenne is available as a raw pepper, which can be eaten raw or cooked. You can also get it at powder, which can be used in recipes and mixed into beverages. There is no dosing information. The amount depends in taste. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Understand how steam helps.",
      "content": "Understand how steam helps. Most decongestant herbs are best taken as steam treatments, breathing the herbs in, directly into the nose, the lungs, and the sinuses. Steam can help open up the nasal passages, help thin out the sometimes thick mucus, and allow the mucus to drain out of the sinuses. These treatments can be used along with pain relievers, antibiotics, and antifungal treatments as well as for viral infections of the sinuses. If you are already seeing a physician, continue with those treatments along with steam treatments. If you are not seeing a physician and these treatments don’t give you any relief within five to seven days, make an appointment to see a physician. You may be dealing with a more complicated situation."

      "title": "Use the right herbs for steam treatments.",
      "content": "Use the right herbs for steam treatments. You can use dried herbs or the essential oils when you use the steam method for your decongestion. Essential oils tend to be a bit more effective because they are the concentrated forms of the herbs. You can also try a mixture of a couple different herbs or oils, such as eucalyptus and peppermint. These essential oils have either antibacterial, antifungal, or antiseptic properties. This means they can kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can infect the sinuses as well as help break up congestion. Be aware that allergic reactions are always possible with herbs. The first time you try an herb, do so for only three to five minutes for steam treatments and then wait for 30 minutes to determine if you are experiencing any adverse reactions. If you do, choose another herb. [17] X Research source"

Remove from heat, then add either one to two drop of the essential oils or 1/2 a teaspoon of dried herbs for one quart of water. Sit the pot aside and cover. Let the oil or herb steep in the hot water for five minutes. [18] X Research source If you don't have a quart pot, a kettle or other pot that can hold at least a quart of water will work fine. Never place your head over boiling water. This can cause burns or serious injury. Cayenne pepper is the exception to the recipe for teas and steam decongesting. Use ⅛ to ¼ a teaspoon. This herb is very strong and is too overpowering in larger doses. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the herbal steam treatment. Open the lid of the pot. Place your hand over the pot to test the temperature. It should be hot but not painful. If it is a good temperature, cover your head with a large, clean cotton towel, close your eyes, and place your head over the steaming pot that is away from the stove. Keep your face at least 12 inches away from the water. You want the heat to enter your nose and throat, but you certainly don’t want to damage or burn yourself with heat. [20] X Research source Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth for five counts and then in and out through your mouth for two counts. Repeat for 10 minutes or as long as the water is still steaming. Try to blow your nose during and after the treatments. You can do this every two hours or as often as your schedule permits.
