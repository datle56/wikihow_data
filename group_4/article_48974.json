When you get a chain that branches off in multiple directions first look at the splitting point. Count \"1\" for the base and one of the branches, count another \"1\" for each additional branch. Most Y-Chain will count as \"2\" since there will be one base and branch with one additional branch. It is very important you only consider chains within a Y-Chain. non-Chains can sometimes branch off of a chain but this is not a Y-Chain. Y-Chains are when a long chain has a small chain branching off of it. Sometimes more than one. Sometimes if there is more than one branch, consider the possibility that the Y-Chain can be broken in the middle making only 2 regular chains. Without considering this possibility you might think the Y-Chain is worth \"3\" since it has 2 branches. But if it is broken in the middle, leaving only 2 chains, then it is worth \"2\"."

A loop and a chain suggest a count of \"3\" but depending on where the follower places the line, you might need to sacrifice or you might be able to take it all. When you encounter a Y-Loop, the loop is always the base and branch which counts as \"2\" followed by the count of the chains that branch off of it. Similar to the Y-Chain, if there are 2 or more chains branching off of it, there is a possibility of cutting the Y-Loop by sacrificing 1 or 2 boxes within the loop and creating one large chain. This would reduce a Y-Loop with a value of \"4\" to a chain with a value of \"1\" which can drastically change the final score."
