      "content": "Look them in the eye and tell them to stop. If a bully is getting in your face, put your hand out like a crossing-guard, creating a barrier between you and the bully. Look them in the eye and say, calmly but firmly, \"I want you to stop right now.\" If they continue encroaching on your territory or continue mocking you in some way, simply repeat your sentence. \"Stop. I want you to stop right now. Stop.\" Don't say or do anything else but hold your ground and repeat yourself.

      "title": "Learn how bullies think.",
      "content": "Learn how bullies think. Bullies tend to pick on those who they identify as being unwilling or unable to stand up for themselves. Bullies choose easy targets to \"test\" by needling with words and actions. The quickest and best way to end bullying is to stand up for yourself and tell the bully firmly to stop and repeat the action until they comply. Negotiating, trying to befriend, or showing that it bothers you will give them more ammunition and make it worse. Don't whine, try not to cry, and stay firm. They'll get bored and lose interest when you stand up for yourself and don't give them anything to bully. There's nothing funny to say about \"Stop.\" There's nothing to mock in someone who is confident."

      "content": "Stand tall and stare them down. [3] X Research source Pay attention to the way you hold yourself physically in the presence of bullies. Even if they're bigger than you (which they often are) stand up straight and look them straight in the eye. Hold their gaze icily. Look through them. Look as if you know something they don't. Think of your favorite strong-willed characters from movies. Picture Vin Diesel, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Clint Eastwood standing up to your bully as you stare them down: \"Go ahead, punk. Make my day.\" Cast yourself as Meryl Streep in Devil Wears Prada Angelina Jolie in Wanted , or even Wednesday Adams from the Adams Family. Be unflappable."

      "title": "Close your ears.",
      "content": "Close your ears. Don't listen to the things bullies say or take them seriously. Bullies say things in order to get a rise out of you, not because they believe these things, not because they are true, and not because they're trying to help. They're trying to break you down as a way of holding themselves up, because bullies are insecure and bullies are weak at heart. Develop a mantra to recite if you're consistently bullied, and continually run it over in your mind while your bully is talking. A good mantra might be a set of lyrics that you like, or a prayer, or a quote that holds you up. If they get in your face, tell them to stop and hold your icy stare. Stay calm. Repeat your mantra."

      "content": "Defend yourself with smarts. [4] X Research source Don't allow yourself to get sucked into an insult-exchange with a bully. You'll almost always lose any kind of verbal head-to-head, even if you're wittier, funnier, and smarter (which you are). Bullies rig the game. Don't try to come up with better come-backs and cutting insults, which can do more to make it worse. Don't play the bullying game. Don't give them more ammunition. Tell them to stop, stand tall, and give them a target they'll be uninterested in. Alternatively, play dumb. \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, the professional wrestler, used to interrupt other wrestlers who tried to talk trash by shouting, \"What?\" and acting confused when they talked. It took the wind right out of their sails."

      "content": "Ignore bullies online . The best thing you can do to stand up to faceless online bullies is to ignore them. If someone is bullying you online, whether it be through email, text, Facebook, or other social networking, you need to disengage from the bully as much as possible. [5] X Research source Avoid getting sucked into an exchange of insults or arguments on any web platform, especially one in \"public.\" As tempting as it may be, avoid the temptation to sling mud back. If necessary, change your privacy settings, \"unfriend\" the bullying party, or start new accounts, if necessary. Just because it's not in person doesn't make it less dangerous."

      "content": "Learn to throw a punch. It's not advisable to let bullies draw you into a fight, but you'll be able to carry yourself with more confidence and character if you're confident that you'll be able to defend yourself if it comes to that. Learn to throw a proper punch and hold your own. Stand properly. [6] X Research source Put one foot forward and balance your weight with your legs shoulder width apart. Maintain a solid center of gravity and keep moving, bouncing on your toes. They can't hit you solidly if you keep moving. Make a fist. [7] X Research source Wrap your thumb around the bottom of your fingers, not inside your fist and not on the side of your fingers, as if you were holding a bug you didn't want to escape. Make a loose fist. Aim for the soft spots. If you've got to throw a punch, aim for a place that'll do the most damage. Smashing your fist into someone's jaw will hurt you more than them. Aim for the nose. [8] X Research source Keep your elbows tucked in. Throw straight punches and jabs, not wild uncontrolled hay makers. More power comes from vertical straight-ahead punches, so keep your elbows in. Play defense. Hold your non-writing hand near your chin to guard your face and hold your writing hand up nearer your cheek. When playing defense, leave your fists relatively loose to swat away punches."

If you're physically injured, take pictures of any cuts, scrapes, or bruises you receive. If your clothes get torn, save them. If anyone saw the bullying take place, talk to them and get them to come forward with you and report the behavior. Save any evidence of cyberbullying you receive by making a copy, taking a screen shot, or printing out hard copies for your records. Use these as evidence."

      "content": "Be kind to anyone being bullied. Bullies select targets who they perceive as being weak. People with fewer friends, or people who are physically smaller are more readily targeted by bullies. Because bullies lack confidence, they will only select targets they can intimidate and dominate. By befriending those who are likely to be bullied, you'll take away the ammunition and find safety in numbers. [12] X Research source It can be tempting and misguided to want to pile on a kid getting bullied to get the attention away from yourself. \"Hey, if that kid's getting it, it means I'm not getting it!\" Never do this.

Bullies will be less likely to pick on a group of kids. If you are confronted by a bully, stay solid in a pack. Stick with the plan. Tell them to stop and stare them down. Tell your friends to do the same. Stay confident. If a bully starts picking on a friend in your group, never laugh or join in the bullying. Don't try to deflect the bullying elsewhere, or you're engaging in bully-type behavior yourself."
