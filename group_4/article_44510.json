Get a fragrance-free type, since fragrances can dry out your skin more. Ointments and creams are better than lotion because they’re thicker and lock in more moisture. Pick up one of these products from any pharmacy. Particularly good moisturizer brands include Eucerin and Cetaphil. You could also use oils like baby oil. These tend to stay on your skin longer and lock in more moisture than creams. Petroleum jelly works as a good moisturizer, but you might find this a little too greasy or slippery.
