Studies show that acupressure can be effective for reducing nausea caused by motion sickness, pregnancy, cancer, chemotherapy, and surgical anesthesia. While it doesn't work for everyone, acupressure is cheap, non-invasive, and doesn’t cause harmful side effects. It’s certainly worth a try.

The P6 point, also called Neiguan, is on the inner side of your arm about one-sixth of the way between your wrist and elbow. The exact point is in the center of your wrist between the 2 large tendons there. A few other pressure points may also be effective, but most studies focus specifically on the P6 point. If you’ve ever taken someone’s pulse with your fingers on their wrist, that’s about where the P6 pressure point is located."

Each meridian is related to an organ or area of the body. If a meridian gets blocked, we experience symptoms related to that area. It's thought that stimulating “pressure points” in the appropriate meridian(s) releases the blocked energy and eases symptoms. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In Western medicine, it’s thought that stimulating pressure points may alter the “pain messages” that nerve endings send to the brain. [14] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source These altered signals tell the brain to release neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, which activate the central nervous system.
