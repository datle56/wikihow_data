      "title": "Choose ripe lychees with bright red skin.",
      "content": "Choose ripe lychees with bright red skin. Feel a lychee to tell how soft it is. A ripe berry feels a little firm, but overripe fruit is soft or mushy. Smell the lychees and buy red or pink berries that have a delicate floral scent. Don't purchase lychees that have an odd odor. [1] X Research source Since lychees won't continue to ripen after they're picked, plan on storing and using your berries quickly."

      "title": "Put the lychees into a plastic bag.",
      "content": "Put the lychees into a plastic bag. Place your lychees into a plastic bag or a container that you can leave open. Don't seal the fruit in an airtight container, since this can trap moisture and make your lychees mold quickly. [2] X Research source If you put your lychees into a plastic produce bag at the grocery store, it's fine to leave them in the same bag."

      "title": "Spritz the lychees with water every day to keep them moist.",
      "content": "Spritz the lychees with water every day to keep them moist. Lychees turn brown the longer they're stored, but you can keep them looking great by misting them with water once a day. If you don't mind the change in color, there's no need to spray them.

Just give them a light spritz to add a little moisture."

      "title": "Chill the lychees in the fridge for up to 1 week.",
      "content": "Chill the lychees in the fridge for up to 1 week. Lychees don't ripen over time, so eat them before they turn soft, mushy, or moldy. Discard lychees that smell bad instead of fragrant. If you can adjust the humidity in your produce drawer, set it at high humidity (between 90 and 98%). If you want to keep lychees at room temperature, keep in mind that they won't last as long so use them within 3 days."

      "title": "Spread lychees on a rimmed baking sheet.",
      "content": "Spread lychees on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour the fruit on the sheet so it's in a single layer. You don't need to peel the fruit before you freeze it, but if you'd like to save time later you can peel the lychees. Use a rimmed sheet so the fruit doesn't roll off the sheet while you transfer it to the freezer. There's no need to wash the fruit before you freeze it."

    {
      "title": "Freeze the lychees on the sheet for 2 hours.",
      "content": "Freeze the lychees on the sheet for 2 hours. Put the sheet into the freezer and chill the fruit until it's completely hard. It's important to freeze the berries individually so they don't clump together and make it difficult to thaw."

      "title": "Transfer the frozen lychees to an airtight freezer bag.",
      "content": "Transfer the frozen lychees to an airtight freezer bag. Once all of the lychees are frozen solid, put them into a freezer bag and squeeze as much of the air out as you can. Then, seal the bag shut and label it with the date. For example, write, \"3 pounds (1.4 kg) of lychees, 7/6/20.\""

      "content": "Freeze the lychees for up to 1 year. When you're ready to enjoy the lychees, take as many as you'd like out of the bag and put them into a bowl. Set the bowl in the fridge and leave the lychees to thaw until they're soft enough to peel.

This is a normal part of freezing and it won't change the fruit's taste."
