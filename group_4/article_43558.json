      "content": "Check the lights on the tester. Most testers will have 2 sets of 8 LED lights that correspond to the 8 pins on the transmitting and receiving end of the Ethernet cable. There will also be a G light for the ground. It will test each pin one at a time. If all 8 pins light up on both ends, the cable is good. If any of the lights do not light up on either end, this indicates a short in the cable. Don't worry if the G light doesn't light up. If the lights on either end flash out of order, this indicates that you are testing a crossover cable. As long as all 8 lights flash, the cable is good. [2] X Research source"
