      "content": "Check your finger for any bruising or swelling. Bruising and swelling will likely occur because you have broken tiny blood vessels in your finger. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you have fractured the fingertip, there will likely be purple blood visible underneath your nail and bruising on the pad of your finger. [3] X Research source You may also feel a sharp pain when you touch the finger. This is a symptom of a broken finger. Some people can still move their finger even if it’s broken and may experience numbness or a dull pain. These could still be signs of a fractured or broken finger and require immediate medical attention. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Watch out for numbness or tingling as well, since these can be symptoms of nerve damage caused by a broken bone."

      "content": "Check for loss of capillary refill by pressing gently on the area. Capillary refill is the return of blood to the finger after pressure has been applied. You can test this by pressing gently on the tissue near the injury to make it turn pale. If the normal color doesn’t return in a few seconds, then blood isn’t flowing to the area normally. [5] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you aren’t able to see a difference in your skin color when you press on it, try using your nail bed, instead. Gently press your fingernail, then watch how long it takes for it to turn pink again. Note that a loss of capillary refill may be caused by other injuries in addition to a broken bone in the finger.

      "content": "Examine your finger for any exposed cuts or bones. You may see large open wounds or pieces of bone that have broken your skin and are sticking out. These are signs of a severe type of fracture known as a compound fracture. If you have these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. [7] X Research source You should also get immediate medical care if there is a lot of blood coming from an open wound on your finger."

      "title": "Check if your finger looks deformed.",
      "content": "Check if your finger looks deformed. If part of your finger is pointing in a different direction, the bone is probably broken or dislocated. A dislocated finger occurs when the bone has moved out of position and usually looks deformed at a joint, such as your knuckle. [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You should see a doctor if you have a dislocated finger. There are 3 bones in each of your fingers and they are all arranged in the same manner. The first bone is the proximal phalanx, the second bone is the middle phalanx, and the bone farthest from your hand is the distal phalanx. Because your thumb is the shortest finger, it does not have a middle phalanx. Your knuckles are joints formed by the bones of your fingers. Often, you break your finger at the knuckles or the joints.

      "content": "Note if the pain and swelling goes down after a couple of hours. If your finger is not deformed or bruised and the pain and swelling eventually subside, you may have just sprained your finger. A sprain means you have stretched the ligaments, which are the bands of tissue that hold the bones in your finger together at the joint. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you think you have a sprained finger, avoid using the finger. Check to see if the pain and swelling gets better over the next day or two. If the pain and swelling does not go away, you should get medical treatment to confirm the finger is only sprained and not fractured or broken. A physical exam and X-rays will determine this."

      "content": "Apply ice to the finger. Wrap the ice in a towel and apply it to the finger on your way to the emergency room. This will reduce swelling and bruising. Never apply ice directly to your skin. [11] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you cannot get to the doctor right away, ice the finger for 15–20 minutes every 2 or 3 hours. Keep your finger elevated above your heart as you ice it. This allows gravity to help reduce the swelling and bleeding."

      "content": "Make a splint. A splint will keep your finger elevated and hold it in place. Alternatively, place a layer of gauze between your broken finger and the finger next to it, then loosely tape them together on your way to the hospital. [12] X Research source To make a temporary makeshift splint: Grab a thin item as long as your broken finger, such as a popsicle stick or a pen. Place it next to your broken finger or have a friend or family member help you hold it in place. Use medical tape to wrap the stick or pen and your finger together. Wrap it loosely—the tape should not squeeze or pinch your finger. If your finger is wrapped too tightly, this can cause additional swelling and cut off circulation to your injured digit.

In some cases, the surgeon may use small wires or plates and screws to keep the bone in place and allow it to heal properly. These pins will be removed later once your finger has healed."
