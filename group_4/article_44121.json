      "content": "Give him a playful smack. Another way to be flirtatious is to lightly hit the guy when you're talking. You can gently hit him on his upper arm if you're both standing up, or hit him on the knee if you're both sitting down. This is a move that says, \"Oh, stop it! But really, don't...\" Make sure you do this lightly and don't hit him too hard, or he'll be put off (and possibly hurt!). [11] X Research source When you're being playful like this, it's important that the guy is reciprocating. If you're playfully hitting him from time to time, he should return the gesture.

[14] X Research source This is a pretty bold move, so don’t overuse it, and find a good reason to do it. For example, if the guy just got a haircut, you can gently squeeze his hair to tease him.

Lean your body toward him to make this happen. If he reciprocates by moving closer, consider taking things further by placing a hand on his knee and squeezing. Zoo-wee mama!"

      "content": "Hold his hand. Once you've gotten more intimate, you can reach your hand over to grasp your fella's hand. You can hold hands while you're walking, or while you're sitting down and talking or watching a movie. If you're sitting across from each other, you can hold hands under the table or with your hands over the table. Give the guy's hand a gentle squeeze from time to time to keep the flirtatious mood going. You can hold the hand of a guy you’re not dating, but this is a pretty straightforward sign you like him, so be prepared for him to withdraw his hand if he doesn’t feel the same.

Just gently stroke his toes, run your fingers along the soles of his feet to tickle him slightly, and give him a light foot massage by running your hands along the joints in his toes in a circular fashion to make him go wild. If he's wearing sneakers and socks, it's probably in your best interest not to take them off to massage his feet—they may be a bit sweaty and smelly at that point.
