Many bed and breakfasts end up closing within two years, either because of a lack of business or the high costs of operating a B&B. Remember that as a B&B owner/operator, you will need to: take care of reservations charge billing accounts manage the business's finances entertain guests keep a clean house interact with local authorities as needed update licenses and permits make/serve breakfast to guests"

If you believe you have the business skills required to open a bed and breakfast, you should also assess your own abilities to operate a business that deals with serving and interacting with customers regularly. Not everyone has a personality or skill set that would work well for running a B&B, so it may be worth thinking honestly about whether or not you are able to. A good B&B owner/operator will need to: be self-motivated resolve tension be impeccably hospitable work long hours with frequent interruptions maintain enthusiasm in tedious situations be able to speak with a friendly and welcoming demeanor, even when you are having a conflict with a guest clean bathrooms and laundry that others have used plan and prepare meals, especially considering the prevalence of food allergies and specialized diets develop promotional materials like brochures, advertisements, and an up-to-date website write a working business plan perform accounting and bookkeeping work while sticking to a budget"

If you've decided you're ready to open a B&B and are ready to start making all the necessary preparations to start your own business, you'll need to perform an honest evaluation of your location and your facilities. Where you live and the condition and layout of your home could make or break your B&B venture. A successful bed and breakfast will need: to be in a community with a basic demand for bed and breakfast locations to be in an under-saturated market (i.e., not surrounded by existing B&Bs) a functional dining room, bedroom, and bathroom accessible to all guests a working kitchen that is big enough to cook for your maximum number of guests sufficient space for the maximum number of guests you'll have on a given day a bathroom space that can be kept extremely clean and well-ventilated a steady supply of toilet paper, tissues, and soap plenty of clean, brand-new linens"

      "content": "Decide on your target market. Every business has a target audience, and B&Bs are no exception. You can decide how you want to market your B&B, and you can advertise it as such on your website or through local lodging lists. You'll also want to customize your decorations/furnishings and amenities to best cater to your target guests. [2] X Research source There are five main types of guests to whom you should try to appeal (though remember, it will not be realistic to appeal to every single type of guest): [3] X Research source tourists - how many tourists you draw in will probably depend on where you are located. Consider offering free travel maps and brochures to nearby destinations, or find ways to have your B&B business listed as a nearby lodging on local destinations' websites. business travelers - again, this will depend on where you are located. If you are in or near a major metropolitan area, or at least close to a few bigger business offices, you may be able to capitalize on this niche. Consider marketing your B&B as being a close resort near major business destinations. romantic getaways - this type of guest will most likely be had in any location, though being near a traditionally romantic getaway (like out in the country or within driving distance to a romantic restaurant) may give you some advantage. Consider offering some type of romance package, including date night goodies like champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries, to couples staying at your B&B for a romantic weekend. college/university visitors - once again, this niche depends on where you live. If you're near one or more colleges/universities, or if you live in or near a popular college town, you may be able to capitalize on parents, college sports fans, and out-of-town visitors. However, this type of market will probably be seasonal, and may not be very stable. locals needing extra lodging - many people having weddings, graduation parties, and family reunions will look for lodging near the party. You can market your B&B to locals by advertising locally as a great place for out-of-town guests to lodge."

Laws vary drastically from one city, county, or state to another, and it can be difficult to ensure that your home qualifies for a planned B&B. Some states, like New York, have begun enforcing state-wide rules and regulations on what constitutes a hotel service. Many B&Bs have been deemed \"illegal hotels\" and were faced with exorbitant fines and fees.

A B&B inn may host up to nine guest rooms, and must be licensed and inspected as a hotel and a food service establishment.

At the very least you will most likely need new beds, bedding, pillows, towels, and other fixtures for the rooms you intend to rent. Even small, low-cost renovations/conversions will require a sizable startup fund. Some experts recommend budgeting $20,000 to $40,000 per guest room for a small property, though conversions/renovations and redecorating may cost up to $50,000 per room in a larger or more dilapidated property.

Get a written estimate from multiple contractors before you choose which one you'll hire. Keep that contractor's written estimate in case any major deviations take place during the project. Get a written contract with estimated start and completion dates. Do not pay cash. Use a check or credit/debit card so you can have a record of your payments and the dates they were made.

Try putting out a decorative vase full of fresh local flowers, hang plants in the windows, and decorate the rooms with a variety of books and general interest magazines. You should also put an alarm clock in each room (just be sure the last guest didn't accidentally set the alarm to go off on a day that a new guest will be there), and consider offering a complementary wakeup service. Depending on your target demographic, you may want to offer a computer or wifi access to guests, and a printer or fax machine (especially if you will be hosting a lot of traveling business men and women)."

However, a room loaded with photographs of your family will also make it difficult for guests to feel like the room is their own. Err on the side of caution and choose tasteful, non-personalized decorations that would feel warm and welcoming in any home. If you live in a rural area and you're appealing to autumn foliage viewers, try decorating your lodging with local wilderness photography. You may also want to adapt your location into your B&B's motif - like hanging birch bark-patterned wallpaper, for example, or mounting deer antlers over the fireplace."

However, depending on the size of the B&B, the number of customers, or the health condition of you or your family, you may need to hire additional workers. At the very least you'll want to hire an attorney and an accountant to help with your finances. You should also think about the tasks that need to be performed on a daily basis: laundry, cleaning, meal preparation, checking people in/out of their rooms, and restocking guest rooms after they're vacated.

A simple continental breakfast should include (at minimum): coffee, juice, milk, bagels or muffins, fruit, and yogurt or cereal. A more gourmet meal, like omelets, tofu scrambles, or a quiche, is always a highly-marketable option. However, keep in mind as you plan your meals that some guests have food allergies and other dietary restrictions.

Marketing your business takes a lot of time and effort, but ultimately is necessary for the success of your bed and breakfast. Know your target audience and market your B&B to those guests. Understand the needs and wants of your guests. Tailor your advertisements to show how you meet those demands. Put up flyers, a press release, and an ad in the phonebook. Send out an e-newsletter and send direct mail to previous guests. Be sure to advertise your business online, though you should still advertise in print as well. Create a social media page for your B&B so that visitors can leave reviews or share your business's information with their friends. Make a rustic-looking sign with your B&B's name and address. Put the sign up at the end of your driveway or near your house to let guests know they've found the B&B they were looking for."
