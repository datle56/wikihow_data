      "content": "He’ll know you’re into him if you interact with him on social media. Look through what he’s shared in the past couple of weeks and like a couple of the posts. If you want to start a conversation with him, leave a comment asking for more details about the post. By showing him you’re genuinely curious about what he’s doing, he’ll be more likely to open up to you. If he posts a selfie of himself, say, “Looking great! What are you all dressed up for?” If he shares a post about a project he just finished, try, “Wow, this is incredible! How long did it take you to make this?” If he posts a link to a funny video, say, “LOL this was hilarious! How do you find stuff like this?” Like a variety of his posts instead of only interacting with attractive pics of him. He’ll like that you care about more than just his looks."

If you don’t want everyone else to see what you’re saying to the guy you like, send him a private message on social media or on a dating app. Say more than “hi” or “hey” so he has something to respond to. You could ask how he is or mention something he posted recently. “Hi there! How’s your day going so far?” “Hi hi! I’m not sure if we’ve met IRL, but your posts are so inspiring! They make me smile every day 😊.” “Hey! I didn’t want to embarrass you in the comments, but you looked amazing in that pic 😉.”"

Scan through your crush’s social media or dating profile to learn more about what he likes so you have a good jumping-off point for your conversation — looking for common ground is great way to really build familiarity with the guy, because it creates a semblance of safety, and people are typically more willing to open up to someone if they feel as if they share common passions, viewpoints, and other views. You can also ask about how his day was, what his hobbies are, or what his favorite memories are. Stick to open-ended questions that need a longer, more thoughtful answer so you get him talking more.
