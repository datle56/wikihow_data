      "title": "Wait a while.",
      "content": "Wait a while. If you just broke up, it's not a good idea to get back together with someone, or tell him that you still have feelings for him. Break-ups take a while to sink in. If you just got dumped yesterday, you'll obviously still have feelings for him. But it's not time to let him know that right now. Wait a while, process what's happened, and then get back in touch in the future if you still feel the same way. There's always a chance. [1] X Research source There's no set time to wait until you get back in touch with an ex, but you need at least enough time to process the break-up. You have to feel like your relationship is actually over. Give it a few weeks at least, and a few months for longer relationships. Try seeing other people for a while. Explore different relationships to learn more about yourself. If it doesn't work out, at least you'll know."

      "title": "Reflect on the problems your relationship faced.",
      "content": "Reflect on the problems your relationship faced. If, after you've waited, you still have feelings for your ex, you need to do some soul-searching. Why did you break up in the first place? What problems were there in the relationship? If you've only been focusing on what you miss about your ex, you may be forgetting about all the problems you had. Now is the time to focus on those problems. [2] X Research source Are the same problems likely to come back up? Were the problems your fault, or his? Have you changed in such a way as to accept his problems, or fixed the problems that you caused? If the same things will happen again, it's not a good idea to get back together. [3] X Expert Source Michelle Jacoby Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 7 September 2021. If your relationship faced big problems, like infidelity or other serious issues, it may be very difficult to get back together at all. Are you willing to forgive him for the major things that he did wrong? Will he be able to forgive you? How can you earn trust back?"

      "title": "Make little changes now to show that you're different.",
      "content": "Make little changes now to show that you're different. You want to give your ex the impression that you're a happy, healthy, sexy, attractive person that he should want to get back with. To do this, start fixing little things about yourself that you'd like to change, now, so you can win him back. If you had jealousy issues, or partied too much, try to get those things under control. Seek out counseling if necessary, so you can prove to him that you're serious when you say you'll change. \"Because I'm sad\" or \"Because I miss you so much\" are not good reasons to get back together with someone. That's not why you got together in the first place. You want to present yourself in the best possible light."

      "title": "Think about what you want.",
      "content": "Think about what you want. Design your ideal partner. Does your ex fit the bill? Sometimes, we can get stuck in the past a little too much and it can be hard to see what we actually want. Make sure you're not jumping backward and getting into something that's best left dead. Do you actually want to get back together? If you still have feelings, but don't think it'll work out, it's probably just going to complicate the break-up to tell him. Keep it to yourself."

      "title": "Find out what he's up to.",
      "content": "Find out what he's up to. If your ex is single, then it's perfectly fine to get in touch and let him know that you still have feelings for him and might want to get back together, as long as that's what you want. If he's seeing someone, you need to wait. It's unfair to his new relationship to interfere and get in the way. Try seeing other people and wait until he's single to talk to him again, if you need to. In some cases, you may feel you have to let him know that you're still in love with him, even if he's seeing someone. If so, just try to think about how you'd feel if someone pulled that with your boyfriend. You've been warned."

      "content": "Reach out. If you want to talk to him, send him a little message via text, or e-mail to let him know that you're still having thoughts and want to talk to him in person. Just shoot him a short message that says, \"Hey, I've been thinking about you a lot lately. Can we talk sometime soon?\" In some cases, it can be really helpful to try to write out your feelings in a letter. If this is the case, do it, but think twice before you mail it. It might be better to have the talk in person, so you can remember what he's like to be around actually. Don't try to get back together online. This isn't an appropriate conversation to have via Facebook messenger. Have it in person, or on the phone at least."

      "content": "Meet somewhere in public. When you arrange to meet, it's important to meet somewhere neutral. If you used to live together, don't try to meet back at your old place, where you'll have lots of old memories. It's important to think about the future objectively, so you don't make a bad decision based on your feelings. Try a public park, somewhere you can be quiet and have a private conversation, but not somewhere that you'll have a lot of history. Don't try to have this conversation through text or over the phoneâ€”it's definitely the kind of thing you should talk about in person.

Tell him that you've reflected on your relationship and you think it can work out better, if you get back together, if that's the way you feel. Talk specifically about the challenges you faced in the past and figure out whether or not you'll be able to get past them together. [6] X Research source Just cut to the chase. You don't need to spend a lot of time catching up or trying to make him think you're doing really great. Just tell him the truth. You're missing him, you think you can make it work, and you're a better person now."

      "content": "Apologize, if necessary. If your relationship ended mutually, you probably don't need to apologize for anything. But if you cheated on your ex, or you did something else that resulted in him ending the relationship, it's important to apologize clearly and definitively. [7] X Research source Be specific when you say you're sorry. Don't just say, \"I'm so sorry.\" Try to prove to him that you understand why he would be upset and you're able to see the results of your actions. Even if you think he did some things wrong that he should apologize for, it's important to keep your ego out of it. Just come right out and apologize. Worry about sorting out the issues later. You want to get your apology out of the way now."

It's important to listen to what he has to say and try to understand. Even if you don't like what you hear, try to understand where he's coming from. If you just get angry and start another fight, it's unlikely this will go anywhere. If he says he's still got feelings for you too, talk about what went wrong in your relationship. Try to focus on the problems you had and sort out whether or not you'll be able to make it work again in the future. [8] X Research source If he says he's totally over you and doesn't feel the same way, just say, \"I was hoping you'd feel differently, but I'm glad I let you know. I needed you to know.

But try to start things slow, as if you were starting with a new boyfriend. Don't just jump right back into living together and seeing each other 24/7, unless you're both really comfortable and want to. If you're still a little nervous about the problems you used to have, take it slow. Just start with easy dates. Go out for coffee, or see a movie together. No big plans and elaborate stuff. Don't make it \"Facebook official\" yet, until you've spend plenty of time together and worked out your stuff. You might even consider not telling your friends until you've given it a while to make it work. It can be embarrassing to think that you've worked it out, only to break up a week later because of old problems."
