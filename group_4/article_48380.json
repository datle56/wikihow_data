      "content": "Let yourself feel your emotions, but don’t wallow in them. It’s normal to feel sad after a relationship. Let yourself do whatever you need to do to get your emotions out, whether that’s crying, screaming into a pillow, or journaling to feel better. But, avoid sitting with your emotions for too long. When you start to notice yourself wallowing in bed for days or weeks after the breakup, make an effort to get up and do something to fill your time. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Focus on your health and well-being. Clinical psychologist Lena Dicken says that focusing on your health after a breakup is a great way to recover. Get exercise and eat well, as opposed to what might feel more natural, like crawling in bed and eating ice cream. You can do that for a bit, but don’t stay there. Focusing on your health and being kind to yourself can help you feel better about yourself post-breakup."

      "content": "Spend more time with your friends and family. When you’re in a relationship, your partner tends to take up the majority of your time, leaving less opportunity to see friends and family. When you break up, though, friends and family are great people to surround yourself with. Not only will you be able to reconnect with them, but they can also provide support and help you process your feelings during this tumultuous time of your life. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Prioritize your hobbies and personal interests. Check out that movie you’ve always wanted to see or visit that museum you’ve been interested in. Indulge in your hobbies and personal interests, too, as they can help fill your time and keep you joyful after the breakup. If you want to find a meaningful hobby , life coach Desiree Panlilio says to ask yourself what you’re interested in, then try it without committing to it to see if it’s something you enjoy. Exercising and playing sports can help keep your mind off of your ex."

      "content": "Take some time apart from each other. Even though it may feel like you absolutely need to see your former partner, whether it be to get closure, maintain a friendship, or try for a second chance, it’s best to take time away from each other so you don’t end up offering emotional support to them and extending your grieving period. You may want to consider going no contact and dedicating a specific period of time to not talking to them. [3] X Research source Relationship coach Amy Chan says it typically takes about six months to two years to recover from the pain of a broken heart. People who have anxious attachment styles often take breakups harder than those with secure or avoidant attachment styles. Psychotherapist Kelli Miller says that if you’re in the same circle as your former partner and consistently seeing them, it can prolong the grieving process."

      "content": "Figure out who will move out if you live together. If you’re on a lease together, discuss if one or both of you will move out. Set a firm move-out date so there's no confusion as to how long each of you will stay in your shared space. You’ll have a specific timeline of when to move out, which can make the breakup easier. [4] X Research source If you are unable to move out, consider dividing the space between you and your former partner as one of you searches for more permanent living solutions. Dedicate specific hours of use to certain people or just split the space down the middle. Make sure everyone has access to essential spaces, like the kitchen, bathroom, and a place to sleep.

      "content": "Set ground rules. Holistic love coach Kate Dreyfus says to honor the reasons why you chose to end your relationship, as it helps build self-trust. Have a conversation with your ex about creating boundaries and setting ground rules to respect each other’s space and time for closure. When you don’t honor your choices and boundaries, you can break the trust you have for yourself. If you’re struggling to honor your choice to end the relationship, Dreyfus says to explore why. You may learn that you need further healing or that your ex meant more to you than you realized."

      "content": "Decide how you two will interact moving forward. If you’re unable to avoid your ex, discuss how you two will interact now that you’re no longer together, whether that means taking different routes to class or only seeing each other when you have to. In the case that your ex isn’t receptive, avoid engaging with them and keep any interactions that involve them as professional as possible. [6] X Research source For example, if you’re forced to work with your ex on a class project, only talk to them about the project. Avoid bringing up your relationship or talking about each other’s personal lives."

      "content": "Respect each other’s boundaries. You may be tempted to check up on your ex or ask your mutual friends about how they’re doing, but your ex also needs time to process and grieve the relationship. Avoid texting, calling, or trying to find out what’s going on in their lives, and ask that they do the same. Life coach Maggie Mitchell says you may feel a bit of discomfort when setting boundaries, but that’s normal. Say “Right now, I need time to recover from this breakup. I would appreciate it if we didn’t contact each other for the next month.” [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Limit social media contact with your ex as much as possible. When it comes to using social media after a breakup, it’s best to avoid stalking your ex or visiting their profile. Miller says to limit as much social media contact with your ex as possible. Unfollow them and remove them from your followers. You may also want to mute them from your feed so you are unable to interact with them. Avoid talking about the breakup on social media. Instead, reach out to a trusted friend or loved one to help process your emotions. Even though you may still be hurt over how the relationship ended, avoid making any overt or subliminal posts aimed at your ex."

      "content": "Let yourself go through the grieving process. Healing from a breakup takes time, especially if you and your ex were together for a while. So feel all of your feelings as you go through the grieving process rather than trying to rush through them. Rushing yourself to feel better and recover can cause you to suppress how you really feel or avoid processing your feelings surrounding the breakup entirely.

Sharing, remembering, and honoring individuals through rituals, small meditations, and being patient with your pain can help you move forward."

      "content": "Express your emotions. Chan says “People who avoid grief and make an effort to suppress emotion take the longest to recover from loss. When you try to repress your anger and emotions, stress skyrockets. The opposite of suppression is expression. You need to process the emotional energy that is stuck in the body. The way to move forward, is through. Practice the Three R’s to help process the emotions after a breakup: Recognize: Create awareness of your emotions and feel them in the body. Close your eyes and try to recognize any sensations in the body, like pressure, pain, and tightness. Respond: Determine the emotions you’re connecting with and what they need to be expressed. You may need to cry, scream, shake, or dance. Reflect: Write about how you feel and where you feel it to gain perspective on your emotions. Ask yourself what your greatest points of grief and frustration are, what your body’s telling you, and what you can learn.”"

      "content": "Reflect on what worked and didn’t work in the relationship. Licensed marriage and family therapist Lia Huynh says to reflect by looking back and asking what you were proud of. Ask yourself what you could have done differently. Consider what drained your energy and what your future self would say to the current you. Reflect on your relationship and use your past feelings and experiences to inform how you would like to be treated in future relationships. Ask yourself if there’s anything you’d like to do differently in a future relationship. Did you do anything you’re not proud of? How do you want to show up in future relationships? Dreyfus says when deciding what’s important to you in a romantic partner, ask yourself questions like “What do you like best about them?,” “Do you have similar core values?,” and “Can you be yourself around them?”"

      "content": "Avoid taking your frustrations out on your former partner. You may be upset with the way things ended, but don’t take your frustrations out on your ex. Avoid trying to guilt trip them by saying things like “You broke my heart” or “I’ll never love again,” don’t try to manipulate them into coming back to the relationship, and don’t try to sabotage their future romantic endeavors. [9] X Research source Chan says, “Feeling sad and missing your ex after a breakup is natural. The same flood of chemicals that cause you to be blissfully in lust during the beginning stages of love are the exact same chemicals that cause you to painfully suffer when it ends.” The brain is literally in withdrawal, which can cause you to want to return to your ex. But with time these feelings will subside."

You don’t have to necessarily get rid of things that remind you of the relationship, especially if they were gifts, but it may be helpful to get them out of your sight so that you can properly grieve. Consider putting shared stuffed animals, photos, love notes, and other shared romantic memorabilia into a box and storing it somewhere you can’t see.
