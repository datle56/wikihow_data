      "content": "Futhark (Runes) The Futhark is an alphabet of runic letters that hold many meanings. Each rune has its own name and symbolism, but when combined, they form even more powerful meanings. In modern times, the Futhark runes can be included in meditation and divination rituals, but you can also use to determine your astrological fate. [1] X Research source The Futhark is divided into two categories: the Elder and the Younger. The Elder Futhark predates the Viking Age (793-1066 AD) and features 24 runic letters. The Younger Futhark was likely created at the beginning of the Viking Age as a simpler alternative to the older alphabet. It has only 16 runes, bringing the total number of known Viking runes to 40. [2] X Research source Many people tattoo their astrological Viking runes on their bodies or find runes that represent special meanings to them. For example, one might tattoo the Hagalaz rune, which symbolizes change, transformation, and destruction, or the Mannaz rune to represent humanity, society, and interconnectedness."
