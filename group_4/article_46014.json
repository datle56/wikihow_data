      "content": "Be aware of the risks of ear candling. Alternative medicine practitioners are strong advocates for the benefits of ear candling, but many medical doctors believe that candling is ineffective and dangerous. Being aware of the risks and concerns about ear candling can help you make an informed decision if it is the best way for you to remove your earwax. [2] X Research source Studies by otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors) have shown that ear candling can cause burns, blockages in the ear canal, ear infections, and ear drum perforations even if you use the candle according to the packaging. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Most medical doctors believe ear candling is ineffective for removing wax."

      "title": "Size the tapered, or small, end of the candle to your ear.",
      "content": "Size the tapered, or small, end of the candle to your ear. The candle should be fitted to the size and contours of your ear. This can help ensure the most safe and effective candling process. If the procedure isn’t performed by an experienced practitioner with the appropriate tools, it can cause damage to your eardrum. Even when performed properly, it’s possible to cause trauma to your ear canal. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use the scissors to trim the end, making the opening slightly larger so it fills the ear canal. Make sure the opening is passable. There should be a clear pathway from one end of the candle to the other. If necessary, use a sharp, pointy object to remove any obstruction from the candle’s smaller end."

      "title": "Wash your hands and your ear.",
      "content": "Wash your hands and your ear. Before you begin candling your ear, wash your hands and wipe off your ear. This can help minimize the risk of spreading bacteria that may cause an infection. Use a soft soap that is antibacterial and antimicrobial. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Wash your hands with a simple and basic soap or use a soft soap that is antimicrobial and antibacterial. Wipe off your ear with a moist cloth."

      "title": "Cover your head with a damp towel.",
      "content": "Cover your head with a damp towel. Moisten a large towel with some water and cover your head and upper torso area. This can help prevent a flame or any ashes from burning you during the candling process. Make sure to cover your head, hair, shoulders, and upper torso."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sit upright for the candling process.",
      "content": "Sit upright for the candling process. It will be easier and safer for you to sit upright during the ear-candling process. This can help ensure that falling ashes don’t contact or burn you. Be careful; if you do not do this correctly, you could burn yourself. Physicians do not recommend using ear candles because of this risk."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rub the area behind your ear.",
      "content": "Rub the area behind your ear. Before you begin the candling procedure, massage the area around and behind your ear. This can help relax you and stimulate circulation in your ear area. Massage the area behind your jawbone, around your temple, and your scalp. Rub for at least 30 seconds to open up the area around your ear."

      "title": "Put a paper plate or pie tin over your ear.",
      "content": "Put a paper plate or pie tin over your ear. Cut a small hole in either a paper plate or pie tin and place it over your ear. This can help ensure that you don’t get burned with the flame or falling ashes. Use any type of paper plate or pie tin, which are found at most grocery stores. Make sure the hole corresponds to the size of the end of the ear candle. Fit the candle into this hole and hold it up over the ear being cleaned."

      "title": "Position the tapered end of the candle in your ear canal.",
      "content": "Position the tapered end of the candle in your ear canal. Place the small end of the candle in the paper plate or pie tin and then position the tip of the candle in your ear canal. The plate can help prevent hot wax from dripping onto your outer ear, causing harmful burns. This can help ensure a safer and more effective candling procedure, but there’s still a chance of burning your inner ear so proceed with extreme caution. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Keep the candle in a vertically upright position. When sitting upright, the candle should be at an approximately 30-degree angle."

    {
      "title": "Light the large end of the candle.",
      "content": "Light the large end of the candle. Have your assistant light the large end of the candle with a lighter or match. This will start the candling process and can help ensure that you safely light the candle without burning yourself. You will know if the candle is properly in place if no smoke escapes from between your ear and the small end of the candle. If you do not have a secure fit, readjust your position or the candle. It is important to get a secure fitting. If this takes a while, try again using a new candle."

      "title": "Burn the candle for approximately fifteen minutes.",
      "content": "Burn the candle for approximately fifteen minutes. It should take about 15 minutes for the candle to burn down to the desired length for the most effective ear-candling session. Be careful to keep the candle from burning too short to help minimize the risk of burning your scalp or depositing candle wax in your ear canal, which are recognized complications of ear candling.

      "title": "Allow the candle burn to within 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of the end.",
      "content": "Allow the candle burn to within 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) of the end. After the candle has burned down so there is only about 3 inches (7.6 cm) remaining, ask your assistant to extinguish it in the bowl of water. This can help minimize your risk of getting burned by the candle. If the burn takes a while, have your assistant check the small end's opening after a few minutes to make sure it is not obstructed. If necessary, use a toothpick to swiftly clear the opening and reinsert the candle in the ear."

      "content": "Observe debris on the candle stub. Once you’ve removed the candle stub from your ear canal, there may be a mixture of wax and debris on the stub. Some alternative health practitioners believe this is earwax and bacteria. Examining it may help you assess if you removed enough wax or need to repeat the candling procedure. However, studies have found no evidence that ear candles are effective at drawing out earwax. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you put the candle into water immediately, no wax may be visible. It’s also possible that some of the wax from the candle was deposited in your ear canal.

      "title": "Apply over-the-counter eardrops to remove wax.",
      "content": "Apply over-the-counter eardrops to remove wax. For those people with minimal to moderate amounts of earwax, use an over-the-counter wax removal preparation. This can help clear any impacted wax. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Most over-the-counter drops are mineral oil and peroxide solutions. The hydrogen peroxide will not dissolve your wax, but help it move through the ear canal. When using hydrogen peroxide, lie on your bed with your head to its side and a towel placed under your head. Pour (or use a rubber bulb) a small amount of H2O2 into the ear. The ear will start to feel warm and you will begin to hear a bubbling sound. This is normal. Roll your ear over onto the towel to let the peroxide drain out. Repeat on other side. If you have any ear discharge consult a doctor immediately. Board Certified Otolaryngologist Dr. Payam Daneshrad cautions, “We try to avoid using peroxide because it can damage the skin of the ear canal…Wax softeners like over-the-counter medications work better. They do have some peroxide in them, but there's a much lower strength than anything a patient can find on their own.” Make sure to follow the package instructions for using the products to help ensure you don’t cause further problems. If you suspect you have an eardrum perforation, do not use an over-the-counter preparation. The symptoms of a perforated eardrum include bloody or pus-filled discharge from your ear, hearing loss, or a ringing sound in your ear. [17] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source You can purchase over-the-counter earwax removal drops at most pharmacies and some large retailers. Cerumenolytics (peroxide & mineral oil) can lead to complications, including allergic reactions, otitis externa, transient hearing loss, and dizziness."

      "title": "Try oil or glycerin drops to soften the wax.",
      "content": "Try oil or glycerin drops to soften the wax. In addition to over-the-counter wax treatments, use simple household oils or glycerin drops to relieve wax plugs. These treatments soften earwax, making it easier to clear out of your ear canal. [18] X Research source Try baby or mineral oils as a treatment. Place one drop of baby or mineral oil in each ear and let it sit for a few minutes before allowing it to drain out. Olive oil is another option that can help remove earwax, but better treatment options exist. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There are no studies about how often it's helpful to use oil or glycerin drops, but no more than a few times a week should be fine."

      "title": "Irrigate your ears to remove wax plugs.",
      "content": "Irrigate your ears to remove wax plugs. Irrigating, sometimes called “syringing,” is one of the most common methods of removing wax plugs from the ears. Try washing your ear by irrigation along with drops or oil if you have large amounts or stubborn earwax. [20] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You’ll need a medical syringe to use this method, which most pharmacies carry. Fill the syringe with body-temperature water. Using cooler or warmer water may cause dizziness or vertigo. Hold your head upright and gently pull the outside of your ear upward to straighten your ear canal. Inject a small stream of water into your ear canal by where the wax plug is located. Tilt your head to drain the water. If necessary, perform an irrigation several times to clear away the impaction. One study showed that injecting a small amount of water or oil into your ear before irrigation may help remove the wax more quickly. Never use a water jet device designed for teeth to irrigate your ears!"

Avoid cleaning your ears too often or using instruments such as cotton swabs to help keep a healthy amount of wax in your ears. [23] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Only clean your ears as often as you feel they require it. If you notice you need to clean your ears daily or have excess discharge, see your doctor. Using instruments such as cotton swabs or hair pins can force wax into your ear instead of removing it and may cause infection or other problems. Using instruments can also perforate your ear drum and lead to infection or hearing loss."
