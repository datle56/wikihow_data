This showcases the shape of your body and can help to make your outfit more flattering. Wear the bag with any outfit that is a little more loose fitting than you want. For example, wear a red cross-body bag over an over-sized leather jacket for a fitted, grunge look. A cross-body bag with a dress can give you a more boho look.
