      "content": "Understand arguments in favor of using electronic collars. Advocates for the use of electronic collars state that the collars give a small electrical shock, similar to a shock from static build-up, that does not hurt the dog. They also argue that these collars can actually give dogs quite a bit of freedom, as you will have a way to control your dog when it is off leash. There is some debate among those that use electronic collars about what the collars should be used for. Some argue that the collars should only be used on dogs that have severe behavior problems, for instance, to change behavior that could get a dog put down. There are others that use the collars for correcting behavior, such as if a dog gets into a garden bed the owner will turn on the collar to teach the dog that this behavior is bad. There are others still that use the collar to signal a dog to do positive behaviors, such as sitting, staying, or lying down."

      "content": "Understand arguments against using electronic collars. Those opposed to the use of these collars state that there is a great chance of misuse and abuse when using a shock collar. In addition, opponents argue that other training systems, such as simple positive reinforcement of behavior, can be just as effective. While positive reinforcement makes the training about the dog's choice of behavior, positive punishment with a shock collar forces a dog to choose between pain and behavior."

Make the decision for yourself whether you think an electronic collar will help your dog learn what they shouldn't do. If you do decide to use it, make sure to follow the manufactures instructions and use the collar properly, not as punishment but to reinforce behavior. If you plan on using an electric collar, hire a professional trainer to help you out. [1] X Expert Source Dominik Feichtner Dog Trainer & Behaviorist Expert Interview. 18 March 2021"

      "content": "Put the batteries in the collar and in the transmitter. Make sure both function before you put them on your dog. Also, make sure that the system is turned off and set to the lowest setting before attaching it to a dog. This will assure that you don't shock the dog on accident."

      "content": "Attach the collar to your dog's neck. Some collars have small prongs that need to touch the skin of the dog, but you don't want them to cause discomfort. Make sure that the collar is tight enough that it won't fall off and that the prongs touch the dog's neck, but don't make it so tight that it is uncomfortable for the dog or restricts its breathing."

This way, the dog will associate the collar with good times and fun, instead of punishment. The goal behind using an electronic collar is to make the dog think that the negative behavior you are trying to stop is causing the shock, not the collar. If you put the collar on the dog and immediately start shocking it, the dog may quickly figure out that the problem is with the collar. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Begin using your electronic remote training collar. Start at the lowest level of stimulation and observe your dog when you activate it. The dog's ear might twitch or it may move its head as if trying to get away from the collar. If your dog doesn't respond at the lowest stimulation, slowly turn the transmitter to the next level and try again."

      "title": "Reinforce commands your dog understands.",
      "content": "Reinforce commands your dog understands. When you train your dog with an electronic collar, begin with commands the dog is familiar with. Say the command, such as sit or stay, and wait for your dog to respond. If your dog is not paying attention, press the button on your transmitter and repeat the command. Set the transmitter to the lowest level of stimulation your dog reacts to. When you use an electronic collar, you want to train your dog, not hurt him. Praise your dog as soon as it responds. Reward it with a pat, by saying \"good dog,\" or with a special treat. When you train dogs, you want to reinforce their good behavior with a reward."

      "title": "Control bad behavior.",
      "content": "Control bad behavior. You may use an electronic collar to manage annoying or aggressive behavior. For instance, if your dog digs holes in the backyard whenever you let him outside, be ready to use an electronic collar to train him when you let him out. When the dog begins to dig, or engage in whatever behavior you want to control, activate the transmitter. Do not hold the button down for more than 3 seconds and do not punch it repeatedly. The object is to train your dog, not injure him. Don't let your dog see you. You don't want your dog to know you are causing the unpleasant sensation around its neck when it starts digging. Rather, you want your dog to associate the sensation with bad behavior."
