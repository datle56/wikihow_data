      "content": "Fold the diaper properly. Before you put on your own diaper, make sure to fold it properly. Fold the diaper length-ways with the back sheet facing outwards; you don't want a hard crease, just a soft fold. Make sure you do not touch the inside of the diaper. You do not want to contaminate it. This folding step is just designed to avoid contaminating the diaper as you put it on. If you're using cloth diapers, there is also folding involved in actually preparing the diaper for wearing. For more information about folding cloth diapers, check out How to Fold a Cloth Diaper ."

      "title": "Tape up the diaper.",
      "content": "Tape up the diaper. Once you have the diaper in a comfortable position, use the adhesive tape provided to secure it in place. Most brands of adult diapers come with four pieces of tape: two on the bottom sides and two on the top. It may be helpful to angle the tape slightly upwards as this improves how the diaper fits around the legs."

      "content": "Adjust the edges for your comfort. Once the diaper is on, make any necessary adjustments for your own comfort. The edges of the brief should ease into the groin to avoid chafing or rashes. You may have to fold the edges over slightly so the sides are not as sharp."

      "content": "Find the right products. If you want to wear diapers subtly, take some time and care selecting products. It is worth doing research into what might work best for you--there are various products available that will help you feel physically comfortable, ranging from briefs, pads, to specialty incontinence underwear. Many brands of adult diapers are fairly easy to wear without others noticing. Choose a product you can easily fit in a bag and briefcase. Less bulky diapers tend to be easier to conceal as they can be folded. You can use a winter hat to bring a fresh brief to bathroom to change a mess. However, be careful when folding a diaper as you do not want to cause any damage to the product. [1] X Research source Make sure you select a product that's strong enough for you, however. If you're nervous about choosing a product, talk to your doctor and ask for a recommendation. He or she should be able to recommend a good brand for you based on your medical history.
