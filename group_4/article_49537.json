      "content": "Make a consumer complaint. Some examples of circumstances that would justify writing a letter include billing issues, warranties, health care complaints, privacy violations, contracts, consumer complaints, and illegal wage practices. If you have gone through the initial process of contacting the organization responsible for the unfair practice and have not received satisfactory results, then the next step may be to write a letter to the Attorney General. These complaints should be written to your state Attorney General, rather than the U.S. Attorney General. The Attorney General will most likely get involved if it is question of wide public concern. But, in writing a letter you might provide new evidence to a case the Attorney General is already building or inform him of an emerging problem."

      "content": "Register a protest. If you are upset with federal or state legal policy, you can send a letter of protest.

For letters to the Attorney General, the issue should deal with the execution of the law, not the law itself. So, if you believe that the government should be prosecuting someone but is not, the Attorney General is the person you should write. To determine if you should write to the state or US Attorney General use a resource like the Legal Information Institute to determine if there is a state or federal law regarding your subject of interest.
