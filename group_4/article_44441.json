      "content": "Visit the doctor if you experience symptoms of bile acid malabsorption. The main symptom of BAM is severe diarrhea. Your stool may look pale, discolored, and oily. You’ll feel the urge to use the bathroom constantly, and may limit how often you leave your home to avoid being too far from a toilet. Make an appointment with your doctor to have an exam and check for BAM. [1] X Research source Other BAM symptoms are abdominal cramps, headache, and constant, foul-smelling gas. During a BAM flareup, you may have diarrhea very soon after eating. BAM is common among people who have Crohn’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome. If you have either of these conditions, your risk of BAM is higher."

      "content": "Complete a test to confirm that you have BAM. If you visit your doctor and they suspect you may have BAM, they may run a series of tests to diagnose you with the condition. These tests don’t produce immediate results, and it may take a week or more to get a diagnosis. Work with the doctor and be patient while they assess the test results. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The SeHCAT test administers a dose of natural bile orally and measures how much is left after 7 days. If retention is low, then you probably have BAM. This test is not used in the U.S. The Serum 7αC4 test is a blood test that measures the amount of bile in your system. This is a common surrogate for the SeHCAT test. A 48-hour stool sample is another common test for BAM. Doctors will analyze the sample to determine if you’re excreting too much bile in your stool."

      "content": "Take bile acid sequestrants to decrease the circulation of bile. Sequestrants are the most common medical treatment for BAM. They come in powder or tablet form, depending on the type your doctor prescribes. The course is usually 10-14 days. Take the medication exactly as your doctor instructs you to and don’t stop taking it before the course is complete. [3] X Research source The most common sequestrant for BAM is cholestyramine. The doctor may prescribe this drug, or another of the same type. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you don’t like the taste of powder-form medication, you can mix it with a smoothie to mask the flavor and texture. In some cases, the doctor may prescribe a sequestrant if they can’t diagnose BAM with certainty. If symptoms improve, then they treat that as an indirect confirmation of BAM."

      "title": "Consume less than 40 grams of fat per day.",
      "content": "Consume less than 40 grams of fat per day. A low-fat diet is the best dietary treatment for BAM, because fat stimulates bile production. Keep track of your fat intake and limit it to 40 grams per day to prevent flareups. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Items to cut out are fried foods, red meat, desserts, butter and margarine, and processed foods.

      "title": "Increase your intake of vitamin B12 to prevent a deficiency.",
      "content": "Increase your intake of vitamin B12 to prevent a deficiency. BAM prevents this vitamin from being absorbed in your lower intestine, so sufferers sometimes have a deficiency. Prevent this by including a mix of vitamin-rich foods and supplements to replace lost nutrients during a flareup. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Foods highest in vitamin B12 are shellfish and fish. Beef and milk also have a good amount. [9] X Research source If you don’t get enough B12 from your diet, you can also take a supplement to replace the vitamin. Consult your doctor before starting on dietary supplements to confirm that they won't interact with any medications you're on. If you’re taking a bile acid sequestrant, your body may have trouble processing fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K. Talk to your doctor about using a multi-vitamin and vitamin D replacement supplement while on these medications."
