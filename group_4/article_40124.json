      "content": "Magic squares have rows, columns, and diagonals that total the same sum. Each number in a magic square fits into a cell on a grid. The number of rows or columns determines the order , so an “order 3” magic square is one with a 3 x 3 grid. When you add up the numbers in a column, the value is called the “magic constant,” and all the other columns, rows, and diagonals will add up to that number. [1] X Research source A normal magic square has consecutive numbers from 1 to n 2 {\\displaystyle n^{2}} (where n equals the order). A normal order 3 magic square with a magic constant of 15 would be: 8 – 1 – 6 3 – 5 – 7 4 – 9 – 2 On a non-normal magic square, the lowest number may be higher than 1. A non-normal order 4 magic square with a magic constant of 87 could be: 21 – 24 – 28 – 14 27 – 15 – 20 – 25 16 – 30 – 22 – 19 23 – 18 – 17 – 29"

      "content": "Calculate the magic constant. To find the magic constant (S) for a normal magic square use the formula S = n [ ( n 2 + 1 ) / 2 ] {\\displaystyle S=n[(n^{2}+1)/2]} where n {\\displaystyle n} equals the order, or number of rows, in the magic square. So for a 3×3 magic square, the formula would be: [2] X Research source S = 3 [ ( 3 2 + 1 ) / 2 ] {\\displaystyle 3[(3^{2}+1)/2]} S = 3 [ ( 9 + 1 ) / 2 ] {\\displaystyle 3[(9+1)/2]} S = 3 ( 10 / 2 ) {\\displaystyle 3(10/2)} S = 3 ( 5 ) {\\displaystyle 3(5)} S = 15 All rows, columns, and diagonals must add up to 15. Normal magic squares always have the same magic constant. If solving for a non-normal square, add all the numbers together and divide by the number of rows to find the magic constant."

Move up one row and to the right one column and write in the next number sequentially. Whenever a move takes you above the top row (like the first move will), go to the bottom row instead. If you need to move a square to the right but are already in the rightmost column, move to the leftmost column instead. Continue filling in the square following the pattern until it’s complete. [4] X Research source Example: In a normal 3 x 3 square, the 2 goes in the bottom right corner and the 3 goes in the left column in the center row. If the movement takes you to a box that is already occupied, go back to the last box that has been filled in, and place the next number directly below it. For example, when you place the 4 in a 3 x 3 magic square, it fits in the bottom left corner below the 3. Then, following the same up-one, right-one pattern, place the 5 in the center of the puzzle to continue."
