      "content": "Set your mind to something without asking someone else for advice. Dependency often stems from a fear of making the wrong choice or doing the wrong thing.

Here are a few other ideas to get you started: [4] X Research source Choose a movie to watch instead of asking for a second opinion. Do a solo hobby or activity that you enjoy.

Maybe you say “no” to a friend instead of automatically going with the flow, or tell your partner that you have other plans for the evening. Being assertive is all about being independent and drawing a clear line in the sand for other people to follow. [5] X Research source Here are a few ways you can practice: Telling your mom that she has to call you before heading over to your apartment Politely declining a friend who asks you to see a movie you’re not interested in Explaining to a co-worker that you can’t switch shifts due to prior plans"

      "content": "Accepting responsibility promotes independence, while deflecting responsibility promotes dependence. When you deflect a problem to someone else, you’re essentially depending on them to make things better. Instead, focus on facing your problems head-on. You’re less likely to be dependent on others if you consistently take responsibility for any problems you run into. [10] X Research source Instead of blaming your teacher for a bad grade on your test, accept the responsibility that you may not have prepared enough for the exam. Instead of blaming your parents for grounding you, accept that you shouldn’t have broken curfew. Instead of blaming a friend for the fight you had, own the negative emotions that you had in the moment."

Here are a few exercises to get you started: [12] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Hopeful Statements: Practice self-compassion by looking at the glass half-full. You might say, “Even though this week is really hard, I’m strong enough to deal with whatever comes my way.” Self-Forgiveness: Accept and forgive your mistakes instead of beating yourself up. Say something like, “I definitely messed up, but this mistake doesn’t define my worth as a human being.” Learning Experiences: Treat all negative events as an opportunity to learn and grow. Tell yourself, “Tonight definitely didn’t go the way that I planned, but I won’t let it bring me down. What can I do in the future to make things better?” Thought Challenging: Analyze your negative thoughts and perceptions using the facts of the situation. Do your feelings hold up against reality, or are they inaccurate?"

      "content": "Identify the source of your self-doubt and view it from a new perspective. As tough as it is, try thinking back to a time when someone made you feel like you weren’t enough. What did that person specifically say to you at that moment? Take that past comment and look at it from a new, more positive perspective. This technique is also known as therapeutically re-writing your history, and it’s a great way to reframe your past in a healthy, productive way. [15] X Research source Here are a few examples: Maybe your parents set the bar really high for you, and you felt like you had to constantly succeed to be worthy of their love attention. Remind yourself that every person has their own strengths and weaknesses and that your worth isn’t attached to your achievements. Maybe your childhood friend brushed you off in the past, and that experience made you feel like you weren’t worthy of other people’s attention. Try viewing this situation from a fresh perspective—maybe your friend was just busy at the time, or didn’t have the energy to hang out that day."
