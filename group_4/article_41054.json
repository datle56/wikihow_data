For instance, if the cut is on your hand, raise your hand and arm to shoulder height or higher. If it’s on your knee, lie down and elevate your leg so the wound is higher than your heart.

To solve that problem, cover the area with a cloth or gauze and wrap it with a compression bandage or medical tape.

Application steps vary; read the instructions and spray it on or use the applicator included in the package. Keep the area dry for at least 2 hours, and allow the artificial scab to fall off on its own instead of picking at it.

However, if you have a pretty bad cut and want stay on the safe side, you can also apply clotting powder or gel right away. If bleeding lasts longer than 30 minutes or if clotting powder or gel is ineffective, seek immediate medical attention."

      "content": "Counteract coumadin’s effects with vitamin K. The most commonly prescribed blood thinner, coumadin (Warfarin), works by reducing your body’s ability to use vitamin K to produce blood clots. In a bleeding emergency, a 1 to 5 mg dose of vitamin K is currently used to reverse the effects of this type of blood thinner. Your healthcare providers will assess your condition and administer the right dose either orally or intravenously (by IV). [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Counteracting the effects of the blood thinner will allow your body to form a clot and stop the bleeding. Newer, more advanced blood thinners work differently, and there are medications available that counteract their effects within minutes. Additionally, more antidotes will likely become available, so vitamin K may no longer be a standard treatment in the future.

They may also order another CT scan after 24 hours. Delayed bleeding in the brain is possible, even if the first scan was all clear."
