      "content": "Angels may visit you or send messages to you in your dreams. An angel may come with a specific message, or they’ll influence your dreams in subtle ways to provide insights or warnings of things to come. If you struggle to remember your dreams , try keeping a notebook by your bedside. Write down your dreams as soon as you wake up and include as much detail as possible. Reflect on the details to help you figure out what the angels are telling you. [1] X Research source For example, if you dream about getting into an accident or losing something important, your angels may be giving you premonitions of future circumstances so you can either prevent them or prepare for them. Sometimes dreams may be symbolic rather than literal, so be sure to research anything that stands out so you can try to interpret the message . What to do: Instead of dismissing the dream, make it a point to be careful and pay close attention to things around you, especially for the next 1-2 days. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Angels may stimulate your solar plexus chakra to send you a warning. The solar plexus chakra, which is located in your stomach, is associated with personal power, self-control, and the ability to make decisions. [3] X Research source If you experience sudden nausea, discomfort, or a knot in your belly, don’t ignore it. Angels may be sending you a direct warning through your solar plexus to help you avoid something dangerous. [4] X Research source For example, if you get a painful knot in your gut when you arrive at a party, or when you're hanging around a particular person, you might be in harm's way. What to do: Make a quick exit and see if the feeling in your stomach eases up. If it doesn’t, ask the angels to give you strength or send you a clearer message so you can act accordingly. If you think your solar plexus chakra is blocked, try a few simple exercises to unblock it ."

      "title": "Feeling sick out of nowhere may be angels telling you to stay home.",
      "content": "Feeling sick out of nowhere may be angels telling you to stay home. Getting sick is a normal thing that we all experience from time to time, but a sudden and severe illness may be divine intervention. Your guardian angels may be trying to protect you from something happening that day and they want to make sure you stay home. Try to avoid “powering through” and continuing your day as you normally would. [5] X Research source Your guardian angels always want what's best for you, and that includes seeing a doctor when you need to. If you’re feeling really sick, don’t avoid getting medical attention. You could have food poisoning or another legitimate illness that needs treatment. What to do: Whether this is a warning from your angels or not, it’s a good idea to take the day off, stay home, and rest up so you'll start feeling better soon."

      "title": "Angels may try to protect you with technical problems or delays.",
      "content": "Angels may try to protect you with technical problems or delays. If you’re in a potentially dangerous situation, your guardian angels might try to keep you safe by stalling or delaying you with a mechanical issue. Essentially, your angels are buying you time; the technical problem usually goes away as soon as the threat has passed. [6] X Research source For example, your phone might die out of nowhere, or suddenly your texts won’t go through. Or maybe you’re on your way home and your usual exit is closed, so you're forced to take a detour. Other common problems include buses or trains running late, canceled flights, and random computer glitches. What to do: Technical problems can be frustrating, but try to be patient. Remember that your guardian angels are just trying to do what’s best for you."

      "title": "Angels may try to get your attention with colors or streaks of light.",
      "content": "Angels may try to get your attention with colors or streaks of light. You might see unusual phenomena like swirling colors, sparkles, or shadows when you’re meditating, or catch quick glimpses of flashing lights or glowing figures as you’re going about your day. Pay attention to anything you see in your mind as you’re drifting off to sleep, as well. These experiences aren’t necessarily warnings, but they can indicate that your guardian angels are nearby. [7] X Research source What to do: Trust your intuition and open your mind in case your angels want to visit or communicate with you directly. If nothing happens, just thank them for their protection and enjoy their divine presence for as long as it lasts."

      "title": "Feeling tingles or light touches may be your angels reaching out.",
      "content": "Feeling tingles or light touches may be your angels reaching out. Guardian angels may try to get your attention through physical sensations like tingling, a warmth spreading throughout your body, or a light touch on your skin. You might also feel a palpable presence in the room around you. These messages are most common when you're going through something difficult or sad. [8] X Research source What to do: In most cases, your angels are just trying to comfort you. Thank them sincerely for being there. If you feel something physically holding you back or preventing you from taking a step forward, your angels may be trying to prevent you from walking into a physically dangerous situation, so be sure to heed their warning."

      "title": "Pay attention to any numbers you see repeatedly throughout the day.",
      "content": "Pay attention to any numbers you see repeatedly throughout the day. Seeing sequences of numbers over and over usually means your guardian angels are trying to communicate or get your attention. Different angel numbers have different meanings, and they don’t always represent warnings (but they certainly can). Your angels are definitely trying to say something to you, so try to stay alert and pick up on numerical patterns you’re seeing. Keep in mind there are no \"bad\" angel numbers. For example, some people worry about seeing 666 , but there's nothing inherently evil about that number. If you aren't sure where to start, try finding your angel number or taking our angel number quiz . What to do: Start by looking up the meanings of individual numbers in the sequence on numerology sites and consider how they relate to your current situation. If you’re feeling sure, consult a numerologist directly for insight."
