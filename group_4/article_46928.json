Facebook will then retrieve suggestions based on your keyword as well as what you are able to see of other people’s posts. If you had searched for “comedy,” for instance, when you see the search results, you will see more search suggestions such as “Comedy photos,” “People who like comedy,” “Pages similar to comedy,” and “My friends who like comedy.” At the very bottom, you will see “See more results for comedy.”"
