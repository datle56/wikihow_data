      "content": "Normal facial asymmetry Facial symmetry is when your eyes, eyelids, ears, and other features look evenly balanced on either side of your face. Most people look like they have symmetrical facial features. But if you observe their eyes or ears or cheeks up close, you'll often see little differences that make them uneven, or asymmetrical. That's perfectly normal. It may even be caused by your genetics. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Ptosis",
      "content": "Ptosis Ptosis (pronounced toe-sis ) is a condition where the levator muscle that controls your eyelid stops working properly. This causes your eyelid to droop. It may droop a little bit or so low that it makes it hard for you to see out of that eye. In fact, children with ptosis may have to lift their heads up to see properly, which can hurt their necks. You can be born with ptosis, acquire it with age, or develop it after an injury or eye disease. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might have ptosis if you've ever experienced any of the following: Stye : An infection in the tear duct, where tears come out of your eyes. Horner syndrome : A condition caused by nerve damage. It causes a drooping eyelid, a smaller pupil size, and reduced sweating on one side of the face. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Myasthenia gravis : A disease that causes voluntary muscles (the ones you can control) all over your body—including your eyelids—to get tired much faster than normal. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tumor : A growth behind or near the eye that pushes against your eyelid and makes it look uneven with your other eyelid. Stroke : A medical emergency where blood flow to your brain is blocked. It can cause nerve damage and paralysis in your face. [5] X Research source Get your eye checked for ptosis if you have a frequent urge to rub your eye; your eyes water a lot ; you feel tired and achy around your eyes; and you notice your vision is blurred or reduced.

      "content": "Uneven fat deposits It's natural to have a small amount of fat tissue in your upper eyelids and all around your eyes. It protects and cushions your eyes so they don't get hurt or damaged. With age, however, the fat deposits in your eyes can start to move forward, making them look puffy. If you notice one eyelid is puffier than the other, it may look that way because the fat deposits in one eye are shifting.

When the skin around your eyes loses this quality, it starts to loosen and sag. This can lead to one or both eyes looking droopy.

Occasionally, though, some children continue to have tics into their adult life. One common tic is blinking or moving your eye. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you do this a lot in one eye, especially when you're stressed or anxious, then your eyes may look uneven in the mirror because of how much one eye is moving more than the other. Tics usually go away on their own. Experts aren't sure what causes them, but they suspect genetics. They also often appear in people who have a mental health condition like attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)."

Bell's palsy can happen when you contract a virus like herpes, chickenpox, measles, mumps, or the flu.

The blockage reduces blood flow to the brain and can cause a lot of damage if it's not treated right away. One of the types of damage it can cause is to the nerves on one side of your face. In fact, facial paralysis, where your facial muscles can't move, is one of the most common signs of a stroke. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you or someone you know suddenly has drooping muscles on one side of their face, identify if a stroke is occuring by checking for other symptoms. Those include confusion and trouble speaking, vision problems, a severe headache, and trouble walking. If you notice all or even just some of these signs, call emergency services (911) right away."

      "content": "Use contour to create the illusion of depth in a hooded eye. Some people have one eye that looks more hooded than the other. An eyelid is hooded when your brow bone protrudes above your eye, so you can't see all (or, in extreme cases, any) of your eyelid. If you can see at least some of it, you may be able to apply contour makeup to create the illusion of shadows and depth. How to apply eyelid contour : Choose foundation or contour at least 2-3 times darker than your natural skin tone. Then fill a medium-sized makeup brush with the product and lightly apply it in the crease of the eye that doesn't look as hooded. Next, apply contour on your hooded eyelid closer to the brow bone. Be more generous here, as you're trying to make it look like that eye has deeper shadows like the other one. [19] X Research source"

To do that, draw an upward angled line, starting at the outer corner of your eyelid and following your lower lash line. Make this first line longer if you want a dramatic wing or shorter if you want it to look more subtle. [20] X Research source Next, draw a second line from the top of the first line inward toward your eyelid, just under your eyelid crease, and end it in line with the outer corner of your eye. Draw a third line straight down from the end of the second one toward your upper lash line. Finish lining your upper lash line and fill in the outline of the wing you just made. When you open your hooded eye fully, you should be able to see the wing shape on the edge of your eyelid."

To find the right position for the eyelid tape, close your eye and decide where you want your crease to be, so that it appears more aligned with your other eye. Next, remove the strip of tape from the packaging and place it on your eyelid in your desired position. Press it on gently with your fingers, then open your eye for a few seconds to secure the bond."
