      "content": "Wait until the symptoms of the condition you're treating have stabilized. Lexapro can take up to 6 weeks to fully kick in. As a result, quitting the Lexapro early can make it difficult to figure out if your subsequent symptoms are withdrawal from the SSRI, or a continuation of your underlying condition. If possible, wait at least 6 weeks before you talk to your doctor about quitting Lexapro.

Your doctor can help you figure out if your condition has improved. In most cases, it's best to take your antidepressant for at least 6-9 months before stopping it, although it depends on your reaction to the medication and the condition you’re treating."

      "content": "Understand why tapering is so important. Lexapro has a short half-life, meaning it leaves your body quickly. In fact, it takes about 27-32 hours for Lexapro to be halfway out of your body, and about 6 days for it to be 99% gone. Since Lexapro withdrawal is uncomfortable, you need to give your body time to slowly adjust to the increasingly lower Lexapro levels. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source It may take more or less time to stop taking Lexapro depending on your circumstances. Everybody reacts differently to a Lexapro taper, so your doctor will need to monitor you closely. Many people have extreme reactions to radical drops in a tapering schedule, like suicidal thoughts. That’s why going slowly is so important. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Collaborate with your doctor to craft the best tapering schedule for you. Most tapering schedules will last for a few weeks or months. Your doctor will wean you off the dose you're taking in small increments. During this time, you will lower your dose every few days or weeks, according to your doctor's instructions. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source The length of your tapering schedule will depend on how long you've been taking your medication, as well as the dosage you're taking. As an example, you may take 20 mg for 5 days, then 15 mg for 5 days, and 10 mg for 10 days. You might finish by slowly moving from 5 mg twice a day to 5 mg once a day. In some cases, your doctor may want to start decreasing your dosage by ½ or ⅓. For example, if you're currently taking 20 mg doses, then you may take a pill every other day instead. If you have any symptoms of withdrawal, your dosage might increase or you may need to taper slowly. Talk to your doctor if you notice any side effects."

It may be tempting to reduce your dose earlier than recommended, but your doctor prescribed each tapered dosage for a reason.

You could keep a journal and write, “I feel upbeat, but I had trouble sleeping last night,” or simply check in with yourself daily to see how you felt. This helps you keep track of how you're feeling. Additionally, it makes it easier to watch for potential withdrawal symptoms, which can develop slowly.

However, if you just had a single headache, it may have been caused by something else. If you think something may be a symptom, contact your doctor and ask them for guidance."

When you stop taking Lexapro, it's possible the condition you were treating (such as depression, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder) will come back. This means you might start experiencing your prior symptoms again. It's possible to mistake these symptoms for withdrawal, but there are ways to tell the difference: [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Withdrawal symptoms will often appear rapidly, and they’ll be transient. The symptoms may feel nonspecific or vague, and you’re likely to feel “not like yourself.” Rebound symptoms will resemble your old psychiatric condition, they’ll come on slowly, and they’ll be more persistent. If you used to deal with obsessive thoughts, the obsessive thoughts will likely come on strong and stick around. Consider if your current symptoms include physical as well as emotional symptoms. For example, muscle pain and prickling sensations aren't usually caused by depression, but they are part of withdrawal. Consult with your doctor for more insight into your unique situation."
