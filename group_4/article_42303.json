There are two screws at the bottom and tops of the sides below the plastic panels you just removed. Then there is one screw in the center of the battery compartment. [3] X Research source If you don't have a Torx 8 screwdriver, you may be able to force it with a Philips screwdriver, but you are likely to strip the screws and make them unusable."

Be careful of the wires if the motors are still attached. If you are experiencing stick drift, you may be able to fix it by turning the black plastic piece on the side of the joystick module with a screwdriver. If the joystick is drifting down or backward, turn the module clockwise. If it is drifting forwards, turn it counter-clockwise. Give it a few turns and then move the stick around. Repeat two or three times to remove any gunk from the stick. [6] X Research source"

The USB connector is at the top of the controller, and the headphone jack and expansion port are located at the bottom of the controller on the bottom board. To clean the circuit board, you can use compressed air to clean dust and loose debris. To spot clean the boards, you can use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to clean the board. Just make sure you ring out any excess alcohol before applying it to the boards. To clean any stubborn dirt, debris, and gunk, you can use a rubber cleaning tool or a clean pencil eraser."
