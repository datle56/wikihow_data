When you’re feeling annoyed or fed up with someone, the 👋 emoji can symbolize your desire for them to leave you alone. It can mean anything from “I don’t want to talk right now” to “We’re over! Go away,” if you decide to break up with a romantic interest or take a break from a friendship. [3] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source “Yeah, IDK why Tinder matched us, this definitely isn't a good fit. Boy, bye! 👋” “We were friends for a while, but she got so negative lately. I had to say bye to that! 👋” Breaking up committed relationships this way isn't common, but you may see it used by people who don't like their match on a dating app, for example, or decide the person they've gone on a couple of dates with isn't right for them."

If you get a text from someone that’s clearly a bit mocking and essentially says “goodbye” in a sassy, snarky way, the person texting you is probably looking for some space. They want you to know that they’re done talking to you for the moment, and the best way to respond is to simply give them what they need. Person 1: “Whatever, bye 👋” Person 2: “Goodbye. If you want to talk out whatever is wrong, you know where to find me.” If you know that you said or did something to upset them, offering an apology might help you mend the relationship. If you don’t know what’s wrong, however, the best way to navigate that might simply be to let them know your door is open if they ever feel like talking things out."

You could bring up your favorite milkshake flavors, gush about how much you want one, or invite somebody to grab a delicious milkshake with you using the combo. “Oooooh. Do you know what sounds really good right now? 🥛👋” “I know this place that does the best milkshakes. Wanna go with me sometime? 🥛👋” You can use the 🍼 (milk bottle) emoji to write “milkshake” alternatively. In that case, the combination would be 🍼👋."
