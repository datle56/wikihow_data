This is located in different places depending on the sewing machine you have, but is normally on the right side of the body or in the back. Depending on your model, a small light above the needle may turn on to indicate the machine is powered on. [1] X Research source Some sewing machines do not have a power switch and instead turn on as soon as they’re plugged in. Some models also have a detachable power cord. If yours does, look for a port on the sides or back of your machine that matches the non-outlet end of your power cord."

      "content": "Look for the stitch adjustment buttons. These are in different locations depending on the specific sewing machine you have, but there are typically a few physical buttons (and sometimes a small screen, depending on your model) on the front or side of the sewing machine. These buttons select the type of stitch you create (a straight stitch or zig-zag, for example), the length of the stitch, and the direction of the stitch (forward or in reverse). [6] X Research source Note the location of the reverse lever or button in particular. This reverses the direction of the stitching and you’ll need it to secure the beginnings and ends of your seams. [7] X Research source Some models may have dials you turn to select different settings instead of pressable buttons. Check the manual for your specific machine to determine the functions and locations for each of the buttons."

Beneath it is the thread feed (a series of channels and loops on the side of the machine beneath the take-up lever). There are typically numbers and arrows printed next to the feed to clearly show you how to thread the machine.

It controls the tension of the thread as you sew; if the tension is too tight, the needle will be pulled to the right. If the tension is too loose, the thread will loop on the bottom of the fabric you are sewing. [9] X Research source The exact tension setting you need depends on the thickness or number of layers of fabric you’re working with. Check your user’s manual for recommendations for your machine."

On some models, the foot pedal cord is detachable; look for a port (likely near the power cord or its port) on the side or back of the machine to plug in the foot pedal. [16] X Research source While sewing, you’ll press the foot pedal to make the needle move. Most pedals are pressure-sensitive; the harder you press, the faster the needle stitches."

Needles are also sized based on the gauge of the needle. The smaller the gauge of the needle, the larger the number. [For example], 8-gauge needles are very thick and best for heavy-weight wovens, and a 16-gauge needle is very thin and great for delicate, lightweight fabrics.” Your machine may come with a variety of needles to choose from. Check your user’s manual for needle recommendations for different fabrics."

      "title": "Install the needle securely with the needle clamp screw.",
      "content": "Install the needle securely with the needle clamp screw. Sewing machine needles have a flat side, meaning they can only fit one way into the clamp (usually with the flat side toward the back). Look for a groove down one side of the needle, generally opposite the flat side of the shank (the upper portion that goes into the clamp). This groove must face the direction from which the needle is threaded (the thread rides in this groove while going up and down through the fabric). [17] X Research source Insert the needle all the way into the post and tighten the thumbscrew securely to install it. On some machines, you may need to tighten the screw with a screwdriver. You may need to use the hand wheel (a small dial that raises and lowers the needle manually) to adjust the height of the needle clamp screw to make the process easier. [18] X Research source If you are having trouble fitting the needle, refer to your machine’s manual. Some machines will come with a needle already installed."

      "content": "Place your thread on the spool pin and a bobbin on the bobbin winder. A sewing machine uses two thread sources: a top thread from the spool and a lower thread, stored on a bobbin. To begin winding the bobbin , place both the spool of thread and your bobbin on their respective pins. “The user manual is your best friend,” says professional tailor Andrea Beaulieu. “Make sure to read it through before starting and keep it handy to troubleshoot. Follow the guide for threading your machine and winding and loading the bobbin exactly, as any tiny deviation will cause problems. The tension and bobbin are the most challenging parts of the machine to master, so be patient with yourself and your machine.”"

Some machines may have a tension disk to wrap the thread around before reaching the bobbin (consult your manual). [19] X Research source Then, wrap the thread around the bobbin a few times in a clockwise direction. Push the end of the thread into a tiny hole or slit in the side to securely attach it.

Slide open the bobbin cover and drop your bobbin in place with the thread in a counterclockwise position (on most machines). Pull about 4 in (10 cm) of thread through the guide (a small notch) in the bobbin compartment and pull it to the left, leaving the thread outside (It will need to be brought up through the hole in the needle plate after you have threaded the top thread). [21] X Research source Once you’re accustomed to your machine, “you can set up a bobbin for winding…as you are sewing other items,” explains Connie Tao, a bridal designer and the founder of Connie Tao Designs in Pasadena, California. “The bobbin winding mechanism will work while you use the machine.”"

To thread the machine , take the thread and pull it through the thread guide at the top, and then down and around the take-up lever and through the thread feed. There should be small numbers and arrows printed on the machine showing how to guide the thread through the channels and loops of the feed. [22] X Research source Usually, the thread follows this general pattern: left, down, up, down, into a hook, through the needle.

The bobbin thread should have been caught when the threaded needle went down and up and is now looped over the needle thread. Pull on one side of the loop to bring up the bobbin thread tail, or just release the needle thread and pass a pair of scissors between the presser foot and plate to pull the looped bobbin thread out. [24] X Research source You should now have the ends of two threads, one from the needle and one coming up from below from the bobbin. Slide the bobbin cover closed to secure it.

If you give the fabric a gentle tug while the presser foot is down, you'll feel that the machine grips it pretty firmly. While you sew, the machine uses the feed dog underneath to advance the fabric at the correct speed. [26] X Research source There's no need to pull the fabric through the machine; in fact, pulling can bend the needle or damage your project. You can adjust the speed and the stitch length on the machine."

      "content": "Press the foot pedal to begin stitching. The foot pedal is your speed control—the harder you push it, the faster you will go. Push it slowly at first (just enough to get the machine going). The machine will advance the fabric automatically away from you. Grip the loose ends of both threads for your first several stitches to keep them from retreating into the fabric. After you've stitched for a short distance, let go and use both hands to control the fabric and the machine. [27] X Research source Professional tailor and designer Andrea Beaulieu says, “if your thread is knotting or too loose on the bottom of your fabric, adjust the upper tension [on the thread]. If it’s knotting on the top, adjust the bobbin.” “Steer” the fabric in a straight line or a curve by guiding it through the machine with your hands. Try sewing in a straight line and making some curves to get a feel for both. Don’t force or pull the material while it’s going under the needle. This can cause the material to stretch or the needle to break, or the stitches to clog up in the bobbin. If you feel like the fabric is not moving fast enough, press the foot pedal harder, adjust the stitch length, or (if you must) buy a faster machine."

      "content": "Engage the reverse button or lever at the end of the fabric to backstitch . This lever reverses the direction that the machine feeds, so the fabric travels toward you as the machine sews (on some machines, this button or lever is spring-loaded, so hold it down to sew in reverse). At the end of a seam or the edge of the fabric, sew a few stitches in reverse back over the last few stitches you just made to keep the thread from pulling out. It’s OK if your stitch or seam runs off the fabric. You can still engage the reverse lever and backstitch back onto the fabric. According to professional designer Andrea Beaulieu, “You should always backstitch before ending…to secure what you have just sewn.”"

Guide the needle up to its highest position, then raise the presser foot to free the fabric (it should pull out easily). “Trim the thread close to the fabric, not the needle,” explains professional tailor Andrea Beaulieu. “This will ensure you don’t have extra trimming work to do later, and also keeps your machine set up for the next bit of stitching without pulling the thread out of the needle (which is what happens if it’s cut too close).” If the thread pulls back when you try to remove the fabric, check the needle position. On many machines, there is a small notch on the back of the post that holds the presser foot you can use to sever the thread. Otherwise, use sewing scissors to trim the thread."

Place the pins perpendicular to the line where the seam will go (most seams are typically ½ inch (1.3 cm) to ⅝ inch (1.6 cm) from the edge of the fabric). Be sure to pin the right sides of the fabric together so that the seam allowance will end up on the inside. The “right” side is whichever side of the fabric you want on the outside when the piece is done (on printed fabric, it’s generally the side with brighter colors. Solids may not have an obvious right side). [28] X Research source While you're looking at the fabric, notice which way the fabric goes. Seams may go any direction, but most sewing projects are cut so the main seams go parallel with the lines of the weave. Also note the direction of the print, if your fabric has one, and arrange it so it will be \"right side up\" (such as with a floral or animal print) or so that stripes or other patterns run a certain direction. While you might sew a single layer of fabric to stop an edge from fraying, the goal of most machine sewing is to join two pieces of fabric. So, get plenty of practice sewing with a couple of layers and pins!"
