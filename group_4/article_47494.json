      "content": "Get an eye exam. If you are interested in wearing contact lenses, get a thorough eye exam to determine exactly what type of corrective lenses you need. Contact lenses can correct: Myopia. People who are myopic can see well close up, but objects far away are blurry. Hyperopia. In this condition, people see well at a distance, but objects close to them are blurry. Presbyopia. This condition occurs when people have more trouble seeing close up as they age. It often begins around age 40. Astigmatism. This occurs when the eye is not shaped correctly. It causes blurred vision. Color blindness. Color blindness occurs when people are unable to perceive some colors, or confuse two colors with each other. Red/green color blindness, which means you confuse the colors red and green together, is most common in men."

      "content": "Determine what type of contacts you want. Some can only be worn in the day, others can only be worn in the night. The eye doctor will measure your eye to make sure you get contacts that fit and are comfortable. Once you know what you need there are several types to choose from: Soft contact lenses. These contacts are flexible and bend to fit your eye. They can correct myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia, or combinations of these conditions. They are good for people who play sports and are active. Hard contact lenses. These lenses may provide a better image than soft lenses and can be used for most eye conditions. They also have a lower risk of eye infections because they are gas permeable. This means that your eye can breathe through them. If you keep them clean, they can sometimes be used for up to three years; however, some people find them uncomfortable. Hybrid contacts. These contacts have a hard center and soft outer part. They are particularly good for people with keratoconus, or irregularly curved corneas."

      "content": "Evaluate what works best with your lifestyle and budget. Hard contacts have the advantage that you can continue using the same pair for up to three years if your prescription stays the same; however, some people find soft contacts more comfortable. If you choose soft contact lenses, there are several types you can choose depending on your lifestyle and budget. Daily wear contacts: These are usually the cheapest option, but they require more care. You have to take them out each night and clean them. Daily wear disposable contacts: These are worn for one day only, then thrown out. Extended wear contacts: These contacts can be left in overnight for up to a week. This option is good for people who are too busy or can’t remember to take them out each night; however, they are not good for people who are prone to eye infections or allergies. Some brands may even be approved to wear continuously for 30 days. Disposable contacts: These contacts require the least effort to wear. These are worn daily (so they must be removed at night) and are good for a certain period, from weeks to months, depending on the type you have. This makes them more expensive."

Put the contact lens on the tip of your index finger with the concave, cup side facing up. While looking in the mirror, use your middle finger to pull down your lower eyelid and lashes. Place the contact onto the surface of your eye. The bottom edge of the contact should be the first part to touch your eye. It should do so on the white part of your eye just above where you have pulled your lower lid down. Press the contact onto the surface of your eye until you feel it stick. When you take your finger away, the contact should float on the surface of your eye. Blink to adjust it to the correct position. If you are inserting your contacts for the first time, your doctor may suggest that you wear them for only an hour the first day and then wear them for longer periods of time. This will give your eyes a chance to get used to them."

For some lenses, you can use a plunger (DMV), which makes it much easier to take out your contacts: just take the plunger, stick it onto the contacts, and remove them. Ask the provider of your contacts if they have one that you can have or buy."

This makes it both safer, better for your contacts, and less likely to sting. They are available at local drug stores and grocery stores. Ask your eye doctor if there is a particular one that she recommends for your type of lenses. Do not use a homemade saline solution. It isn’t sterilized, won’t have the right concentration of salt, and may have other traces of minerals or chemicals. This could cause eye infections or damage the lenses. Do not use bottled or tap water. Even purified water is not sufficiently sterile. In addition, it will probably sting because it won’t have the correct salt concentration. Do not use saliva. Saliva contains bacteria, enzymes, and many other contaminants which could increase your risk of an eye infection or damage the lenses. Do not top up the contact lens solution when you soak or store your contacts. Change the solution instead to prevent the buildup of bacteria. Do not use expired contact solution. If your contact solution has expired, throw it out and get new solution. It isn’t worth risking an eye infection."

If you do have long nails , you can use certain techniques to safely remove your contacts. It is best to rub them, even if you have a “no-rub” solution. Do this as often as your type of lenses require. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the lenses and contact solution, in addition to any recommendations from your doctor."
