      "title": "Always name the hosts of the event.",
      "content": "Always name the hosts of the event. Listing the hosts tells your guests who is inviting them to the event. How you write the hosts' names and the order in which you should list them varies depending on who is hosting. [1] X Research source These rules are particularly important if you are writing a formal wedding invitation . For example, you should start a dinner invitation by saying \"Sam and Ellen Smith invite you to a dinner celebrating the graduation of their daughter Leslie from graduate school.\" If a company is hosting, write out the company’s full name. For example, you could write, “ABC Tech Company invites you to an award ceremony celebrating this year’s top-performing employees.”"

      "title": "Below the hosts’ names, invite the recipients to the occasion.",
      "content": "Below the hosts’ names, invite the recipients to the occasion. Use phrasing to make it clear that this is an invitation specifically for the guest and not just an informational flyer. The simplest way is to add “requests the pleasure of your company” after listing the hosts, then put the event type. Don’t just put “a party” as the event type—specify what it’s for and who is being celebrated, if relevant. For example, specify if it’s a wedding, a corporate retreat, a gala, a dinner, or a retirement party. For wedding invitations when the ceremony is being held in a church, the most common wording is “[Hosts’ full names] request the honor of your presence.” For wedding invitations when the ceremony is being held outside the church, but is still formal, swap “request the pleasure of your company” for “request the honor of your presence.”"

      "title": "Avoid abbreviating guest names, dates, and other info.",
      "content": "Avoid abbreviating guest names, dates, and other info. Regardless of the type of event you’re inviting your guests to, you should use a formal writing style on a formal invitation. This means spelling out dates, street types, states, and other words that are usually abbreviated. Write out guests' full names, and always use last names if you know them. [2] X Research source For example, write “253212 Boston Street” instead of “253212 Boston St.” Write out, “Saturday, the nineteenth of November” instead of “Saturday, November 19th.” Put the year on its own line, spelling it out like “two thousand and twenty-five.” Don’t use the shortened versions of guests’ names. Write “Stephanie Smith” instead of “Steph Smith.”"

      "content": "Mention a dress code, if there is one. Business events, weddings, and other formal occasions usually follow a specific dress code. Tell guests what the dress code is at the bottom of the invitation, after the important details about the event. You may simply write, “Formal dress code,” swapping formal out for the type of dress code you desire. [3] X Research source Common formal dress codes include cocktail attire, black-tie, white-tie, semi-formal, and formal attire. For business events, you may specify business formal, business casual, or one of the previous, dressier options."

Include the start time of the event, writing it out completely instead of using numerals or abbreviations like “am” and “pm.” [4] X Research source For example, write “six o’clock in the evening” or “nine-thirty in the morning.” When writing an address out, avoid abbreviations. For example, write “1234 Market Street,” not “1234 Market St.” Spell out state names as well—put ”California” instead of “CA,” and so on."

Ask your guests to let you know if they're attending or not with a phrase like, “Kindly reply via [RSVP format] by [date] if you will attend.” It's up to you how you'd like them to respond—via phone, email, mail, or another format. [5] X Research source Formal dinner invitations should include an RSVP card similar to the kind you would send for a wedding, but anniversary parties and bridal or baby showers can simply ask guests to call the host with their response. Business events typically track RSVPs via email or other digital forms. If you’re sending an evite (a digital invitation sent through an electronic format), embed a link to the desired RSVP method to make it easy for guests to respond."

      "title": "Order and write the hosts' names correctly.",
      "content": "Order and write the hosts' names correctly. A host is the person funding the event. How to write out the hosts’ names on a formal wedding invitation depends on who the hosts are and their marital status. Generally, the hosts related to the bride go first, but if both sets of parents are hosting or as a courtesy, you may include the groom's relatives as well. Follow the wording below that best matches your situation. [6] X Research source Bride’s parents hosting (married): If the parents of the bride or groom are still married, write “Mr. and Mrs.\" followed by the father's name. So Tiffany Smith's parents should be written as \"Mr. and Mrs. John Smith” on the first line of the invitation. Bride and grooms parents hosting: If including the groom's parents alongside the bride’s parents, put “and” on its own on the second line, then write their names as above if they’re still married. Refer to the guidance below for divorced parents. Same-sex couples: For same-sex couples, ask hosts if they have a preference for whose name is included and in which order. Default to whoever’s name is first alphabetically if they have no preference. Bride and groom hosting with parents: If the bride and groom are hosting with their families, you should write “Together with their families\" on the first line, then the full name of the bride, \"and,\" and the full name of the groom on the second, third, and fourth lines respectively. For same-sex couples, choose a desired order for the couples’ names or default to alphabetical order by first name. Divorced parents hosting: If the bride’s parents are divorced and remarried but hosting together, you should write the mother's new name first, followed by the father's name. So for example, you might write “Mr. and Mrs. Jill Willby,” then “Mr. and Mrs. Greg Smith.\" Again, each couple gets their own line. An in-between “and” isn’t necessary, as it’s reserved for hosts who are married to each other. If the bride’s parents are divorced and one or both are not remarried, put the father’s name first, then put the mother’s name on a separate line with “Ms.” instead of “Mrs.” (unless she’s remarried, in which case put “Mrs. [Husband’s Name].”) Someone besides parents and couple hosting: If someone other than parents or stepparents is hosting, write the host(s) name(s) and their relationship to the bride or groom in the invitation line. For example, if the bride’s brother is hosting, you should write “Mr. Stanley Smith requests the honor of your presence at the marriage of his sister Stephanie Smith to David Young.” Honoring deceased parents: To honor a deceased parent, include their name in the host line or below the bride or groom’s name. Put “the late” before their name. For example, you may write “Mr. James Smith and the late Mrs. Jane Smith.” Another option is to write “[bride/groom’s name], the child of [surviving parent’s name] and the late [deceased parent’s name].”"

    {
      "title": "Use the right phrase to invite guests to attend.",
      "content": "Use the right phrase to invite guests to attend. Regardless of who hosts, the next line after the hosts’ names should be either “requests the honor of your presence” (for a church ceremony) or “requests the pleasure of your company” (for a ceremony outside a church). Follow it with either “at the marriage of” if someone other than the bride(s) and/or groom(s) are hosting or “at their marriage” if the bride(s) and/or groom(s) are hosting as well. [7] X Research source For example, you might say “ [Hosts' names] request the honor of your presence at the marriage of their daughter Tiffany Smith to Adam Jones” (if the bride’s parents are hosting) or “[Hosts' names] request the pleasure of your company at the marriage of Tiffany Smith to their son Adam Jones” (if the groom’s parents are hosting.) Another option is “[host names] invite you to share in the joy of marriage uniting their child,” followed by the bride and groom’s names."

In order, you should list the date, time, and venue of the wedding, each on their own line. For example, you might write “Saturday, the sixteenth of October,” “two thousand twenty-five,” and “at half past six in the evening” on their own lines. Add the venue name and address on the next two lines. [8] X Research source Put a dress code, if there is one, below the venue address. Don’t include registry information on the wedding invitation—this is considered poor etiquette because it presumes that guests will give a gift. Include registry details on your wedding website or a separate registry card alongside the invite."

      "title": "Include information about the reception.",
      "content": "Include information about the reception. If the wedding ceremony will be followed by a reception that everyone is invited to at the same venue, add that information to the invitation itself. If the reception is at a separate venue and/or not everyone is invited, write the reception information on a separate card to be included with the invitation. If you include the reception information on the invitation itself, it should come last on the invitation and include the time (assuming it’s at the same venue). For example, you could say “Reception to follow at 5 pm.” “Reception to follow” and “at 5 pm” should get their own lines. On a separate reception card, include the reception time, the venue name, and the street address. [9] X Research source If the wedding is child-free, specify this below the location, says Summer. Put a phrase like “Adults only. Reception to follow.” If children are allowed at the ceremony but not the reception, say “After the ceremony, there will be an adult only reception.” [10] X Expert Source Ivy Summer Certified Wedding & Event Planner Expert Interview. 9 Feb 2021."

Leave space for their name and how many guests they’re bringing. [11] X Research source For example, a standard RSVP card will say “M.______________ __ will attend __ will not attend.” The “M.” at the beginning allows them to write “Ms.,” “Mr.,” “Mr. and Ms.,” or “Mr. and Mrs.” and lets you know how many people are attending. To make the RSVP card feel more formal, swap out “will attend” and “will not attend” for “accepts with pleasure” or “regretfully declines.” [12] X Research source If you are asking your guests to make a meal selection, this should be listed on the RSVP card as well. List their meal options and leave a space underneath each for the names of the guests requesting that particular meal."

      "title": "Business events or corporate events",
      "content": "Business events or corporate events When writing a formal invitation to a business or corporate event, follow conventional guidelines. Spell out everything, including numerals. Avoid abbreviations. Lead with the hosting person(s) or company’s name, then a line inviting the guest to the event (and stating what the event is). Below that, include the date, time, venue name, and venue address, each on their own line. Include a dress code at the bottom, if applicable. [13] X Research source While an RSVP card isn’t required, be sure to clarify how guests should RSVP on the invitation if you’re not including one. Also mention meal choices, if available. For the invitation line after the hosts’ names, put a phrase like “requests the pleasure of your company at,” “requests the honor of your presence at,” or “formally invites you to.” The formality of the events dictates how long ahead of time you must send invitations out. For important seminars and dinners with out-of-town executives or other high-profile guests, send invitations between four and eight months. For more casual events like luncheons, reception, cocktail parties, send invitations between five and four weeks out."

If there’s a guest of honor, put “honoring” or “celebrating” at the end of the invitation line, before their name. You may or may not have hosts to lists for a formal dinner, but if you do, their names should go at the top of the invitation. If there are meal options, include them on a separate RSVP card.

You may or may not list a host, but you should include the name of the bride and/or couple and the information regarding the shower. The spacing of a shower invitation should follow the spacing of a wedding invitation. For example, you could write “You are cordially invited to a bridal shower in honor of Tiffany Smith on November 5th at 6 pm. The Country Club. 123 Name Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota.” If you’d prefer not to receive gifts, especially if this isn’t your first marriage or child, tell guests who inquire but leave it off the invitation. If you’d like to indicate it to all guests, consider using a phrase like “Gift us only with the honor of your presence” or “Your presence in our lives is a gift! We request no other.” [14] X Research source"
