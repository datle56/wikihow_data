      "content": "Wear a nude-colored bra under a chiffon or mesh top for a refined look. If you want a more classic look, opt for a nude-colored bra that won't distract from the color of the chiffon top. [1] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. Choose a balconette bra if you want more breast support. [2] X Research source Pair it with slacks for a semi-formal look or jeans for a dress-casual vibe. A bandeau or tank bra might be a little more comfortable and smooth out your silhouette under a tighter-fitting blouse. Take the straps off if you're wearing a halter or sleeveless sheer top so your bra straps won't show. This is a good option for thick chiffon that's nearly opaque."

      "content": "Sport a white or black camisole with spaghetti straps underneath. If the top is more sheer than opaque, throw on a fitted cami underneath to hide your midsection and smooth out your silhouette. [3] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. If the top is black, wear a black or nude cami. If it's white, go for white, black, or tan depending on the look you want. [4] X Research source Choose a deep scoop or v-neck cami to maximize the appeal of the see-through top. Make sure the cami is long enough to reach all the way to the waistband of your pants or skirt. This will work for chiffon, mesh, tulle, loose crochet, organza, or lace."

      "content": "Show off your silhouette with a decorative bandeau bra underneath. If you don't mind your stomach showing through the shirt, feel free to go bold with nothing but a bandeau bra underneath. Choose any color bandeau bra you like—a colorful one will make it stand out and draw attention to the fact that your skin is showing through the top (which is great if you’re going for a more risque look). [5] X Research source Feel free to play with patterns and details on the bra; a polka dot, striped, chevron, or checkered bandeau bra will add some spunk to your getup! Make sure it fits snugly around your bust so you're not having to pull it up or readjust it. Pair it with jeans or slacks depending on the type of look you're going for (casual vs. posh). If you don't have any decorative bras, a bandeau swimsuit top will work just as well."

      "content": "Smooth your silhouette with a form-fitting bodysuit under a sheer top. Put the bodysuit on before you put on anything else and make sure you’re happy with how it hugs you around your chest and tummy. Choose a black bodysuit to go under a black blouse for a classic look or a black one under a white blouse for a smart, high-contrast look. [6] X Research source A bodysuit with a sweetheart neckline looks great under a t-shirt style or off-the-shoulder top."

      "content": "Cover your breasts with pasties if you want a daring look. If your sheer top is nearly opaque or if you don't mind showing more skin, stick pasties over your breasts. Choose a color that closely matches your skin tone and stick them onto your dry breasts before you get dressed. [7] X Research source Don't use lotions or any types of oils on your skin before sticking on the pasties. You can buy pasties online or at most department or outlet stores that sell women’s undergarments."

If you’re dressing for work or for a fancy party, put on a long-sleeved mesh or transparent chiffon blouse over a collared button-up. Pull the collar up so it sticks out of the neck of the blouse and tuck the bottom of the shirt into your slacks. You can also flip the look and wear a scoop-neck tank top under a sheer collared button-up blouse. [8] X Research source Tie a pussycat bow loosely around your neck to make it a little more formal or office-friendly."

Leave the bow slightly loose and hanging down the front of your chest for a poised, charming look. [9] X Research source Match the color of the pussycat bow to the sheer top or play with contrast by wearing a white cami under a white sheer top and a black pussycat bow. If the sheer top is a collared button-down, button it all the way up for a prim-and-proper look or leave the top 2 buttons undone for a more relaxed semi-formal look."

Choose a long-sleeve or sleeveless white lace top and put it over a fitted white camisole. Throw on some loose slacks or black fitted jeans and you're good to go! Add pops of color with your accessories like a belt, pumps, bag, or jewelry. If your lace top is off-the-shoulder or short-sleeved, opt for a tank bra that covers your torso from your bust to your waist. If you want to make it a little sexier (i.e., not for work), wear a decorative t-shirt bra, bralette, or demi bra."

[10] X Research source Complete the look with black slingbacks or a mule sandal with a slight heel. If this is your going out look, pair it with black pumps. Or, for a more spicy look, spruce it up with red, orange, yellow, pink, or blue point-toed pumps with a colorful clutch."

      "content": "Pair a structured transparent top with a nude bra or cami and a mini-skirt. If your transparent top has ribbing on the side or an ornate neckline that gives it some structure, let that be the star of the show! Wear a nude cami or bra under it and pair it with a simple black or white skirt. Finish the look with pumps, pointed-toe t-strap heels, flat or heeled mules, or slingback sandals. This looks great if your sheer top has a Queen Anne, boat, square, or jewel neckline. To make it a little sexier for nighttime, choose a black bra and a black miniskirt. If the structured top has lace or hemmed design, keep your jewelry to a minimum—a simple bracelet, ring, or stud earrings will do. You can also wear slacks instead of a skirt during chilly winter months."

      "content": "Pair a cropped crochet or lace top with a high-waisted skirt or shorts. Depending on how much skin you want to show, wear a bra, camisole, or fitted t-shirt under the top. Choose a maxi, A-line, or midi skirt with a cinched waistline to show off your figure. [12] X Expert Source Kalee Hewlett Fashion Stylist Expert Interview. 23 April 2019. Make sure the bottom hem of the top ends at the top of the skirt's waistline so it doesn't look billowy around your midsection. If the base of the top is asymmetrical, make sure to choose a bra that won't stick out underneath (i.e., don’t wear a cami or ¾ tank bra). If the top hangs down past the waistband of the skirt or shorts, tuck it in and belt it for a more put-together look."

      "content": "Up your sex appeal with a detailed bra under black mesh or lace. Choose lace bralette with a v-style cut and some ruffles on the inner edges for a casual day-time date look or a night out on the town. For a laid-back vibe, wear casual boyfriend jeans and boots, flat mules, or sneakers. Channel your inner rockstar by topping it with a leather bomber jacket. If you’re going full casual-sexy, choose light-wash jeans. To dress it up a little, choose dark blue or black wash denim and a more fitted fit (like skinny, straight, or flared). For a fun twist on the look, flip it by wearing the mesh top under your bralette."

      "content": "Sport a bodysuit under high-waisted cutoffs or jeans and a sheer button-up blouse. Slip on a bodysuit and then put on your cutoffs or jeans. Put the sheer button-up blouse on and let it hang loose for a chilled-out look or tie it around your waist just above the waistline of your jeans. You can also button up the bottom 2 to 3 buttons and do a half-tuck at the front for a cool, casual look. High-waisted ones look best with bodysuits, but you can wear low or mid-rise shorts if you like. Feel free to add a chunky statement belt to show off your curvy silhouette. To keep it casual, wear sneakers, flat booties, sandals, or flat mules. This is a great look to play with funky colors and patterns! For instance, if your bodysuit is black, pair it with a white mesh or chiffon button-up and funky-colored or patterned jeans (like leopard print, striped, or polka dot)."

If you're feeling like a playful, summery look, put the mesh top on before anything else and cover up with a jumper or overalls on top. If the top of the jumper or overalls doesn’t cover your chest, wear a bra or cami underneath the sheer top. [13] X Research source This works best if the sheer top has long sleeves so you can show off more of the beautiful fabric."

If you’re in the mood for a daring, feminine look, put the transparent top on first and then wear a slinky slip dress over it. Choose a black sheer top and a dark-colored dress for nighttime or a white sheer top for the daytime. Finish the look with sneakers, combat boots, or knee-rise boots. [14] X Research source Make it a little more playful by wearing a pastel-colored sheer top under a patterned slip dress (think polka dots, paisley, or stripes). This looks best with mini or midi dresses (that come down to your knee or at your mid-thigh) but you can also try it with a maxi-dress to make it look more modern or city-chic."
