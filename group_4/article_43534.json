The unit for capacitance is the farad, which is abbreviated with a capital “F.” You may also see the Greek letter mu (µ), which looks like a lowercase “u” with a tail in front of it. (Because the farad is a large unit, most capacitors measure capacitance in microfarads; a microfarad is a millionth of a farad.)"

If the needle initially shows a low resistance value then gradually moves towards infinity, the capacitor is good. If the needle shows a low resistance value and doesn’t move, the capacitor has been shorted out. You’ll need to replace it. If the needle shows no resistance value and doesn’t move or a high value and doesn’t move, the capacitor is an open capacitor (dead). [9] X Research source"

For a 25V capacitor, you could use a voltage of 9 volts, while for a 600V capacitor, you should use a voltage of at least 400 volts. Let the capacitor charge for a few seconds. Be sure to connect the positive (red) lead from the voltage source to the positive (longer) capacitor terminal and the negative (black) lead to the negative (shorter) terminal. The greater the discrepancy between the capacitor’s voltage rating and the voltage you’re charging it with, the longer it will take to charge. Generally, the higher voltage of the power supply you have access to, the higher the voltage ratings of the capacitors you can test with ease.

Only if the initial reading is much lower than the expected voltage should you be concerned. [12] X Research source"

This method will only work with capacitors that can hold enough energy to produce a spark when shorted. This method is not recommended because it only can be used to determine if the capacitor can hold a charge, capable of sparking when shorted, or not. It can not be used to check if the capacity of the capacitor is within the specifications. Using this method on larger capacitors could result in serious injury or even death!"
