      "content": "Plan your work. A drawing of your design is very helpful. It allows you to create a pattern you like and determine how much tile you will need and in what colors. Graph paper is perfect for this or you can create your design with a drawing program. Take a trip to your local tile store and find the tile you like first, then create your design. You'll also need some tools and materials which listed elsewhere in this article."

The objective is to create a rough surface for your thinset mortar to grab onto. Unlike finish woodworking, a smooth surface is NOT the objective. [1] X Research source If you do not have sandpaper in your home kit, look into a sanding block at your hardware store. These are stiff foam covered with various grades of sandpaper and work like a champ. If you do have sandpaper, wrap it around an old chalk eraser to get a better grip and save your hands. A small block of wood also serves but the eraser is more comfortable."

If you have large cracks or the table is made of several independent pieces such as a picnic table, consider an underlayment that will span these cracks. Why? Movement of the wood can cause your tiles to crack. Schluter Ditra makes one such product. But, it may not be available in the small quantity you need. Another option, and the one I will use for this project, is simple Masonite, 1/8\" to 1/4\" thick. [2] X Research source"

You can accomplish this with the size tile you buy and the width of your grout lines. This said, you learn by doing so if your design does not allow for full tile only, rent a tile saw for the project. Most tile stores offer them for rent. For this project, it is assumed there's a symmetrical layout that flows along the two lines you drew and does not require cutting. A tutorial on cutting tile is available here: How to Cut Tile ."

This technique has you take some thinset, apply it to the back of a tile like you are spreading it with a butter knife then spread it over the entire tile back with your notched trowel. Take a regular trowel, grab some thinset with it and scrap it onto the tile at one edge. Take your notched trowel and spread it across the tile then run the trowel over it again at a 90 degree angle. The objective is a smooth, even and complete covering of the back of the tile. Thickness is important here. You want each tile to have a consistent thickness of mortar for an even top later but you don't want it so thin that you have poor adhesion. Have enough so that when you have made my two passes with the notched trowel, you cannot see any of the back of the tile and the total thickness of the mortar is the depth of the notches plus about 1/8\".

For example, if your tile is 3/8\" thick and your table is 1.5\" thick, you would need a strip 1 7/8\" wide. If a 2\" piece is more readily available, that is fine, allow the excess to project below the bottom of the table top."

Start one of the finishing nails about 1\" for the end of the molding in the center of the molding (but low enough to not hit your tile).

Use even pressure and steady strokes to be sure you fill the joints completely. Squeegee off excess. [8] X Research source"

Your technique will depend upon how you want to proceed. If you need to seal your tile as well as your grout, do the tile first so you have no risk of staining the tile with the grout sealer. It isn't a stain so much as a difference in color as you have sealed the small portion around the joint before the rest of the tile and that might be hard to reverse. [10] X Research source"
