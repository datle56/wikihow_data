      "content": "Get a prescription for antibiotics. If you are diagnosed with walking pneumonia which is normally caused by bacteria, you will be prescribed an antibiotic.Your medical practitioner will prescribe an antibiotic which is loosely based on your medical history and presentation. You may also have to do a sputum culture test to identify the type of bacteria which is present in your lungs. This helps pick the right antibiotic. There are several antibiotics that are usually prescribed for the treatment of walking pneumonia. These antibiotics include 'macrolide antibiotics' - which are often prescribed for children and adults. Fluoroquinolones on the other hand are often given to adults and are usually not recommended for young children! Tetracyclines can be prescribed for adults and older children as well. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Consult your medical practitioner in order to find the best antibiotic for you. Early treatment of pneumonia and its subsequent treatment with an antibiotic can prevent life-threatening complications. Your doctor may suggest eating yogurt or taking probiotic supplements. This ensures healthy gut bacteria and biome while taking the antibiotics. Use a bronchodilator or inhaler. These usually considered useful for difficulty in breathing, a tight chest, or wheezing. This helps open up the alveoli of the lungs and facilitate oxygenation which rides off mucus containing bacteria."

Though it will not cure your infection. Take an aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin IB) and acetaminophen (Tylenol). [2] X Research source To help reduce secretions that harbor bacteria the lungs a mucolytic OTC product (such as Mucinex) can be helpful. Make sure you drink a glass of water along with your mucolytic medicine.

Talking to your doctor before you take your prescribed OTC medication for walking pneumonia is considered a good idea."

      "content": "Eat nutritious, easy to digest foods. Concentrate on maintaining a diet that includes a lot of soup. Ideally this could include Chicken soup or even chicken bouillon, and other small but nutritious meals throughout the day. [5] X Research source You shouldn't tire your body with big meals. On the other hand but you should support your immune system with nutrients so it can fight the virus. Try an egg and mushroom omelette for breakfast. Eggs are a great source of zinc and can boost your immune system. This is also easy to digest. Mushrooms contain glucans. Add a pinch of cayenne pepper to your omelette. This will help break down the mucus in your lungs and increase drainage. Yogurt with fruit for lunch or as a snack is a great idea. The active cultures in yogurt help improve your gut bacteria and the immune system too. Let your dinner incorporate foods that are high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Such foods include red peppers, oranges, berries, and leafy green vegetables. Including foods high in beta-carotenes and vitamin A are also good. Such foods include carrots, squash, and sweet potatoes. Go for the yellow or orange colored foods."
