      "content": "Make a baking soda soak in a sink or basin. Dissolve 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of baking soda into 2 litres (8.5 c) of warm water. Let this mixture sit for several minutes until the baking soda is dissolved. Do not place your garment into the soak until the baking soda is completely dissolved as it may stick to the fabric. The baking soda should help soften the fabric, making it easier to stretch. [1] X Research source Note that this soak will work better with natural fabrics like cotton and wool than with synthetic fabrics like polyester or rayon. Cotton fibers stretch slightly and are often mixed with synthetic fibers to make it stretch more easily. Cotton lacks memory, so it will take the shape it’s stretched into when worn."

      "content": "Dip the garment into the soak and remove excess moisture. Completely submerge the item of clothing you want to stretch in the baking soda soak. Pull it out of the water and gently squeeze out excess moisture. To avoid damage, do not wring it out. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Stretch the garment gently with your hands.",
      "content": "Stretch the garment gently with your hands. Gently pull the fabric of the garment in all directions to stretch it out. Be careful not to pull too hard, as this could damage the fabric. Stretch the entire garment evenly to avoid an asymmetrical shape. [3] X Research source Use rubber gloves to protect your hands from the baking soda if you have sensitive skin."

      "content": "Put the item back in the baking soda mixture and let it soak for 1 hour. Once you have stretched the item to the shape you desire, place it back into the baking soda soak. Make sure the item is completely submerged in the water. Let it sit for an hour, then pour out or drain away the water."

      "title": "Rinse the garment with a vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Rinse the garment with a vinegar solution. In a small bucket, mix 1 litre (4.2 c) of warm water with about 0.25 litres (1.1 c) of white vinegar. Pour this mixture over the clothing item. The combined effects of the baking soda and vinegar should help to soften and stretch the fabric. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Lay the garment out flat and let it air dry.",
      "content": "Lay the garment out flat and let it air dry. Because heat shrinks clothes, it’s important that you don’t put the garment in the dryer. Lay it flat and let it air dry to avoid fading. To speed up the process, turn on a fan. Mirjan says you can also “hang [the garment] to dry away from direct sunlight.” [5] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. Exposure to sunlight may cause the color to fade. Try to air dry the garment each time you wash it in the future so it doesn’t shrink back down."

      "content": "Prepare a gentle soak with warm water and conditioner or baby shampoo. Fill a sink or basin full of warm water. Add about 0.33 cups (78 ml) of baby shampoo or hair conditioner to the water. Swirl it with your hands to fully mix the soap with the water. [6] X Research source Note that this soak is intended for items made from knit fabrics like cotton, cashmere, or wool , which can be shrunk and unshrunk much more easily than synthetic fibers or silk. Alternatively, add a capful of a delicate detergent. Gorgis says, “I like to use lukewarm water and Tide Free & Gentle detergent because it is delicate on clothes.” [7] X Expert Source Rani Gorgis Laundry & Cleaning Specialist Expert Interview. 7 April 2021."

Leave it there for at least 10 minutes to relax the fabric’s fibers, though Mirjan recommends “25-30 minutes.” [8] X Expert Source Ayad Mirjan Dry Cleaner & Laundry Specialist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021. The item should be fully submerged under the water during this time. [9] X Research source If your clothing is made of a thick knit fabric, soak it for 20 minutes or more.

Gently squeeze the knit garment to remove as much wetness as possible, but do not rinse it. [11] X Research source Mirjan says to “make sure not to wring the garment,” as this may alter its shape.

      "content": "Lay the clothing out on top of a towel and roll it up to absorb moisture. Carefully remove your clothing item from the sink and position it flat on a large, clean towel. Starting at one end, gently roll up the towel with the garment inside. This motion will help the towel pull moisture away from the garment. [13] X Research source After doing this, the clothing item should be damp, but not wet."

Gently stretch the edges of the item by lightly tugging the fabric with your hands in the direction you want to stretch it. To prevent damage, avoid stretching the fabric in large, aggressive motions. [14] X Research source If you’re not sure how much to stretch the clothing, lay a similar garment that fits you well on a large piece of parchment paper and trace the outline. Then, lay the damp garment on the outline and stretch it so it fits the shape."

      "content": "Pin down the edges of the knit clothing with heavy objects. Once you have stretched the garment to the desired size, secure it by weighing it down. Place heavy items with smooth edges around the outline of the sweater or other garment to keep it in place. Such items could include paperweights, smooth stones, coffee mugs, or small hand weights. [15] X Research source Do not use anything with sharp or uneven edges to pin down the garment, as these items could rip or damage the fabric."

      "content": "Leave the garment in this position until it is dry. Do not remove the garment from the parchment paper until it dries completely. Depending on the garment, you may have to let it dry for a couple of hours, or overnight. If you remove it from its stretched out position when it is still damp, the fabric fibers are likely to contract as they dry. [16] X Research source Do not put the stretched item back in the dryer, as this will likely cause it to shrink back down."

If your jeans are too tight all-over, spray the entire surface of your jeans. Be sure to spray the jeans on both the front and the back. [18] X Research source The water will help to loosen the tightly-knit fibers, which will help the jeans stretch. A spray fabric softener can also work in place of water."

Focus on the tightest areas to add flexibility to the material. Do this repeatedly for several minutes to ensure that the fabric is reshaped. [19] X Research source Since jean fabric is tough and resilient, you do not need to worry about ripping it. Be careful to avoid any decorative touches that may be on your jeans, such as rhinestones or intentional rips in the fabric."

What is safe for one item may damage another. Check the garment’s care label to learn how to wash, dry, and iron your clothing to keep it from shrinking, bleeding, or becoming otherwise damaged.

When possible, allow your clothes to air dry by laying them flat or hanging them up . Otherwise, opt for the tumble dry setting on your dryer. If you need to dry them more quickly , check the garment’s care tag to see which temperature to use to avoid shrinkage. [23] X Research source If you don’t have time to let your clothes air dry completely, put them in the dryer but take them out while they’re still damp. Let them air dry the rest of the way."

      "title": "Clothes may shrink because of their fabric.",
      "content": "Clothes may shrink because of their fabric. Fabric type often determines how a garment retains its size. Clothing made of natural fibers (like cotton and linen) are prone to shrinkage because they absorb moisture quickly. Washing natural fabrics too vigorously can cause the fibers to tighten, which in turn shrinks the garment. Heat also causes many fabrics to shrink. [24] X Research source Synthetic fibers, like polyester, are usually more heat-resilient and won’t shrink."
