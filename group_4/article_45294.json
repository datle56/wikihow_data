      "title": "Find the right posture.",
      "content": "Find the right posture. Your fingers should curve over the keys with your wrists lightly resting on the desk. In other words, don't put too much pressure on your wrists. Sit up straight with your elbows bent at your sides (not resting on the desk). Correct posture helps you to be more accurate, but it also helps lessen the strain on your arms, hands, and shoulders over time. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn or relearn the finger positions.",
      "content": "Learn or relearn the finger positions. When at rest, your four fingers on each hand rest on certain keys, called the home row or base position. Your left-hand fingers should rest on the keys A, S, D, and F, starting with the pinky on the A, while your right-hand fingers should rest on J, K, L, and ;, starting with your pointer finger on the J. [2] X Research source By keeping your fingers on these home keys when you are resting, you always know where all the letters are. Additionally, it is easy to reach most of the letters on the keyboard from this position. If you already type using all your fingers, make sure you're always landing on the right keys. If you aren't, practice returning to this position. Most keyboards have a little raised bump on the \"F\" and \"J\" keys to help you return your fingers to the correct position without glancing down."

      "title": "Know which finger types which letter.",
      "content": "Know which finger types which letter. Basically, each finger types the diagonal that slants down to the right. For instance, the pinky on the left-hand types the letters and numbers 1, Q, A, and Z, while the ring finger types 2, W, S, and X. Both pointer fingers also type the adjoining row in addition to their own row. For example, the right pointer finger types 7, U, J, and M, as well as 6, Y, H, and N. [3] X Research source Although this is the \"proper\" technique for touch-based typing, you might be more comfortable not using your pinky and instead using more of a custom positioning, which is one key to the left.

      "content": "Use your pinky to hit the \"Shift\" key. Usually, you use the pinky on the opposite hand of the letter you are typing. You also use your pinky to hit keys like the \"Tab\" key, the \"Caps Lock, \" and the \"CTRL\" key on the left side, as well as most of the punctuation keys, the \"Backspace\" key, and the arrow keys.

Once you become more proficient, do it without looking. It may take you longer, but it will help you learn how to type better in the long run. Always be sure to check your email for mistakes after practicing your technique. You are going to make mistakes as you learn, but you can quickly fix them before sending it off."
