If the person you're trying to collaborate with is not using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer, you won't be able to share a Note with them. This is because Notes collaboration happens through the Notes app, which is an Apple-specific system app. If you need to share and collaborate notes with a non-Apple user, consider using a different app instead. Google Keep is a popular option that is available on Apple devices, Android devices, and on the web."
