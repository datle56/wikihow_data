      "title": "Get there 30 minutes early.",
      "content": "Get there 30 minutes early. In order to win, you need to hear every single number that gets called. Arrive 30 minutes before the game is set to begin. This will give you time to purchase cards, visit with friends, get something to drink, set up your station, and get your head in the game before it begins. [1] X Research source When playing online bingo, make sure you have everything you need (something to drink, your phone, etc.) before you start a game."

      "content": "Bring a bingo dabber and masking tape. You can set yourself up for success by bringing the right supplies with you. A bingo dabber enables you to quickly mark the numbers on your cards that have been called. Masking tape can help you keep your game pieces secured to your table (so you don’t waste time adjusting them). [2] X Research source You may also want to bring some good luck charms . Many bingo halls sell dabbers, so you might be OK if you forget one."

      "title": "Choose your seat carefully.",
      "content": "Choose your seat carefully. Where you sit can have a major effect on how well you play. The key is to avoid distractions. If you are serious about winning, you may not want to sit near friends, or other rambunctious people. [3] X Research source You may want to sit close to the caller. This helps to keep you focused, and helps make sure you don’t miss any numbers being called."

    {
      "title": "Stay alert.",
      "content": "Stay alert. Whether you are playing in-person or online, missing even one number being called can make the difference between winning and losing, so the number 1 way to win at bingo is to stay alert! [4] X Research source Strategies for staying focused and aware can vary from person to person, but here are some tips: Avoid drinking alcohol. Consider drinking coffee or tea instead. Don’t go to bingo on a day when you’re especially tired. Take advantage of scheduled breaks."

    {
      "title": "Play games with lower attendance.",
      "content": "Play games with lower attendance. Every game of bingo has just one winner. Fewer players means that each player has a greater chance of winning. Try attending bingo games on weeknights when the crowds tend to be smaller. [5] X Research source This applies to online bingo too! Some bingo prize pots are based off the number of cards purchased, so although a small group of players increases your chances of winning, it may mean a smaller prize."

      "title": "Figure out how many cards you can handle.",
      "content": "Figure out how many cards you can handle. The more cards (or in some cases, cards) you have, the better your chances are of winning. This is true for in-person bingo, as well as online. However, this only holds up if you are able to truly check the numbers on all of your cards effectively. Start with no more than 4 cards. If you feel you’ve gotten the hang of 4 cards, try adding 1 card at a time. [6] X Research source In a game with 20 players where everyone has 1 card, every player has a 5% chance of winning. In a game with 20 players where everyone has 1 card, but you have 4 cards, your chances of winning are 17%."

      "title": "Consider buying fewer cards, but playing more games.",
      "content": "Consider buying fewer cards, but playing more games. According to concepts of mathematical probability, there should be a uniform pattern in the way the balls are drawn. This means that the longer you stay in the game, the higher the likelihood becomes that your balls will be drawn. If you are working with a set budget, it might be a better strategy for you to play fewer cards in more games. [7] X Research source This strategy only works in the classic “wheel-of-balls” version of the game."

      "content": "Mark your cards with highlighter for special pattern games. In most bingo games, there are five ways to win: five in a row, blackout, X, and 4 corners. However, many bingo halls also have “special pattern” games to keep things interesting. For these special pattern games, mark your cards with a highlighter to help you remember which squares can win.

      "title": "Choose cards with median numbers.",
      "content": "Choose cards with median numbers. The Tippett theory suggests that more numbers that are called in a wheel-of-balls bingo game, the more those numbers will gravitate towards the middle. If you can, look for bingo cards with more numbers toward the median. [9] X Research source In a game that goes from 1-99, the median would be 45. The Tippett theory has never been proven. This theory was designed in terms of the classic \"wheel-of-balls\" version of the game, but many online bingo players use it as well."

      "title": "Select cards that don’t have a lot of numbers in common.",
      "content": "Select cards that don’t have a lot of numbers in common. This way, you can cover a wider range of numbers. If you are playing multiple cards at once, this should increase your odds of winning."
