If you don’t want to cut this person out of your life completely, at least make a firm decision to take a break from them until you start feeling better. [1] X Research source Stop following them on social media and stop replying to their texts and calls. If you run into them in person, keep your interaction short and sweet. They may want to return to a normal friendship (and perhaps you'll be on the same page one day) but just let them know you're not ready for that yet."

      "content": "Give yourself time and space to deal with your emotions . It’s normal to feel sadness, anger, and self-doubt after being rejected. Repressing those feelings isn’t good for you, though, so give yourself a chance to deal with them properly. That way, you can put them behind you and move forward. Give yourself permission to cry, yell, or just spend some time alone. [2] X Research source Try journaling to explore and understand your feelings.

      "content": "Put an end to negative self-talk. The way you talk to yourself can affect you deeply. Whenever you notice a negative thought pop into your mind, immediately counter it with a positive one. Try to think of your inner critic as separate from yourself. To take the critic's power away, talk back! Over time, this trains your brain to look at things in a more positive way. [4] X Research source If you find yourself thinking, \"I'm just not likable enough,\" challenge that with something positive like, \"Hold up, my friends and coworkers adore me! My personality is not the problem.\" If you catch yourself thinking, \"I'm just not attractive enough,\" counter that with something like, \"When I look in the mirror, I like the person I see.\" If you find yourself thinking, \"No one will ever want to date me,\" challenge your inner critic with: \"Actually, only one person rejected me. There are 7 billion people on this planet. Of course someone will want to date me!\""

You'll come out on the other side of this situation feeling stronger, wiser, and better equipped to take meaningful risks. [7] X Research source Try asking yourself questions like: What did I learn about myself through this experience? Did I react in unexpected ways to the rejection? If so, why?

You're much more interesting and complex than that; you have so much to offer. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that rejection creates new opportunities, too.
