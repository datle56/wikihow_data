      "title": "Gather everything you need.",
      "content": "Gather everything you need. Before you head out into the sun, grab everything you need for a study session of decent length. You don't want to have to head back inside because you forgot something. If you'll be reading, it's a good idea to load several e-books onto the same device. This makes your homework more portable, and ensures you don't run out of things to do. Bring a snack and a water bottle. Hunger and thirst can be distracting and will eventually send you off in search of sustenance."

      "title": "Choose a good location.",
      "content": "Choose a good location. Choose a place to study where you feel safe and comfortable. There are lots of good places to study outdoors, each of which can have advantages and drawbacks. A park or common area of your school can be a great choice because it's free. The downsides here are that there can sometimes be too much activity going on around you, and you often end up sitting on the ground, which can get uncomfortable after a while. A cafe with outdoor seating is a good option because you get to work at a table, and if you start to get hungry or thirsty, you can order something to eat. The downside here is that you usually MUST order something, so this option costs a bit more. Some cafes also won't want you to stay for a long time unless you keep ordering things. Your own backyard, patio, deck, or balcony can be a good choice because you have more control over your environment than in a public place. However, if you're looking to get out of your house or make this a social experience, working just outside your own back door may not satisfy those wishes."

      "title": "Find a spot that's comfortable.",
      "content": "Find a spot that's comfortable. Bring a blanket to sit on and spread your study materials out, if you want. Make sure you support your back so you aren’t in pain or stiff after your study session. You can even bring a lawn chair or a cushion to sit on. Sitting on the ground can get uncomfortable after a while, and that can make it hard to focus on your studies. So, make sure you find a spot where that won't be a problem. [2] X Research source Don't get too comfortable, however, or you may fall asleep. You may not want to stretch out on your back with a blanket and pillow."

      "title": "Consider the lighting.",
      "content": "Consider the lighting. Natural light can be great for studying. It can help you stay focused and calm, and can even decrease the likelihood of headaches. [3] X Research source This is a real perk of outdoor studying. Pick a place where you'll get plenty of light, but where you won't be blinded. The sun on the white paper of your textbook pages can be a bit much, and can also make screens hard to read. Pick a spot that works for you, and bring your sunglasses! If you are going to study in direct sunlight, make sure to put on some sunscreen first. Partial shade is often your best option."

      "content": "Avoid obvious distractions. While studying outside can help you avoid certain distractions you might find indoors (like your video game system or a pile of dirty dishes), it can come with its own set of distracting problems. In choosing a spot, try to avoid any obvious distractions. The park can be a great place to study, but setting up right next to a playground full of screaming children or an off-leash dog area can it make a lot harder to keep your focus."

      "content": "Bring music. If you are someone who can study with music on, bring some noise-canceling headphones. [4] X Expert Source Josh Jones Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 15 November 2019. Music can help many people tune out distracting sounds in their environment, and there can be a lot of these outside. Some people can study just fine in noisy environments, but for others, the sound of a barking dog or people talking as they pass by can really hinder their study efforts. [5] X Research source Music can help you block these sounds out. Music that you've heard before and that isn't too loud is often easier to tune out than noises in your environment. [6] X Research source Listen to music without lyrics if you need to read so you won’t be distracted. If the situation allows, bring speakers to use instead of headphones. Some research shows that listening to music on headphones can make it harder to retain information. Studying with some light distraction in the background can help you get used to the noise of taking an exam in class with other students.

      "content": "Disconnect from technology. Unless you need the internet for the work you're doing, consider disconnecting from the internet while you study.If you have your laptop with you, switch it to airplane mode. If you get a lot of text messages or calls, you may wish to consider putting your phone in silent mode or even just turning it off for a little while to minimize distractions. Keep your phone in a backpack or away from you to avoid temptation. Many people find it easier to go without technology when working outdoors. In your bedroom, it's easy to fall into the routine of checking Facebook \"just for a few minutes,\" but you probably do this less when you are in outdoor settings. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Vary your tasks.",
      "content": "Vary your tasks. If you can, try doing several different types of study activities while studying outdoors. Variety can help you stay focused. [9] X Research source Read a chapter of a novel for English class, then switch to some math problems or go through some foreign language flashcards. Changing things up keeps it interesting and makes it less likely that you'll be distracted by what's going on around you."

      "title": "Make it a social activity.",
      "content": "Make it a social activity. One great thing about studying outside is that it feels more like a social experience than studying alone in your room. Bring a friend or study group with you, and you'll finish up feeling like you've had some social time even if you don't talk much. [10] X Research source Just being out with other people can produce this feeling of social connection, even if you don't bring anyone with you."

This is easier to do outside than in your house because there are usually a lot more locations to choose from!

      "title": "Take breaks.",
      "content": "Take breaks. As with studying inside, you'll focus better and get more out of studying outside if you take breaks. Since you're outside, make the most of these breaks by getting a little exercise. [13] X Research source Take a short walk or throw a Frisbee around for a few minutes instead of logging on to social media. You'll feel invigorated by some exercise, and that can give you renewed focus when you return to your studies."
