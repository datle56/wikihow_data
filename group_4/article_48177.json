      "content": "A good ping is about 30 ms or lower. Hardcore players will tell you that you should shoot for 10 ms or lower if you want buttery smooth gameplay and zero lag (though 0 is physically impossible). [1] X Research source More realistically, though, a ping of about 30-60 ms will serve you just fine in most games, especially those that don’t require split-second reactions. That said, different types of games demand different latencies: Real-time strategy, online shooters, and racing games: We recommend aiming for 10ms. This is where you want as low a ping as possible, since every moment counts. Many are still playable at 60 ms or lower, though. MMOs: You’ll do just fine with 30-60 ms when playing most massively multiplayer games, since these rarely demand twitchy reactions. Turn-based games: Here, ping doesn’t matter as much, since players aren’t playing simultaneously. You could easily get away with anything below 150ms, or sometimes higher."

      "content": "Ping is a measurement of your internet’s latency. “Latency” is another word for computing delay. Ping (indicated in milliseconds) is a measure of the time it takes for your control inputs to travel to a server and back to your computer, where the input is then displayed on screen. [2] X Research source A high ping means more delay, or lag, and a low ping means less delay, which is desirable. Think of ping like an echo. You shout, and your ping is the time it takes for your voice to come back to you. In this case, though, you’re pressing buttons and waiting for them to register on screen. The word “ping” comes from WWII, and was a term used for radar readings—after a noise a radar makes. Like your internet while gaming, radar sends signals out and waits for them to come back."

      "content": "Keep in mind that ping varies from game to game. Most online games use their own servers to connect players, so doing a general internet speed test isn’t always an accurate indicator of your ping in any given game. That said, if your speed test shows that you have a strong and fast connection, it’s a clue that high ping may be related to the game itself, and not your system or internet. Many games will tell you your in-game ping, though you may have to enable this in the settings or network menus. Play a casual game at first to test your connection, before diving into a more competitive game or game mode."

If that’s not possible, IT expert Luigi Oppido says to check which internet band you’re connected to: 2.4 gigahertz connections are stronger but travel shorter distances through your home, while 5 gigahertz is weaker but can reach consoles and computers that are farther away."

But if your game has to stop at the firewall while it communicates with the game server, your ping may become high. Turn off your firewall while you play, or at least turn it off for that specific game. [9] X Research source"

When you’re gaming online, it’s always a good idea to close out of any apps you’re not using—across every device on your network. [10] X Research source These apps can run internet processes when you’re not looking, taking up bandwidth and increasing your ping. Also, stop any downloads. Downloads can slow an already weak connection to a crawl, making it impossible to play online games."
