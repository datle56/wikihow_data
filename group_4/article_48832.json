      "content": "Replace empty ink and toner cartridges. If your printer says the ink levels are low or empty, open the printer to remove the old cartridges. Use cartridges made by or compatible with your printer brand. The ink and toner locations and how to remove them depend on your printer model, so check your owner’s manual for specific instructions. Most cartridges have a tab or locking mechanism that you have to push in before you can pull them out. Check the ink or toner cartridge for a small plastic strip along the edge. Remove the strip before installing so ink can come out from the cartridge."

Usually, printers tell you when the ink is low or empty on the display screen, but you can also find the ink levels in your printer settings on your device. [2] X Research source To check ink levels on Windows , type “Scanners and Printers” into the Start menu, and click on your printer. To see ink levels on a Mac, open System Settings, select “Printers and Scanners,” select your printer, and then choose “Options and supplies.” If you’re printing from your phone, most printers have a dedicated app that allows you to connect with your device and check ink levels."

Ink and toner cartridges fit snugly into a slot inside your printer, but they can become misaligned if they’re not installed properly. When the cartridges are loose, they don’t connect to the printhead, and blank pages may print out instead.

      "content": "The printhead is clogged. If your printer has ink but prints blank pages, the printhead is usually the culprit. Over time, the ink can build up and dry inside the printhead. Blain Gunter, a computer repair specialist, states that printheads can dry out if you don’t use them for a long time, which can cause the printer to not work properly. If the last few documents you printed were blurry or looked faded, it may also be a sign that the printhead has clogged."

If you’re frequently printing documents, just keep your printer powered on and in standby mode so it continues to work properly.
