You might say, “Your home was cozy—the perfect place to recharge after a long day of sightseeing!” Claytor adds, “Of course, you can add additional information such as ‘I enjoyed speaking with you’...and a compliment to the person you're sending the thank you card to, like ‘You’re a lovely person’ or ‘You’re easy to talk to.” For a sign off, Claytor says “In business, you say ‘Regards,’ ‘Best regards,’ or ‘Warm regards,” while for personal notes you can say something like “With love.”"
