In some situations, such as in letters or other formal writing, the date is preceded by the article der , which means \"the,\" or am , meaning \"on\" or \"on the.\" [2] X Research source For example, if you wanted to talk about an event that happened on January 22, 2019, you would write der 22.01.2019 to mean \"the 22nd of January 2019,\" or am 22.01.2019 to mean \"on the 22 of January 2019.\""

Germany uses the Gregorian calendar, with 12 months from January through December. [3] X Research source For example, if you saw 01.04.2019 in German, this date is April 1st, 2019 – not January 4th."

      "title": "Separate the parts of the date with periods.",
      "content": "Separate the parts of the date with periods. Use a period or full-stop after the numeral representing the day and the month. Do not include a space after the period. There's no need for a period after the year unless the date happens to fall at the end of a sentence. [4] X Research source For example, if you wanted to write the date January 12, 2019 numerically in German, you would write \"12.01.2019\"."

Usually, you would do this on an invitation to an event or a notification of a meeting. The name of the day of the week is followed by a comma. [5] X Research source For example, you might write \"Dienstag, 22. Januar 2019.\" (Tuesday, 22nd January 2019). In German, the days of the week are Montag (Monday), Dienstag (Tuesday), Mittwoch (Wednesday), Donnerstag (Thursday), Freitag (Friday), Samstag (Saturday), and Sonntag (Sunday).

      "content": "Write the number of the day followed by a period. The period (or full-stop) after the numeral indicating the day of the month signals that the number is an ordinal. Unlike when writing the date using only numbers, there is a space after the period and before the name of the month. [7] X Research source For example, you would write \"July 4, 2019\" as der 4. Juli 2019."

Type a space, then close your date with the numerals of the year. There's no punctuation between the month and the year. [8] X Research source For example, you would write \"December 24, 2019\" as der 24. Dezember 2019 . The months of the year in German are: Januar (January), Februar (February), März (March), April (April), Mai (May), Juni (June), Juli (July), August (August), September (September), Oktober (October), November (November), and Dezember (December). They're fairly easy to recognize and remember if you already know the months of the year in English."

The ending of the ordinal changes if you say the date along with a preposition, such as am , or an article, such as der . [10] X Research source If there is no article or preposition, the ordinal ends in -er . For example, you would say fünfter Oktober zweitausendelf to mean \"5th October 2011.\" If you happen to use an indefinite article, such as ein (meaning \"a\" or \"an\"), you would also end the ordinal with -er. When using a definite article, such as der , the ordinal ends in -e . For example, you would say der fünfte Oktober zweitausendelf to mean \"the 5th [of] Oktober 2011.\" If a preposition precedes the date, the ordinal ends in -en .

Prior to that year, numbers are read as hundreds. For the year 2000 and beyond, read the number as it appears. [12] X Research source For example, you would read the year 1813 as achtzehnhundertdreizehn , meaning \"18 hundred 13.\" However, the year 2010 is read zweitausendzehn , or \"2 thousand 10.\""
