      "content": "Use SMB as shorthand for “somebody” over text or on TikTok. Send SMB as a casual abbreviation for anyone, or to describe someone specific that you don’t want to name directly (like if they'd rather not be mentioned or if you're feuding with them). [1] X Research source Using SMB to mean “somebody” is most common among young people, but people of all ages can use the term. It’s mainly used online on apps like TikTok, but shows up over text and other sites, too. For example: “Smb tell me what they thought of this movie. Is it worth seeing?” “It’s crazy when smb you thought was cool does you wrong 🙄” [2] X Research source SMB was first used in place of \"somebody\" on TikTok in 2020, but became more common in 2023 as more young people started to use it."

      "content": "In business, SMB refers to businesses with 25 to 500 employees. If you see SMB in a company presentation, it’s safe to assume the presenter is referring to a small-to-midsize business. In the professional world, an SMB usually has an annual revenue of less than $50 million, and some larger SMBs can reach up to 5,000 employees. They’re considered the backbone of the economy, as most businesses across the world are SMBs that promote innovation. [5] X Research source Some SMBs make more than $50 million, but less than $1 billion. There is no agreed-upon definition of a small-to-midsize business, but they usually fall into these ranges. SMBs often struggle with building capital, maintaining talent, and accessing resources, but they combat these struggles with tight budgets, strong hiring incentives and federal government assistance."

      "content": "Use “smb” to apologize for something minor over text or online. Using SMB in place of “Sorry, my bad” isn’t as common as other slang meanings, but it is still somewhat common among TikTok users. If a friend texts you saying that something you did upset them, for example, say “smb” to apologize. Follow it up by explaining your actions so that your apology is more genuine. Keep in mind that a quick apology over text works for minor or mostly unimportant things. If you're in a serious argument, a phone call or in-person chat is best. Them: “Are you running late again?” You: “Smb, I got held up by a work meeting. Be there soon!” Them: “Ugh you ate all the chips!” You: “Smb I was so hungry when I got home 😭”"

      "content": "A surface marker buoy (SMB) is a piece of scuba diving equipment. The buoy is used by divers to mark where they're diving on the surface of the water. A diver will inflate the brightly colored, inflatable tube to signal their location or let others know they're in distress. This makes it easier for people and boat traffic to know where their whereabouts quickly. [6] X Research source If you’re taking a scuba diving class and they mention SMBs, they’re talking about surface marker buoys, which are crucial for diver safety."
