      "content": "They do just enough to keep you around. In a relationship, the “bare minimum” is one step above absolutely nothing. When someone’s just doing the bare minimum, you don’t necessarily notice that anything’s wrong, but there’s not a lot to brag about, either. You might feel okay in the relationship, but you just wish your partner would do a little bit more to make you feel special. [1] X Research source Your partner probably won’t cheat on you or make you feel bad—but it’s important to ask yourself if they actually make you feel good."

      "title": "They’re not emotionally invested in the relationship.",
      "content": "They’re not emotionally invested in the relationship. Do you feel like you’re doing all the emotional heavy lifting? All the bonding and deep conversations come from your end, while your partner is totally cool with keeping things surface-level. While it’s possible that they’re just not comfortable opening up to you yet, there’s also a chance that they’re keeping you at arm’s length on purpose.

      "content": "There’s no romance or passion in your relationship. Does your partner take you out on dates? Do they plan romantic evenings for you two to spend one-on-one time together? If the answer is no and no, it’s likely that they are just doing the bare minimum to keep you around. [3] X Research source If you’ve brought this up before, you might notice that your partner changes their ways for a little while, but then eventually returns to their old habits."

      "title": "You feel like you have to beg for love or affection.",
      "content": "You feel like you have to beg for love or affection. In a healthy relationship, you should never feel like you’re begging for anything. Love, affection, and support should come naturally. If your partner makes you feel bad for asking that your emotional needs are met, it’s a sign that they don’t want to put in the effort to make this relationship work. For instance, maybe you tell your partner that for your birthday, you’d really like a bouquet of flowers. When your birthday comes around, they’ll say that they “forgot” or didn’t get to it in time."

      "title": "Healthy communication",
      "content": "Healthy communication The foundation to building a healthy relationship is always open and honest communication. Make sure that you and your partner are on the same page, and you two can talk to each other about anything and everything. Good communication ensures that you’ll have fewer disagreements and misunderstandings. Try not to assume what your partner means when they tell you things. If you aren’t 100% clear on what’s being said or asked of you, clarify it with your partner. Say something like, “So I’m hearing you say…” or, “Could you explain what you meant by that?”"

      "content": "Exclusivity If you two are in a monogamous relationship, the bare minimum is staying faithful to each other. Be sure to define the relationship so you’re both on the same page, then stay exclusive to each other. If you two are just casually dating, it’s even more important to talk about what that means for both of you. Does “casual” mean that it’s okay to date other people, or is it a monogamous relationship without the labels?"

      "title": "Mutual respect",
      "content": "Mutual respect Respect means that you both value each other and won’t cross each other’s boundaries. It also means that you take your partner’s feelings and wishes into account when you make decisions. [4] X Research source For instance, an example of disrespect in a relationship might be flirting with other people. Even though you’re “technically” not cheating, it’s still not very respectful to flirt with others while in a relationship."

Trust is another pillar in a healthy relationship, and it’s important to trust your partner so you can give them the benefit of the doubt. [5] X Research source If you and your partner don’t have a solid foundation of trust in the relationship, consider going to couple’s counseling. Trust can be hard to re-establish once it’s gone, and a professional can help."

You shouldn’t be expected to hang out with your partner 24/7, so make sure you both get alone time as well. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A partner who wants to hang out with you all the time is showing controlling behavior, which can lead to abusive tendencies down the line."

      "content": "Clear boundaries Talk about your boundaries with each other so you’re both on the same page. These could be about the relationship (no flirting with other people, no getting numbers from others), sex (which sex acts are on or off the table), or even how you two fight (no name-calling or yelling). Try to respect your partner’s boundaries, and make sure they respect yours as well. [7] X Trustworthy Source New York State Government Official website for the State of New York Go to source"

Talk to your partner about what a good sex life looks like for the both of you, then do your best to make yourself and your partner happy. It’s important to talk about the frequency of sex throughout the week, too. People’s libidos are different, and you may have to compromise with your partner about how often you two have sex."

It really makes me feel good when you take me out, and it makes me happy to see that you put thought into an outing.” “Hey, could we talk?
