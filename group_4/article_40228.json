      "title": "Determine why you want or need to speak.",
      "content": "Determine why you want or need to speak. You may have to give a speech or presentation for school or work, or you may be invited to speak on a subject you are an expert in or are passionate about. Keep the reason for your speaking engagement in mind as you prepare so that your focus remains on what you want to teach the audience or what you hope to accomplish with your speech. [1] X Research source If you have to speak in front of a group as a school assignment, carefully review the rubric and guidelines to ensure that your speech meets all of the requirements."

      "title": "Learn about your audience so you can tailor your speech to their interests.",
      "content": "Learn about your audience so you can tailor your speech to their interests. In order to keep the audience engaged, it’s important to cater your speech to them. Whenever possible, find out the ages, backgrounds, and education levels of the audience members. Think about their beliefs and values as well as their attitude toward the topic you’re speaking about so that you can tailor your speech toward these specific people to make it more effective. [2] X Research source Talk to various audience members beforehand to get an idea of what’s important to them and why they’re attending your speaking engagement. For instance, giving a speech to a group of middle schoolers may require simpler language and more humor, while speaking in front of a military audience might require more decorum."

    {
      "title": "Keep your goal in mind as you craft your speech.",
      "content": "Keep your goal in mind as you craft your speech . Depending on the circumstances, you may need to research your topic before you begin writing. Then, create an outline that covers all the main points you want to convey. Include facts and a few statistics as well as personal anecdotes and even a joke or two if you think they would be received well. Write out your entire speech on notecards so you can rehearse it. [3] X Research source Remember why you're speaking about this topic and make sure all parts of your speech focus on your overall goal or call to action. A really engaging opening, or hook, is key. Share a story, statistic, or fact that will grab your audience’s attention and make them want to learn more. Present your main points in a logical order so the audience can follow your argument. Use transitions to guide your listeners to the next idea. End your speech with a provocative anecdote, fact, or call to action so that your audience continues to mull over what you said even after your speaking engagement is over."

    {
      "title": "Stick to the time limit, if applicable.",
      "content": "Stick to the time limit, if applicable. If your speaking engagement is a timed event, make sure your speech is within the limits. Practice your speech at a few different speaking speeds and time each delivery so you know if you need to cut anything. In most cases, shorter is better! [4] X Research source Generally, a 5-minute speech contains around 750 words while a 20-minute speech might have between 2,500 and 3,000 words."

    {
      "title": "Practice until you don’t need your notes.",
      "content": "Practice until you don’t need your notes. The key to speaking in front of large groups of people is to be prepared. While you can start practicing by reading what you’ve written down, the goal is to memorize your speech, or at least the key points, so you don’t have to rely on your notes when you speak in front of the audience. [5] X Research source Don’t always rehearse from the beginning of your speech. Try starting at various places so you memorize each point independent of one another. That way, if you get sidetracked or lose your place, you’ll be familiar with picking up your speech in the middle. You can practice your speech in front of a mirror, in the car, or while you’re gardening, shooting hoops, cleaning, shopping, or doing nearly anything else. This can help you memorize it better and give you ample time to rehearse."

      "title": "Prepare visual aids if desired or necessary.",
      "content": "Prepare visual aids if desired or necessary. Visual aids can be very helpful for reducing nervousness. They give you, and the audience, something else to focus on. If it’s appropriate for the topic or event, feel free to create a slideshow, bring props, present posters, or otherwise share a visual aid that will help demonstrate your main points. [6] X Research source Be sure to create a contingency plan in case your technology fails! Be prepared to give your speech without the visual components, if necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use visual aids.",
      "content": "Use visual aids. Visual aids are your friends. Even if what you’re discussing doesn’t necessitate aids, bring in something to display beside or behind you. When people are given something other than you to look at up there, you’ll feel more comfortable. However, don't look up at them yourself—keep an eye on your laptop or memorize what's on them so the presented information appears like a seamless extension of your brain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat yourself.",
      "content": "Repeat yourself. Repeating key phrases once or twice is a great way to reinforce important points, and repeating audience questions will not only give you an extra minute to come up with a good response, but also ensure everyone else hears it, and gives the effect that you’re especially engaged."
    },
    {
      "title": "Admit you’re nervous.",
      "content": "Admit you’re nervous. Don’t be afraid to freak out. Try clenching your fists, breathing deeply, and standing confidently to help curb your nervous energy and anxiety beforehand; doing so will subconsciously calm you down. It’s also not a bad idea to admit to the crowd up front that you’re nervous; it invites empathy and can make you feel more comfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Redefine your audience.",
      "content": "Redefine your audience. Don’t imagine everyone in front of you is naked or that they’re all just friendly pigs, because that’s absurd. Instead, change how you see them in a more meaningful way: maybe they’re fellow students who are all equally nervous because they’ll be presenting after you, or they’re a bunch of old friends whose vaguely familiar faces are watching you with nothing but support."

    {
      "title": "Visit the venue ahead of time.",
      "content": "Visit the venue ahead of time. If you’ve never been to the place where you’re going to speak, wondering what it will be like can ramp up your nervousness. Scope it out beforehand so you’re familiar with the location and can find your way to the restrooms, exits, and so on. [7] X Research source This also allows you to plan your route ahead of time so you know how long it will take you to get to the venue on the day of the event."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take care with your appearance.",
      "content": "Take care with your appearance. Looking good can make you feel good, so spend some time grooming yourself before your speaking engagement. Choose an outfit that flatters your body while still being appropriate for the event. Get a haircut or a manicure if you need a little boost of self-confidence. [8] X Research source In most cases, well-fitting slacks and a button-down shirt are appropriate for speaking engagements. Alternatively, you could wear a suit and tie or a pencil skirt and a blazer. Ensure your clothes are clean and free of wrinkles."

    {
      "title": "Acknowledge your fear so you can overcome it.",
      "content": "Acknowledge your fear so you can overcome it. There’s no shame in being afraid of public speaking. Admit to yourself that you’re scared and acknowledge how you’re feeling. You can think, “My heart is racing, my mind is blank, and I have butterflies in my stomach.” Then, tell yourself that this is normal and the adrenaline that’s causing these symptoms indicates that you care about doing well. [9] X Research source Turn that adrenaline into passion to help you demonstrate to your audience why what you have to say is important. Visualizing yourself delivering a successful speech can actually help you perform better, so spend a few minutes imagining things going well."

    {
      "title": "Release your jitters before you go on stage.",
      "content": "Release your jitters before you go on stage. Adrenaline can make you feel jumpy and energetic. Before you deliver your speech, do a few jumping jacks, shake out your hands, or dance to your favorite song. You’ll feel calmer and more in control when you face the audience. [10] X Research source You may even want to exercise the morning of your speech to help diffuse your nervousness and excess energy."

    {
      "title": "Take deep breaths to steady your nerves.",
      "content": "Take deep breaths to steady your nerves. You may have heard it a million times, but it’s true: deep, controlled breathing can actually help you calm down. Inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 4, then exhale for a count of 4. Repeat until you feel your pulse slowing and you feel more in control. [11] X Research source Avoid taking quick, shallow breaths, as this can lead to hyperventilation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Face the audience.",
      "content": "Face the audience. Though it can be tempting to turn away from the people staring at you, facing the audience and speaking directly to them makes you appear more confident. Stand up straight and square your shoulders. You can do this! [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Act like you’re talking to your friends.",
      "content": "Act like you’re talking to your friends. Thinking about all the people in the audience and their possible reactions can make you even more nervous. Instead, pretend that you’re talking to people you know and trust. This can help calm your nerves and give you more confidence. [13] X Research source While it's commonly suggested to picture the audience in their underwear, this may make you even more nervous or uncomfortable. However, if you think it'll help you feel less anxious or intimidated, by all means, go ahead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Speak at a normal speed.",
      "content": "Speak at a normal speed. Many people rush through their speech when they’re nervous or want to get it over with. However, speaking quickly will make it more difficult for the audience to follow what you’re saying. On the other hand, you don’t want to speak so slowly that the audience loses interest or thinks you’re talking down to them. Speak at the same rate you would when having a normal conversation with someone. [14] X Research source If you want to get really technical, aim to speak 190 words per minute when delivering a speech."
    },
    {
      "title": "Project your voice and speak clearly so everyone can hear you.",
      "content": "Project your voice and speak clearly so everyone can hear you. When you're speaking to a large group of people, it's essential to make sure everyone in the audience can understand what you're saying. Speak loudly, articulate your words clearly, and use an authoritative tone. Use a microphone, if you're provided with one. If not, aim to speak louder than you would in a normal conversation, but refrain from shouting. [15] X Research source Say a few tongue-twisters before your speech to warm up. For instance, repeat \"Sally sells seashells by the seashore\" or \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\""

    {
      "title": "Make eye contact with people in the crowd.",
      "content": "Make eye contact with people in the crowd. If you have friends or family members in the audience, look at them. An encouraging nod or smile can reassure you and give you a boost of confidence. If you don’t know anyone, pick a few people in the audience and make eye contact periodically. This can help the audience feel more connected to you while you’re speaking to them. [16] X Research source If you're too scared to make eye contact, look at a point just above the audience member's heads. Avoid looking up at the ceiling or down at the floor, though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be expressive while you're speaking.",
      "content": "Be expressive while you're speaking. Avoid speaking in a monotone while standing stock still. In normal conversations, people move around a little bit, gesture with their hands, and show how they’re feeling with their facial expressions. You should do the same when you’re speaking in front of people! Display enthusiasm and show people why the topic is important to you with your body language and inflections. [17] X Research source Show emotion to help the audience relate to you. Just avoid going overboard or getting so worked up that you can’t carry on. Aim to find a balance between professional and passionate."

    {
      "title": "Pause when you need to.",
      "content": "Pause when you need to. Silence, especially when it’s purposeful, is not a bad thing. Don’t feel as though you need to speaking every single second. If you get nervous or lose your place, pause for a few seconds so you can gather your thoughts. Also, if you make an important or provocative point, pause to allow the audience to absorb what you’ve just said.

      "title": "Move on if you make a mistake.",
      "content": "Move on if you make a mistake. Fumbling your words or skipping a key point can be super scary. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and it probably seems like a much bigger deal to you than to the audience. Rather than freezing up or running off stage, take a breath and continue speaking. Don’t focus on your mistake—focus on getting the audience to understand your message, instead. [19] X Research source No one is perfect, so you shouldn’t expect your speech to be perfect, either! Just be yourself."
