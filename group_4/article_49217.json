    {
      "title": "Use a pen or pencil that doesn’t require you to press down hard.",
      "content": "Use a pen or pencil that doesn’t require you to press down hard. If you have to press down hard as you write, your hand will get fatigued faster. Find a pen that isn’t so thin that it’s hard to grip, but that isn’t so thick that writing is uncomfortable. [1] X Research source A mechanical pencil requires less force to write with than a traditional pencil. You can purchase a pencil or pen grip to make your writing tool thicker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the pen or pencil in a way that’s comfortable for you.",
      "content": "Hold the pen or pencil in a way that’s comfortable for you. The way that you grip your pencil doesn’t have as much of an impact on your writing speed as your comfort does. When writing, make sure that your hand is in a comfortable position and doesn’t cramp or get fatigued as you write. If it does, consider switching the way that you’re holding the pencil or pen to improve your writing speed. [2] X Research source The traditional way to hold a pen or pencil is to support the pen in between your index finger and thumb while the pen rests on your middle finger. Angling the paper in a different way may also feel more comfortable for you."

    {
      "title": "Maintain good posture.",
      "content": "Maintain good posture. Straighten your back and make sure that your feet are resting flat on the floor. Your lower back and hips should be fully supported by the chair that you’re sitting in. Both your knees and your elbows should be bent and you should feel comfortable while you sit. Maintain this posture to reduce fatigue and improve stamina as you write. [3] X Research source Whenever you feel yourself slouching, adjust your posture so you’re sitting correctly. If your chair is too low or your desk is too high, you may need to purchase new furniture."

      "title": "Use shorthand if you aren’t writing for an assignment.",
      "content": "Use shorthand if you aren’t writing for an assignment. Methods like Pitman Shorthand and Gregg Shorthand use symbols to represent words, letters, and punctuation. Most of these symbols are quicker and easier to write than letters and words in English and could vastly improve your writing speed. Research and learn how to use either of these shorthand methods online or at a library. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that these shorthand methods aren’t known by everyone and can’t be used for assignments or on tests. It may take several weeks or even months to master these shorthand methods."

      "title": "Keep practicing.",
      "content": "Keep practicing. Practice every day to improve the speed and the appearance of your handwriting. The more that you do it, the quicker and neater your handwriting will become. You can try writing at home, or transcribing notes quickly in the middle of class. Use the things that work and avoid things that slow you down. [5] X Research source If you still aren't improving after trying everything, just talk to a teacher and see if they have any techniques that may help you."

    {
      "title": "Determine the time of day that you’re most productive.",
      "content": "Determine the time of day that you’re most productive. Some people write faster and more efficiently in the morning, while others excel at night. Try writing in both settings and determine which time feels best for you. Then, try to get as much writing done as you can during the times of day when you’re most productive. [6] X Research source Even if you’re a night owl, you may still be more productive in the morning. Write during different parts of the day to see what works best for you."

    {
      "title": "Write an outline for your assignment.",
      "content": "Write an outline for your assignment. Read the prompt or assignment so you know what you have to write. Perform research and plot out the main points in your essay, paper, or story in an outline form. Determine what you want to include in your writing, and then write 2-3 sentences, or subpoints, within those main points. This will keep your writing precise and on topic, which will reduce the amount you need to delete or edit later. [7] X Research source For example, the main points of your article could be something like, \"Describing circuits\" and \"Powering Electronics.\" \"Describing circuits\" could include points like \"Explaining a simple circuit\" and \"Completing a circuit.\" Researching things in the middle of writing wastes valuable time. Include your sources in your outline to save time, especially if you have to make citations later. If you’re using electronic sources, bookmark them on your computer. Include notes in your outline about how you’re going to use your sources and what information you hope to take from them."

    {
      "title": "Write your first draft quickly and revisit it for edits.",
      "content": "Write your first draft quickly and revisit it for edits. If the words are too complex, jot down an approximation of what you think you’re hearing and do your research afterwards.”Write your first draft and then come back and edit and review the writing later. This will allow you to get the bulk of the work out of the way and enable you to concentrate on grammar and spelling the second time around. Wasting time on smaller details can drain time and make the entire writing process much longer. If you find yourself stuck in a section, move past it and revisit it later with a fresh mind."

    {
      "title": "Minimize the distractions around you.",
      "content": "Minimize the distractions around you. Distractions like surfing the web, TV, or open chat programs can hinder your efficiency and slow down your writing speed. Find a solitary space where you can write and won’t be distracted by the things going on around you. [8] X Research source Clearing the clutter off your writing desk may also minimize distractions and improve your efficiency. If you can, put away your phone, tablet, or other devices you might be tempted to use to check social media or browse the web. You can also use productivity apps or extensions (like StayFocused) that temporarily cut off your access to time-wasting websites."

      "title": "Set realistic goals and deadlines for yourself.",
      "content": "Set realistic goals and deadlines for yourself. If you are newer at writing or aren’t used to writing on a deadline, there’s a good possibility you’ll be slower at writing than someone with more experience. Set goals that make sense for you and are within your ability. If you set a goal and you are stressed or feel like meeting the goal is impossible, set lighter goals for yourself. [9] X Research source Set incrementally higher goals for yourself rather than taking on too much too fast. If you haven’t written a lot in the past, you won’t be able to write quickly without practice. However, once you practice writing a lot, you will be able to write at a quicker pace. For instance, you can set a goal that you’ll have a certain number of pages or words completed within a day. If you’re still working on building speed, daily goals can feel more manageable than more short-term ones (such as hourly goals)."

    {
      "title": "Use a timer to help meet your goals.",
      "content": "Use a timer to help meet your goals. In order to improve your writing speed, you’ll need a way to measure if you’re improving. Set a timer to the goal that you set for yourself earlier and try to meet your goal within the allotted time. If you don't have a stopwatch or timer, there are apps that were created specifically for that purpose. [10] X Research source Don’t let the timer stress you out. It’s merely there to remind you of how much time you’re spending on an assignment."
