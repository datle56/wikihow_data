      "title": "Assess what the reader knows.",
      "content": "Assess what the reader knows. Start by figuring what letter sounds, or phonemes, the person already knows. That way, you can help fill in where they need help without rehashing what they do know. [1] X Research source Most curriculums have an assessment you can do with students. However, if you need to make your own, make it based on the 6 phoneme tasks."

      "content": "Ask questions about phoneme isolation. Phoneme isolation is the ability to identify sounds in words. For instance, you might ask, \"What is the first sound in 'finish'?\" or \"What is the last sound in 'past'?\" [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Discuss phoneme identity.",
      "content": "Discuss phoneme identity. In this task, the student must find the same sound in different words. For example, you might ask, \"What is the common sound in 'paper,' 'pitch,' and 'pipe'?\" [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask about phoneme blending.",
      "content": "Ask about phoneme blending. Phoneme blending requires students to join separate sounds together. You could say, \"what word do these sounds spell? /s/ /k/ /u/ /p/ (scoop)?\" [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Assess the student's phoneme segmentation.",
      "content": "Assess the student's phoneme segmentation. Here, you see whether students can pull the sounds out of a word. It's the opposite of blending. You could ask, \"How many phonemes are there in 'scoop'?\" (/s/ /k/ /u/ /p/) [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss phoneme deletion.",
      "content": "Discuss phoneme deletion. In this task, you ask students to delete a sound from a word and see what is leftover. You might ask, \"How would you say 'scoop' without the /s/ sound?\" [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Introduce sounds individually.",
      "content": "Introduce sounds individually. Go through all the phonemes, using listening activities. For instance, you could use the phoneme /f/ which is the \"F\" sound in the English language. Start by saying the sound several times while holding up a card with /f/ on it. Then, using flash cards, show the students words that begin with /f/ as you say them slowly, such as \"fine,\" \"fall,\" \"fast,\" and \"furry.\" [8] X Research source You can also use words that make that sound with different letters, such as \"phone.\""

      "content": "Differentiate between each individual sound and others. Walk around the room and point to different objects. If it has the /f/ sound, for instance, hold up the card and say the word. If it doesn't have the sound, don't hold up the card. [9] X Research source"

Provide examples of each task, and then ask the students to give you answers.

      "title": "Help with non-decodable words.",
      "content": "Help with non-decodable words. Non-decodable words are ones that don't follow the rules of phonetics, such as \"who.\" English has borrowed words from many languages, which is why many words don't follow \"the rules.\" As the adults are trying to sound out words, help them figure out the ones that can't be decoded by saying it for them. Mostly, these words just need to be memorized."

Then, have the students write down the corresponding letter for each sound. [12] X Research source"

However, children's books can take adults back to when they were first trying to read, which can be helpful. [13] X Research source Plus, children's books often include rhyming and alliteration, which helps any beginning reader learn the phonetics of reading. Try reading these aloud to your students. If you feel like it might be condescending, try breaking the ice with a little joke, like \"Well, we all know Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall, but now we get to read about it! Extra, extra!\""

You can even use common games like Pictionary, Scategories, and charades to help students work on their vocabulary. [19] X Research source You can also try a game like chalkboard anagram. Write a word on the board, and then have students come up and write a word for each letter. Ask them to pick a word related to the anagram. For instance, if you write \"COMPUTER,\" students could write \" C rash,\" \" O rder,\" \" M ouse,\" \" P ictures,\" \" U ser,\" \" T echnology,\" \" E mail,\" and \" R eboot.\""

The humans finally opened it, and the cat ran out when they weren't looking. The cat visited the neighbors, chased a mouse, and found a warm sun spot to nap. When it got dark, the cat decided to go home because he wanted his dinner.\" The student might say, \"The cat wanted to go outside, so he did.
