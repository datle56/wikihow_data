      "content": "Most men looking for a long-term partner favor brunettes. It’s long been assumed that men have a natural affinity for blondes, but when it comes to what may be seen as “wifey” material, research shows that most men gravitate toward women with brown hair. Researchers from the College of Natural and Health Sciences for the University of Tampa conducted a 2018 study that found that \"brunette hair color in females has been associated with several personality characteristics, such as intelligence, independence, competence, and not being needy.\" [1] X Research source In a poll conducted by Health Digest in 2021, 32% of readers voted for brunette hair as their favorite, landing it a spot as the number one most attractive hair color among readers.

      "content": "Men often approach blondes the most. While studies show that a lot of men view brunettes as the most attractive, other research reveals that some are more confident when it comes to approaching someone with blonde hair. A 2011 study conducted by the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology found that British men approached a blonde woman in a nightclub significantly more than they approached the same woman in a brunette or red wig. [3] X Research source Moreover, it's been found that many men associate blonde hair with \"youth,\" \"health,\" and overall \"attractiveness,\" which researchers believe could signal \"reproductive potential.\" [4] X Research source Men in the 2011 study were found to approach blonde women more, but also reported that they perceived them as being “more needy.” [5] X Research source This may lead men to assume that light-haired females are more receptive to advances and less likely to turn them down, which could explain why blondes are targeted the most. According to the 2021 Health Digest poll, 25% of readers voted blonde hair as their favorite, making it the second most popular color after brunette. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Most women prefer brown hair. While there are very few women who would turn down Ryan Gosling because of his hair color, the consensus shows that women are more drawn toward guys with darker hair. The hair color preference study from the College of Natural and Health Sciences for the University of Tampa revealed that most women who took part in the research, just as most men, were more attracted to brunette hair. [7] X Research source The attraction women have toward brown-haired men likely stems from stereotypes. For women taking their dating life seriously, blonde-haired men may be perceived as unserious or looking for nothing more than a fling, as \"blondes have more fun\" has been an enduring and infamous label. In a 2012 study by Nicolas Guéguen from the Université de Bretagne-Sud in France, 65% of women agreed to dance with a dark-haired male suitor. On the other hand, only 13.8% of women agreed to dance with men wearing a red wig. [8] X Research source"

Only 3% of the female population had red hair, but both females and males preferred it at a higher rate of 6%. [9] X Research source"

[11] X Research source For example, teens or those in their early twenties may be more attracted to the bright, bubbly effervescence of a blonde as opposed to the timeless elegance of a brunette. People in their 30s may see brown as an attractive hair color because they’re looking to settle down, get serious, or choose a partner they view as their equal."
