      "content": "List multiples of the denominators if necessary. If the denominators of your fractions aren't the same, you'll need to make them the same. List the multiples of each denominator so you can find a number that both denominators have in common. For example, if you're doing 1/4 - 1/5, list all the multiples of 4 and 5 to find 20. [1] X Research source Since the multiples of 4 include 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and the multiples of 5 include 5, 10, 15, and 20, 20 is the lowest number they have in common. If the denominators are already the same, you can skip straight to subtracting the numerators."

      "content": "Multiply both the numerator and denominator to get like denominators. Once you've found the lowest common multiple for your unlike fractions, multiply the fraction so the denominator becomes the least common multiple. [2] X Research source For example, multiply 1/4 by 5 to get a denominator of 20. You'll also need to multiply the numerator by 5, so 1/4 becomes 5/20."

Keep in mind that if you adjust 1 of the fractions in the problem, you'll need to adjust all of the fractions so they're equivalent. [3] X Research source For example, if you've adjusted 1/4 to become 5/20, multiply the 1/5 by 4 to get 4/20. The original problem 1/4 - 1/5 becomes 5/20 - 4/20."

If you started with denominators that were the same or you made equivalent fractions with the same denominator, subtract the numerators. Write the answer and then write the denominator underneath it. [4] X Research source Remember not to subtract the denominators as well. For example, 5/20 - 4/20 = 1/20."

For example, if you had an answer of 24/32, the greatest common factor is 8. Divide both numbers by 8 to get 3/4. [5] X Research source Depending on your answer, you may not be able to simplify it. For example, 1/20 can't be reduced further."

This will mean that the numerator will be larger than the denominator. [6] X Research source For example, 2 3/4 - 1 1/7 will become 11/4 - 8/7."

[7] X Research source Since the multiples of 4 include 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and the multiples of 7 include 7, 14, 21, and 28, 28 is the lowest number they have in common."

[11] X Research source For example, 45/28 becomes 1 17/28 because 28 goes into 45 1 time and has 17 parts of 28 left over."
