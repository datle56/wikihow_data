      "content": "Make sure the hat fits. Big hats look better on big heads, whereas small hats look better on small heads. [1] X Research source Make sure the hat fits well and feels comfortable before you purchase it. If your hat is too tight or constantly falls off your head, you're not going to want to wear it often. To measure your head, place a tape measure 1/8 of an inch above your left ear and then wrap it around the circumference of your head to determine your head size. [2] X Research source If you don't have a tape measure, don't worry. Any hat store will be able to measure your head for you."

      "title": "Choose a fedora that matches your style.",
      "content": "Choose a fedora that matches your style. Most fedoras are made of felt, but some are made of wool, fur or straw. Some fedoras have wide bands with decoration and others do not. Depending on your style and what you're looking for in a hat, you'll need to make some decisions. If you live in a warm climate, you might want to shy away from getting a wool fedora, so you don't overheat. For warmer climates, consider getting a felt or straw fedora. If you're more of a traditionalist, consider getting a classic fedora. A classic fedora is generally made of wool and will make you look just like the gangsters in old movies. If you have a smaller head, consider getting a pork-pie hat. This type of fedora has a smaller brim, so it will fit your face better."

      "content": "Wear your fedora on dressy occasions. A wool fedora looks great with a suit and tie. [3] X Research source Wearing a fedora is stylish way to look original and classy at a fancy event. If you don't currently have a suit, you can buy one in most department stores, or at a thrift store. You can also borrow one from a friend who is a similar size as you. Wearing a fedora with your suit is appropriate for weddings, dances and other fancy parties. Avoid wearing a fedora at more solemn occasions, like funerals. If you have a little extra money, pay to have your suit professionally tailored. This will ensure your suit fits your body perfectly, which will perfectly accentuate your fedora."

      "title": "Dress your fedora down.",
      "content": "Dress your fedora down. To do this, pair your fedora with a tighter-fitting sweater, slacks and nice shoes (not sneakers). This is the perfect outfit to wear out to dinner or to a school dance. If you're going to dinner first, keep in mind that some restaurants will expect you to take off your hat indoors. You can also swap the sweater out for a nice vest over a button down shirt. If you're wearing a sweater, don't wear a fedora made of straw. Those are considered warmer weather fedoras, and your hat will look odd with your outfit."

      "title": "Wear your fedora with jeans.",
      "content": "Wear your fedora with jeans. Since the fedora is a dressy hat, you'll need to dress up your outfit a little bit if you're going with jeans. Do this by pairing your jeans (which should be well-tailored) with a blazer or nice jacket. Try adding a colorful or patterned button-down shirt under your jacket for a little pop of color and visual interest. If the colors of this outfit are fairly neutral, try mixing it up with a brightly colored fedora. This is a great outfit to wear while hanging out on the weekend or while traveling on vacation."

      "title": "Choose the right size fedora.",
      "content": "Choose the right size fedora. To do this, either measure your head or try the fedora on for size before purchasing. If the fedora does not leave a red mark around your forehead when you take it off, or fall down around your ears, it's a good fit. Fedoras generally look better on women when they wear their hair down, but you can also pull your hair into a low ponytail or bun at the nape of your neck. If this is something you're planning to do, try both hairstyles out when trying on your fedora to make sure they work. Women usually position fedoras so they are jauntily askew, rather than sitting squarely on the head. To do this, tilt the brim so the hat is positioned over your eyebrows. If the brim tips down over your eyes when you move, the hat is too big."

      "content": "Choose a color and texture that matches your style. Neutrals like black and camel are popular, but to give yourself a fun, whimsical edge, try wearing a fedora in a bright color, like purple or green. You can also look for fedoras in interesting textures, like denim or leather. [4] X Research source If you choose to rock a bright fedora, make the fedora your focal point. Wear something subdued, like black or a neutral color on the bottom so you don't distract from your hat. [5] X Research source Pair your colorful fedora with a dark trench for the perfect rainy day outfit."

      "content": "Add embellishments. Sometimes you will find a fedora that you really like, but it's missing that something extra. If you want to take your fedora to the next level, try hot-gluing a dramatic feather to the inside of your fedora band. If your fedora does not come with a band, you can glue a ribbon around the hat. If you don't want to commit to an embellishment, try tying the ribbon around the hat. Then you can swap out your ribbon for different colored sashes or bands, depending on your outfit. The brighter the color of your fedora, the fewer embellishments you should add."

Try wearing a t-shirt or flannel shirt under your jacket for a 90s grunge vibe. [6] X Research source If you don't have a leather jacket or don't want to buy one for ethical reasons, try using a faux leather jacket instead. Make sure whatever jacket you end up choosing fits you well. You want the jacket to be tight, but not too tight."

      "content": "Wear it with a sweater. For a cozy weekend look, try rocking your fedora with an oversized, cable-knit sweater. [7] X Research source Add boyfriend jeans on the bottom and a soft, worn-in t-shirt for a casual, comfortable look. You can also try substituting the sweater for a flannel shirt or solid hoodie. Fedoras look great with layers, so feel free to start with a tank top, add a cardigan and throw a vest over that."

[8] X Research source Be careful not to go overboard with the patterns. You don't want to distract from your hat. Try wearing a pair of patterned pants on the bottom with a solid tee on the top. The solid will help balance out the patterns and allow your hat to be the star of the show."

If you hold your head up high and exude confidence, your classy style will be sure to turn heads. [9] X Research source Don't be surprised if after you start wearing a fedora, others you know start wearing them, too. It's a good thing to be a trendsetter!"

Wear your fedora in the sun as often as possible to help prevent skin cancer. [11] X Research source When choosing a fedora for the beach, choose a straw texture and choose something wider brimmed. This will help shield any areas that you might have missed when applying sunscreen. Make sure to remove your hat if you're planning to swim, but leave it on if you're just hanging out, wading in the water."
