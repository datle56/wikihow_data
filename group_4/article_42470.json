      "title": "Open the MiraLAX bottle and look inside the cap.",
      "content": "Open the MiraLAX bottle and look inside the cap. All bottles of MiraLAX come with lids that double as measuring cups. While the outside of the cap is purple, the underside is white up to a line that is marked for 17 grams, which is the proper single dosage for MiraLAX. [1] X Research source Get a box of single-dose MiraLAX packets so you don’t have to measure it out every time. Generic brands of MiraLAX (polyethylene glycol 3350) usually have a measuring cup inside the cap as well, although the particular setup may vary. The standard dose is always 17 grams, though."

      "title": "Fill the cap with MiraLAX up to the marked 17-gram line.",
      "content": "Fill the cap with MiraLAX up to the marked 17-gram line. Pour the fine, white powder into the cap until it fills the white section of the cap’s underside. Gently tap or shake the cap in order to level out the powder and make sure it’s at the 17-gram line. [2] X Research source If you have a box of single-use packets, simply pour the contents of a single packet into your chosen beverage (see below). Do not take a larger dose of MiraLAX unless instructed by your doctor. Talk to a doctor before giving a child under 17 any amount of MiraLAX."

      "content": "Pour the MiraLAX into 4–8 fl oz (120–240 ml) of your chosen liquid. MiraLAX can be taken with hot, cold, or room temperature liquids. You need at least 4 fl oz (120 ml) of liquid to fully dissolve a single dose, but you’ll get the best results with a full 8 fl oz (240 ml) glass, which is about the size of a coffee cup. [3] X Research source MiraLAX is practically flavorless and non-gritty, so it’s fine to take it with plain water. You can also try tea, coffee, or juice. [4] X Expert Source Roy Nattiv, MD Board Certified Gastroenterologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. Don’t mix MiraLAX into alcoholic beverages. Also, mixing it into carbonated beverages (like soda) may cause them to bubble over when you stir the mixture."

      "title": "Stir the mixture to dissolve the powder, then drink it all fairly quickly.",
      "content": "Stir the mixture to dissolve the powder, then drink it all fairly quickly. Use a spoon to give your cup of liquid a quick stir, until you no longer see flecks of MiraLAX in it. Drink the entire cup or glass within the next 10-15 minutes. [5] X Research source It is not recommended to combine the mixture and then drink some or all of it later since it will thicken and be hard to drink. Wait until you can drink the full amount before mixing it. You don’t have to “chug” the mixture, though. Just take normal sips over several minutes until you drink it all. Make sure to stir your glass in between sips so the MiraLAX doesn’t settle on the bottom."

      "content": "Use MiraLAX once a day for up to 7 consecutive days. MiraLAX is formulated and labeled for use no more than once per day. You don’t have to take it at the same time every day, but you shouldn’t take more than 1 dose per day without the approval of your doctor. [6] X Research source You should also not take MiraLAX for more than 7 days in a row without consulting your doctor. If you’ve taken it every day for a week, stop there until you are able to speak to your doctor. Once you achieve regular, soft stools, you can stop taking MiraLAX until the next time you need it.

You definitely shouldn’t take MiraLAX if you’re allergic to polyethylene glycol, which is the main active ingredient in the product. Also make sure to consult with your doctor if you have any chronic or serious medical conditions, especially the following: [8] X Research source Ulcerative colitis Irritable bowel syndrome Kidney disease An eating disorder (such as anorexia or bulimia) A bowel obstruction or intestinal blockage Pregnancy, potential pregnancy, or breastfeeding Nausea, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or a major change in bowel habits that’s lasted for more than 2 weeks"

      "content": "Talk to your doctor beforehand about potential drug incompatibilities. MiraLAX typically does not have any significant incompatibilities with other medications. However, it can cause mild to moderate interactions, such as dizziness or cramping, with a wide range of common drugs. To be safe, you should always talk to your doctor or pharmacist about all prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements you take. [9] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Potential drug incompatibilities include acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, melatonin, omeprazole, oxycodone, prednisone, and alprazolam, among many others. You can see the full list of 255 potential interactions at https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/polyethylene-glycol-3350,MiraLAX.html . Keep in mind that most of these potential interactions are minor, so there’s a good chance you’ll still be able to take MiraLAX."

      "content": "Contact your doctor before giving MiraLAX to kids under 17. MiraLAX is generally safe for kids aged 6 months and older, but it is not labeled for kids under 17. Do not give any amount of MiraLAX to a child who is 16 or younger without talking to their pediatrician. [11] X Research source It’s important to get the right dosage based on the child’s size and age. Too much MiraLAX may cause very watery stools and possibly dehydration, while too little may not be effective."

      "content": "Clarify the pediatric dosing instructions with your doctor. For a pre-teen or teen, the doctor will probably advise you to give a standard 17-gram dose. For younger kids, they might recommend a half-dose, in which case you’ll need to fill the cap halfway up to the marked line. For reference, the standard dosage rates for children are as follows: [12] X Research source Kids 6 months and older: 0.5 - 1.5 g per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight. Kids 2 years and older: 1.5 g per 1 kg (2.2 lb) of body weight. Contact your doctor if you aren’t sure what the correct dose is for your child.

Your colon needs to be completely emptied in order for a colonoscopy to be effective, so the doctor doing the procedure will have a dietary and laxative plan for you to follow in the days leading up to the colonoscopy. Follow their specific instructions, but don’t be surprised if they include the following: [14] X Research source A full, standard size, 238-gram bottle of MiraLAX. A 64 fl oz (1.9 L) jug of a clear or light-colored liquid. Sports drinks (like Gatorade) are often recommended because they replace electrolytes lost as your colon is emptied.

However, follow the specific instructions given by your healthcare provider. [15] X Research source Don’t mix up the MiraLAX and liquid until directed to do so—often the day before your procedure.

During the day or so leading up to the colonoscopy, you’ll likely be directed to drink 8 fl oz (240 ml) glass every hour, and then every 15 minutes until it is all gone. You will be given a precise schedule to follow, and you should follow it precisely. [16] X Research source Shake the bottle up well each time you pour a glass. Follow the doctor’s instructions exactly as given to you. If you don’t, the colonoscopy may not be successful and you’ll have to repeat the entire process at a later date."
