      "content": "Opt for a vest that’s long enough to cover your waistline in the front. A waistcoat is supposed to cover the entire front of your dress shirt from the middle of your torso down. For best results, opt for a length of vest that puts the last button right above or almost on top of your belt. [1] X Research source Don’t worry as much about how long the back of the vest is if you plan to wear it with a suit. The coat will shield the back of the vest from view. If you wear the vest without a suit, it’s best to have the back of the vest come all the way down to the waistline as well."

      "content": "Choose a suit vest that fits snugly around your shoulders. This will ensure that the shoulders of your vest always lie flat against your body. If your vest is too loose, the shoulders could pop up instead of lying flat, which will look very awkward. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Go with a suit vest that’s narrow enough to be seen under a coat.",
      "content": "Go with a suit vest that’s narrow enough to be seen under a coat. The “V” shape of your suit vest when it’s buttoned up should be thin and narrow so that it’s still visible even when you’re wearing a suit jacket. If the “V” is too wide, your suit vest will “disappear” whenever you wear a suit jacket and button it up. [3] X Research source The best way to determine if the suit vest is narrow enough is to simply try it on with a coat. If you don’t plan to wear your suit vest with a coat, feel free to go with as wide a “V” as you like. A vest paired with a suit creates a really formal look.

      "content": "Get a vest that fits snugly around your torso. A suit vest should be tight enough to “hug” your body and avoid looking floppy. However, don’t get a vest that’s too tight, either; otherwise, it will look small on you. [5] X Research source There shouldn’t be any “pulling” on the buttons when you button up your vest. If there is, it’s too small for your body."

      "title": "Be sure to always leave the last button at the bottom of the vest undone.",
      "content": "Be sure to always leave the last button at the bottom of the vest undone. This is the traditional way to wear a suit vest. You can also leave the top button of the vest undone if you like, although this is technically optional. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear a vest in the same color and style as your suit and pants.",
      "content": "Wear a vest in the same color and style as your suit and pants. For formal affairs, your suit vest should be the same color and pattern, if applicable, as the other parts of your 3-piece suit. If your suit jacket is black, though, you can also opt for a vest in a very dark non-black color, such as dark green or dark brown. [7] X Research source Note that if you’re attending an event that has been labelled “black tie,” this means you should wear a black vest and black bowtie with your suit. Your suit jacket and pants should also be black on this type of occasion. The style or pattern on your suit vest should match that of the suit jacket itself. For instance, if your suit jacket is solid blue, go with a vest that is also solid blue. Shop for vests in versatile colors, so they match with multiple shirts and ties in your wardrobe.

      "title": "Choose a complementary color for your tie instead of a matching one.",
      "content": "Choose a complementary color for your tie instead of a matching one. You should always wear a dress shirt and tie underneath your waistcoat when wearing a suit. The tie should complement the color of your suit vest, but shouldn’t be the exact same unless the situation specifically calls for the tie and vest to match the suit. [9] X Research source For example, for a dark, earthy suit vest color (e.g., dark green), try wearing a lighter colored tie (e.g., light green) to complement it. Black tie events are the main exception to this rule, since they require that you wear a black tie and black vest to match a black suit."

      "content": "Buy a vest made of natural fibers to achieve a more textured look. Suits and suit vests made of synthetic fibers like polyester tend to look flashy and cheap. When you buy your vest, go with wool, tweed, corduroy, or any other natural fiber in order to give your outfit a deep, textured look. [10] X Research source Tweed and corduroy are better materials for wearing a vest in cold weather, while linen and cotton are better for warm-weather events."

      "content": "Go with jeans, chinos, or trousers for a more casual look. Ditch the suit jacket and tie for a dress shirt with rolled up sleeves. Then, tuck that shirt into a pair of blue jeans, chinos, or trousers in order to pull off a casual yet stylish appearance. [11] X Research source If you’re wearing jeans, stick with a darker shade of blue denim. The denim should also be a slimmer fit, in order to match with your vest. You may want to avoid wearing black trousers with your vest, since this might make you look like a waiter at a fancy restaurant!"

      "title": "Opt for shoes that match the formality of the occasion.",
      "content": "Opt for shoes that match the formality of the occasion. If you’re wearing a waistcoat and suit to a formal affair, wear black dress shoes to maintain a formal look. If you’re going for something more casual, go with loafers or dress boots to get a more business casual look to complement your suit vest. When it comes to color, your business casual shoes should stand out with a unique shade. For example, wear loafers that have a navy blue hue or intricate details on them."

      "title": "Choose a colored and patterned suit vest for a more playful style.",
      "content": "Choose a colored and patterned suit vest for a more playful style. If you’re wearing your suit vest casually, you’ll want it to be fun and attention-grabbing, even as it looks semi-formal. To accomplish this, go with a colored suit vest instead of a solid black one and don’t be afraid to have it feature an interesting pattern like checks or stripes. [12] X Research source"

Don’t wear a tie with this outfit, or else you’ll look more formal than casual. [13] X Research source Although this outfit is meant to look pretty casual, you should still have your shirt tucked into your pants. Otherwise, you may look sloppy instead of simply casual."

      "title": "Avoid pairing the vest with clothes that look too casual or loose.",
      "content": "Avoid pairing the vest with clothes that look too casual or loose. A suit vest is going to look pretty dressy, so if you pair it with something that looks very casual, the effect can be jarring. Avoid clothes like ripped jeans, sandals, sneakers, shorts, or pants that hang very loosely around your legs. [14] X Research source The same goes for the shirt you wear underneath your vest. For best results, you should generally avoid pairing it with a t-shirt or loose top."
