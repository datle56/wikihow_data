After you have thoroughly lathered your hands with soap and water, rinse the soap off with clean water. Then, lather your fingertips again with soap and water, and lather the skin around your piercing to clean it. Rinse your lip with water, and dry your hands and face with a paper towel. After washing your hands, apply a salt water solution (1 cup of water mixed with 1 tbsp of salt) to the area before touching. Most piercers recommend using a cotton swab to remove some of the crusty residue."

Twist the bead to the left, loosening the bead until you can remove it completely. Once you have removed the bead, you can let go of the inside of the piercing with your teeth. [3] X Research source Hoop piercings normally have a compression ball in between the two ends of the hoop. These can be difficult to remove, so it may be best to visit your local piercing to help with the removal. Some hoop piercings are pinched together for a close (rather than having a compression ball between the two ends of the hoop), and these piercings can be pulled apart by pulling the metal in opposite directions. You might want some help from a professional piercer to remove these kinds of lip rings."
