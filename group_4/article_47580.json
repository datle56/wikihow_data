      "content": "Adhere to the dress code on the invitation, if applicable. In many cases, the dress code may be stated on the invitation. If that's the case, do your best to stick to the dress code dictated by the bride and groom. [1] X Research source For instance, if the dress code says “white tie” or “black tie,” wear an evening or ball gown. If the dress code says “formal” or “cocktail attire,” opt for a cocktail dress. If the dress code says “semi-formal,” wear a nice dress."

      "content": "Opt for a slip dress for a casual event. If the wedding isn't a black-tie affair, you can choose a more casual outfit, like a slip dress. Pair it with heels or flats, and add a pop of color with a jacket, handbag, or statement necklace. [2] X Research source For example, pair a black slip dress with pink peep-toe heels and a printed clutch."

      "title": "Choose an embellished dress for formal affairs.",
      "content": "Choose an embellished dress for formal affairs. Look for dresses with embellishments like sequins, bows, flowers, and other interesting details. Beading and lace can make a black dress the perfect piece for a formal wedding. [3] X Research source For instance, a dress with a beaded top and an empire waist would be perfect for a formal wedding. Add a beaded clutch and slingback heels to complete the look."

      "title": "Select a dress with a hemline below the knee for a conservative wedding.",
      "content": "Select a dress with a hemline below the knee for a conservative wedding. A short black dress could cause a stir if the event is very conservative, so it's best to choose a dress with a hemline below the knee or lower. A long black dress is chic and versatile, allowing you to style it in a way that shows your personality. [4] X Research source For example, pair a black maxi dress with a printed shrug and colorful flats."

      "title": "Wear a dress with a hemline above the knee for a summer wedding.",
      "content": "Wear a dress with a hemline above the knee for a summer wedding. Though you might not think “black cocktail dress” when you envision a summer wedding, you can totally make it work! Wearing a dress with a hemline above the knee will keep you cool during the summer months. Lighten up your look with bright heels or fun jewelry. [5] X Research source For instance, a flowy black dress that hits just above the knee would look fantastic paired with metallic gladiator sandals, bangle bracelets, and a metallic handbag."

      "title": "Choose a printed dress if you don't want to wear all black.",
      "content": "Choose a printed dress if you don't want to wear all black. While you can wear an all-black dress, you can also opt for a dress that has black in addition to other colors. Printed dresses or dresses with color-blocking are flattering on nearly all body types. Just don't pick a print that's too loud—your look should be understated. [6] X Research source For example, a rose-patterned dress with a black background would look great paired with black wedges and a red belt."

      "title": "Pick a pair of colorful shoes to spice up your ensemble.",
      "content": "Pick a pair of colorful shoes to spice up your ensemble. Wearing all black may make your look more suitable for a funeral than a wedding! A fun pair of heels or flats can help liven up a black dress. Choose shoes that are colorful, sparkly, printed, or otherwise make a statement. [7] X Research source For example, pair a tea-length black dress with yellow strappy sandals, a beaded necklace, and a yellow clutch. If you do choose a black pair of shoes, be sure to add some color to your outfit with other accessories, like a hat, shawl, or belt."

      "content": "Add some drama with a statement scarf or necklace. A bold scarf or necklace draws the eye to the top half of your body and can break up a monochromatic look. Pick a necklace or scarf that has a lot of color or a fun pattern. [8] X Research source For instance, pair a black A-line dress with a red, white, and black printed scarf and red pumps. Add some simple earrings and a single bracelet."

      "title": "Layer on a printed pashmina or shawl to liven up your look.",
      "content": "Layer on a printed pashmina or shawl to liven up your look. An easy way to add color to your outfit is with another layer. Choose a printed jacket, shawl, pashmina, or shrug and match it to your belt, handbag, or shoes. For example, a floral-printed jacket would look great over a black slip dress. Finish off your look with brightly-colored kitten heels and some dangly earrings."

      "content": "Incorporate some bling with earrings and bracelets. Jewelry always helps to jazz up your look! Layer on sparkly bangle bracelets or show off your diamond earrings with your black dress. Adding some bling will bring your look from everyday to wedding-ready! [9] X Research source For instance, pair a black maxi dress with a diamond tennis bracelet, diamond studs, and a simple diamond necklace."

      "title": "Add a pop of color with a belt.",
      "content": "Add a pop of color with a belt. If you're worried that your look is too monochromatic, break it up with a colorful belt. Not only will the color stand out against the black, a belt has the added bonus of highlighting your waistline. [10] X Research source For example, add a brightly-colored belt to the waist of an A-line dress. Match the belt with your shoes or handbag."

      "title": "Choose no more than 3 bold accessories.",
      "content": "Choose no more than 3 bold accessories. While you want to add some interest to your ensemble with accessories, you shouldn't go overboard. One or 2 statement pieces will take your look from drab to exciting, but more than 3 can make you look too busy. [11] X Research source For instance, if you choose a bright jacket and shoes, keep your jewelry understated. Alternatively, if you opt for dramatic jewelry, pair it with some simple shoes and a neutral handbag."

      "title": "Avoid wearing a dress that's very risqué.",
      "content": "Avoid wearing a dress that's very risqué. A black dress can work for a wedding as long as it isn't too revealing, low-cut, or tight. Avoid dresses with plunging necklines and/or hemlines above mid-thigh. A wedding is a classy affair, and you should show respect for the bride and groom, as well as their families, by opting for a more conservative style. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Stay away from white, cream, or ivory. Rather than avoiding wearing black, you should actually avoid wearing a similar color to the bride's dress. Though you may not know what dress she chose in advance, stay away from white, cream, and ivory to be safe. You don't want to look like you're trying to upstage the bride, after all!

      "content": "Consider the season and setting when choosing your dress. Generally, longer dresses are better for the fall and winter months, while dresses with hemlines above the knee are best for summer and spring. Be sure to choose a dress with more coverage for a conservative setting, like a church wedding. A black ball gown may be appropriate for more formal setting, such as a ballroom, but in other settings it may not be. [14] X Research source For instance, don't wear a long, black dress to a beach wedding! Choose a cocktail or slip dress with a shorter hemline, instead."
