If you are looking to increase muscle size and strength in your upper back, trapezius, and hamstring muscles, lifting straps may be right for you. They allow you to lift more weight to work these muscles than your natural grip might allow. [1] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview. 21 October 2019. Specifically, they are good for the following exercises: [2] X Research source Dumbbell or barbell rows Shrugs Deadlifts Romanian deadlifts Rack pulls"

      "content": "Avoid using lifting straps for the wrong exercises. First, it is important to note that lifting straps are not allowed in power lifting competitions. If you are training to power lift, don't use straps all the time, because you need a strong natural grip. [3] X Research source Make sure to do at least some reps with your natural grip, even if it means you can't lift as heavy a weight. Additionally, these straps are only helpful for lifts in which gravity is working against your ability to hold on to the weight. Lifting straps do not aid in bench presses or similar exercises. Using them for these lifts may result in ridicule from other weight lifters. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Select the right lifting straps.",
      "content": "Select the right lifting straps. Lifting straps are sewn from heavy-duty cotton, nylon, or leather.The varying materials and styles of these straps provide different advantages to the lifter. Here are some guidelines in choosing straps. Make sure they are well stitched and strong. Cotton and nylon straps are firmer than leather straps and are less easily bent out of shape. Leather straps have a little more give. This makes them a better choice if you plan to wear them to clean, though many weightlifters don't believe straps should be used for this lift anyway. [5] X Research source Nylon straps allow you to release the dumbbell the most quickly. Olympic/speed straps are shorter. These allow for easier and faster release of the barbell, but a less firm grip, because the strap wraps around the barbell fewer times. Although you can buy padded straps, straps with hook-and-loop fasteners, and weightlifting gloves with straps or hooks built in, these don't offer much improvement in function or comfort and are more expensive. Further, hook straps don't fit all barbells and can negatively affect your technique for some lifts. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the straps on. Slide your hands through the circles or attach the straps with the hook-and-loop fasteners so the end of the straps hang down along your fingers. Pull on the ends of the straps or adjust the fasteners until the straps fit snugly around your wrists. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the ends of the strap around the bar (or bars) holding the weight.",
      "content": "Wrap the ends of the strap around the bar (or bars) holding the weight. Start by going under the bar from back to front, and then wrapping the strap over the top and under again. Wrap the strap completely around the bar. [8] X Research source Some weight trainers prefer to wrap the straps in a figure-8 configuration. This can lead to a better grip on the barbell, but some people complain that after many reps, it can make the bar less comfortable to hold on to or even lead to friction burns."

      "title": "Place your hands over the straps.",
      "content": "Place your hands over the straps. Close your palm and fingers over the area where the straps are wrapped around the barbell. This is what holds them in place. When you let go, they should slide off easily. [9] X Research source If you're uncomfortable, re-wrap the straps to tighten or loosen as necessary."

      "title": "Roll the bar toward you.",
      "content": "Roll the bar toward you. Rolling the bar will tighten the strap. Do this until the straps pull on your wrists. Do not start lifting before the straps are tight--you will not get the full benefit of using lifting straps and may increase the risk of injury. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Lift the weight",
      "content": "Lift the weight . Take care not to force your wrists to hold the entire weight as you lift. The lifting straps should let your wrists assist you in maintaining your grip on the bar, not do all the work. You can injure your wrists by relying too heavily on them to lift the weight, so use your grip as well."

      "title": "Strengthen your grip.",
      "content": "Strengthen your grip. Use hand grips, squeeze the barbell during reps, do fist or fingertip push-ups, climb ropes, or hang from the pull-up bar to strengthen your grip so you don't have to rely too much on your lifting straps. [11] X Research source Lifting straps often cause weight trainers to ignore the need to strengthen their grips. This can be a real problem, especially if you compete in a sport that doesn't allow you to use straps."
