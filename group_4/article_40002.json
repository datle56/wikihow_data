      "content": "Thread the line through the hook’s eye and toward the shank. Pinch the line near the leading end and feed it through the eye opening. Pull the line through until it’s a few inches longer the length of the shaft, or at least 6–8 in (15–20 cm). [1] X Research source Some anglers contend that you should always thread the line through “front to back”—that is, insert the line on the side of the eye that is on the same side as the hook’s barbed tip. This may keep the hook in better alignment with the line when it’s in the water. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Form a single, large loop. Bring the leading end around so that it’s on the same side of the eye as where you first inserted the line. You’re basically creating a letter “O” with the line. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Thread the leading end through the eye again.",
      "content": "Thread the leading end through the eye again. Feed it through in the same direction as before. Thread about 2 in (5.1 cm) of line through the eye this time. [4] X Research source If you went “front to back” the first time through the eye, do so again this time."

      "title": "Pinch the hook eye and line with your thumb and forefinger.",
      "content": "Pinch the hook eye and line with your thumb and forefinger. Pinch right over the hook eye. With this pinch, hold on to both the part of the line that runs through the hook eye and the part that extends away from the hook (the standing end). [5] X Research source Below your pinched fingers, around 2 in (5.1 cm) of the leading end of the line should be running alongside the hook shank (the straight portion of the hook). The loop you created should also be below your pinched fingers."

      "title": "Twist the loop to wrap it around the hook shank and leading end.",
      "content": "Twist the loop to wrap it around the hook shank and leading end. With your free hand, grasp the loop and twist it clockwise. This will wrap the base of the loop (nearest to your fingers over the hook eye) around both the hook shank and the leading end that extends alongside the shank. [6] X Research source Try to make a fairly tight coil around the hook shank and leading end. This will make it easier to tighten the entire knot at the end. Once you finish the coil, slide your pinching fingers down a bit to hold it in place as well. The loop will shrink in circumference as you wrap it around the hook shank and leading end."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the loop around 6-7 more times.",
      "content": "Wrap the loop around 6-7 more times. Create 7-8 total coils around both the hook shank and leading end. Keep sliding your pinching fingers down to cover over each coil you make. [7] X Research source You’re essentially making a noose, with the hook shank being wrapped by the noose coils. When you’re done wrapping, the goal is to have the remaining loop be roughly the size of the hook eye. There also needs to be a roughly 0.5 in (1.3 cm) stub of the leading end extending below the coils. With practice, you’ll be able to create loops that are just the right size to wrap around the shank 7-8 times. If you can only manage 5-6 coils, your knot will probably hold. If you need to create more coils to use up the loop, that’s fine as well—but it won’t make the knot any stronger."

      "content": "Pull the standing end away from the hook to shrink the loop. Maintain a light but secure pinch grip over the 7-8 coils, but release pressure over the hook eye. Pull slowly on the standing end of the line with your free hand, and any slack remaining at the end of the loop will disappear. [8] X Research source Maintain your grip on the standing end of the line for the next move."

Keep holding the standing end with one hand, and slide your pinching fingers down to grip only the stub of the leading end that’s below the coils. Tug on each end simultaneously to draw the coils tight and secure the knot. You may want to lubricate the line by dipping it in water or spitting on it before doing this. [9] X Research source Lubricating the line will make tightening it easier by reducing friction along the coils."

Pass about 6 in (15 cm) of the leading end of the line through the eye, or a length that’s twice that of the hook—whichever is longer. [11] X Research source It’s up to you which side of the eye to feed the line into, although some people say using the same side as the tip of the hook provides better fishing results. [12] X Research source The “eye” is the closed loop at one end of the hook, and the “shank” is the straight portion of the hook (below the eye and above the curved section). Be careful not to hook yourself while tying any type of snell knot!"

At that point, create a loop that is directed away from the curve of the hook. Feed the end of the line (also the end of the loop) underneath both the shank and the line itself, again at the point where the curve of the hook begins.

Make fairly tight coils that don’t overlap, and go around both the shank and the section of line that runs alongside it. [14] X Research source Fewer than 5 wraps won’t make a tight enough knot, while more than 7 starts to become overkill (that is, the line will break before the knot will give regardless). Consider 7 wraps to be the “magic number.”"

After creating 5-7 fairly tight coils, you should have enough free line left to thread through the loop you created earlier. If not, undo 1-2 coils (at the risk of weakening the knot) or, better yet, undo the entire knot and start over. [15] X Research source You only need about 0.5–1 in (1.3–2.5 cm) of the leading end to pass through the loop this time; it’s OK if you have more."

With the other hand, pinch the leading end that has passed through the loop and give it a steady tug. [16] X Research source Pulling the leading end will tighten the coils against the shank. However, if you don’t pinch the coils, they’ll unravel, and if you pinch them too tight, you won’t be able to pull the leading end. Light pinching pressure is all that’s needed."

Slide your pinching fingers from the coils up to the standing end of the line, just beyond where it enters the hook’s eye. Maintain your grip on the leading end with your other hand. Pull firmly on both ends of the line at the same time. This will bring the coils in as tight as possible. [17] X Research source As you tighten them, make sure the coils remain side-by-side and don’t overlap. If they do, loosen the coils a bit, reposition them as needed, and re-tighten them. The coils may tighten more easily if you moisten them a little, either by dipping them in water or spitting on them."

While keeping the loop on this side, extend about 2 in (5.1 cm) of the leading end of the line over the top and to the other side of the hook’s shank. [21] X Research source Keep the part of the standing end of the line that you fed through the eye next to the hook shank. Pass the leading end over top of this along with the shank. Just a reminder—the “leading end” is the end of the line that you create the loops and coils with, while the “standing end” is the opposite end of the line. The leading end is sometimes also called the “tag end.”"

Each time, feed the leading end into the loop and back out, thereby wrapping it over both the hook shank and the section of line that’s alongside the shank. Be sure the coils you create are fairly snug against each other as you do this. [22] X Research source You need at least 4 coils to make an adequately-strong knot, while making more than 6 won’t provide much added benefit.
