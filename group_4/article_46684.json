      "content": "Purchase a nasal rinse product if not making your own rinse. There are a variety of nasal rinses that come prepackaged and ready to use. Look for a product labeled as a \"nasal rinse,\" \"sinus rinse,\" or for \"nasal irrigation.\" They are typically available at pharmacies but can be found in some grocery and big box stores as well. [1] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Most store-bought nasal rinse products are made up almost exclusively of saline. Saline is a combination of purified water and salt. Read and follow the directions on the packaging. These directions should include how to do the nasal rinse and how often you can do it. Some store-bought nasal rinse products require that you add purified or boiled and cooled water to the applicator. If your product says to do this, be sure to do it and don't simply add tap water. Use purified bottled water from an unopened bottle, or boil some tap water and let it cool if bottled water is unavailable."

      "content": "Get an irrigation device. There are a variety of devices that can be used to clean out the sinuses. These include commercial nasal saline rinse bottles, ear bulb syringes, and neti pots . Look for devices from online retailers or from pharmacies or natural product stores in your area. [2] X Research source All of these products work generally in the same way. They apply the rinse into 1 nostril and the rinse travels through the sinuses and out the other nostril. Be sure that the device that you buy is made specifically for irrigating the nasal passages. If you are unsure what device to get, ask your pharmacist for advice."

      "content": "Blow your nose to clear out your nasal passages. Before rinsing out your nose, try to get it as clear as possible. Giving it a good blow will make the rinse easier to do and more effective. Take a look at your nasal discharge when you blow your nose. If it’s clear and watery, it’s likely to be due to allergies or a common cold. A nasal rinse is an appropriate treatment in these cases. If your mucus is yellowish, green, or brown, you may have a sinus infection, which requires antibiotic treatment prescribed by a healthcare professional."

      "content": "Go to a sink to prevent a mess. To use the nasal rinse, you have to be near a sink or some other place that can catch the dirty water. The water will travel into 1 nostril and out the other, so make sure it has somewhere to go.

      "title": "Fill your irrigation device.",
      "content": "Fill your irrigation device. Draw some fluid into the bulb or syringe or pour the rinse into your neti pot. Draw about 4 milliliters (0.1 fl oz) of nasal rinse into a bulb or syringe if you are using one. If using a neti pot, fill it about halfway full. [4] X Research source Make sure that whatever you are using to administer the rinse is clean and disinfected before filling it up with rinse."

      "title": "Place the tip of the irrigation device in 1 nostril.",
      "content": "Place the tip of the irrigation device in 1 nostril. Pick whichever nostril you would like to flush first. You need to create a seal when you insert the device so no air can get out of that nostril.

      "title": "Tilt your head to the side with the open nostril and slowly release the rinse.",
      "content": "Tilt your head to the side with the open nostril and slowly release the rinse. If you are using a neti pot, the rinse will flow into the sinuses as you tilt your head. If using a bulb or syringe, slowly press it to release the rinse. Allow the solution to drain out the other nostril. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ideally the rinse will pass into 1 nostril and run out of your other nostril, flushing out mucus, dust, and pollen. You may need to adjust the tilt of your head as you begin to apply the rinse. The goal is to find an angle that allows the rinse to run through the sinuses and out the other nostril, not down your throat. Repeat the process in the other nostril."

      "title": "Avoid breathing through your nose as you are flushing.",
      "content": "Avoid breathing through your nose as you are flushing. Always breathe through your mouth while using the nasal rinse. This will prevent the rinse from entering your throat, which can cause you to cough and may be uncomfortable."

      "content": "Use a nasal rinse once a day for cleansing. While rinsing out your nasal passages can provide great relief and can help keep your sinuses healthy, doing it too much is also not great. Using it more than once a day can irritate the mucus lining of the sinuses, so stick to a single use in a day.

Store-bought saline rinses and sprays in ready-to-use applicators are a quick and easy alternative to irrigation devices such as neti pots. These rinses come in disposable containers with sterile applicator tips. Follow the directions on the package for proper use.

This container should be big enough to hold about 2 cups (about .5 liters) of liquid. [8] X Research source Glass or BPA-free plastic are both good container materials to consider. Always remember to wash your hands before and after creating your nasal rinse. This will avoid cross-contamination and the introduction of microorganisms or viruses."

      "content": "Add boiled or distilled water. You need the water to be pure of irritating chemicals and minerals, which can be present in tap water. To avoid this, either buy distilled water or boil your tap water for 3-5 minutes and then let it cool down to lukewarm. Once you have the water ready, add 1 cup (237 ml) of it to your dry ingredients. [10] X Research source Stir the mixture until the salt and baking soda have dissolved, or until the water is clear. If you boiled the water, wait until the solution cools to a lukewarm temperature before using it. A homemade nasal rinse can be stored for 3 days at room temperature."
