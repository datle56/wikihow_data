However, you can create custom Snapchat stories for specific audiences. But how do you know if a story is private? It has a ðŸ”’ on it! [1] X Research source When a story is private, unapproved friends wonâ€™t see a story in their feed. The lock only appears on stories. Regular snaps are sent individually, so youâ€™ll only see a normal snap if it was meant for you in the first place. The lock will be purple if you havenâ€™t watched a private story yet, or gray if youâ€™ve viewed it. Itâ€™s also gray in your profile if you want to make your own custom story. If youâ€™re brand new to Snapchat, a story refers to snaps that you post for people to open at their leisure. Unlike normal snaps you send individually, a story wonâ€™t pop up in someoneâ€™s inbox."

      "content": "Yes, the fact that you can see the story means itâ€™s meant for you. The story wouldnâ€™t pop up in your feed if you werenâ€™t able to view it. This means that your friend went out of their way to select your name so that you could see the story. [2] X Research source You should feel honored! The lock simply means that other people may not be able to view the story."

      "content": "People make private stories because itâ€™s faster than sending snaps. If you know that you want to send a single snap to a large number of people, crafting a private story is a tad bit faster than shooting a regular snap and sending it out to a bunch of people individually. Sending the individual snaps isnâ€™t a massive time sink, but making a private story is just a lot more streamlined. You can select who views your story from an alphabetized contact list. In contrast, when you send a normal snap, your friends list is sorted based on streaks (how often you send them snaps), which can be kind of clunky to sift through."

      "title": "A user might make a story private to keep certain people from seeing it.",
      "content": "A user might make a story private to keep certain people from seeing it. Private stories are a great way to invite specific people to a party or share personal news without letting everyone see it. If youâ€™re only trying to share something with a specific group of people (like close friends, coworkers, or family members), a private story will prevent folks you only talk to occasionally from seeing it. If you accept random friend requests, making a story private is a good idea if youâ€™re revealing any personal info on the app . Itâ€™s better to be safe than sorry! You may also want to hide a story if youâ€™re doing something in a snap that certain people may not approve of. If youâ€™ve got a sibling who hates people who drink, you may want to block them from seeing footage of you at a party, for example."

When you send a normal snap, you select who to send it to after you shoot the video or take a photo.

There are three ways you can add content to your private story: The Snaps tab allows you to pick from Snaps you've already created. Tap on one to add it to your private story. The Camera Roll tab allows you to pick from photos on your phone to add to your private story. Tap it to add it to your private story. The camera icon in the upper-right corner allows you to record a new Snap to add to your private story. Simply record a Snap like you would normally, then add it to your private story."
