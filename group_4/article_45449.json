      "content": "Understand why girls may act differently. When a man is confused by a woman, he may dismiss her behavior as crazy or irrational. However, everyone has reasons for what they doâ€”you just need to look more closely to see the logic behind the differences. For women, many of these behavioral differences have something to do with a thing called \"socialization.\" Socialization is all of the positive and negative influences the world and other people have on a person; it affects their personality, beliefs, attitudes, and worldview. [1] X Research source Some examples of socialization include: The idea of \"girl toys\" and \"boy toys.\" Some people have started to defy this idea in recent years; however, it's still a general rule that dolls and kitchen sets are \"for girls\" and trucks and toy weapons are \"for boys.\" The belief that femininity is inferior. Typically this is an undertone, not overt. Think about it: calling a girl \"boyish\" or a \"tomboy\" is a harmless description, while calling a boy \"girly\" is an insult. \"Chick flicks\" are made fun of. Stereotypically female pastimes, such as shopping and getting beauty treatments, are seen as shallow or silly, even by many girls, who consider themselves superior for liking sports or books. Cultural standards of beauty. In most Western nations, the ideal woman, according to TV and magazines, is thin but curvy, with flawless skin and gorgeous hair. This gives girls an impossible standard to strive for. You should consider her feelings, needs, experiences, and concerns to understand her."

      "content": "Recognize that girls are socialized to hide feelings too, just in different ways than boys are. A \"good girl\" is quiet, obedient, and very, very polite. Thus, girls might feel that it is inconvenient to others if they express less-than-cheerful feelings, or say that they are upset by something you did. Girls may be discouraged from expressing anger, or even asserting themselves. Thus, some of them end up repressing a lot."

      "content": "She may seem aloof if she is upset about something. She may talk less, be physically farther from you, or look elsewhere. She might seem disinterested, stressed, or sad. Asking \"What's wrong?\" may work, but it could also result in an \"I don't know\" or an untruthful \"Nothing.\" This is usually a sign that she's afraid of asserting herself. You can ask more specific questions (e.g. \"Have I done something to upset you?\") or you can say \"I'm willing to listen if you'd like to talk about it.\""

      "content": "She may pretend that things are fine when they aren't. Some women are very reluctant to express needs or wants, because they feel like they aren't supposed to. This, obviously, isn't healthy. She will act differently than normal, and probably break down or start talking if you gently ask if something is wrong once or twice. Many girls don't show when they are struggling, no matter how much they would like to be comforted or helped."

      "content": "She may act like you don't care about her if she's mad at you. Girls might act cold and aloof when you have upset them. Conversations with you may be cut short, and she may seem hurt or frustrated. She might suddenly prefer the company of other people. In this case, it's especially important to ask her what is wrong. After that conversation, give her a reminder of how much you love her (a big hug, kind words, giving ice cream, a romantic date, etc.)."

      "content": "She may become quiet if you say something that upsets her. Some girls don't feel comfortable with speaking up when they disagree, so instead she may withdraw. This is especially likely if you are saying something rude or insensitive, or are insulting something or someone she cares about. Ask what is wrong before you assume it is your fault. For example, maybe you mentioned a person who was being a total jerk, and it reminded her of the guy who has been bullying her. Her sadness may not be your fault."

This gives you an opportunity to comfort her. [2] X Research source If it's a bad time, be upfront and reschedule or offer an alternative. Offering a different opportunity to connect shows her that your saying \"no\" to her is not a rejection of her, just a sign of bad timing."

      "content": "Recognize that she may talk about the things she secretly wants. Since girls may be afraid to ask for what they want outright, they may talk about something they want in the hopes that you'll notice and do it for them. If she gushes about a romantic gesture that her friend's boyfriend did, it may be that she'd love a similar romantic gesture from you. For example, \"Picnics are so romantic\" might mean \"I'd love to go on a picnic with you sometime, especially if you surprised me.\""

      "content": "Keep in mind that extra niceness can be a sign of insecurity. Sometimes, when she goes the extra mile for you, it's because she fears losing you and she wants to please you. If she's nervously doing something nice for you, it might be worth asking her if she's worried about something, and reassuring her that you're not going anywhere. Don't jump to conclusions, though: nice gestures don't always mean something is worrying her. They can also mean that she really likes you, or is in a very good mood, or thinks you make her happy and wants to make you happy too."

Listening is more than hearing her words: don't distract yourself, ask questions to help you understand, and focus on what she is saying (not on what you are going to say). Try validating her feelings to encourage her to work through her feelings. (It can also help her feel better if she's stressed.)

      "content": "Notice her mannerisms and coping mechanisms when she's stressed. Everyone handles difficult situations differently. Maybe she takes a walk, boxes with a punching bag, talks to her older sister, or becomes incredibly sweet. When you know she's having a hard time, pay attention to what she does to cope. This can help you notice problems even when she is feigning a smile. If you notice that a certain coping mechanism soothes her, keep it in mind so you can help. For example, perhaps you've noticed that your wife likes to play with the dog to calm down. When you see her stressed out at a family reunion, you could quietly mention that the dog might need a walk. This gives her an opportunity to go unwind if she wants."

If you listen closely and let her take as much time as she needs to talk, she will probably reveal what is on her mind. [4] X Research source Validate her feelings. Being nonjudgmental is key. Seek to understand first, and then try to work together to fix the problem. If you upset her, don't defend yourself. Take a deep breath, be strong, and listen. Apologize for hurting her. It is okay to explain your actions, but don't try to excuse them."

It could be anything from computer programming to punk rock. If you are romantically interested in her, try learning a bit about the subject. Ask her to teach you something, or look it up independently. See if her favorite topics overlap with things you like. This could be a great way to connect."
