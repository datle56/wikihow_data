Since this test will determine if photosynthesis has occurred in your leaf, make sure that the leaf you choose has had at least a few hours of recent exposure to sunlight.

      "content": "Boil 250 mL (8.5 fl oz) of water. Fill a beaker halfway with water, and allow it to come to a boil using a Bunsen burner or hot plate. Always use caution when working with heat by wearing gloves that protect against burns and other heat-related injuries. Make sure to keep your water at its boiling point. [3] X Research source A Bunsen burner is a type of gas burner that heats liquids and solids in chemical experiments."

      "content": "Use your forceps to place your leaf in boiling water for 2 minutes. When placing your leaf into the boiling water, be sure to use your forceps (pincers, tongs or similar objects) to avoid any possible injury during this process. Boiling your leaf in the water will prevent any other chemical reactions from taking place in your leaf before you test for starch. This will allow you to get the most accurate results possible. [4] X Research source Your leaf will be done boiling when it has become completely soft. [5] X Research source Boiling your leaf will remove the waxy covering or cuticle that may prevent the entry of the iodine. [6] X Research source"

As you remove your leaf, make sure to turn off your Bunsen burner right away. [7] X Research source It is not necessary to turn off hot plates or electric water baths at this time.

      "content": "Place the leaf into a boiling tube containing 90% ethanol. Try to get your leaf as close to the bottom of the boiling tube as possible. Keep your ethanol away from any open flames. Always wear safety goggles when using ethanol and other chemicals. Make sure that the amount of ethanol in the boiling tube is enough to completely cover your leaf. [9] X Research source A boiling tube is a cylinder tube of thin glass. It will be open on one end and will be able to withstand extreme temperatures. A test tube is suitable for this experiment."

      "content": "Boil your leaf for 10 minutes. While your leaf is in the boiling tube, place the tube in the hot water. You should let it boil for approximately 10 minutes, however, if your leaf decolorizes before that, go ahead and remove it from the heat. [10] X Research source It is better to use a hot plate or water bath for this step as ethanol is extremely flammable. You may need to replenish your ethanol levels if the ethanol is no longer covering your leaf completely. [11] X Research source Your leaf is done boiling when all of the green coloring is transferred to the ethanol, leaving your leaf colorless. [12] X Research source"

Ensure that your leaf stays intact during the removal process and rinse with a tiny bit of cold water. Make sure you are wearing your protective goggles and heat-resistant gloves. [13] X Research source Boiling your leaf in ethanol will cause it to become brittle. By adding a small amount of cold water, it will help the leaf regain a soft texture."

This will help provide clarity when looking at the results of your starch test. [14] X Research source You can also place your leaf in a petri dish, rather than placing it directly on the white tile.

While a few drops should be enough to cover your entire leaf, continue to add 1 drop at a time if your leaf is not fully covered.
