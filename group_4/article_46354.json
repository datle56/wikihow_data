      "content": "Fill a one-quart pot with water. Boil the water on the stove for a minute or two or until it is steaming vigorously. Then remove the pot from the heat. [1] X Research source Place the hot pot on a heat resistant mat on a table. Keep any children away from the pot while it is boiling and while it is steaming. Try to do a steaming treatment when there aren't any children around."

      "content": "Cover your head. Drape a large, clean cotton towel over your head and then place your head over the steaming pot. Close your eyes and keep your face at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the water. You want the heat to enter your nose and throat, but you certainly don’t want to damage or burn yourself."

      "content": "Consider steaming on the go. If you're busy and not able to boil a pot of water and sit over it, consider placing your face over the steam coming from a hot tea or bowl of soup when you're at work or out and about. The goal and effect is still the same, even if the source of steam is different! A humidifier can also be utilized for this method of relieving the sinuses."

If you don't notice any irritation or other reaction, reheat the water and do the full steam treatment."

      "title": "Use a humidifier.",
      "content": "Use a humidifier. To help improve the health of your sinuses, place a humidifier in your bedroom while you sleep. A humidifier produces steam and moist air, which will help clear out the nasal passages. [10] X Research source When your nasal passages are blocked, you need to focus on keeping your nasal passages and sinuses moist. Although many people think that if you have a runny nose, that dry air is the trick, dry air only further irritates the membranes in your nasal passage. Humidifiers are especially good during the wintertime because the air in most homes is very dry due to central heating. [11] X Research source Even placing a hot water bottle near the ear may have a similar effect and help to draw out ear fluid."

The hot water from the shower creates warm, moist air that is useful in clearing out blocked nasal passages and relieving sinus pressure.

Make sure that you drink lots of water (at least 8 full glasses a day) because this will thin out your mucus and can help prevent sinuses blockages, and thereby ease pressure.
