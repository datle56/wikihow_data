      "title": "Double tap the forward key.",
      "content": "Double tap the forward key. This is W by default. Press and hold after double-tapping to keep sprinting forward. You will move 30% faster than usual, and your field of view will become slightly wider. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the sprint key instead.",
      "content": "Use the sprint key instead. Tap left control while moving forward to start sprinting. If this doesn't work, open the Esc menu and go to Options â†’ Controls to assign a key to sprint."

      "title": "Stop moving to stop sprinting.",
      "content": "Stop moving to stop sprinting. Your character will continue to sprint until you release the forward key, collide with a block, or interact with a mob. If you tapped the sprint key, you will stop sprinting after thirty seconds, but can turn it on again right away. You can turn left and right as usual while sprinting, though this slows you down slightly. [2] X Research source While sprinting, you can jump four blocks horizontally instead of two. Your jump height does not increase. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Stay above six hunger.",
      "content": "Stay above six hunger. You can only sprint while you have at least six hunger (three food symbols in your hunger bar). Eat some food and try again if your stomach is empty. Sprinting uses up your saturation and hunger 10 times faster than walking. Jumping while sprinting uses them up 80 times faster than walking. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Sprint with other modes of transportation.",
      "content": "Sprint with other modes of transportation. You can hit the sprint key while swimming as well, or while flying in Creative mode. This will only increase your speed a little bit, but your field of vision will widen. If you are on a vehicle or mount, your field of vision will widen but your speed will remain the same. If you don't use the sprint key, instead start sprinting on the ground, then double tap space to start flying."

    {
      "title": "Flick the left analog stick forward twice.",
      "content": "Flick the left analog stick forward twice. This is the same stick you push forward to walk normally. To sprint, just push it forward twice, as fast as you can."

    {
      "title": "Hold forward to keep sprinting.",
      "content": "Hold forward to keep sprinting. After the second push, keep the stick forward. Your character will continue to sprint until you release the analog stick, collide with a block, or interact with a mob."

      "content": "Keep your hunger above six. If you drop below six hunger (three food symbols), you cannot sprint. [5] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Double tap forward.",
      "content": "Double tap forward. Touch the forward button twice and hold it down to sprint. You will move at double speed, but will use up hunger much faster than walking. While sprinting, you can jump three blocks forward instead of two."

      "title": "Stop moving to stop sprinting.",
      "content": "Stop moving to stop sprinting. To return to normal speed, just let go of the forward button, then walk forward again with a single tap. You will also stop sprinting if you collide with a block or fight a mob."

      "title": "Eat food if your hunger is low.",
      "content": "Eat food if your hunger is low. Your Minecraft character needs energy for all that running. If your hunger drops below four food symbols, you cannot sprint. If your version of Minecraft does not have hunger, you are playing an old version that does not have sprinting.
