      "title": "Use letterhead if you have it.",
      "content": "Use letterhead if you have it. Particularly if you are writing your letter in a professional capacity, letterhead from your company or firm is preferred for a letter of attestation. Don't use company letterhead, however, if you're writing in your personal capacity. For example, if you're writing an attestation letter for a former employee to attest to their skills and expertise, you would want to use company letterhead. If you're writing an attestation letter for yourself, don't use company letterhead if the subject of the letter has nothing to do with your work for the company."

      "content": "Choose a readable font. For an attestation letter, you typically want to use a more formal, conservative font such as Times New Roman. This font is available on any word processing application.

    {
      "title": "Date your letter.",
      "content": "Date your letter. The top line of your letter should be the date you are writing the letter. You may want to post date the letter if you don't think you're going to be able to mail it for a day or two. Write out the month rather than using numerals. If you're using a business letter template through your word processing application, it may insert the current date by default."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include the address of the recipient.",
      "content": "Include the address of the recipient. Include the full name of the recipient, if known, and their job title. If you're simply writing your letter to a school, company, or professional board, the name of the entity is sufficient. Addresses on business letters are typically done in block format, similar to the way you would write them on an envelope. If you're using a template from your word processing app, it will already have these text boxes set up for you. If you're not using letterhead, the first block on your letter would be your name and address. You would then follow with the recipient's name and address."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide a subject line.",
      "content": "Provide a subject line. The subject line tells the recipient what the letter is about. This is particularly important if you're not sending the letter to a specific person. Whoever opens it needs to know how to direct it so the right person sees it. [2] X Research source The subject line typically will be the reason you're writing the attestation letter. If you're writing the letter for another person, you might use their name as the subject line. For example, you might write: \"Attestation Letter for Sally Sunshine.\""

      "content": "Create your signature block. Skip down a few lines to leave space for the body of your letter, then go ahead and format the area where you'll place your signature . Use a basic closing such as \"Sincerely,\" drop down four lines, then type your first and last name. [3] X Research source If you're planning on getting your letter notarized , you'll also want to include a notary block. Search online for a notary block you can copy.

      "content": "Address the letter to the appropriate individual or entity. Typically, you don't need to start with the word \"Dear\" in the salutation of a formal business letter. Simply type the name of the individual or department that will receive the letter. [4] X Research source For example, if you are writing an attestation letter certifying that you have met the continuing education requirements for a license, you might address it \"Licensing Board\" followed by a colon. Use the name of the specific department or board when possible, rather than addressing it \"To Whom It May Concern.\" If you're writing an attestation letter on behalf of another individual, such as a former employee, try to address it to the recipient by name if at all possible."

      "content": "Introduce yourself if appropriate. Particularly if you're writing an attestation letter on behalf of someone else, use the first paragraph of your letter to explain who you are. Include your relationship to the person and any applicable certifications you have. [5] X Research source For example, if you're writing an attestation letter for a former employee, you might begin by describing your job title in the company and how long you've been working there. If you're writing the letter for yourself, you may not need any introduction other than your name. For example, you might write \"I, Sally Sunshine, attest that I completed the weekend seminar in Sunny Valley, held October 3 - 7.\" For that sort of attestation letter, the body of the letter typically would only be a sentence or two."

You may choose to include it in the first sentence, then continue to introduce yourself.

There should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) on all sides of the page. If your letter is more than one page, make sure the pages are numbered.
