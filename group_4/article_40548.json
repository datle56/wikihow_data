      "content": "Choose a few calisthenic exercises to target every part of your body. You can do pushups , pullups, squats and lunges , crunches, jumping jacks, and more if you’re creating a training program. A calisthenic is any exercise where you lift your own body weight, so there are literally hundreds of options out there. Start by picking 5 exercises that seem fun to you for a basic routine, and cover all of your bases by including exercises that work your upper body, core, and lower body. [2] X Research source For your upper body, there’s no real substitute for pushups! Chin-ups and pullups are great if you want to focus on your shoulders, while dips are a great way to target your triceps. Crunches , sit-ups, Russian twists, and deadbugs are great for working your core. You can also use planks if you’re looking for something a little less intense. [3] X Expert Source Landis Owens Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 8 June 2021. To target the lower body, you could do squats, box jumps, or lunges. [4] X Expert Source Landis Owens Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 8 June 2021. Most calisthenic exercises that target your lower body will also strengthen your back and hips. Some calisthenic exercises are designed to target the whole body. The burpee is a great option for this, but burpees can be a little rough if you’re just starting out."

      "content": "Start with a low number of reps and work your way up over time. To start a calisthenic routine, the most popular strategy is to start with a set number of repetitions for each exercise (usually 5 or 10), and then increase the number of repetitions over time to improve your endurance. When you’re starting out, focus on your form and master that before you increase the number of reps. [5] X Research source If your goal is to build muscle, you can put a weighted vest on or use resistance bands to increase the amount of effort you need to put into each rep. This is a great way to make your calisthenic routine more interesting after you have the form down! [6] X Research source There are high-intensity calisthenic routines out there that involve advanced exercises. [7] X Research source These are not ideal if you’re just starting out."

      "title": "Yes, calisthenics will help you develop your muscles.",
      "content": "Yes, calisthenics will help you develop your muscles. When you lift your body’s natural weight, it’s basically the same thing as lifting a free-weight. Any kind of weight-resistance exercise will help you build muscle, and calisthenics are no different. [8] X Research source However, since you can’t control the weight and calisthenics burn a lot of calories, calisthenics aren’t necessarily the fastest or most efficient way to bulk up. They will certainly make you stronger and help with muscle definition, though. [9] X Research source You are less likely to build muscle if you’re especially skinny or you have a low BMI. The reasoning here is that calisthenics rely on your body weight as the main form of resistance. If you don’t weigh a lot, you aren’t putting that much stress on your muscles. You’ll still build muscle, but you won’t see big gains right away."

      "content": "You can add a weighted vest or ankle weights to increase your muscle growth. If your main goal is to lose weight or improve your flexibility, don’t focus on adding weight. But if you are interested in bigger muscles, get a weighted vest or ankle weights and wear them while you do your exercises. [10] X Research source If you want that body builder look, lifting weights is really the best way to go. You can still do calisthenics, but incorporate at least 2-3 days of weight lifting into your weekly exercise schedule."

      "content": "Calisthenics can definitely help you burn fat and lose weight. Since calisthenics increase your heart rate and get your body moving, they will help you lose weight. If weight loss is your main goal, be sure to incorporate squats and jumping jacks in your routine. These are two of the best exercises if you want to burn fat since they work your entire body and keep you sweating. [11] X Research source"

Your diet and lifestyle are much more important when it comes to losing weight. Even when you start shedding pounds with a calisthenic program, you’re likely to put the weight back on if you aren’t eating a healthy diet.

If you aren’t doing any weightlifting or high-intensity workouts and you want to lose weight, do calisthenics for at least 30 minutes every day. This is the best way to consistently burn through calories without putting a ton of stress on your body. [13] X Research source The great thing about calisthenics is that you don’t need any crazy equipment and you can do them basically anywhere in your home. One easy way to get your 30 minutes of exercise in is to throw on a TV show that lasts 30 minutes and just work out while you’re watching it."

If you are doing any weight lifting or high-intensity training, you need to take days off in between workouts. Do your calisthenics on your rest days to burn through some calories and tone your muscles without putting too much pressure on your body. If you’re doing some kind of high-intensity calisthenic training, treat the calisthenics like a form of weight lifting. Take at least one day off after each workout to give your muscles time to recover."

Just focus on eating a healthy diet that’s low in red meat, fat, and sugar. Try to consume a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Cut out the junk food and avoid sugary drinks, since these are full of empty calories.

Hydration is really important when it comes to any exercise routines. Drink 2–3 cups (470–710 mL) of water before and after you work out.
