      "title": "Write it out.",
      "content": "Write it out. If you're afraid you'll get flustered, it's perfectly fine to write out what you think you'll say. This can help you process what you want to say so that you can present your new relationship in the best way possible. That way, when the time comes, you'll be able to get it out without stopping. [1] X Research source As you write out what you might say, you may try to anticipate your parents' responses. That way you can answer their concerns as you tell them about your boyfriend."

    {
      "title": "Practice delivering the news.",
      "content": "Practice delivering the news. It's normal to feel apprehensive about telling your parents about your new relationship. Practicing what you'll say to them can make it easier. Use a friend or understanding relative for practice. You can also practice in front of a mirror. [2] X Research source Ask someone you trust to help, not someone who may reveal your news before you're ready. For example, choose a cousin you're close to rather than an older sibling, who might feel obligated to tell your parents."
    },
    {
      "title": "Figure out who to tell first.",
      "content": "Figure out who to tell first. You might have a parent you feel closer to or maybe one of your parents tends to be more lenient than the other. Oftentimes, breaking the news to a parent who is easier to talk to can clear the way for talking to the other parent. For instance, if you grew up as a \"daddy's girl,\" meaning you can now wrap him around your little finger, you might start with your dad. On the other hand, if your dad tends to be overprotective, you might start with your mother instead. This approach can be an especially helpful idea if you are a teenager with your first boyfriend. On the other hand, if you think both of your parents will take it equally well (or badly), just rip off the bandaid and tell them both at the same time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pick a good time.",
      "content": "Pick a good time. You don't want to tell your parents when they are busy with something else or when they aren't in a good mood. If you want, you can ask them when a good time to talk would be. Try to choose a time when the house is calm, and your parents are not stressed or distracted by something else. [3] X Research source However, don't use picking a good time as a way to continually put off telling them. You will need to tell them eventually, so you might as well get it over with."
    },
    {
      "title": "Identify what you're feeling.",
      "content": "Identify what you're feeling. You are hesitating about telling your parents for a reason. Do you think that your parents will be mad because you're dating? Maybe you think they won't approve of the person you're dating. On the other hand, maybe you just prefer to keep your personal life private. Knowing what you're feeling is important because you can use that in the discussion. [4] X Research source For instance, if you think that your parents think that you aren't ready to date, you could say, \"Mom and Dad, I need to talk to you about something. I've been a little hesitant to tell you that I have a boyfriend because I think you think that I'm not old enough.\""

    {
      "title": "Get it over with.",
      "content": "Get it over with. Once you sit down, you just need to get the conversation over with. Don't beat around the bush. However, you can soften the blow with qualifiers. For instance, you could say, \"I really love you two, and I don't want to make you mad. Also, I really want to be honest with you about my life. I want to tell you about the boy that I've started dating.\""

    {
      "title": "Talk about why you feel you are ready to date.",
      "content": "Talk about why you feel you are ready to date. If you are trying to make a case for dating, lay out the reasons why you think you should be able to. For instance, maybe you think that you should be able to date because you are in high school, and most people your age are allowed to date. Be reasonable, and don't get angry if your parents don't agree. Your parents probably won't respond well to \"But everyone else is doing it!\" However, you can pull statistics off the internet about the average age that people start dating, and you can bring up points about how you've shown your maturity in the last year."

    {
      "title": "Be willing to negotiate.",
      "content": "Be willing to negotiate. If your parents don't want you to date and you're asking them to let you, you need to be willing to compromise. Maybe you can suggest that you only see your boyfriend at school or that you only go on group dates with other people. Your parents just want to protect you, so you have to be willing to give up some of your freedom. [5] X Research source Listen to what your parents have to say and consider if their concerns are legitimate. Although they may be frustrating sometimes, remember that your parents are older and have more experience than you do. They may spot red flags or issues of concern that you haven't experienced yet. If they express concerns, watch out for signs that they could be true."

      "title": "Discuss the person.",
      "content": "Discuss the person. Tell your parents about your boyfriend. Talk to them about his family and what you like about him. Highlight his good qualities so they get a sense of who he is. It's also helpful to have a photo for them to see. Your parents will probably have many, many questions. It is advisable to answer every question as honestly and fully as possible to reassure them about your new relationship. If you try to hide or lie about something, your parents may become suspicious and anxious. If your boyfriend has a good relationship with his family, make sure your parents know. This trait is a major plus for many parents because it lets them know that this new guy in your life knows how to value others and can appreciate the tight ties of family."

      "content": "Don't try to hide it. One of the most important things to do if you want your parents to accept your boyfriend is to be the one to tell them about your relationship. If they find out about your relationship from someone else, they may assume that you were trying to hide it because you felt you were doing something wrong. [6] X Research source You should tell your parents about your boyfriend even if you do not plan to make any formal introductions any time soon. As a general rule, the sooner you own up to the relationship, the better. Avoiding the conversation will only make it harder to have eventually and will increase the odds that your parents may find out from another source. Once you get older and have already moved out of the house, you do not necessarily need to bring up every date or every boyfriend you have. Wait until a guy comes along that you can exclusively and seriously commit to before getting everyone worked up."

      "content": "Wait on the negatives. If you know something about your boyfriend is going to bother your parents, don't start the conversation with that. Instead, wait until the middle or end of the conversation to talk about it. For instance, if your boyfriend is older than you, you might want to hold off on that bit of news until near the end of the conversation."

      "title": "Give it time.",
      "content": "Give it time. It may take a little while for your parents to get used to the idea. If they get upset while you are talking to them and tell you \"no,\" they might change their minds later when they've cooled down a bit. Either way, you need to respect the fact that you still need to have a relationship with them, meaning you can't just write them off as evil because they told you no. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait until the time is right. This kind of discussion is a difficult one, especially if you aren't sure how your parents will react. Wait until you feel comfortable having the discussion. It can be hard if you're questioning your sexuality, as your parents may try to convince you're actually not gay. [9] X Research source If you show any hesitation about your sexuality, your parents are likely to ask questions such as \"Are you sure?\" It's okay to discuss your feelings and reservations with them. – Just realize that they may want to ask if you're positive about your feelings. If you're not 100% sure, it's okay. You can have feelings for another guy now, yet decide later that you prefer women. Sexuality can change over time. But even if that happens later on, it does not invalidate your current feelings or your current relationship."

      "content": "Do a practice run. While coming out to anybody is difficult, try coming out to someone who you know is sympathetic first. For instance, if you have a gay friend or know someone who is a gay ally, talk to them about your sexuality before addressing it with your parents. It's very hard to say the first time, so trying it out on someone else first can make it slightly easier on you when you do go to your parents. Plus, the person may be able to give you some tips if they’re gay. Just be sure you completely trust the person first. [10] X Research source"

That is, if you think your parents may kick you out or even be physically violent with you, it's best to wait until you are able to support yourself. [14] X Research source You may also not want to tell them if you are emotionally insecure, and you know they would come down very harshly on you. [15] X Research source Prepare ahead of time for how to deal with a bad reaction from your parents. Plan where you will go if things get heated, and know who you can turn to for emotional support. You can get help with coming out from a nonprofit center dedicated to LGBTQ issues, such as The Trevor Project."

On the other hand, they probably have some legitimate concerns that you should take into consideration. [16] X Research source Calmly and politely ask your parents why they do not approve of your boyfriend. Maybe a trait of his makes them feel anxious, and that anxiety could very well have validity and be something you should think more deeply about. Even if the reasons they give do not seem significant, listening to their doubts and fears will give you an idea of what you need to do to convince them that the relationship is okay after all."

Good parents take the job of protecting their children very seriously, so it is only natural that they may have to struggle to accept the fact that you are growing up. Try having a little compassion for them. [17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Along with being compassionate, you should also be respectful. No matter how the conversation goes, you should treat your parents with respect. If you can disagree with them about something in a respectful way, your parents are likely to feel less upset and may eventually be persuaded to change their minds. Remember that one reason for refusing an engagement is the risk of early pregnancy, and especially that she doesn't want the responsibility. There may be other reasons: Maybe they're a bad student. They don't work, they're idle and they live off their parents. They're involved in criminal or drug-related gangs. They have a reputation for being unfaithful and flirtatious."

The more you talk things through, the better both sides will be able to understand each other. You may even get your parents to relent. [19] X Research source You should also provide more opportunities for your parents to get to know your boyfriend. The more time they spend with him, the more accurate their perception of him will be. If he really is a good guy, they might eventually drop their guard long enough to see that. It's a good idea to arrange a casual meeting before you tell your parents about your relationship. For example, your boyfriend could attend a group hangout in your home with other friends. This allows your parents to become familiar with him."

Together, the two of you might be able to figure out some way of convincing your parents to confer their blessing upon you. [20] X Research source If your parents have never met the guy, he might offer to introduce himself to them as a way of easing their minds. If your parents offered specific reasons for why they do not approve of your boyfriend, letting him know about these reasons may prompt him to try to fix whatever behavior or condition has them feeling anxious."

Adults tend to relate to each other better than they relate to teenagers, so if two respectable adults approach your parents and defend your relationship, offering their assurances about their son in the process, your parents might be willing to take this new evidence into careful consideration."
