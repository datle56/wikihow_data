      "content": "Keep single-use face masks in a cool, dry place. If you buy small packets of creamy face masks, keep them in a drawer or cupboard in your bathroom. Make sure they're out of direct sunlight and away from sources of heat. For instance, face masks are best stored in a drawer far away from the shower or from the area where you blow-dry your hair."

      "title": "Make sure the container is fully closed.",
      "content": "Make sure the container is fully closed. If the face mask is in a squeeze bottle, be sure to close the cap so it's sealed. Inspect the cap of squeeze bottles to ensure the top can fully close. You may need to wipe away any residue around where the mask squeezes out to ensure a tight fit. [1] X Research source If the face mask is in a small jar, twist the top to the right as far as you can to ensure it's airtight. If the cap or lid of the face mask is cracked or damaged, place the container in a plastic zipper bag. Squeeze out all of the air before you seal it. Masks containing vitamin C and vitamin A especially need to be airtight because the vitamins can deactivate at a faster rate when they’re exposed to air."

      "content": "Preserve clay or mud-based face masks in an airtight, non-metallic jar. If you bought a face mask that says \"living clay\" on the container, it's best to keep it in the container it came in. It will either be made from opaque glass, ceramic, or stone. Make sure the lid is screwed on tight. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Place the container in a drawer at room temperature. Don’t put it in the refrigerator because it can harden the clay, making it more difficult to scoop out when you’re ready to use it. For long-term storage, open the lid and use a clean spoon or your finger to scrape the sides and the rim of the container. Incorporate the side scrapings into the main body of the product to keep it from going dry. Clay-based face masks can get thicker the longer they sit around, so add water if you want to loosen it up and make it easier to apply."

      "content": "Store eye masks in the door of your refrigerator for extra benefits. When it comes to de-puffing your eyes in the morning, putting eye creams and serums in the fridge is ideal. Make sure the jar or lid is sealed. If any part of the package or container is damaged, place it in a plastic zipper bag, squeeze out the air, and seal it. However, if the package says to store it at room temperature, do that. Cooling down the cream or serum will help de-puff your eyes even more."

      "content": "Store masks made with dairy or vegetables in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. If you've made a mask from pumpkin, yogurt, eggs, or milk, scoop any leftovers into an airtight glass jar or plastic container and refrigerate it. The enzymes and probiotics in these ingredients will stay active for up to 3 days, so be sure to use the mask quickly. [3] X Research source Don't use metallic jars as some of the metallic enzymes may seep into the mixture."

      "title": "Preserve fruit-based masks in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Preserve fruit-based masks in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If you've made a mask from papaya, apple, banana, watermelon, kiwi, avocado, or strawberry, use a spoon to scoop the leftovers into an airtight glass jar or plastic container. The mask will stay fresh for up to 1 week. [4] X Research source To make avocado-based masks last longer, squeeze a little lemon juice onto the mixture or place the pit of the avocado into the mixture."

      "title": "Leave oil-based masks at room temperature in a sealed container.",
      "content": "Leave oil-based masks at room temperature in a sealed container. Masks made from coconut, olive, or any other kind of oil should be stored just like you would the oil itself. Scoop the leftovers into an airtight glass container and place it in the cupboard away from heat or light. However, if you add any perishable ingredients like fruit or vegetable puree, place the sealed container in the refrigerator. Take it out of the fridge about 15 to 20 minutes before you plan to apply the mask so it won't be hard or clumpy. Oil-based masks with other non-perishable ingredients (like essential oils, vitamin E, honey, or shelf-stable fruit extracts) will technically stay fresh for up to 2 years. But it’s best to use the homemade mix right away."

      "content": "Add natural preservatives to your homemade masks to extend their shelf life. Grapefruit seed extract, vitamin E oil, and aloe vera are excellent natural preservatives that can keep your homemade face masks fresh for longer. Add 3 to 4 drops of grapefruit seed extract or vitamin E oil or incorporate a scoop of aloe vera gel into your face masks for longevity. You can buy vitamin E oil at most drugstores or any beauty supply store. If they only have capsules, split 1 capsule with a knife and use a few drops. Grapefruit seed extract can be found online, at grocery stores with a natural beauty section, or most beauty supply stores."

Every face mask has different ingredients, so refer to the manufacturer's directions on the package to see the best way to store the product. Putting face masks in the refrigerator will affect the viscosity of the ingredients. [5] X Research source For instance, a face mask containing coconut oil that's been refrigerated may freeze and not function as well as it would if it had been stored at room temperature."
