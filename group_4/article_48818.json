      "title": "Air bubbles prevent your disposable vape from hitting.",
      "content": "Air bubbles prevent your disposable vape from hitting. As you take puffs from your Cake disposable, air bubbles can form in the cartridge. When the air bubbles reach the mouthpiece, they can stop the airflow temporarily and keep your vape from lighting up. [1] X Research source The Fix: Try flicking or tapping the side of the vape cartridge a few times to break apart the air bubbles."

      "title": "Debris or thickened vape liquid can block your vape’s mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Debris or thickened vape liquid can block your vape’s mouthpiece. Sometimes, pocket lint or other small debris finds its way inside the mouthpiece. Other times, taking long hits pulls oil into the mouthpiece, which can thicken and form a clog. If you have difficulty pulling from your Cake disposable, a clog could be the source of the problem. The Fix: Use a toothpick or paperclip to pick out any blockages inside of the mouthpiece. You may also try covering the air holes on the vape and taking a hit to force the clog out. Store your vape upright and take smaller hits to prevent clogs from forming."

      "title": "Your Cake pen won’t light up or work at all with a dead battery.",
      "content": "Your Cake pen won’t light up or work at all with a dead battery. Your Cake disposable may blink a few times to signal the battery is low, but it may not work at all if the battery is completely dead. Luckily, Cake disposables are rechargeable so you’re able to continue using it. [2] X Research source The Fix: Plug in your Cake disposable and let it charge completely before trying to take another hit."

    {
      "title": "Vape liquid can’t reach the coils inside when the wick is dry.",
      "content": "Vape liquid can’t reach the coils inside when the wick is dry. Vape wicks soak up the liquid inside so it can travel to the heated coils and change into vapor. When the wick is dried out, your Cake disposable won’t hit properly or it will have a weak, burnt flavor. [3] X Research source The Fix: Take a break from vaping for about 10 minutes so more liquid can soak into the wick. Gently shaking your Cake vape may also help the wick soak up more."

    {
      "title": "Your vape will automatically stop hitting if the battery gets too hot.",
      "content": "Your vape will automatically stop hitting if the battery gets too hot. If you leave your vape in hot temperatures or take multiple puffs without a break, the battery will stop working to prevent damage. Your vape may blink a few times or won’t light up at all to signal an overheated battery. [4] X Research source The Fix: Take a short break in between puffs so the battery has a chance to cool down. Take shorter, slower draws from your vape so it’s less likely to overheat."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cold vape liquid makes it more difficult to take a hit.",
      "content": "Cold vape liquid makes it more difficult to take a hit. When your Cake disposable is exposed to cold temperatures, it starts to thicken and doesn’t pull easily through the vape. This could prevent your vape from lighting up or working properly when you try taking a puff. [5] X Research source The Fix: Keep your vape in a warm area. Try warming it up in your hands for a few minutes before taking a hit to help make the liquid flow easier."

    {
      "title": "An empty vape cartridge won’t hit or light up.",
      "content": "An empty vape cartridge won’t hit or light up. As you use your Cake vape, it will burn through the liquid inside of the cartridge. If you notice the cartridge doesn’t have any liquid left inside or if the vape has a burnt flavor, then the tank is empty and causing the problem. [6] X Research source The Fix: Get a new Cake disposable vape since you aren’t able to refill the old one."

      "title": "A defect can make your vape faulty right out of the box.",
      "content": "A defect can make your vape faulty right out of the box. On rare occasions, Cake disposable vapes have manufacturing errors and won't work when you first use them. If none of the other fixes solved your problem, then you may just have a faulty device. [7] X Research source The Fix: Contact the seller and let them know that your vape isn’t working properly. They may be able to offer a replacement or refund."
