      "content": "Use a sharp knife to slice the watermelon into triangular chunks. Place the whole watermelon on a large cutting board. Cut the watermelon in half (lengthwise), then slice it into large half-moon or triangular pieces about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. [1] X Research source Have some paper towels handy to wipe up some of the juice. If this is how you’d like to serve the watermelon, skip the next step."

      "title": "Use a sharp knife to remove the rind from the flesh.",
      "content": "Use a sharp knife to remove the rind from the flesh. Place the blade of the knife right at the point where the ruby red flesh meets the white-greenish rind. Then, move the knife back and forth or, if the watermelon is ripe enough, glide the blade along the rind to separate it from the flesh. Repeat this step for each slice of watermelon. [2] X Research source Discard the rinds in a compost bin or save them for pickling if you like."

    {
      "title": "Slice each piece of watermelon flesh into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.",
      "content": "Slice each piece of watermelon flesh into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes. Use a knife to slice or dice the watermelon into cubes or rectangles. Feel free to slice it into smaller or larger chunks depending on how you plan to use the watermelon. [3] X Research source For example, if you’re adding it to a salad, you might want to have smaller chunks or slivers. And if you’re eating it by itself, larger cubes or rectangles might be more appropriate."

    {
      "title": "Sprinkle up to 1/4 teaspoon (1.4 grams) of salt onto each slice.",
      "content": "Sprinkle up to 1/4 teaspoon (1.4 grams) of salt onto each slice. Use your fingers or a salt shaker to sprinkle salt onto the flesh of the watermelon. Use as much or as little as you like. The salt will contrast with the natural sugars in the watermelon, making the sweet flavor more robust. [4] X Research source For a bowl of small watermelon chunks, a quick sprinkle with a salt shaker over the entire dish should do the trick. If you’ve added too much salt for your taste, simply scrape it off with your finger or rinse the watermelon piece under running water and try again. Use any type of salt you like: rock salt, pink salt, shaved salt, or regular table salt!"

    {
      "title": "Add brown or white sugar to watermelon for a quick, easy snack.",
      "content": "Add brown or white sugar to watermelon for a quick, easy snack. Use your fingers to grab a pinch of sugar and distribute it evenly on top of each cube or triangular chunk. Using brown sugar will give the watermelon hints of molasses and caramel while regular white sugar will add a rich sweetness. [5] X Research source You can also use powdered sugar, but it may create a chalky texture when it comes in contact with the moisture of the melon."

      "title": "Try soaking watermelon cubes in sugar water for 3 hours in the fridge.",
      "content": "Try soaking watermelon cubes in sugar water for 3 hours in the fridge. After you slice up the watermelon, place it into an airtight container. Then, place equal parts of water and sugar into a mixing bowl and stir it together with a whisk. Pour the sugar water over the watermelon when most or all of the sugar has dissolved. Place the lid on the container and refrigerate the melon chunks for about 3 hours so the sugar water can soak in. [6] X Research source Use enough sugar water to cover all or most of the watermelon chunks. For example, if you have 3 cups (681 grams) of watermelon cubes, you’ll need about 3 cups (710 mL) of water and 3 cups (681 grams) of sugar. Use less sugar if you don’t want to make it super sweet. Serve the watermelon with some mint or basil leaves to add a refreshing or sweet flavor element."

      "content": "Drizzle watermelon chunks with balsamic glaze for salads and snacks. Purchase premade balsamic glaze or make your own balsamic reduction over the stove. The sweet-tart flavor of the balsamic reduction will elevate the taste of the watermelon. [7] X Research source Add a fresh herbs like basil leaf or rosemary for an earthy-sweet flavor. Place the watermelon chunks on top of some fresh spring greens for a sweet and refreshing salad."

      "content": "Squeeze lemon or lime juice onto watermelon for a refreshing treat. Use a knife to slice a lemon or lime in half and squeeze about 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of juice over sliced or cubed watermelon. Some people find that a boost of acidity makes the melon taste sweeter. [8] X Research source Try adding salt and pepper to round out the flavor. Or, if you like spicy foods, add some cayenne or hot sauce!"

To make a quick sweet cream, simply stir together 1/2 cup (64 grams) of light sour cream and 3 tablespoons (43 g) of packed brown sugar. [9] X Research source Then, Place a dollop on top of a bowl of watermelon cubes or smear a spoonful onto each triangular chunk. Feel free to drizzle some honey or chocolate syrup on top for a decadent finish! You can also purchase premade sweet cream at any grocery store."
