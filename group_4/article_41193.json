Applying cold water to itchy skin can reduce the sensation.

You could also place a cold washcloth on the skin until itching stops. A cold shower or bath can help, especially if the itch covers a large area. Ice packs are a good option as well. You can buy commercial ice packs at most supermarkets or drug stores. Always wrap these in a towel or washcloth and never apply directly to the skin. If you can't find ice packs, you can also place ice cubes in a plastic bag or use frozen vegetables like a bag of peas instead."

[5] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Avoid tight, constricting items of clothing. If possible, choose outfits that do not cover the itchy area. Natural fibers, such as silk and cotton, do not usually irritate itchy skin. Wool is not recommended."

[6] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Opt for a 1% hydrocortisone cream and apply it to the affected area up to 4 times daily for 5–7 days. Look for the following ingredients when selecting creams, as they're particularly effective in combating itch: camphor, menthol, phenol, pramoxine, diphenhydramine, and benzocaine. These remedies numb nerve endings and therefore reduce itching. They can be applied every few minutes until symptoms stop. Try calamine lotion with up to 4% concentration of menthol.

Make sure you know what to do in the event of an allergic reaction."

[8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Use non-drowsy antihistamines during the day. This will include over-the-counter allergy medications such as 10 mg of cetirizine (Zyrtec) or 10 mg of loratadine (Claritin) once a day for adults. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You may take 25–50 mg of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at night to reduce itching and help you fall asleep. Make sure you talk to your doctor about your itch as only she can determine if it's caused by allergies. If it's caused by other factors, antihistamines may not help you with your itching."

      "content": "Hydrocortisone creams are a variety of over the counter topical ointments designed to reduce the itch. They can be helpful in some situations but are not always the right option depending on the cause of your itching. [10] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Hydrocortisone creams only help ease itch caused by certain rashes, such as eczema. Over-the-counter creams are often somewhat weak, containing only 1% cortisone, but if you have eczema or another skin condition such as seborrhea they might still provide some relief. If your itching is caused by an allergic reaction, bug bites, or dry skin it's doubtful hydrocortisone creams would help at all. As always, only apply over-the-counter creams as necessary and talk to your doctor if you have a reaction."

      "content": "If your itching is caused by sunburn, make sure to apply sunscreen to any exposed skin when going outside. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your skin is particularly sensitive to the sun, avoid sunshine during peak hours. This means anywhere between 10 AM and 2 PM. Peak hours are based on peaks in UV radiation and not sunlight itself. Therefore, the timeframe remains the same year-round. SPF levels are somewhat deceitful. A sunscreen that has an SPF of 50, for example, is not actually twice as protective as one with an SPF of 25. Choose brands based on what they protect against rather than SPF levels. Look for brands that specifically protect against UVA and UVB rays. These are usually labeled \"broad spectrum.\" While SPF levels aren't the best measure of a sunscreen's strength, it's important to understand most dermatologists recommend a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or above."

Common causes of allergic reactions on skin are nickel, jewelry, perfume, skin products with fragrances, cleaning products, and some cosmetics. If itchiness seems to occur in response to a particular product, cease use. Scented laundry detergents are known to cause skin itchiness. Try to buy natural detergents that don't contain added scents. Use mild, unscented soaps, conditioners, and lotions when possible."
