      "title": "Disconnect power from the wires.",
      "content": "Disconnect power from the wires. Unplug the device that you’re splicing wires to if you can. If the wire is in the wall or can’t be unplugged, turn off the circuit leading to the area so you don’t get shocked while working. If you can’t disconnect the power, do not attempt to splice the wire, or you could get electrocuted."

      "title": "Strip back 1 in (2.5 cm) of each wire’s insulation.",
      "content": "Strip back 1 in (2.5 cm) of each wire’s insulation. Pick a hole on the wire stripper that’s 1-2 sizes smaller than your wire. Clamp the wire in the hole and pull the stripper towards the end to completely remove the insulation. Repeat the process on the other piece of wire. Wire strippers can be bought at your local hardware store. If you are using uninsulated wire, you can skip this step."

      "title": "Slide a 3 in (7.6 cm) piece of shrink tube onto one of the wires.",
      "content": "Slide a 3 in (7.6 cm) piece of shrink tube onto one of the wires. Shrink tube is made from plastic that gets smaller when it’s heated. Slide a piece of the shrink tube on your wires before you splice them so you can easily slide it into place once you’re finished. You don’t need to use a shrink tube if you’re splicing with a wire cap. Shrink tubes can be purchased in the electrical department of your local hardware store."

      "content": "Hold the wire ends so they’re touching one another. Press the exposed ends of the wires together so they’re right next to each other. Don’t twist or coil the wires together, or they won’t stay as secure in the wire cap. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist a wire cap clockwise onto the exposed wires.",
      "content": "Twist a wire cap clockwise onto the exposed wires. Set a wire cap on top of the exposed wires and start twisting it on with your fingers. Turn it clockwise for about 5 seconds so the wires wrap and coil inside of the cap. Kuhlman notes there's a spring inside a wire cap, so as you spin it, it will get tighter and tighter around the wire. [2] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. Lightly tug on the wires to see if they stay in place. If not, tighten the wire cap more. [3] X Research source Wire caps can be purchased from your local home improvement or hardware store. Strip off more insulation if you need to keep twisting the wire."

      "title": "Layer electrical tape around the wire cap and exposed wires.",
      "content": "Layer electrical tape around the wire cap and exposed wires. Wrap black electrical tape around the bottom of the wire cap so it’s completely covered. Overlap each layer of tape by half so there’s no chance of exposed wiring. Use scissors or a utility knife to cut the tape when you’re finished. [4] X Research source If you’re working on multiple wiring projects, use different colors of electric tape to mark which wires are connected."

[5] X Expert Source Jesse Kuhlman Master Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. Butt splices are small tubes with openings on each end to insert wires. Take one of your wires and place it in the center of the butt splice. Push the exposed end until it’s in the middle of the splice. [6] X Research source"

Place the jaws of the crimper 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in (0.64–1.27 cm) from the edge of the butt splice. Squeeze the crimper handles all the way so the wire is held in place. [7] X Research source Don’t use a hole that’s too small, or you may cut through your wire. Many wire strippers have a crimper built into them, so you don’t have to get multiple tools."

      "content": "Put the second wire in the other side of the splice and crimp it. Repeat the process on the other side of the butt splice. When you insert the second wire, make sure it touches the first one inside of the splice. Use your crimper to secure the second wire in place. [8] X Research source Some butt splices are see-through in the center so you can tell when the wires are touching one another."

Make sure the wrap is tight so the wires make a solid connection with one another. Aim to get at least three coils around the other wire if you can. Repeat the process on the other side.

Here's the best way to heat up your wires before soldering: Heat up your soldering iron. Place the flat edge of the soldering iron against the splice you just made. Make sure to apply some pressure to ensure the iron is fully in contact with the wires. Add a small ball of solder to the tip of your soldering iron. This ball of solder will help the heat in the iron distribute more effectively through the wires. [14] X Research source"

Hold a rod of silver solder with your non-dominant hand next to the tip of your soldering iron. Melt the silver onto your coils so it drips between your wires and coats your entire splice. [15] X Research source Avoid touching the end of your soldering iron with your bare hands or else you’ll get burned. Line your work surface with a paper towel or scrap wood to protect against any accidental drips."
