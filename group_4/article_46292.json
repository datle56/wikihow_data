      "content": "Choose a device size that targets your treatment goals. Handheld or small standing devices are great for face rejuvenation, hair growth, and muscle healing in the knees, wrists, and feet. Larger, full body devices work best for chronic inflammation and body pain, muscle recovery, weight loss, and improving blood flow and circulation. Make sure the device you choose has both red light and near infrared light options to reap all the benefits of this therapy. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Only buy devices that are cleared by the FDA. Red light therapy devices can range from $200 to over $1,000 depending on their size. Many devices are made for specific areas of your body, such as red light therapy masks that target your face."

      "content": "Wear eye protection when using your device. The red and near infrared light used in red light therapy is like the light you see from the sun, just without the harmful UV rays and heat. While this makes red light therapy safe to use on your skin, it is recommended that you protect your eyes from any potential damage.

      "content": "Position the device at the recommended distance. While red light therapy is safe, sitting too close to your device may overheat and damage your skin. In general, most device companies say that you should sit about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away from your device for deeper tissue and muscle treatments and 12-36 inches (30-91 cm) away for more surface level skin concerns. [3] X Research source Don’t cover up the area you are treating. Red light can’t penetrate your skin if you are wearing clothes and accessories. Near infrared light can move through your clothes, but it is still best to remove them. Sunscreen may also reduce red light therapy’s effectiveness. If you apply sunscreen daily or use makeup with SPF, you may want to complete your sessions in the morning before you put on these products.

When you start red light therapy, the treated areas may feel warm at first. If you have sensitive skin and the treated areas look red and feel tight, cut the length of your session.

Find a suitable location for your device where you can sit or stand for 20 minutes at a time. You will dedicate a lot of time to this area, so spruce it up and make it relaxing with candles, music, and aromatherapy. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Be consistent with 3-5 sessions a week. If you miss a session, don’t try to extend the next session’s length. Keeping your sessions at the same time of day and for the same amount of time is what gives you results, not longer and more frequent sessions.

Look back at where you started to see the benefits of red light therapy.

      "content": "Reduce wrinkles and fine lines by increasing collagen production. When you use a red light therapy device, red light wavelengths enter your skin and give energy to cells. Energized cells increase collagen production, which is the protein that gives your skin its structure and elasticity. Your energized cells also reduce the signs of aging by repairing skin and promoting cell growth more efficiently. [9] X Research source"

Red light therapy is an effective method in improving blood circulation, which in turn reduces the swelling associated with acne and improves the skin’s healing process. The light might also act as a bactericide, killing the bacteria that build up in your oil glands and cause blemishes. [11] X Research source The anti-inflammatory properties of red and near infrared light can also reduce the redness and itchiness associated with eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea. [12] X Research source While many people report improvements to their skin, most do not see a reduction in their acne with red light therapy alone. Work with your dermatologist to find a treatment that you can use alongside red light therapy. There isn’t enough evidence to suggest that red light therapy will cure eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea, but it might be able to lessen your discomfort."

There are many common medications and treatments that make you more sensitive to light. Because red light therapy works by dispersing red and near infrared light into your skin, the therapy on top of the medications might make your skin red, tight, and uncomfortable. [17] X Research source While red light therapy is completely safe, most doctors prefer to err on the side of caution if you are pregnant. Doctors also don’t recommend using red light therapy if you have active skin diseases, are undergoing chemotherapy, or if you have epilepsy or a history of seizures."
