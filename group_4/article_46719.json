      "title": "Add liquid ingredients to your protein shaker.",
      "content": "Add liquid ingredients to your protein shaker. Take a look at some protein shake recipes and select your favorite. Now, pinpoint all the liquids (juices, milk, water, coffee) in the recipe and pour them all in one by one. [1] X Research source Try using regular milk, almond milk, soy milk, water, or orange juice. Use the measurements printed on the outside of your shaker (if it has any) as a guide."

      "title": "Scoop protein powder into your protein shaker.",
      "content": "Scoop protein powder into your protein shaker. After the liquids are in, start adding in your desired amount of protein powder. Be sure to follow the directions in your recipe to ensure that you have a good ratio of powder to liquids. Afterward, stir it in gently with a spoon to make the shaking process easier. [2] X Research source If you're not sure how much protein powder to use, add 0.035 oz (0.99 g) of protein per 1 lb (0.45 kg) of lean body weight. For the liquid: protein powder ratio, try using about 10 ounces (29.57 milliliters) per 1 scoop of protein or enough to dissolve all of the powder. Calculate your body fat percentage using a measuring tape, calipers, or your body mass index (BMI). Now, determine your lean body weight by subtracting your body fat percentage from your total body weight—this is a good guideline for the amount of protein you should use in your shakes."

      "title": "Mix in your solid and thick ingredients.",
      "content": "Mix in your solid and thick ingredients. Find all the solid ingredients like nuts, dry fruits, and vegetables and add them in. Afterward, add thicker ingredients like maple syrup and yogurt. [3] X Research source Try not to use more than 1/2 cup (64 grams) of solid ingredients and 1/2 cup (64 grams) of thicker ingredients. For example, use 1/4 cup (32 grams) of dried oats and 1/4 cup (32 grams) of ice cubes for solid ingredients and 1/2 cup (64 grams) of Greek yogurt. You can also just use 1/2 cup (64 grams) of either solid or thick ingredients—experiment and see what you prefer! Try out different nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Don't be afraid to stray from the recipe! Other proteins you can add to your shake include flaxseeds, chia seeds, and almond butter.

Afterward, press the flip cap down onto the lid until it snaps shut. [5] X Research source If you don't hear the flip cap snap, it hasn't been securely closed—try again. If your protein shaker has a ball whisk, drop it into the bottom of the bottle before screwing on the lid. If it has a mesh screen, be sure to attach it first."

Just make sure the pieces are small enough to be crumpled and fit into your shaker. Now, get some new pieces of newspaper or paper towel and add 3 to 4 drops of vanilla extract to each. Crumple your papers and paper towels, stuff them in the bottle, and let it sit for 24 hours with the flip cap open. The moist paper will absorb odors and the vanilla will create a pleasant odor.
