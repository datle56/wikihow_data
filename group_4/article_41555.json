If you don’t want to use a plastic bag, place the donuts on a plate or baking sheet and cover them with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. [1] X Research source Donuts stored in a plastic bag will become soggy after 24 hours. Cover them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil if you don’t plan on eating them the next day. Be careful when wrapping iced or glazed donuts. If you wrap them too tightly, the icing will stick to the wrap."

Heat them for 5 seconds on medium heat, then feel them to see how warm they are. If you need to heat them longer, set the microwave for an additional 5-10 seconds.

      "content": "Cover the donuts with plastic wrap before refrigerating them. Place the donuts on a plate and cover them with plastic wrap. If the donuts are still in the box, wrap the box tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the whole box. [4] X Research source If you don’t have plastic wrap, you can use aluminum foil. If you prefer, you can put them in a paper pastry box or bag before putting them in the fridge. Never put donuts in a plastic bag when storing them in the fridge. Plastic bags trap moisture inside and will make the donuts soggy. Donuts will dry out quickly if left uncovered."

Always refrigerate cream-filled donuts, rather than storing them at room temperature, to keep the cream from spoiling. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Heat refrigerated donuts in 10-second intervals. Microwave the donuts, uncovered, on a microwave-safe plate for 10 seconds. Feel the donuts after 10 seconds, and if they're still too cold for your liking, heat them for 10 more seconds. Check the temperature in 10-second intervals so you don’t overheat them.

Stick them in the freezer for at least 4 hours to harden them up. [7] X Research source Freezing works best for cake donuts, or unglazed donuts without icing. If you freeze iced donuts, the icing will melt when you go to reheat them later."

Let them sit at least 15 minutes at room temperature, or leave them to defrost overnight before heating them. [10] X Research source The process of defrosting can take anywhere from 15-60 minutes, so be patient. Do not cover the donuts while they’re defrosting, as this will trap moisture and make your donuts soggy."

Just follow your favorite bread pudding recipe, but use crumbled-up donuts instead of bread. [13] X Research source This works best with unglazed yeast donuts. Bread pudding is one of the more popular ways to recycle old donuts. Just make sure your donuts aren’t spoiled!"

[14] X Research source In a medium-sized bowl, combine the donut crumb with 1/2 tsp (1.15 g) of cinnamon and the chocolate mixture. Mix until the crumb sticks together. Use your hands to roll the mixture into balls. Make each ball roughly the size of a golf ball. Line a baking sheet with wax paper and place the balls on the sheet. Refrigerate the truffles for 30 minutes. Melt 3.5 ounces (99 g) of white chocolate, then dip the truffles into the chocolate. Place them back on the lined baking sheet. Refrigerate truffles for at least 1 hour before serving them."
