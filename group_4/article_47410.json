Not all security cameras are Wi-Fi compatible, so before you spend the money to purchase a DVR for your security system, double-check that your cameras will be able to broadcast their streams. You can also use Ethernet-only security cameras, though this will be difficult to do if you have more than one security camera you want to monitor."

A DVR stores the footage recorded by your security cameras; if you buy one that has streaming capabilities, you'll be able to connect to it to view live footage as well.

While many services recommend forwarding port 80 instead of port 88, port 80 tends to be blocked by firewalls and some Internet Service Providers. You'll need to enter the DVR's static IP address in the port forwarding section."
