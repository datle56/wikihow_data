      "content": "Choose the type of trap you will use. The most common traps used to bait raccoons are 1-door traps or 2-door traps. The bait is positioned differently for each. Set the trap in a stable area. This trap entices the animal into the cage with food. There is a trip pan that will trigger the door shut when the animal steps on it. [1] X Research source Place the bait behind the trigger plate in a 1-door trap. You don’t want the bait to be close to the trap walls or the raccoon might swipe the bait from outside the trap. Professionals like 1-door traps because it’s easier for large animals to enter them. [2] X Research source In a 2-door trap, place the bait right behind the trigger or bury it under the trigger. Or you could hang it from the top of the trap. The trap should be at least 32-inches long. [3] X Research source"
