      "title": "Arrange to get your puppy at 8 weeks from birth.",
      "content": "Arrange to get your puppy at 8 weeks from birth. The first 16 weeks of the puppy’s life are the socialization period that determines much about what they learn about other animals and the outside world. The first step in socialization is ensuring the puppy has adequate time with his mother. Ask your breeder if the mom had time to care for the puppy and discipline it. The second step is socialization with littermates. Siblings teach each other about submission and dominance. The third step in socialization is the breeder. This person is the first contact with humans. A gentle touch, good discipline and basic housebreaking will go a long way. The fourth step is you as the owner. The socialization process between 7 and 16 weeks is even more important for pit bulls than other breeds of dog."
