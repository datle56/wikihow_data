      "content": "Include your address on upper right side of the letter. For a personal letter, place your address on the upper right hand side of your paper. This will make it easier for your recipient to respond to you because he or she will not have to look up your address or save the envelope. You do not need to include your name in the address. Just include your street address or PO box on the first line and then include your city, state, and zip code on the next line."
    },
    {
      "title": "Provide the date after your address.",
      "content": "Provide the date after your address. It is important to include a date so that your recipient will know when you composed your letter. Including a date can also be useful if your recipient wants to save the letters he or she receives and organize them by date. Place the date on the next line after your address. [1] X Research source Write out the date with the Month first, then the date, and then the year. For example, “April 22, 2023.”"

      "content": "Address your recipient. Next, you will need to skip a line and move over to the left side of your page. You should always use the salutation “Dear” to begin personal letters. Follow “Dear” with your recipient's name and a comma. Consider how you usually address your recipient when you talk to him or her. For example, you might address your recipient as, “Dear Stephanie,” “Dear Grandma,” or “Dear Mr. Thompson,” depending on how you usually address the person. If you're writing to a group of people, like a family, use a greeting like \"Hi everyone\" to start your letter."

      "title": "Ask a question.",
      "content": "Ask a question. For a personal letter, such as to a friend or family member, opening with a question is a common approach. You can open your letter with a question to show your interest in what the recipient is doing or how he or she has been. For example, you could open with something like, “How are you?” or, “How do you like your new school?” or, “Are you feeling better?”"

    {
      "title": "Express your interest in something the recipient said or did.",
      "content": "Express your interest in something the recipient said or did. Another good way to start a personal letter is to begin by expressing your interest in something that your recipient put into his or her last letter, such as a recent accomplishment, a fun vacation, or an obstacle that he or she is facing. [2] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, you might start with something like, “Congratulations on your award!” or “Your vacation sounds like it was really fun!” or “I am sorry to hear that you have been having such a bad time at school.”"

      "title": "Include your address.",
      "content": "Include your address. Your full mailing address should appear at the top of your letter. Do not include your name before the address, but you may include an email address and/or a phone number below the mailing address if desired.

    {
      "title": "Add the date.",
      "content": "Add the date. After you have written your address and any other contact info that you wish to include, skip a line and include the date. Write out the date in full to include the month, day, and year. [4] X Research source For example, “April 22, 2016.”"

Place the address after the date with one space dividing the two. [5] X Research source Skip a line after your address as well. Your salutation (\"Dear ___,\" or “To whom it may concern,”) goes on the next line."

    {
      "title": "Decide if “Dear” is appropriate for your purposes.",
      "content": "Decide if “Dear” is appropriate for your purposes. Starting off letters with “Dear” is standard, but it might not always seem appropriate. For example, “Dear” might seem too personal for a complaint letter or for a business correspondence. [6] X Research source Think about who you are writing to and whether or not using “Dear” suits your purposes. If you are hoping to get to know the recipient better, such as by teaming up on a project, then “Dear” is probably appropriate. If including “Dear” makes you uncomfortable, then you can always leave off the “Dear” and just open the letter with the recipient's title and name. For example, you could simply open with “Mr. Parker,” and then follow with your opening line. “To Whom it May Concern” is another alternative, but this is even more distant and businesslike than leaving off “Dear.” Only use this opening phrase if you do not know the name of your recipient."

      "title": "Think about how to address your recipient.",
      "content": "Think about how to address your recipient. Before you write your recipient's name on the letter, take a moment to determine the best way to address him or her. In most cases, business letter should address recipients in a more formal manner, such as by using any titles the person holds. You can also consider how the person has addressed you in letters and your relationship with the person. [7] X Research source Consider the person's title and position. If the person you are writing to has a special title or position, then you should include this in your Salutation. For example, if the person is a doctor, then you might begin your letter with “Dear Dr. Jones.” If the person is a general in the military, then you might begin your letter with “Dear General Wilson.” People who have a PhD or LLD at the end of their names should also be addressed as Dr. Check the letter you are responding to. If you are writing a letter in response to another letter, then checking to see how you were addressed may help you to decide how to address your recipient. For example, if the letter you received starts with “Dear Ms. Johnson,” then you should also start your letter with “Dear Mr./Mrs./Ms. ____.” Think about how well you know the recipient. You may also want to consider how well you know the recipient when deciding how to address your letter. Are you on a first name basis? Or do you use a title when you address the person? Keep in mind that even if you have called the person by his or her first name in the past, it might be too informal for a business letter. If you are in doubt, err on the side of caution and address the person in a formal manner, such as by including Mr., Ms., or Dr."

Even if you are writing to complain or for some other unpleasant purpose, never start your letter by saying something rude or demanding. Instead, try expressing well wishes to your recipient or congratulating your recipient on an accomplishment. For example, if you want to set a friendly tone in the beginning of your letter, then you might start by saying something like, “I hope this letter finds you well.” Or, “Congratulations on your promotion!”"

It is okay to start a cover letter with something simple, such as “I am writing to apply for X position.” However, if you want to try something a little different to open a cover letter, then you might start with a brief summary of your greatest accomplishments. Offering a brief summary of what you have accomplished can grab the attention of the hiring manager and increase your chance of getting an interview. [10] X Research source For example, you might start with, “In the past five years, I have doubled my sales and expanded my territory to three neighboring states.” You could then go on to talk more about your professional experience, education, special training, and other qualifications for the job."

[12] X Research source Some good keywords to mention include those that appear in the job posting, such as specific skills or experience that you possess. For example, you might begin with something like, “In my five years as a sales manager, I have given regular presentations, developed successful sales strategies, and written numerous sales scripts for my employees.” You can also mention the names of any person or persons who referred you to this position. This might catch the attention of the hiring manager and ensure that you get an interview. For example, you might write something like, “I heard about this position from our department chair, Dr. Smith.”"
