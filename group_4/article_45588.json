[1] X Research source Simply go to the Agents tab, click a locked agent, then click Activate . Since episode 7 came out, or the most recent update, there are even more free agents to unlock! You'll get an event pass whenever one hits the live servers. In that case, you have 28 days to hit level 5 of the contract for that agent. For example, go to the Agents tab and click the locked agent that the event pass specifies. Click View Contract and complete the required steps to unlock that agent! [2] X Research source"

      "content": "You can also use VP points to unlock agents without leveling their contract. \"VP\" stands for Valorant points, which you can buy with real money. You'll need about $10 worth of VP to get enough levels to unlock agents. [3] X Research source If you have the money, it might be a good idea to grind to the 2nd or 3rd levels in each contract that you have active, then you can buy the remaining levels to unlock the agent. While paying for agents might be the fastest way to unlock them, you can also use your time efficiently to unlock them for free without wasting much time."

      "content": "Focus on daily challenges and play game modes that give you the most XP. To unlock agents, you must first activate their contract and gain XP to earn levels. You have unlocked that agent once you reach level 5 in the contract. Games like Deathmatch can be good or bad, depending on how well you play . These generally last up to 9 minutes or until a player gets 40 kills, but they reward each player with up to 900 XP per game. So, a 9-minute game might not be the fastest way to get XP for someone who can't get 40 kills before the game ends. If you're trying to unlock agents quickly, try games like unrated and competitive, which reward players up to 200 XP per round. The games are much faster. And even if you're not a good player, you'll get at least 100 XP for participating."

      "content": "Test agents in The Range before you buy them! You always want to make sure their gameplay is how you like to play the game. Agents like Reyna are simple to play with some utility abilities that make surviving easier. Skye is another more support-style agent, making playing easier with controlled animals like hawks and wolves. Viper is also an easy-to-learn agent that's great at support. Chamber has great utilization skills, like placing teleports, but is harder to master than the others."
