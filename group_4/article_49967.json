      "title": "Powerful",
      "content": "Powerful According to the ancient poet Homer, Zeus was the most powerful of all the gods—more powerful than all the gods together, even. [1] X Research source After all, it was Zeus who returned to Olympus to free his siblings from their father, and it’s Zeus who rules over the sky, slinging his lightning bolts from above."

      "title": "Just & wise",
      "content": "Just & wise Zeus was often a mediator and judge for matters of the gods. He was often harsh, but he also doled out punishment and praise where needed. He resolved a conflict between Hermes and Apollo as they bickered over the first lyre, as well as a conflict between Apollo and Hercules. [2] X Research source He offered many who offended him a chance at purification. [3] X Research source It’s said that Zeus kept the “jars of Fate,” one of which held evil and the other good, and he would unleash either of them as he saw fit. Also, Zeus would determine the moment of a mortal’s death by weighing their fates on his golden scales."

    {
      "title": "Impulsive & impatient",
      "content": "Impulsive & impatient For as wise and just as Zeus was, he was also fairly impatient and easy to anger, and would act on the anger often. For one, when Prometheus betrayed him by offering fire to mankind, Zeus angrily took the fire back and chained Prometheus to a rock to have his liver eaten by an eagle. [4] X Research source It’s safe to say that you don’t ever want to be on Zeus’ bad side."

      "title": "Confident & charismatic",
      "content": "Confident & charismatic It’s not easy overthrowing your dad and his titan cronies to become the ruler of a bunch of constantly bickering gods, but Zeus managed it thanks in part to his confidence and charisma. He’s a force to be reckoned with, that’s for sure, and nobody knows that better than Zeus himself. Some depictions also show Zeus as a god who loved laughter and amusement."

    {
      "title": "Lustful",
      "content": "Lustful Perhaps Zeus’ biggest vice was his lust. He fathered many children with many different women, and would often even shapeshift into animals or other gods in order to seduce them. He’s notorious for his promiscuity, and many found themselves the victim of his desires. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Zeus appears in ancient art as a bearded, muscled deity. He often carries his signature lightning bolt, or a scepter to represent his role as ruler of the gods. [6] X Research source Statues and other representations often depict him with a powerful body ready to strike, or presiding over his kingdom in the sky. He sometimes wears a golden wrap around his legs and golden sandals on his feet. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Zeus was the son of Cronus and Rhea.",
      "content": "Zeus was the son of Cronus and Rhea. Cronus was the leader of the Titans, the descendants of the earth and sky. But a prophecy told Cronus that one of his offspring would dethrone him, and so he ate Zeus and the rest of his children—Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Rhea saved Zeus by feeding a rock to Cronus instead. [8] X Research source Rhea then took Zeus to the island of Crete, where he was raised by Gaia, or the earth, or in some tellings, by nymphs."

      "title": "Zeus returned to free his siblings from Cronus.",
      "content": "Zeus returned to free his siblings from Cronus. It’s said that Zeus’ wife, Metis, put a charm on Cronus and made him free Zeus’ siblings. Then, the siblings overthrew Cronus and took the world for themselves, but had to fight a hard and brutal battle with the Titans in a war known as the Titanomachy. [9] X Research source After the Titanomachy, Zeus imprisoned the Titans in Tartarus. He spared the Titans Themis and Prometheus, who fought against their fellow Titans. The world was then divided into 3—Zeus became ruler of the sky, Poseidon became ruler of the sea, and Hades ruler of the underworld. The gods agreed to rule over Olympus itself together."

      "content": "There are many diverse stories and representations of Zeus. As one of the chief figures in Greek mythology, there are an overwhelming number of stories and factoids about the leader of the gods, and how the stories end often depend on who’s telling them. Here’re some more fun facts: The name Zeus means “to shine” or “sky.” [18] X Research source Before the Trojan War, Zeus was asked to judge who was the fairest—Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite. His wisdom told him not to take sides, and he refused. According to myth, Zeus ordered Hephaestus to make women as mankind’s punishment for their discovery of fire through Prometheus. [19] X Research source Zeus is often represented by lightning, a bull, an eagle, or an oak tree, each symbol representing his power and authority. [20] X Research source Zeus’ Roman counterpart is Jupiter. Myths about Zeus and Jupiter overlap quite a bit, as the Roman and Greek religions blended and fused. Zeus’ signature thunderbolt was said to have been crafted by the Cyclops. After the Titanomachy was the Gigantomachy, or a war against the giants. [21] X Research source"
