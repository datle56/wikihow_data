Your metabolism is all the chemical processes your body uses to convert calories from food into energy and stay alive. That includes processes like breathing, circulating your blood, digesting your food, and repairing your cells. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Metabolic age measures the minimum amount of calories you need to convert into energy daily to survive, compared to other people your age. If you need fewer calories for your age group, for example, then your metabolic age is younger than your calendar age. [2] X Research source"

If it's 40, though, that might be less than ideal. It means you're having to burn more calories than normal for someone your age to support your body's basic functions. In that case, you may want to talk to your doctor about what you can do to improve your BMR and your overall health. [6] X Research source"

To calculate how much water you need, take your weight in pounds (or kilograms) and divide it in half, then drink that in ounces (or milliliters). For example, says Mahallati, \"if you weigh 160 pounds, you need to drink 80 ounces of water per day.\""

It also helps us build muscle, maintain a healthy weight, and have stable blood sugar. [7] X Research source Mahallati advises to eat it at \"every meal and snack\" throughout the day."

Different types of vitamin B, such as thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), and biotin (B7), help your body metabolize important nutrients like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. [9] X Research source Meanwhile, low amounts of vitamin D have been associated with metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity. [10] X Research source Mahallati says to make sure you're taking in both nutrients to support your metabolism. You can get vitamin B from foods like whole grains, eggs, beef, fish, and dark green vegetables (e.g., broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, and spinach).

[12] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Scientists determine a person's metabolic age by comparing their BMR with other people in their age group. This is different from your age in years. For example, you might be 40 years old and have a BMR similar to a 30-year-old. [13] X Research source Researchers also consider factors like your height and weight and, if you're a woman, whether or not you're pregnant. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source One study measured participants' blood pressure and dietary intake, as well. [15] X Research source There isn't much research on metabolic age yet. That means it's impossible for you to calculate it on your own without the help of a doctor or a team of researchers. You can still calculate your BMR , which will give you an idea of how well you're converting calories into energy compared to other adult men and women."

      "content": "Use the Harris-Benedict equation to get a rough idea of your BMR. Ideally, you should calculate your BMR in a lab to get the most accurate reading. Most people don't have access to that type of test, though. If you want to get more insight into your metabolic health at home, use the Harris-Benedict equation for BMR: [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For men : BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) - (5.677 x calendar age). The average BMR for adult men is 1696 calories daily. For women : BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) - (4.330 x calendar age). The average BMR for adult women is 1410 calories daily. Example : A woman who weighs 60 kg (132.3 lb), is 175 cm (68.9 in) tall, and is 35 years old may have a BMR of 1393 calories per day. That's a little below average, but not by a significant amount. Given the information available, this number might tell us that the woman has a good BMR for her age. Remember, though, that these equations only offer estimates of BMR. There are a lot of other factors that go into BMR besides weight, height, and age. A lab test might include your sex, ethnicity, genetics, temperature, thyroid hormones, and more."

They also haven't developed a standard for measuring it. As a result, a lot of factors that could be impacting your metabolic health, like your hormone levels, might get left out of the equation. A slightly more accurate metric is BMR. You can calculate it at home, and it can show you how well you're processing the calories you're ingesting.

      "content": "Metabolic age measures how well you burn calories for energy at your age. Not a lot of research about metabolic age exists. However, a few studies show that low metabolic age is an indicator of lower blood pressure and smaller body circumference. Meanwhile, high metabolic age could point to a higher risk for dementia and metabolic syndrome. While you can't calculate your metabolic age right now without the help of a doctor, you can still calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). BMR tells you how many calories you're converting into energy each day. This will give you a better idea of how your metabolism is working."
