      "title": "Hold the thumb loop against your palm and wrap your fingers 6 times.",
      "content": "Hold the thumb loop against your palm and wrap your fingers 6 times. Position the thumb loop so its end is aligned with the edge of your index finger above the knuckle. Spread your fingers out slightly as you begin wrapping them. Squeezing them together will cause the wrap to be too tight and restrictive. [1] X Research source Many Muay Thai fighters roll their wraps inside-out. To do this, unroll your wrap, then roll it back up tightly with the adhesive patch facing inward. This will make wrapping your hands a little easier. [2] X Research source It doesn’t really matter if you start by taking the wrap around the back of your hand or underneath it. As long as you wrap up your wrist and each finger, your hands will be secure."

      "title": "Slip the wrap off your hand and secure it to your knuckles.",
      "content": "Slip the wrap off your hand and secure it to your knuckles. Pull the wrap off carefully, holding the layers together so the wrap doesn’t fall apart. Set the pad on the back of your hand and pinch it in place with the side of your thumb. Pick up the roll of the remaining fabric with your other hand, which will be by either your pinky or thumb. Wrap it underneath your hand, between your thumb and index finger, and over the pad to secure it in place. [3] X Research source Bring the wrap around your hand 3 times to secure the pad to your knuckles. [4] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Avoid wrapping your thumb at this point. For now, you need it free so you have more freedom of movement. Make sure the wrap feels snug against your hand at all times. If it feels too loose or too tight, unroll it and start again."

      "title": "Cross the wrap down and around your wrist 3 times.",
      "content": "Cross the wrap down and around your wrist 3 times. Move your thumb to the side to get it out of the way. Bring the wrap diagonally down between your thumb and index finger to the edge of your wrist on the opposite side of your hand. Finish protecting your wrist by wrapping it up snugly. [5] X Research source Hold your wrist straight as you wrap it. Wrapping your wrist while it is crooked increases your chances of injuring it."

      "title": "Bring the wrap up between your ring and pinky finger.",
      "content": "Bring the wrap up between your ring and pinky finger. Stop when you have the roll of wrap next to your thumb. From this position, take the wrap diagonally upward, across the back of your hand, to your pinky. After moving the roll between your fingers, hold the wrap near your palm for a moment. [6] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. To achieve proper wrapping technique, you will need to flex your fingers. Keep your fingers straight until you have brought the wrap between them."

      "content": "Close your hand into a fist, then wind the wrap down around your wrist. Bring the wrap around your palm to your thumb. Pass the wrap between your thumb and index finger again.

      "content": "Secure your remaining fingers by passing the wrap between them. You will need to repeat the previous motions a total of 3 times. Start by bringing the fabric between your middle and ring fingers. Wrap diagonally towards to your wrist, then go all the way around your wrist so the wrap ends up near your thumb. Then, do this for the remaining sets of fingers. [8] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Remember to close your hand into a fist every time you pass the wrap between 2 fingers. Make sure the wrap is at the proper consistency before continuing."

      "title": "Bring the wrap around your wrist and secure it in place.",
      "content": "Bring the wrap around your wrist and secure it in place. If you haven’t already, take the wrap around your thumb and down to the edge of your wrist below it. You won’t have much wrap left, only enough to pass around your wrist 2 or 3 more times. Press the adhesive end against your wrist to hold the wrap in place, then give it a good test before getting into the ring. [9] X Research source The wrap should stop about 3/4 of the way up your forearm. [10] X Expert Source David Engel Muay Thai Instructor & Self Defense Trainer Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. To test the wrap, close your hand into a fist. Check that your knuckles are level with your fingers. Make sure your wrist looks straight in the wrap so it doesn’t bend while punching. This is the traditional wrapping style used by many experienced Muay Thai fighters. Some fighters prefer a boxing-style wrap , which may be a little bulkier but still effective."

      "title": "Select an elastic wrap that fits comfortably on your hands.",
      "content": "Select an elastic wrap that fits comfortably on your hands. Basic hand wraps are made with cotton and held in place with a patch of Velcro. The most useful type of wrap you can get are elastic wraps, also called Mexican hand wraps. The elastic fibers make these wraps easier to put on and more comfortable to wear. [11] X Research source Non-elastic wraps are also an option. These wraps tend to be more durable than elastic wraps, so they’re particularly good for training sessions. The most important part is comfort. Pick a wrap you are most comfortable using and get spares so you always have a clean pair available."

      "title": "Choose a wrap that is long enough to fit over your hand.",
      "content": "Choose a wrap that is long enough to fit over your hand. A standard wrap is about 180 in (460 cm) long. This is an ideal size for most adults. However, wraps are available in all sorts of sizes, including junior sizes. You can only learn what size is right for you by trying on wraps of different lengths. [12] X Research source Choosing a wrap length is a personal process. The length you need depends on how you wrap your hands and what feels best to you. If you can’t finish wrapping your hands by bringing the fabric around your wrist a few times, you need a longer wrap. Similarly, if you have a lot of material left when you’re done wrapping, try a shorter wrap."

      "title": "Hold your wrist straight while wrapping your hand.",
      "content": "Hold your wrist straight while wrapping your hand. Bending your wrist makes it more prone to injury. Your wrist needs to be level with your hand and forearm at all times. If you bend your wrist at all, the wrap will hold it in a bent position. Undo the wrapping and start over to avoid any problems. [13] X Research source Make sure your wrist feels comfortable in the wrapping. If it feels bent, hitting something can cause it to bend further. Never begin sparring unless you are sure your hands are well-wrapped."

      "title": "Pad your fingers around the first knuckle.",
      "content": "Pad your fingers around the first knuckle. When your hands are well-wrapped, your fingers are cushioned but still free to move independently. This is done in Muay Thai by taking the wrap between your fingers and around your wrist. Avoid wrapping your hands beyond the first knuckle, since the wrap will restrict your fingers. [14] X Research source For protection, make sure the wrap is thick around each knuckle as well as your wrist. When you wrap your hands correctly, the wrap will feel snug enough to stay in place, but it won’t feel tight enough to hinder your circulation."
