      "content": "Recognize the symptoms that precede vomiting. Many people notice nausea before they are sick. Nausea is the feeling that you might be sick. [2] X Research source Most people also experience over-activity in their parotid glands just prior to regurgitating, which causes salivation. By producing extra saliva, the body is helping to reduce the acidity of the vomit. [3] X Research source If you are experiencing these symptoms, quickly seek a bathroom or a place where you can safely release the contents of your stomach."

      "title": "Find a safe place to vomit if possible.",
      "content": "Find a safe place to vomit if possible. Your end goal should be to keep yourself safe while also minimizing the mess that you will make while you are sick. In order to do this, assess your current environment as quickly as possible. You will then need to make a quick decision about where you will vomit. Consider the following: If you are near a bathroom, do your best to make it to the toilet before you are sick. If you are unable to make it to the bathroom, try to find a trash can or some type of container into which you can vomit to minimize the mess that you will make. If you are in a car, do your best to alert the driver to the fact that you are going to be sick and ask him or her to pull over. Finally, if you are unable to find a bathroom, container, or trash can in which to vomit, or if you are in a car, remember that your best bet might be to vomit outside. It is much easier to hose off a sidewalk or a gutter than it is to get vomit out of cloth seats or carpets."

      "content": "Allow yourself to vomit. As awful as it can be, vomiting is a necessary reflex and it should not be suppressed. Especially in the case of food or alcohol poisoning, the body is desperately trying to rid itself of toxins, and it does this through the act of vomiting. Moreover, many things may lead to regurgitation and none of these things are anything to be embarrassed about. Causes of vomiting include, but are not limited to: [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Pregnancy Food allergies Adverse reactions to medications Food poisoning Drinking too much alcohol Rotavirus Viral Gastroenteritis Migraine Chemotherapy Peptic Ulcer"

When you are finally able to do a thorough cleansing of yourself try the following: [6] X Research source Take a hot, steamy shower to remove vomit from you and your sinus cavity Blow your nose into a tissue directly after showering Thoroughly brush your teeth and gargle with mouthwash Eat a throat lozenge to calm a sore and scratchy throat Dry yourself completely and climb into comfortable clothing"

      "content": "Remember that most people have been sick in public at some point in their lives. It's not the end of the world, and the people around you will likely have empathy. In fact, most people treat others who are ill with kindness. Embarrassment occurs when you have broken a social norm and you are worried that others are judging you negatively for your perceived transgression. [7] X Research source Others often meet an embarrassing ordeal with empathy and kindness, rather than with judgment, as this allows them to avoid a potentially awkward or embarrassing situation as well. For example, perhaps an office worker is experiencing morning sickness and vomits into her trash can in front of a co-worker. Her co-worker will likely ask if the woman with morning sickness is okay, if she needs anything, and sympathize with her, rather than offering a negative judgment of the woman's condition or illness."
