      "title": "Check if the LED power light is coming on.",
      "content": "Check if the LED power light is coming on. Also check to see if you hear any system sounds, or fans, or see backlighting on the screen. If the screen is black but has backlighting, the problem is most likely with the system not booting up properly rather than a power problem. If you hear fans or system sound, but nothing is displayed on the screen, connect to an external monitor using an adapter or dock. If you can get an image on an external monitor, the screen is most likely faulty."

      "content": "Press and hold the power button for 12 seconds. If your Steam Deck won't turn on normally, the first thing you should try is to perform a forced restart. You can do so by pressing and holding the Power button for 12 seconds. Not only will this do a forced restart, but it will also force a system update, which may fix any software issues."

      "content": "Disconnect it from any charging cables and let it sit for a while. If the Steam Deck feels warm to the touch, it may be overheating. If it gets too hot, it will shut itself off automatically to prevent damage. Let it sit in a cool place for a while to cool down."

      "content": "Use a different charging cable or charger. If you let your Steam Deck charge for 2 to 3 hours, and it still won't turn on, make sure the charger is working. [1] X Research source Try using a different USB-C cable. If that doesn't work, try using a different wall charger that you know works. Also, try using a different electrical outlet."

      "title": "Check the charging port for dirt and debris.",
      "content": "Check the charging port for dirt and debris. Make sure the charging cable fits all the way in and is snug against the shell of the Steam Deck. You can use a flashlight to look inside and see if you spot any dirt or debris. If it looks dirty inside, you can clean it with condensed air. If there is any large debris that won't come out, you can clear it out using a wooden toothpick shaved to size. Do not stick anything metal inside the charging port. Using a USB multimeter, you can check if the charging port is working properly."

      "title": "Press the power button and see how it feels.",
      "content": "Press the power button and see how it feels. If it feels sticky or feels like it's not pressing down, try cleaning it with a cotton swap lightly soaked with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Make sure your Steam Deck is powered off when you do this. You can also use a dry toothbrush or toothpick to get into the crevices. If the power button feels loose, the button mechanism may have come loose from the motherboard. If you are skilled at soldering , you can try to solder the power button back to the motherboard. If you are uncomfortable doing this, you'll need to take it in for a repair or try to warranty your Steam Deck."

Then you will need to remove the metal cover and disconnect the battery. Once the battery is removed, connect the Steam Deck to a charging cable and try to power it on. If it powers on without the battery, the battery has most likely failed. If it does not turn on, replace the battery and see if it powers on. You should only attempt this if you are comfortable working on electronics."
