      "title": "Put the longer side of the tie on the same side as your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Put the longer side of the tie on the same side as your dominant hand. Wear a button-down collared shirt with your bow tie for a classic look. Lift your collar, and put the bow tie around your neck so that the pattern is face-up. Position your tie so one end hangs roughly 1 1 ⁄ 2 –2 inches (3.8–5.1 cm) lower than the other end. From now on, the longer side is called “side A” and the short side is “side B.” [1] X Research source Measure your neck to find out what size bow tie you need. Many bow ties have adjustable sliders or buttons that let you change the length to fit around your neck."

    {
      "title": "Loosely overlap your tie right below your Adam’s apple.",
      "content": "Loosely overlap your tie right below your Adam’s apple. Pull side A over so the strap, which is the narrowest part, is just above the “leaf”, which is rounded, bulged section near the end, of side B. Leave 1 or 2 finger-widths between your skin and the tie where it overlaps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set side A on your shoulder after so it's out of the way for now.",
      "content": "Set side A on your shoulder after so it's out of the way for now. Push the end of side A through the bottom of the neck loop and pull it through. Pull side A tight until your tie is a finger-width away from your neck. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "The fold creates the first loop of your bow tie.",
      "content": "The fold creates the first loop of your bow tie. Pinch where your tie overlaps, and bring side B toward your non-dominant arm. Then, lift up the shorter end and fold it over on itself at the widest part to make the bow shape. Turn that section of your tie so it’s horizontal and right below your Adam’s apple. [3] X Research source Keep your tie pinched so it stays tight against your neck."
    },
    {
      "title": "The tie strap forms the center of your bow tie’s knot.",
      "content": "The tie strap forms the center of your bow tie’s knot. Take the longer end off your shoulder and drape it over the skinniest part of the bow shape you just made. Make sure the patterned side faces out and lies flat on the bow. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat the same fold you did for side B for the bow’s other half.",
      "content": "Repeat the same fold you did for side B for the bow’s other half. Pinch side A right above where the strap starts to widen out and fold it back toward your chest. Then, fold your tie down at the widest point to create the bow shape. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Each side of the bow will have a folded and flat part.",
      "content": "Each side of the bow will have a folded and flat part. Pinch the ends of side B together to expose the loop in your tie. Gently push the folded section of side A into the loop and pull it through. Smooth out the tie so it sits flat and aligns with the bow shape in front of it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "You’re all done tying your bow tie after a quick tightening.",
      "content": "You’re all done tying your bow tie after a quick tightening. Gently pull on the loops on each side of the tie until the knot is secure. If you need to even out the sides of your tie, then pull on the flat ends to make your adjustments. After that, just lower your shirt’s collar and finish getting dressed ! [7] X Research source Check your tie periodically while you’re wearing it to ensure it’s still straight and tight."
