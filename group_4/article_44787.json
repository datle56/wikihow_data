Look at the appearance of the burn and note specific characteristics. This will help you decide which type of burn you have. Burns are classified as first-, second-, or third-degree, depending on how deeply they have burned the skin. First-degree burns are the mildest type, while third-degree burns are the worst. Different methods are used to treat burns depending on their degree.

When you press on the skin, they might turn white for a few moments after you release the pressure. If the burn has not blistered or opened but has just reddened the skin, you have a first-degree burn. [10] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If a mild burn covers the hand as well as the face or airway, most of the hands, feet, groin, buttocks, or over major joints, a trip to the doctor is recommended.
