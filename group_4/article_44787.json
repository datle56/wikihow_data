Look at the appearance of the burn and note specific characteristics. This will help you decide which type of burn you have. Burns are classified as first-, second-, or third-degree, depending on how deeply they have burned the skin. First-degree burns are the mildest type, while third-degree burns are the worst. Different methods are used to treat burns depending on their degree. [8] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If you have circumferential burns on your fingers (meaning the burns wrap around any or several fingers), seek prompt medical attention. This type of burn can restrict blood flow and in severe cases could require amputation of the finger if left untreated. [9] X Research source"

When you press on the skin, they might turn white for a few moments after you release the pressure. If the burn has not blistered or opened but has just reddened the skin, you have a first-degree burn. [10] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If a mild burn covers the hand as well as the face or airway, most of the hands, feet, groin, buttocks, or over major joints, a trip to the doctor is recommended.
