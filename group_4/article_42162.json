      "content": "Search for a dry, flat area between 2 trees with splits in their trunks. Look around the area to find a relatively flat area with a tree that has a trunk that splits about 3–5 feet (0.91–1.52 m) off of the ground. If possible, try to find 2 trees that have a split in their trunks about 3–5 feet (0.91–1.52 m) off of the ground and are about 10 feet (3.0 m) apart from each other. [1] X Research source If you can't find a tree with a split in its trunk, look for a strong branch or log that has a “Y” shape to serve as the support for your shelter. This process covers how to build an A-frame shelter. However, if you’re close to a natural shelter (like a covered canopy or a safe rock formation), that’s probably preferable. Felled trees, hollow logs, caves, hollows, and trenches can all be great shelters depending on your location. Clear the area between the trees of rocks and debris so it will be more comfortable to lie on. Why worry about shelter first? Exposure is more immediately dangerous than a lack of food or water most of the time. You can survive 3 days without water and potentially up to 2 months without food, but extreme heat or cold may end your life overnight. [2] X Research source"

Lay the leaves and small branches over the frame in order of decreasing size to create a thick layer. [7] X Research source Add layers of insulation until you can't find any holes in it and add as many layers as you can to help keep the shelter warm.

Check for any insects or spiders on the material before you put it in your shelter. [8] X Research source A final note: Your body loses heat five ways: evaporation, convection, conduction, radiation, and respiration. If your shelter takes all five of these risks into account, it’s a good shelter."

Look for signs of fresh water nearby like areas of green foliage that indicate water is nearby, low-lying areas where water could be collected, and signs of wildlife like animal tracks. It could mean that a creek, stream, or pond is nearby. While finding water is important for survival, be aware some water sources will not be safe; if possible treat all drinking water before consuming it. If there are mountains nearby, look for water collected at the foot of the cliffs. The presence of insects like mosquitoes and flies means that water is nearby. Freshwater springs are typically safer water sources, although these can be contaminated by mineral or bacteria as well. Remember that all untreated water must be considered risky unless treated. Even crystal clear water can harbor diseases and be dangerous if consumed."

If it starts to rain, place any containers that you have out in the rain to collect it. If you have a tarp or a poncho, hang it at least 3–4 feet (0.91–1.22 m) off of the ground by tying the corners to trees, and place a small rock in the center to create a depression that will collect the water. [10] X Research source Don't let the water sit in a container or a tarp for too long or it can stagnate and bacteria can contaminate it. If possible, purify any water that you collect."

Find a clearing or a meadow with tall grasses and place the cloth on top of the grass to pick up the dew. Move the cloth around in the grass until it's saturated, then wring out the water, collecting it in a container. [11] X Research source You can collect the most dew just before sunrise.

You may be able to find fresh water simply by digging a hole deep enough to reach the water table or the level at which the ground is saturated with water. Use a shovel or a sturdy stick to dig down until you reach water. Make the hole wide enough so you can easily scoop water from the hole. [12] X Research source Wait until the mud settles down at the bottom of the hole and the water clears before you scoop it out."

You can place the ice or snow in a container and place it next to a fire to melt it or you can hold the container to use your body heat to melt it. [13] X Research source Melting snow is an inefficient way to obtain water. Although it is a relatively safe and easily identifiable source of water, it is not a lot of water by volume. Melting a pot of snow will yield only about a third of a pot of water. A lot of fuel and effort may be wasted if there is a better source available. Collect snow or ice that has a bluish tint to it. Frozen water that is gray or opaque will have a high concentration of salt, which can dehydrate you even more if you drink it."

It's extremely important that you purify any water that you collect, including rainwater, dew, and ice or snow, so you don't consume bacteria that could make you ill or even kill you. Use a piece of cloth or clothing to strain the water to remove large particles, then boil the water for 10 minutes to kill any contaminants. [14] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you don't have a container to boil water in, you can fill a clear plastic bottle with water, seal the lid, and place the bottle on its side in direct sunlight for 6 hours to purify it. In the event that you have no containers and no way to purify water, you can dig a deep hole, let it fill with groundwater, and wait for the particles to settle at the bottom and the water is clear before you drink it. You should only do this if you have no other option. [15] X Research source"

Look for dry wood in the area and stack near where you plan to start your fire so you can easily add more fuel when you need it.

Use another branch to plough up and down the groove to use the friction to build up heat. After a few minutes of work, the heat will ignite the wood. Act fast and light your tinder to start the rest of the fire. Use a dry piece of wood to make your fire plough. Anchor the fire plough by kneeling on it to keep it still."

Check under rotting logs to look for ants, termites, beetles, and grubs. Keep an eye out for worms in the dirt, too. You can eat most insects raw, but avoid spiders, ticks, and flies. [17] X Research source Check under stones, boards, and other materials for insects. Only eat insects that you have killed. Insects with hard outer shells like beetles and grasshoppers should be cooked for 5 minutes before you eat them to remove any parasites.

Look for dandelion leaves, the green leaves of chickweed and wood sorrel, and the tender young flowers of primrose and wild violets. If you're not sure what plant you're picking, don't eat it. Wash off any edible plants that you find. Stay away from mushrooms unless you’re an expert in mycology and mushroom identification."

Then push the opposite end of the string or wire through the slip knot to form a large circle. Hang the circle of the snare over a footpath or a trail in the woods.

Even if you can kill a deer or pig, you may not have the tools necessary to preserve the massive amount of meat that has come from the once-living animal.

If you have determined you are hopelessly lost, your best tactic is to stop and hunker down in a safe place rather than to try to hike out. [24] X Research source If you aren't safe where you are, find a safe location nearby. When lost, humans have a tendency to walk in wide circles, often coming back to the same locations time and time again. In the process, a lot of time, energy, and emotional focus is lost.

Repeat the process to form a line of cloudy puffs of smoke in the sky.
