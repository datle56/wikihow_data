One study found that 14% of men and 10% of women had not had sexual intercourse in the preceding year. There are many changes and transitions in life that can lead to celibacy – involuntary or not. [1] X Research source Donnelly, D., Burgess, E., Anderson, S., Davis, R., &amp; Dillard, J. (2001). Involuntary celibacy: A life course analysis. Journal of Sex Research, 38(2), 159-169. Resist the urge to judge yourself harshly for being celibate. Ignore what you think society says about where you should be in your lifespan and whether you should be having sex, dating, married or with children. Your opinion of yourself is the most important one. The depression that can occur from celibacy can unfortunately prevent you from moving forward.

Involuntary celibacy: A life course analysis. Journal of Sex Research, 38(2), 159-169. Work on improving your social skills so that you feel more comfortable meeting new people. Work on your nonverbal communication. Your body language communicates certain messages to other people. If you stand away from a crowd, or you hunch your shoulders a lot, you may be nonverbally telling others to stay away from you. Try standing up straight with your shoulders back and your head held high. Stand closer to a group of people and listen with interest to their conversation. [5] X Research source Have a mental list of general conversation topics. If you find that you run out of things to say, you can prepare ahead of time with some general ideas about things to talk about. This can include the weather, your work or school, a recent movie, a hike you went on, and so on. [6] X Research source Practice your social skills with all kinds of people. You don’t need to save your social skills for potential partners. Try them out on the mail carrier or the grocery store clerk."

You might live with a roommate or a family member. If you want to pursue a physical relationship with a partner, figure out ways to ensure you get the privacy you need. See if your roommate will go out for one or two evenings every week, for example. You might consider getting your own place if your living situation isn’t allowing you enough privacy."

This doesn’t mean that you have to stop having sex entirely. There are many options for medications and other treatments for sexual dysfunction, both for men and women. Be proactive about addressing dysfunction that you’re experiencing. Make an appointment with your doctor. He or she will be able to help you figure out the next step. You may feel shy or embarrassed when talking to your doctor about issues pertaining to sex. But your doctor is there to help you live your life to the fullest and genuinely wants to help you. It might help talking with a female doctor if you’re a woman, or a male doctor if you’re a man."
