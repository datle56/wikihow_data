      "content": "Calm yourself and make sure you have time to devote to detangling. Trying to rush through the process will likely worsen the knot and leave you angry and frustrated. Working out a knot can take time and a lot of patience, and you should go into the process as calmly as possible. Take a few deep breaths, put on some enjoyable music, and get to work. If you have a friend, sibling, or parent willing to help, you can speed up the process. And if the knot is somewhere that is difficult to reach, they may be necessary. [1] X Research source Remember to take breaks. You may need to stop and rest your arms. If you don't have time to deal with the knot, pull your hair into a bun and wait until you have enough time to dedicate to working it out. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Gather your materials. When trying to unknot hair, your tools can make all the difference. You absolutely want to use a detangler, conditioner, or other lubricant (like coconut oil). Don't use a brush, as this can lead to more knotting. Instead, find a sturdy medium- or wide-toothed comb. Set up a chair in front of a mirror--you'll want to be sitting, since it may take a while. There's an abundance of detangling products for curly-haired people. Look for sprays to use after the shower, plus rinses and shampoos that can help when you wash your hair. Look for gentle, no-tears versions for kids or very fine hair. If your hair is dry and damaged, look for a product that moisturizes as it detangles. You can also use a silicone-based de-frizzing gel to work out tangles. [3] X Research source Make your own spray by mixing conditioner and water in a clean, empty spray bottle."

      "content": "Detangle your hair when it's dry to avoid breakage. Some experts will recommend detangling your hair when it's wet because it's more stretchy and elastic. However, detangling wet hair can actually lead to more breakage, so it's best to work on it when it's dry. [4] X Research source If you need to, lightly mist your hair with spray or conditioner to add lubrication and \"slip\" to dry hair, which is often sufficient for working out a knot. Some experts recommend detangling right before you shower, so you can easily work shampoo and conditioner through your hair and comb it out afterwards. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide your hair to isolate the knot. Use plastic hair clamps or clips to separate your hair. Try to clip back all the hair that is not already part of the knot so it doesn't end up in the mess. The knot should be free from the clips with everything else pulled out of the way. If you have a ton of tangles, it will be much easier for you to work in sections. [6] X Research source Try dividing your hair into about six sections and work on them one at a time. If you're working through all your hair, make sure you separate the finished sections from those that are still knotted. You may want to braid the finished section so it doesn't tangle again.

      "content": "Mist the section of hair with your detangler. Apply the product and allow it to sit for several minutes so it can soak into your hair. Follow the instructions on the bottle of the product. The more slip and lubrication, the easier it will be to undo the knot."

Don't tug on your hair with the combâ€”that will lead to breakage, which will only create future tangles. Be very, very gentle when combing through the knot [10] X Research source If you can't get the comb through the knot, try applying more product. Remember to take breaks if you get tired or frustrated. This process may take quite a while."

[11] X Expert Source Shun Pittman Master Cosmetologist, Global Salon Educator & Author Expert Interview. 11 May 2021. Make sure you are holding your hair firmly with your free hand, near the root.

Try picking them out with the tail of your comb, just like you did with the bigger knot. If they won't budge, stop and try a different strand of hair. [14] X Research source If you have removed some hair from the tiny knot but it still won't undo, see a salon professional. Never rip the knot out with a comb. [15] X Research source"

You can also try a sleeping bonnet, satin or silk pillowcase or a hair net to keep your hair tangle-free at night. [16] X Research source Use soft hair ties, not rubber bands, to pull your hair back. Remove any bobby pins you may have used to style your hair."

Many women can't stand to give up even a centimeter of their hard-earned hair length, but avoiding haircuts leads to dead, dry hair and split ends that cause tangles. [17] X Research source At the very least, you should get your hair trimmed every three months, and tell your stylist you want the dead hair removed. [18] X Research source Split ends can travel up the hair shaft, damaging living hair and causing major tangles. [19] X Research source As much as you may love every inch of your hair, dry, dead hair really doesn't look very good. Remember that your hair will continue to grow, and it will look healthier and stronger if you get a minor cut every season. [20] X Research source"
