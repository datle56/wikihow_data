      "content": "iOS may label your Snapchat notifications as Time Sensitive. This simply acts as a reminder to respond to your Snap messages when you have Do Not Disturb or another Focus mode enabled. iPhones and iPads running iOS 15 or later have this feature to stay on top of time-sensitive events. While this is helpful for other apps like Find My or Lyft, it may be considered spammy if you don't need or want reminders to use a social media app. You can easily disable this feature in your settings."
