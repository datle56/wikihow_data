[12] X Research source You may want to start by pushing your pedal slowly to find your rhythm, but there’s no reason to wind your bobbin at a slow speed. If your bobbin fills unevenly, you have likely wound your thread around the tension disk in the wrong spot. Check your placement of the thread. If you believe you have done it correctly, then wrap it a second time to ensure that your thread is winding evenly. If your thread catches on the notch of the spool, try turning the spool over and working in the opposite direction of that notch."

You may be unsure of how much thread you’ll use, but it’s a good idea to fill up your bobbin each time you wind it so that you don’t run out of thread. [13] X Research source Your bobbin is full when you reach the edges of the sides of the bobbin, making your thread flush with the outside edge. If you keep loading your bobbin past the sides, then the thread will slide off and unwind."
