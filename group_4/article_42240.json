      "content": "Hearts Although its medical and scientific significance is very different from its symbolic meaning, the heart is still one of the most widely recognized symbols of love and passion. That could be because, in Greek mythology, Cupid would pierce people’s hearts with arrows—and, in many other cultures, the heart has been associated with strong emotion. [1] X Research source Think about how your heart beats faster (and louder) when you’re with someone you love or are crushing on—or the feelings of intense happiness that make your chest feel lighter. Those could also contribute to the heart being associated with love!"

      "content": "Apples Apples are believed to be symbols of love, desire, and abundance. Greek mythology depicts apples as symbols of courtship (with Gaia, the goddess of nature, giving apples to Hera, the goddess of marriage and family, during her wedding). Thus, the tradition of couples sharing apples at their weddings goes back to the 7th century B.C.! It was done to signify a couple’s hope for a long, fruitful marriage. [2] X Research source Apples also represent lasting beauty in Norse mythology since it was said that eating the apples from Iðunn’s garden (the goddess of youth) could prevent disease and aging. Furthermore, in Chinese culture, apple blossoms are a symbol of adoration and affection. However, apples later came to symbolize temptation in the Christian religion (specifically the temptation of Adam and Eve), which some compare to desire and lust."

It’s often featured on Celtic rings and other jewelry because of this symbolism! The Claddagh is especially popular on engagement rings because of the folktale associated with it: [3] X Research source According to Irish folklore, the symbol is connected to the village of Claddagh outside Galway, where pirates captured a man named Richard. Richard was forced to work as a smith and saved up metal scraps (either silver or gold, depending on the legend) to create the first Claddagh ring for the love he was forced to leave behind, Margaret. When Richard finally escaped and returned home, he gave the ring to Margaret as an engagement gift."

The love knot likely originated in the 3rd century B.C. from the Roman empire before being adopted by Christians around 450 A.D to decorate crosses and manuscripts. Wedding rings with a Celtic design still often feature love knots today, making them an enduring symbol of love! There’s also a Celtic tradition called “handfasting,” in which a couple’s hands are tied together during their wedding ceremony. Handfasting represents union and commitment—and, together with the love knot, also represents everlasting love. A similar wedding tradition in the Hindu faith is called “Granthi Bandhanam,” wherein scarves worn by the couple are tied together. This represents the bond between Parvati, the goddess of love, and her spouse, Shiva (the god of power)."

Clasped hands don’t necessarily mean romantic love, either; they can symbolize affection between family and friends, too. For another example, the joined hands of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria were used to represent friendship between Germany and England. One legend says that a man proposed marriage to his love by asking for her hand, thus leading to clasped hands becoming a symbol of love—but this may or may not be true."

Carl Jung (Freud’s student) theorized that some symbols—called concept archetypes—were so deeply ingrained in the human psyche that they appeared across worldwide cultures and history. [17] X Trustworthy Source Simply Psychology Popular site for evidence-based psychology information Go to source Contemporary psychology supports the idea that many people can more easily remember symbolic word pairings, which explains how so many symbols of love have endured or become popular (like the heart or ring). Basically, the mind can create an innate connection between a symbol and its related idea or concept, thus giving that symbol added significance!"
