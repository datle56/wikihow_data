      "title": "He wants to take things slow.",
      "content": "He wants to take things slow. If a guy pulls away after intimacy, it might be because he thinks things are moving too fast. Don’t worry if a few days have passed since you last saw each other—he might just be taking his time to be sure of his feelings for you. This isn’t a bad thing! Taking things slow can increase the chances of a successful relationship because it helps ensure a strong foundation. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "He doesn’t know how you feel about him.",
      "content": "He doesn’t know how you feel about him. If a guy goes radio silent after sex, he could be distancing himself because he doesn’t know how you feel. He might be afraid of rejection, so he’s pulling away to protect his emotions. [2] X Research source If this is the case, he might be waiting for you to reach out, rather than taking that leap himself."

    {
      "title": "He’s worried you didn’t enjoy yourself.",
      "content": "He’s worried you didn’t enjoy yourself. Everyone feels a little insecure sometimes, and it’s possible he’s concerned about his performance during intimacy. If he’s worried that you didn’t have a good time, this could make him feel anxious or depressed, which could be keeping him away. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "He’s genuinely busy with his personal life.",
      "content": "He’s genuinely busy with his personal life. Sometimes, the explanation is as simple as a busy schedule. [4] X Research source If a guy has a lot on his plate with work or family commitments, he might not have the time to be super present. He could be busy with anything, from a high-pressure job to demanding elderly parents. If this is the case, he could reach out when things calm down. Either way, it has nothing to do with how he feels about you—external factors are just making things tough for him."

      "title": "He needs his space.",
      "content": "He needs his space. Some guys have a fear of being smothered, which makes them pull away even when they like you. [5] X Research source Guys who have this fear tend to show mixed signals and might get into on-again-off-again relationships. If you feel like he is constantly flipping between showing you lots of attention and emotionally withdrawing, this could be the reason."

      "title": "He isn’t ready for a relationship.",
      "content": "He isn’t ready for a relationship. A guy might distance himself after sex because he wants to keep things casual. He might not have the space for a relationship in his life right now, so he could be pulling away to make sure he doesn’t give you the wrong signals or lead you on. It might hurt at first if he isn’t ready to commit, but in the long run it will protect you from being in a relationship with someone who isn’t all in. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "He wants to play the field.",
      "content": "He wants to play the field. It’s possible that he wants to date around and meet lots of people, which could be why he is pulling away. With online dating and dating apps being so common, the whole dating scene can seem like a marketplace where people prefer to shop around, rather than commit. [7] X Research source Remember, if this guy is dead set on playing the field, this has nothing to do with how special you are as a person. Sometimes, your dating goals just don’t line up with someone else’s, and that’s okay!"

      "title": "He’s experiencing the refractory period.",
      "content": "He’s experiencing the refractory period. Immediately after intimacy, men go through a period of “recovery” where their bodies return to their pre-intimacy states. [8] X Research source During the refractory period, men don’t think about sex as often, and they don’t get aroused. If a guy seems distant after intimacy but only a few hours have passed, don’t overthink it! He could just be experiencing this normal bodily process. Refractory period lengths vary. For some men, the period lasts only an hour or two, while others need a day or longer. Age also plays a role, with older men typically having longer refractory periods. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "His brain chemistry is different post-intimacy.",
      "content": "His brain chemistry is different post-intimacy. During sex, your body experiences a rush of happy hormones like dopamine, making you feel energetic and euphoric. [10] X Research source This feeling can be so intense that it mimics a drug-induced high, so the after-effects can feel almost like a withdrawal. [11] X Research source If he seems distant after sex, he might be experiencing the dramatic drop in these feel-good chemicals. This sudden drop in mood is so common that there’s actually a name for it—postcoital dysphoria, or PCD. Postcoital dysphoria involves feeling sad, anxious, or even depressed after sex. [12] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Remember, if the guy you’re seeing experiences postcoital dysphoria, it doesn’t mean you’ve done something wrong. PCD happens for a variety of reasons, and it might just be a personal thing he has to work through. Sometimes, a little patience or space is all he’ll need to feel alright again."

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tons of different things can cause low libido, including medical conditions, hormone imbalances, certain medications, stress, and aging. It might take a bit longer for a guy with low libido to feel physical desire again after an intimate encounter, which may be why he isn’t reaching out. If a guy seems less interested after sex, it might have to do with one of these health issues, rather than any issue with your relationship."

[14] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source If a guy seems less enthusiastic after sex, or if he’s not scrambling to see you again, a mental health condition could be a factor. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used to treat depression, can cause low sex drive or trouble with arousal, which could contribute to the problem. [15] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source It’s possible that he’ll need a bit more time to feel aroused again after your intimate encounter, and that’s okay! These issues can be pretty personal and vulnerable, so make sure to let him come to you if he feels comfortable talking about it. Even if you feel pretty sure that he’s dealing with a mental health problem, it’s important not to assume."

      "content": "He has commitment or intimacy issues. These issues are complex and could stem from many different causes, like bad past relationship experiences, or a fear of hurting other people. [16] X Research source Attachment styles could also play a role, as people with avoidant attachment styles are often more emotionally unavailable in their relationships. [17] X Research source Whatever the cause, intimacy or commitment issues can really complicate a relationship and make you feel like you’re in the dark. Don’t feel bad if you can’t seem to figure him out—complicated issues like these often require the help of a therapist or counselor for a real resolution."

It’s completely normal to get fed up with mixed signals, so if you don’t feel comfortable with the uncertainty anymore, it could help to ask him for some clarity. Defining the relationship can be daunting, but it could provide you with that extra security you need. [19] X Research source Even if you don’t get the answer you were hoping for, at least you’ll know where you stand!"

[20] X Research source If he is experiencing one of the typical post-intimacy effects, like hormonal changes or the refractory period, he might just need a minute to reset. Wait a couple days and see if he reaches out—he could come back refreshed and ready to keep getting to know you."

If you’re in a relationship and are hoping to increase intimacy, having conversations about your emotions is a great way to bring you and your partner closer. [27] X Research source It takes vulnerability to be honest with someone about how you feel, and doing this together can really increase feelings of closeness and affection. “I really love spending time with you, and my feelings for you are definitely growing stronger.” “Sometimes, when we go a while without talking, I start to feel a little anxious. I’m working through it, but I wanted to share my feelings with you.” “When you remember details I’ve told you about myself, it makes me feel really seen and understood. I really appreciate that you listen to me so closely!”"

When other forms of intimacy don’t accompany physical closeness, this could cause loneliness or isolation. [28] X Research source Brainstorm ways you and your partner can show affection for each other other than sex, in order to develop a more balanced and fulfilling relationship. Try planning a unique date that your partner will love. If they love to cook, cook a romantic meal together. If they’re a bookworm, take them to their favorite bookstore and spend the afternoon reading together. This will show your partner that you’ve taken the time to get to know them, which can increase emotional intimacy."

Simply telling your partner you care, asking about their day, or making them a cup of coffee in the morning can go a long way."
