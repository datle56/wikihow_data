      "content": "Take around 1000mg per day. While there needs to be more scientific research done on how much lysine to take, it is generally advisable to take approximately 1000mg per day. A person's general daily dietary requirement for lysine is 8 grams a day. Adding 1000mg daily with a supplement will help offset a small deficit in that dietary requirement. [3] X Research source Even if you have a diet high in lysine, taking a supplement is typically fine. Recommended dosing for lysine varies dramatically. Any amount between 500mg and 3000mg per day may be recommended by your doctor or naturopath. Any dose under 8 grams is not likely to be toxic, but always follow your doctor's instructions.

      "content": "Avoid a diet high in arginine-containing foods. Foods that are high in arginine, such as chocolate, nuts, and dairy, can minimize the effectiveness of lysine supplements because it will lower your level of lysine. This is because it uses the same body pathways as lysine. Additionally, high arginine foods can actually make cold sores worse, so they should be avoided in general if you have a herpes simplex infection."

Keep this uncertainty in mind when taking lysine, as it's important to use caution when taking it and so that you manage your expectations about its effectiveness."
