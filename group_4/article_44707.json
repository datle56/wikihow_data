      "content": "Apply over-the-counter acne treatment products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. It's important to wait 5-15 minutes after you cleanse your skin before applying any topical acne medication. If you apply the medication immediately after washing your face, it may actually irritate the skin and result in whiteheads. Benzoyl peroxide destroys the bacteria found in the pores when acne is present. [1] X Research source It is included in a wide range of products, including face washes, lotions, and ointments. Be careful when applying, as it can stain or remove color from your clothes. Salicylic acid helps the skin shed dead cells, which helps open pores. It also dries up the excess oil that causes whiteheads. Because it is an acid, it may cause some tingling when you apply it. With either of these medications, stop using them and contact a dermatologist if you experience any of the following: skin rash or intense itching, blisters, redness, or swelling. Don't over apply! Applying more than the recommended dose of these medicines not only won't clear your skin faster, it can actually irritate your skin and cause redness, inflammation, and more whiteheads."

Saturate a cotton ball with the oil and dab it on the affected area once a day. (If you use 100% pure tea tree oil, make sure to dilute it, otherwise you will end up irritating the skin.) Although it may take longer to work (approximately three months), studies have shown that tea tree oil is as effective over time at fighting inflammation as benzoyl peroxide but has fewer side effects.

      "title": "Understand what causes whiteheads.",
      "content": "Understand what causes whiteheads. Whiteheads are small, white bumps on the surface of the skin. They are usually the least severe type of acne, but may also occur alongside other types. Whiteheads and other acne breakouts can have a variety of causes. Understanding how whiteheads form can help you decide on treatment. Hormonal changes in the body, such as those that occur during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, can cause breakouts. Nearly 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 develop acne of some sort. Changes in medication such as hormonal birth control and certain psychiatric drugs can also trigger a breakout. Excessive sebum production contributes to whiteheads and other types of acne. Sebum is an oily substance produced in hair follicles that can cause whiteheads and other acne breakouts when too much is absorbed by your skin. Most of the hair follicles on your body produce sebum, so it is possible to get whiteheads on other areas of your skin besides your face. Some people are more genetically likely to develop whiteheads. White people are more likely than people of other races to develop whiteheads and other acne, and the tendency to get whiteheads can also be passed down in families. Whiteheads have many causes, not all of which you can treat on your own. If your skin does not respond to at-home treatments, it's best to see a doctor even if your condition isn't severe. You may have other underlying health issues that are contributing to your whiteheads."

      "content": "Examine your skin. If you've been treating your whiteheads at home and haven't seen improvement after 4-8 weeks of using topical medication, it is probably time to reassess your situation. The American Academy of Dermatology has an online guide to help you understand your acne symptoms, but this should not replace professional advice."

      "title": "Visit your general practitioner.",
      "content": "Visit your general practitioner. If your whiteheads are severe or do not respond to home treatment methods, your general practitioner can prescribe both oral and topical prescriptions that are stronger than over-the-counter medications. These usually work in a few weeks. If your whiteheads continue to be a problem, talk to your physician about getting a referral to see a dermatologist. Your general practitioner can prescribe medications that also include antibiotics to decrease the presence and growth of acne-causing bacteria ( P. acnes ) on your skin. Some common oral antibiotics include erythromycin, tetracycline and derivatives, and (for women) oral contraceptives. Your doctor may also prescribe topical antimicrobials such as benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid. Some health insurance programs in the US require a physician's referral for you to see a dermatologist, and dermatologists are usually more expensive than visiting your general practitioner. To avoid surprise costs, check with your health insurance provider before scheduling a visit."

Topical retinoids are derived from vitamin A and unclog pores, which helps to clear whiteheads and prevent them from recurring. Minor side effects like skin irritation may occur, and some of them (such as tazarotene) should not be taken by pregnant people. Some over-the-counter skin creams contain retinoids, but your doctor can prescribe prescription-strength topical medications that are specifically for fighting whiteheads and other acne. It’s best to seek a physician’s advice."

Your dermatologist can physically remove whiteheads and blackheads using a sterile extraction device to dislodge the material clogging the pores. They may also provide a microdermabrasion peel to help remove dead skin and open smaller clogged pores. [8] X Research source You should never try to remove whiteheads on your own. Squeezing, picking, popping, or using an at-home extraction device on your own can worsen your whitehead problem because it may force the contents of the whitehead further into the skin.

[10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source In about 85% of patients with severe acne, isotretinoin treatments produce permanently clear skin in 4 to 5 months.

[15] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020. Applying rubbing alcohol can also irritate your skin and cause whiteheads to develop. Skincare products that contain certain oils are also not a good idea if you have acne-prone skin. Many cosmetics and sunblock lotions contain oil that can clog pores and lead to whiteheads. These are the oils you should avoid if you have oily or acne-prone skin: fractionated coconut oil, Cocoa butter, Sesame oil, Wheat germ oil, Shea butter, Sea buckthorn oil, Other oils Several oils are high in “oleic” fatty acids, which are believed to cause more clogged pores than those high in “linoleic” fatty acids. Since oily skin is believed to be low in linoleic fatty acids, oils with more of these typically work well, while those with more “oleic” acid may cause more issues. Based on this theory, some to avoid include olive, avocado, apricot kernel, and sweet almond oil. Meanwhile, some oils that are great for oily skin include grapeseed, rosehip, evening primrose, hemp, and pumpkin seed oil. Avoid heavy foundations and cream cosmetics if possible. These tend to be the worst culprits for blocking pores."
