      "title": "Open your letter with a salutation to the hiring manager.",
      "content": "Open your letter with a salutation to the hiring manager. Find the website of the company you want to work for and try to find the contact information for the person in charge of hiring. Then, address your letter to them, using the standard \"Dear\" as a greeting. [1] X Research source Including the hiring manager's name makes your email more personal. If possible, you can also include their title, their company, address, city, state, zip code, etc. if you intend the email to function as a cover letter. [2] X Expert Source Amber Rosenberg, PCC Founder of Pacific Life Coach Expert Interview. 6 February 2019. For instance, your greeting might say \"Dear Ms. Smith:\" If you cannot locate the name of the person in charge of hiring, you can use \"To Whom It May Concern:\" instead. [3] X Research source If the person has a gender neutral name and you can’t figure out their gender or preference, err on the side of caution and use the full name in the greeting. For example, it’s better to say \"Dear Chris Smith,\" than writing Dear Ms. Smith to a Christopher Smith."

If you want to jazz it up a bit, consider writing \"I look forward to hearing from you,\" followed by \"Sincerely.\" [10] X Research source Finish by typing your name or including your digital signature. Beneath that, include any relevant contact information that isn't in the body of the email, like your address. Finish by signing the letter with your digital signature."

[14] X Research source Don't forget to use positive and actionable adjectives too, like \"reliable,\" \"intelligent,\" \"good-natured,\" and \"diligent.\" [15] X Research source You can put these words together in phrases, such as \"I collaborated on a marketing project and was a significant asset in my company gaining several new clients.

Instead, consider writing something like \"My current employers have called me one of the most responsible and collegial co-workers with whom they’ve had the pleasure to work.\" When assessing your technical skills and abilities, you can write something along the lines of \"I am among the top 5% of brand managers in my field based on sales.\""
