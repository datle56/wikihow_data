      "content": "Press or toggle the Wi-Fi switch on your HP laptop. Some HP laptops have a Wi-Fi switch, button, or key that makes it easy to turn Wi-Fi on and off without digging through Windows menus. The location of your laptop's Wi-Fi switch or button varies by model. If you can't access Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi switch may be turned off. On many older HP laptop models, you'll find a physical switch on the right or left side of the laptop that you can slide into the on and off positions. The switch is usually labeled with a Wi-Fi symbol that looks like a tower emitting signals. On other HP laptops, you'll see a button above the top row of keyboard keys that has a Wi-Fi symbol or tower switch. If your laptop has one of these buttons, you can press it to toggle Wi-Fi on and off as you use your PC. If you don't have a separate button or switch, your HP laptop may have a dedicated function key (the F keys) that acts as a wireless switch. This is usually F8 or F12, but might be a different F key. Switching Wi-Fi on and off may require you to hold down the Fn key as you press the Wi-Fi key. If your HP laptop doesn't have a wireless switch, button, or key, it may have an airplane mode button or function key. Pressing this button should also toggle Wi-Fi on and off."
