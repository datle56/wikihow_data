For instance, you typically need fuller lips to get a vertical labret or jestrum piercing, as there needs to be enough tissue to pierce. If you don’t have the appropriate features for a particular piercing, the piercing can potentially damage your teeth and gums. When you go into the piercing studio, the piercer will meet with you to discuss the piercing you want and if it’s possible to safely give it to you. [19] X Research source If you have the “right” anatomy, the piercer will work with you on placement and which jewelry to choose. The piercer will also walk you through the piercing process. In most cases, they will clean the area and then pierce the spot with a hollow needle. Then, they’ll insert the jewelry.

However, it’s best to call or visit the piercing studio to get a refresher on what they specifically advise you to do. Follow the piercer’s instructions for the entire healing period.

Sanford says “not many of the piercings have their own special cleaning process”—for most, you can simply “rinse it in the shower.” Always wash your hands with soap and warm water before cleaning your piercing."

After you eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack, swish salt water or mouthwash inside your mouth for 30 to 60 seconds. This gets rid of food particles that can be irritating or cause infection.

      "content": "Avoid touching or moving your piercing. According to Sanford, “the most important part of taking care of any piercing…is that you don't touch it and that it's not being moved.” She says to make sure that you’re “not picking at it” and that “that your fingers are staying away from it.” Piercing specialist Roger Rodríguez agrees, saying “you should not twist, turn, rotate, move back and forth, or bend the area around that piercing. Piercings are designed to break the skin and stay still. They're not supposed to move or rotate or slide back and forth.” Touching your piercing can slow down its healing time and potentially lead to infection. Rodríguez explains that a “piercing is [like] a cut. When you get a cut, you get a scab. And when you get a scab, then it's going to eventually heal. So if that [piercing] is being twisted, turned, or moved, or picked at, you're picking off a scar.”"

      "content": "What is the least painful lip piercing? Most people agree that the labret piercing is the least painful lip piercing, and it tends to be the most common one, too. However, piercing pain is very subjective and varies from person to person. In general, lip piercings are quick so the pain doesn’t typically last that long. On the flip side, people tend to consider upper lip piercings and piercings that go directly through the lip the most painful. For instance, the Medusa, vertical labret, jestrum, and horizontal labret are some of the more painful lip piercings."

      "content": "How much do lip piercings cost? In general, a lip piercing costs between $30 to $80. However, the price largely depends on the type of piercing you’re getting, the studio you’re at, and where you’re located. This also doesn’t account for the price of the jewelry the studio uses, which is typically between $30 to $60. For instance, a labret piercing in the lower price range might cost you $60 total (piercing + jewelry). Most people recommend tipping your piercer 20%. So, for the labret piercing, you’re now looking at a total of $72."
