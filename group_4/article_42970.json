      "title": "Set up a time and place to talk.",
      "content": "Set up a time and place to talk. How you decide to meet with your friend and talk about ending the friendship depends on the length of your friendship, how close you are, and how you both usually talk. Make sure you choose a time, place, and method of talking that best fits the needs of your friendship, not the one that’s just easiest or least awkward for you. If you’ve been good friends for a long time, meet in person. See if you can meet at a place where you can have some privacy. Give them a heads-up that you want to meet to talk about something important so they’ll set aside enough time for you. If you’ve been friends for a short time, or you usually communicate online or on the phone, send them an email or call them."

      "content": "Address the problem with your friendship. Avoid listing your friend's faults or being too specific since getting into too much detail may be hurtful. Instead, focus on your feelings about your relationship and how you don't see it progressing any further. Think of what you’d like to say beforehand and practice it in your head or with someone you trust. Below are examples of clear, generic ways to say you want to end your friendship. \"It seems like our lives are heading in different directions and we have different goals, so I'd like to step back from our friendship.\" \"I've enjoyed getting to know you, but I don’t think we're a good fit as long-term friends. We don’t have any of the same interests and our personalities seem to clash.\""

      "content": "Express appreciation for the good parts of your relationship. Let your friend know you like and care for them. Say “thank you” for the experiences you shared. Tell them what you like about them as a person, which will balance out and soften the blow of why you want to end the friendship. [1] X Research source Avoid being excessively flattering or generous. If you try to sweeten your rejection with dishonest compliments, flattery, presents, or snacks, they might receive mixed messages. Avoid giving them false hope that the friendship could continue. You can say, \"I appreciate all the experiences we've shared during our summers together. I like that you're always trying to make sure everyone has fun.\""

      "content": "Avoid blaming and shaming. Don't tell your friend it’s their fault or that something is wrong with them as a person. Instead, focus on the specific behavior or actions you don’t like. Avoid accusing them or shaming them for who they are. For example, if you have a good friend who has been getting involved in inappropriate, perhaps even illegal activities, you can say, \"I’ve noticed you’re spending more time with people who smoke and drink. Your friendship has meant a lot to me, but I am not comfortable around those things. That's not how I want to have fun.”"

They may be angry, sad, defensive, or try to tell you you’re wrong. [2] X Research source Stay true to your feelings. Don’t let them change your mind. If they don’t want to listen or try to convince you to stay friends, be firm. Repeat a phrase like “This isn’t working out.”"

      "content": "Limit your interactions with them. Sometimes the more direct approach of talking is too hurtful or inappropriate, particularly if you haven’t been friends with the other person long. Try limiting the amount of time you spend around them. They’ll eventually get the hint and leave you alone, but this could take a while. [6] X Research source If you have to be around them, keep your interactions short and impersonal. Focus your conversation and attention on others. Keep in mind that if you were close friends, this type of avoidance may be confusing to the other person and cause conflict. Don't try to avoid them completely unless they pose a threat to you George advises. That gives them power over you. Instead, she says, \"Acknowledge their presence and then find a polite way to leave the conversation.\" [7] X Expert Source Jessica George, MA, CHt Certified Professional Master Life Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2022."

      "content": "Limit the attention you give them over the phone. Your friend or acquaintance may still try to interact with you outside of seeing you in person. Don't respond to their DMs, text messages, emails, or phone calls. If you haven’t already given them your phone number, make sure you don’t at this point. If you’re hesitant to immediately stop responding to all of their texts or calls, cut them off gradually. [8] X Research source For example, every time they text you, take a few hours longer to respond until more than a day has passed, then stop answering altogether. Especially avoid responding to text messages or calls that occur late at night or that the other person uses to try to pull you into drama. Responding to them with help will send them a mixed message that you’re available to them as a friend."

Avoid accepting any invitations to spend time with this person, especially for anything one-on-one. Give excuses. Anytime they invite you out, tell them you have a doctor’s appointment, plans with your family or another friend, or that you’re not feeling well. They’ll likely get the hint and stop inviting you to things. [9] X Research source If they express concern or surprise at you not wanting to spend time with them, you may need to address it directly. You can say, “I know I’ve been fading out, but I just don’t have the time or energy to connect with you as often anymore. I’m sorry.” [10] X Research source"

If you were good friends with the person in the past, you may want to talk to them directly or at least write them a letter explaining the break. Otherwise they may keep reaching out and will think it's strange when you don't respond. This method will also hurt their feelings less since they won't have to worry if they did something to drive you away. Some people don't take hints very well and need to be told important information. If the person you don't want to be friends with anymore is this way, talking it out will work best."

If the other person is merely an acquaintance and not someone you've known intimately or for a long time, you may want to let the friendship fade.

Here are some actionable ways to accomplish these goals. Spend less time together or break off all contact. Unfollow or hide the other person's account on social media. Avoid sitting next to them in class or at work. Keep other supportive people around. Keep your conversations light. Reduce how much you rely on or confide in them."

Reflect on what went well and wrong in the friendship, what qualities annoyed you about your friend, and what you’d do differently in the future. Look at your own behavior, not just theirs. Remember, relationships are 2-way streets. While their actions may have caused the split, you may also have room for improvement. For example, you could work on choosing better friends. Learn what limits you need to set with friends in the future. Avoid friends who ask too much of you or always expect you to let them dump all their problems on you. [12] X Research source"
