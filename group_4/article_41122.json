      "title": "Wash your face to remove excess oils from around your eyes.",
      "content": "Wash your face to remove excess oils from around your eyes. One of the main reasons your eyeliner smudges is because of oil—whether it's natural oil from your skin or from your moisturizer. Start your makeup routine with a clean face, and if you want to apply moisturizer around your eyes, use a product that is lightweight to reduce the risk of your eyeliner smearing later on.

      "title": "Apply a makeup primer to your lids to set a foundation for the liner.",
      "content": "Apply a makeup primer to your lids to set a foundation for the liner. Instead of just quickly sweeping some primer over your top eyelids, really brush the primer on all the way from your brows down to your eyelashes. Extend the primer out to the corner of your eyes, especially making sure to get the area that creases when you smile. Apply the primer around the bottom of your eyelids, and don't forget to apply it around your tear ducts, too. [2] X Research source The primer helps lock your eyeliner in place, making it less likely that it'll smudge throughout the day."

    {
      "title": "Brush skin-colored powder or eyeshadow over the makeup primer.",
      "content": "Brush skin-colored powder or eyeshadow over the makeup primer. Use a small makeup brush to apply the powder as close to your lash lines as possible. This extra layer gives the eyeliner an additional product to hold onto; plus, if you decide to wear colored eyeshadow, your lids will be primed for that step of your makeup routine. [3] X Research source Remember to clean your makeup brushes every 1 to 2 weeks to keep them in good condition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Curl your eyelashes",
      "content": "Curl your eyelashes before applying any eyeliner. Don't apply mascara yet, but do go ahead and prime your lashes by curling them before doing anything else. If you use an eyelash curler after you've applied your eyeliner, chances are you'll smudge the liner and have to redo it. [4] X Research source If you wear fake lashes, you should also apply them before doing your liner."

      "title": "Use a long-lasting eyeliner to reduce the likelihood of it smudging over time.",
      "content": "Use a long-lasting eyeliner to reduce the likelihood of it smudging over time. If you tend to have drier skin, you won't have as much of a problem using wax pencils, but if you tend to have oily skin, steer away from wax eyeliners or liners made with whipped gels—they'll smear and smudge more easily because of your skin type. Read the label when you're shopping and look for statements like, “long-wearing” or “smudge resistant.” [5] X Research source Generally, liquid eyeliner will stay in place longer than pencil or gel eyeliners. Pencil eyeliners are often made to be smudged to create a specific kind of look. Gel eyeliners run easily and are harder to apply since they come in a pot and need to be applied with a makeup brush. As great as kohl eyeliner might look, it will definitely smudge over the course of the day. Avoid it for those times when you really don't want to risk smearing your eyeliner."

      "title": "Reduce the risk of runny eyes by keeping liner away from your waterline.",
      "content": "Reduce the risk of runny eyes by keeping liner away from your waterline. The waterline is the area of skin between your eyeballs and your lashes. It's a really popular spot to put eyeliner because it makes your eyes pop, but having eyeliner there will also make your eyes water, which will, in turn, make your eyeliner smear. Instead, apply liner on the lash line or just under it (for your lower lids) or over it (for your upper lids). [6] X Research source If you want to line your waterline because you love the way it looks, make sure to bring your eyeliner with you when you leave home so you can refresh your look during the day."

    {
      "title": "Apply the liner",
      "content": "Apply the liner with gentle movements so you don't irritate your eyes. Oil and moisture are the biggest culprits in smudging your eyeliner. Avoid pressing down hard on your lids, and be careful to not accidentally poke yourself in the eye. The gentler the application, the less likely your eyes will be irritated and start watering. [7] X Research source If you use a pencil liner, keep the edge sharpened so that you don't have to press down too hard to apply the liner."

      "title": "Make a barrier out of primer and powder to keep eyeliner in place.",
      "content": "Make a barrier out of primer and powder to keep eyeliner in place. This works especially well for the liner on your lower lids. After you've applied the eyeliner, take a very thin makeup brush and apply a line of primer beneath the eyeliner. Follow that with a thin layer of powder. This should create a really thin, invisible barrier that will keep your liner in place so you can avoid the dreaded raccoon eyes. [8] X Research source It's best to wait 1 to 2 minutes after applying the liner so that it has had time to dry before you create the barrier."

      "title": "Top your eyeliner with a matching eyeshadow to set the liner in place.",
      "content": "Top your eyeliner with a matching eyeshadow to set the liner in place. Use a thin makeup brush to carefully apply a layer of eyeshadow overtop of your eyeliner. You can also use this opportunity to fix any small mistakes you may have made, like a slightly uneven line or a gap in the eyeliner. The layer of eyeshadow will protect the eyeliner from the oils that accumulate over the course of the day, slowing down the smudging effect."

    {
      "title": "Opt for waterproof mascara to provide a barrier for your eyeliner.",
      "content": "Opt for waterproof mascara to provide a barrier for your eyeliner. Waterproof mascara will keep wetness from your eyes and oils from your skin from your eyeliner, which will help it last longer. Be very careful when putting on the mascara, because if it gets on your skin or messes up your eyeliner, it'll be really hard to get off without having to redo everything. [9] X Research source Make sure to take off your waterproof mascara every night."

      "title": "Use a setting spray to increase the wear-time for your eyeliner.",
      "content": "Use a setting spray to increase the wear-time for your eyeliner. Finish doing the rest of your makeup first. Then, hold the setting spray about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) away from your face, close your eyes, and mist your face. Keep your eyes closed until the spray has completely dried, which shouldn't take more than 5 to 10 seconds. Never rub the spray into your eyeliner. [10] X Research source If you have dry skin, avoid using a setting spray that has alcohol in it, as it could dry out your skin even more. If you have oily skin, look for oil-free sprays to avoid making your face look shiny. Use blotting paper to carefully pat the area around your eyes if you find they're getting oily and shiny over the course of the day. This way, your fingers won't smear your eyeliner, and you can remove the oil at the same time."

      "content": "Avoid moisture, sweating, and heat to prolong your eyeliner's life. Things like swimming, showering, exercising, using a sauna, sunbathing, and other similar activities can quickly cause your eyeliner to start running. If you're intent on keeping your makeup looking fresh all day long, do your best to avoid these types of things. If you know you're going to do something that might ruin your eyeliner, bring makeup wipes and your makeup bag with you. That way, after the activity, you can clean your face and reapply your makeup."

      "title": "Keep your hands away from your eyes to protect your eyeliner.",
      "content": "Keep your hands away from your eyes to protect your eyeliner. If you don't normally wear eye makeup, you may be used to rubbing your eyes or touching them throughout the day. Remember to keep your hands away from them when you're wearing eyeliner, though! Similarly, avoid rubbing your face against other materials, like scarves, jackets, or a shirtsleeves.
