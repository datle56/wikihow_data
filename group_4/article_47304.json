      "content": "Choose Jamaican black castor oil for thick hair and cold-pressed for thin hair. Jamaican black castor oil is boiled with ash, which gives it its distinctive dark color and lovely roasted scent.

Use it if you have thinner hair so you don’t add extra weight or oily residue to your hair. [10] X Research source You can find both types of castor oil at your local beauty supply shop. You can also order them online. There are other castor oil products that have added colors and scents you can choose from if you prefer."
