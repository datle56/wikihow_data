      "content": "Wash and dry your hair. Crimping will work best on clean hair. Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Allow hair to air dry or blow dry it completely as your hair crimper won't work on wet hair. [1] X Research source Using a heated crimping iron on wet hair could cause damage to your follicles."

      "title": "Apply a styling product to your hair.",
      "content": "Apply a styling product to your hair. If you are prone to frizzy hair, apply a dime-sized amount of anti-frizzing serum. Next, mist a volumizing styling spray or spritz all over your hair. Your hair will hold a crimp longer if it has a thickening product in it. [2] X Research source Blast your hair with a blow dryer for several seconds to lock the product onto it. To protect your hair from heat damage, consider applying a moisturizing product like argan oil to the ends of it. Applying a heat protectant spray all over your hair is another styling option."

      "title": "Plug in the hair crimper and allow it to heat up.",
      "content": "Plug in the hair crimper and allow it to heat up. Find an outlet near a mirror to plug in your hair crimper, possibly in your bathroom. Select the medium heat setting, which will crimp your hair effectively without burning your scalp. Allow it to warm up for 3-5 minutes before using it. Note that the higher the heat setting, the more effective the styling will be. However, high heat settings also cause more damage to your hair. Finding the amount of heat needed for your hair type can take some trial and error over multiple uses."

      "title": "Crimp hair in 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 2 inches (5.1 cm) sections for 3-5 seconds each.",
      "content": "Crimp hair in 1 inch (2.5 cm) or 2 inches (5.1 cm) sections for 3-5 seconds each. Grab a section of hair at the bottom with your non-dominant hand and gently clamp down the crimper using your other hand, starting at the roots. Get as close to your scalp as possible without burning it. Hold down for 3-5 seconds, and then release the clamp. If you have long or thick hair, it might be easier to work in quadrants. Part your hair down the middle from your forehead to your neck to create two sections. Part it again around the back of your head from ear to ear to create four sections. Use clips to clip up the hair you aren't currently working with and keep it out of the way."

      "content": "Continue crimping down the length of your hair for a uniform look. Slide the tool down the length of your hair and clamp down on the next section. Overlap the barrel of the crimper over the last kink you made. This will prevent any gaps in your waves. [3] X Research source Continue until the entire section is crimped."

      "content": "Crimp hair in a sporadic pattern for a more natural look. To get a more casual look, apply the crimper sparingly to different sections of your hair. Vary the pattern, leaving sections of your hair uncrimped. After you are done, tousle your hair for a carefree, beach style. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure the style with hair spray.",
      "content": "Secure the style with hair spray. Spritz your hair with a styling spray for longer-lasting waves. Use a hairspray with flexible hold for a looser style. A hairspray with an extra-strong hold is a good idea if you are going to be exposed to wind or need your hair to stay wavy all day long."

Add a thickening product like mousse to your damp hair from root to tip, then blow dry your hair. For extra volume, blow dry your hair upside down to redirect the roots upwards.

Rub your roots lightly with your fingers to blend in any powder residue that may remain from the spray. [6] X Research source Dry shampoo will add a subtle hold to your hair, making it easier to hold waves when you crimp it."

Place the barrel of your crimper around each section near the root and clamp down. Hold each section for about 2-3 seconds, then release it. [7] X Research source Be very careful to avoid burning your scalp. This should amount to 2-3 sections on each side of your head."

      "content": "Buy a hair crimper with ceramic plates for regular use. You can purchase a hair crimper with either ceramic or metal plates. If you plan to use this styling tool on a regular basis, opt for a ceramic model. This kind of crimper will cost more but will cause less damage to your hair than one with metal plates. Ceramic plates also help to control frizz."

      "content": "Purchase a hair crimper with metal plates for occasional use. If you only plan to crimp your hair on rare occasions, opt for a model with metal plates. While these plates do cause a bit more damage than ceramic plates, it will not make a big difference with limited use. Crimpers with metal plates are also a more cost-effective choice."

      "content": "Select a crimper with adjustable temperature settings. Thin hair should be crimped at a lower temperature than thick hair to prevent damage, so try to avoid buying a crimper with just one temperature setting. Go with a model with adjustable temperature settings and multiple temperature options to choose from. Many heat styling tools mention the temperature range or maximum temperature on the packaging. Some models offer an automatic turn-off feature."

Choose a crimper with a large, wide barrel and deep grooves if you want big, soft waves. Choose a hair crimper with a small barrel and narrow grooves if you want small, tight waves. Shop for a hair crimper in salons, beauty supply stores, department stores, or online."
