      "content": "You convert sexual energy by adjusting your sexual behavior. Think of sexual energy like normal matter; it cannot be created or destroyed, just converted to something else. There are two general strategies you might employ to convert sexual energy (although there are several ways you could go about them): [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Sexual abstinence—refraining from sex or masturbation for a period of time to spend your sexual energy elsewhere. Sexual expression—changing the way you engage in sex or masturbation to change the flow of energy."

      "content": "It’s the process of converting sexual energy into a higher goal. Your sexual desires, your orgasm, and your attraction to others are all-powerful forces. That energy can be redirected to non-sexual desires, though! This is the premise behind sexual transmutation—you take all of that sexual energy, and you focus it elsewhere. [2] X Research source Transmutation is a principle that goes back to the magick principles of alchemy: the belief that you can convert metals and other materials into something new.

      "content": "Meditate before masturbating or having sex to set your intention. Before you engage in sexual activity, visualize what you want out of the future. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Find a quiet place, sit comfortably, and close your eyes. Then, take deep breaths while monitoring on your body’s sensations. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source As you meditate, formulate your intention and focus on what you want. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, you may set an intention to find peace in your work life, get out from under debt, or improve your relationship with a higher power. A lot of this is based on the laws of attraction —the belief that asking the universe for something while maintaining a positive mindset will get you what you want."

      "content": "Incorporate breathwork into your masturbation to amplify your consciousness. Mindful breathing can help you focus your energy or elevate your awareness while you pleasure yourself. [7] X Research source Try taking long, deep breaths and holding them for a fraction of a second at the peak of each breath cycle. Alternatively, you can breathe rhythmically in an even pattern. [8] X Research source This will put you more in tune with your subconscious energy and elevate your awareness of your body. You may feel a little awkward doing this at first, but just relax as much as you possibly can and take your time."

      "content": "Visualize your energy and desire while orgasming to manifest goals . What you picture in your mind’s eye in the moments leading up to and during your climax can hold incredible power. [9] X Research source As you’re entering your climax, picture your body vibrating and generating colorful, radiant energy. [10] X Research source At your peak, you might feel yourself achieving your deepest desire, or obtaining the object of your intention. Manifestation is the act of bringing personal goals into reality by pouring your spiritual energy into what you desire. The moment of climax is filled with a monumental amount of energy, so visualizing what you want in this moment can dramatically influence your future. If you’ve never experienced an orgasm, that’s okay! Some people simply don’t orgasm at all. [11] X Research source You can still try this if you’d like; just focus on the moment of highest intensity."

      "title": "Redirect sexual energy via abstinence to become more creative.",
      "content": "Redirect sexual energy via abstinence to become more creative. If you want to simply redirect your sexual energy, try taking a break from sex and masturbation entirely. Your sexual energy is powerful, and focusing it on activities other than sex can help you generate new ideas, be more productive, or uncover subconscious desires. Simply refrain from giving in to sexual urges and see how you feel! [12] X Research source The idea here is that over time, you’ll naturally feel more creative and innovative just by abstaining from sex. By keeping your sexual energy bottled up, it will naturally flow to other parts of your life. Don’t force yourself to stay abstinent for an extended period of time if this doesn’t feel helpful or meaningful to you. Using abstinence to redirect sexual energy doesn’t mean that there’s anything intrinsically wrong with having sex or masturbating (there’s not). It’s just simply one method you may find productive."

[13] X Research source Try exploring new sexual interests and kinks. Explore your body to get to know it as intimately as possible. You might give yourself a massage, light candles and dim the lights while you touch yourself, or simply explore your interests online. [14] X Research source If you’ve never used sex toys, now is the perfect time to start! There are all kinds of different toys out there that can generate unique sensations and help you stumble on to new energies and wavelengths."

[15] X Research source Never feel bad about exploring your sexuality. If sexual experiences are stressful for you, ask yourself why? Sort through your feelings and unlock your true, sexual self. [16] X Research source Society puts a lot of messages out there—especially towards women—that can make you feel ashamed about your sexuality. Do not let that noise influence your energy. If you’ve experienced trauma in the past or you grew up in a super religious household and you’re struggling to reframe your perspective, talking to a therapist can dramatically improve the way you feel. Reader Poll: We asked 269 wikiHow readers and 58% of them agreed that talking to others helps them to manage their stress. [Take Poll] So, talking to a friend or counselor may help you to manage your stress around sex."

Consider taking a break from the porn to see how that impacts your sexual energy. You may be surprised with how your energy and auras react to a little bit of a break.

Whether it’s a toxic relationship that’s draining your energy, or a traumatic experience keeping you from being present when you’re engaging in sexual activity, getting back in a positive, healthy headspace can unblock your sexual energy.

If you’re masturbating or having sex compulsively, you don’t appreciate or respect your body, or you use sex to numb uncomfortable feelings, you may be creating a barrier between you and a healthy sex life. Resolving any underlying issues you have with your relationship to sex can unblock the energy you’re trying to access.

If you’re sexually active with a partner, ask them to try Tantric sex if you want to combine your sexual energies and redirect them together. Meditate together, try naked yoga, spend time staring at each other, and stimulate one another without focusing on orgasming. [20] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Tantric sex is all about getting to know your partner and letting your souls and emotional energies intertwine. Don’t fixate on the outcome—enjoy the journey! You might even experiment with having sex and intentionally stopping right before climax to harvest that sexual energy. This is known as edging, and it’s a popular way to maximize sexual energy. [21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
