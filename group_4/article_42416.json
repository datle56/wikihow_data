If you want to change brands, do so slowly. Mix 1/2 and 1/2 for a week, then 1/4 and 3/4 for a week, then full change over."

Usually readily available commercial food is fine for your puppy. Examine the first five ingredients on the dog food label; the first one or two ingredients should be meat (not meat by-products which are fine but they should be further down the list) followed by vegetables, and then grains. Once in a while an English bulldog will have signs of food intolerance (diarrhea, vomiting, or skin problems) to one or more of the ingredients in a food. If your puppy or dog shows these signs, you will need to work with your veterinarian to determine the cause and then follow a strict lifelong diet to minimize symptoms."

      "content": "Watch your dog's weight. English bulldogs can put on weight easily, so you need to watch that your puppy doesn’t get overweight. If your puppy is putting on too much weight, consult with your veterinarian about the best, and safest, way to keep your dog's weight in balance. Remember treats add calories to the diet so they should be fed in tiny amounts and sparingly. Reserve these for when your puppy is training. [5] X Expert Source Brian Bourquin, DVM Veterinarian Expert Interview. 20 December 2019. Monitor your bulldog’s body condition score (BCS) to determine if it is overweight (or underweight) on a monthly basis. A normal-weight dog will have a “tucked” abdomen (when viewed from the side) and its ribs will be easily felt but not seen. A fat dog will lose the abdomen tuck, as fat accumulates here and on the ribs cage. An underweight dog will have a more extreme abdomen tuck and its ribs will both be easily felt and easily seen."

Your dog can be the perfect host for these pests if regular treatment for these nasty pests is not given. Your veterinarian is the best source of knowledge for the local bugs that bug the local dog population and how to prevent these pests. Heartworm is a widespread disease present spread by mosquitoes throughout most of the United States. [6] X Research source A yearly blood test is taken to make sure the dog isn’t infected with this nasty parasite, then a monthly tablet or a shot that lasts for up to 6 months is used to kill any organisms present in the bloodstream. There is a treatment for heartworm, but it is expensive and takes a toll physically on the dog and can take months to combat. Another vaccination to consider, especially if you live in an endemic area, is the Lyme’s disease vaccination. This is especially important for dogs that spend a lot of time outside, that live on farms, or that hunt, as they are at increased risk of contracting this tick-borne disease. In addition to joint pain, swelling, and fevers, dogs can also get a generally fatal kidney disease as the consequence of contracting Lyme’s disease."

The veterinarian will examine the puppies to make sure there are no hernias, heart, lung, or eye or ear problems in any of the pups. Generally, they will be de-wormed at this time and be given their first puppy shot (the distemper” vaccine). At 9 weeks, and then again at 12 weeks, the de-wormer and distemper vaccines will be repeated. Then these can be given once a year or on a schedule determined by you and your veterinarian.

John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2006 At the 12 weeks visit the rabies vaccination will be given—although this may vary depending on local laws. This vaccination is required by many communities. There can sometimes be severe penalties if your dog is not rabies vaccinated especially if the dog bites a person or another pet. As your dog ages, more frequent examinations will need to be given. Twice yearly examination will catch medical issues before they become big problems. Older dogs frequently suffer from arthritis and heart disease just like elderly humans. There are effective and safe treatments that can help your older dog live reasonably pain-free and pleasant golden years."

The inner ear part of the ear is normally white or darker colored, usually corresponding to the color of the dog's coat, so look for discoloring. The puppy's ears should also not smell nor have any discharge in the ear or on the flap. The ear should be free of debris, dirt, or parasites, like ticks or mites.

[11] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source By brushing daily (or at least 2 to 3 times a week), you will remove the bacteria and plaque that build up each day on the teeth. It also gives you a great opportunity to examine your dog’s mouth for loose or damaged teeth, sores, growths, or any unusual things, and bring them to your veterinarian’s attention at an early stage before they become big problems. Never use human toothpaste on a dog; only use dental toothpaste made for dogs. The fluoride in human toothpaste is poisonous to dogs and can cause serious health problems. Place a little puppy toothpaste on your fingertip and let your puppy lick it off. The next day put it on your finger and rub it along the outer gums. Then try to put a little on a dog toothbrush, let the puppy lick it then run the toothbrush along the outer edges of the teeth and gums. Only the outer part (against the cheeks) needs to be brushed. It should only take about 30 seconds to brush the puppy’s teeth. Even with regular tooth brushing, dogs may need dental cleanings once in a while. Plaque and bacteria can build up under the gum line causing problems there or in the roots of the teeth. Just like with their human owners, regular mouth examinations by their doggy dentist should be done once a year."

The procedure needs to be done correctly so you don’t trim the “quick,” or the part of the nail where the blood vessels and nerves are. Once a dog has been “quicked,” or the quick has been cut, it will be hard to trim your puppy's nails, due to fear of pain and bleeding."

Instead of punishing your puppy when it doesn't do the right thing, you need to make it a pleasurable experience when it does the right thing. Give your dog a treat (either a snack or praise and love) when it follows your directions and it will make the puppy want to do what you say! Teaching your puppy to heel while walking on a leash is also important. Not only is it a good way for your puppy to learn direction, it also gives them exercise and socialization out in the world. Just be sure not to walk your puppy too much. Little puppies get pooped out really easily, so don't walk them into the ground."

Younger puppies under the age of 14 to 16 weeks are most amenable to socialization, as after this age they become more wary of new situations, humans, and other animals. Get your puppy used to riding in the car and walking around the neighborhood. You should also get it used to humans of all ages, sizes, colors, and genders (safely and in a friendly way). Also, make sure to safely introduce him to friendly dogs and cats. A great way to introduce the puppy to people and dogs is at puppy socialization or obedience classes held at large pet stores, veterinary clinics, or through community courses."

Be sure to keep your puppy cool enough in summer months. Any temperature of 90 degrees or above can be very dangerous. If you take your puppy out during a hot day, be sure to wet it down and provide unlimited water to drink. Keep the puppy's time out to a minimum during extreme heat. Bulldog puppies can get cold very easily. Be sure to keep it in a warm environment during colder months to avoid catching a cold.

Bring your puppy into an air conditioned room during hot or humid weather and only exercise it inside during extremes of weather.
