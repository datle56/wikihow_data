      "title": "Understand why you may have received a Content ID claim.",
      "content": "Understand why you may have received a Content ID claim. Content ID is a system that identifies potential copyrighted content in videos by scanning uploaded videos for previously-uploaded content. The system will scan for audio, video, and images. If a match occurs, the original owner is notified and a Content ID claim is filed. The original owner can choose to do nothing, mute their audio in your video, block the video from being viewed, monetize the video, or track the video's viewership."
    },

      "title": "Decide if you want to do anything.",
      "content": "Decide if you want to do anything. Content ID claims are not necessarily a negative thing for your account. If you're fine with part of the audio being blocked or with ad revenue going to the original owner, you can decide not to do anything. The only time a Content ID claim can be negative is when the owner blocks your video globally. This can put your account in bad standing."

      "content": "Use YouTube's tools to try to remove or swap the music. If your claim was because of a song used in your video, you can try YouTube's automated removal tools to take the song out without having to re-upload the video: [1] X Research source Open the Video Manager page and find the video you want to remove or swap the song from. Click the â–¼ button next to \"Edit\" and select \"Audio.\" Click \"Remove this song\" next to the Content ID'd song you want to remove. This may not be possible on all videos. Select a replacement track if you'd like from the YouTube Audio Library. Many of these songs are free to use and monetize."

You can see which videos apply for this in the Monetization section of your account. Click the gray \"$\" button next to the video.

      "title": "Ensure your video falls under \"Fair Use.\"",
      "content": "Ensure your video falls under \"Fair Use.\" If you've received a copyright strike on your video, it's because the original creator or owner has decided that your video does not fall under \"fair use.\" Fair use allows you to use content that others have created, but only in specific circumstances that are decided on a case-by-case basis. Fair use is a fairly complicated topic, but generally your video will be measured against the following four factors (in the US): [3] X Research source The purpose of using the copyrighted content. The video needs to add new expression or meaning to the original copyrighted content. Non-profit and educational uses are given more leeway, but are not exempt. If your video is monetized, your chances of claiming fair use diminish. The nature of the copyrighted content. Using factual copyrighted content (e.g. news reports) is usually considered more fair than fictional content (e.g. movies). The ratio of copyrighted content to your own content. You'll have a better chance of claiming fair use if you only use a few bits and pieces of the copyrighted content, and the vast majority of the video is your own work. Harm done to the potential profits of the copyright holder. If your video can be perceived to cause a negative impact on the owner's profits, you are less likely to be eligible for fair use. Parody is the main exception to this."

During this time, you'll lose access to certain YouTube features, such as uploading videos longer than 15 minutes. This is your only course of action if the copyright claim was legitimate and you did in fact violate a copyright when posting the video. During the wait, you'll need to complete the YouTube Copyright School by watching a video and answering a few questions at youtube.com/copyright_school . If you receive another copyright strike during this waiting period, your six month waiting period will restart. If you receive three strikes, your account will be terminated."

      "content": "Contact the copyright owner and ask for a retraction. If possible, contacting the claimant may be quicker than appealing your strike. If the claimant has a YouTube account, use the private message function to send them a message. If a corporation or other entity filed the claim, you'll need to find and contact their copyright department. Be polite when requesting a retraction, and clearly explain why you believe the strike was a mistake. Don't just say \"fair use;\" give evidence for why you believe the claim to be wrong. The claimant is under no obligation to retract the copyright strike claim."
