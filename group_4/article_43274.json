      "title": "You see shadows and figures, or a clear apparition.",
      "content": "You see shadows and figures, or a clear apparition. If you've ever seen anything seemingly inexplicable in your home, this can be a sign of a haunting. You may see dark shadows in the corner of your eye or even shadowy figures resembling people or animals. [1] X Research source Remember, however, that your peripheral vision is often unreliable. If you think you see a spirit out of the corner of your eye, it may be a trick of the light. Set up a video camera in your home when you're away to capture any unusual shadows on film."

      "title": "You feel like you're being watched.",
      "content": "You feel like you're being watched. Your intuition can help guide you when evaluating whether your house is haunted. People who live in allegedly haunted homes sometimes feel like they're being watched or frequently feel a weird sensation on the back of their neck. If you ever get a sense you're not alone, even if no one else is in the room, this can be a sign of a haunting. [2] X Research source Remember, ghosts are usually just people. They don’t have a body, but they were a person once. If you feel like other people are around you, it may be a big sign they are. If you have other people living with you, ask them if they also experience the sense of being watched. Keep in mind that feelings of nervousness and paranoia can also be attributed to underlying mental health issues. A mental health professional should evaluate this kind of anxiety."

      "title": "You smell unusual or inexplicable odors.",
      "content": "You smell unusual or inexplicable odors. Some people think ghosts can leave unusual smells that do not have a clear source. Sulfur and bad odors are often associated with hauntings. However, smells like food and perfume may also be detected. [3] X Research source Rule out other possible sources before assuming a smell is supernatural. Try to follow the smell to see if it has a source or notice if you left a window open. An unusual smell can float in from outside."
    },
    {
      "title": "You feel random cold spots or temperature changes.",
      "content": "You feel random cold spots or temperature changes. Some believe that ghosts can cause dips in temperature. If you notice spots in your home seem cold, even if there is no obvious cause of a draft, this can be a sign of a haunting. [4] X Research source However, double-check for cracks in doors and open windows near the cold spots. Drafts can easily be a culprit for unusual cold spots in your home."
    },
    {
      "title": "You hear unusual noises.",
      "content": "You hear unusual noises. People who believe they live in haunted houses report odd noises. You may hear inexplicable footsteps, scratching, music, or even soft voices. [5] X Research source Remember, unusual noises can be caused by opened windows or your neighbor's TV set. Don't attribute them to hauntings without checking for more plausible explanations. Mice, rats, or bugs can make scratching and footstep sounds. Having an exterminator check out your home is a good idea to rule that out and provide treatment if necessary. You can also use a phone, tablet, or digital audio recorder to capture noises."

      "title": "Your electronic devices are constantly drained or acting up.",
      "content": "Your electronic devices are constantly drained or acting up. Is your phone constantly at 1%, or does your TV turn on and off by itself? These phenomena may be explained by a ghost in your house trying to pull its energy from your power sources. [6] X Research source Phone batteries also die quickly when the device or charger is old and faulty. If professionals have checked out your phone and TV and they are in good condition, this could be the work of a paranormal entity."

      "content": "You find objects that have moved from where you last left them. You may have left your keys by the front door hook, and now they're on your bedside table. If you’re repeatedly finding things in odd places or where you’re certain you didn’t leave them, this could be a ghost in your house trying to assert its presence or make the home feel the way they like. [7] X Research source Sometimes, people misplace things or don’t remember moving things from one spot to the other. If other people share your space, they also may be moving objects around."

[8] X Research source Nightmares may be very vivid, to the point you can physically feel things in your dreams. If you're experiencing things like shortness of breath during sleep, however, see a doctor. These symptoms can be a sign of a medical condition, such as sleep apnea, which should be ruled out before you attribute the issues to ghosts. Nightmares can also have psychological causes. If you've been stressed or upset lately, this may be causing your nightmares as well."
