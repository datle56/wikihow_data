Questions should be used to denote a question and exclamation marks can be used to denote excitement or anger. Many people spell words with shortened spelling so as to not take up as many characters. For example, you might see \"tho\" instead of \"thought,\" \"u\" or \"ur\" instead of \"You\" or \"your,\" or \"thx\" instead of \"thanks.\""
