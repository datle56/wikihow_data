      "content": "Send a flirty text to your crush to show them they’re on your mind. You’re killing two birds with one stone here. You’re letting them know you’re thinking about them and also getting them to start thinking about you. Send a coy or cheeky text to make the point that you’re thinking about them in a rather special way. [1] X Research source “Just thinking about how your laugh is probably my favorite sound.” “You know our text thread is pinned at the top of my messages? So you’re always the first person I think of when I write a text.” “Ugh, school just wasn’t the same today without you here. You totally miss me too, right?” “Do you think about me as much as I think about you?” “Planning out my week right now. Are you free for a date sometime?” “I’m trying to be productive, but I literally can’t stop thinking of you.”"

      "title": "Give them a compliment",
      "content": "Give them a compliment to fluster them a bit. If you’re texting your crush , why not get them blushing with a bit of flattery? It also never hurts to point out all of their best features and brighten up their day. Think about every single thing you love about them and compliment them with a short, sweet message. “I was just thinking about how well you played in yesterday’s game. You were awesome!” “Suddenly thinking about how sweet and kind you are.” “Someone asked me who I thought the funniest person is, and I instantly started thinking of you.” “Thinking about how you always make time for me and how much I love that.” “Couldn’t help but think about how pretty your smile is.” “I’m just thinking about how absolutely perfect you are.”"

Send a simple “Good morning!” or “Sweet dreams” text to let them know that you’re thinking of them. “ Good morning to my favorite person!” “Wanted to make sure you were the first person I said good morning to.” “I had a dream about you last night. Want to hear about it?” “Hoping you had a great day today! Sleep well!” “You’re the first person I want to think of when I wake up and the last person I want to think of before I go to bed.” “Good night and sweet dreams.”"

      "content": "Tell them you saw something that reminded you of them. Sometimes it’s the little things that make us think of that certain someone. Maybe it’s a song that you and your crush listened to for the first time together. Or maybe you saw a meme that you knew would make them laugh. Whatever it may be, shoot your crush a quick message and take a few seconds to bond over your shared experience. “I just started reading your favorite book and OMG it’s sooo good!” “You should know that I can’t eat tacos without instantly thinking of you.” “I saw a dog in the park and I just know you would’ve freaked out over how cute it was.” “I just know you’re going to find this meme absolutely hilarious.” “This video just popped up and I thought you’d like it.” “I just heard a song that totally reminded me of you.”"

They’ll probably find it endearing that you’re thinking about them so much! Send them a text with your honest feelings and maybe ask them if you can see them again soon. [2] X Research source “I keep thinking about how it’s been forever since I saw you.” “Except for when I’m sleeping, I’m always thinking about you.” “I just realized that we haven’t seen each other in a whole week!

      "content": "Ask a random question to start the conversation. It might be a bit of an odd way to tell your crush you’re thinking of them, but hey, why not do something a little unexpected? It’s kind of like saying, “I had this really random thought and you were the first person I wanted to share it with.” When you think about it, it’s kind of sweet. Just send them whatever’s on your mind at that very moment. “Are you a supporter of pineapple on pizza?” “Would you love me even if I was a worm?” “Did you know that cashews come from a fruit?” “Do straws have one hole or two?” “Is a hotdog a sandwich?” “How many cats is too many cats in your opinion?”"
