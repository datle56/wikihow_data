      "content": "Ensure that the local authorities permit the use of BX cable. There are many types of armored cables—not all of them may be acceptable for use in all circumstances. For example, BX cable without an internal bonding strip are not accepted by the National Electrical Code (NEC). [1] X Research source Make sure you have the proper connectors for the selected type of cable. Some types may work for several cable types, while others may be prohibited. Be sure to obtain any necessary electrical permits, even if your jurisdiction allows the work to be done by a non-licensed electrician. Many inspectors will want to see the \"listing label\" for your cable so they can verify that it conforms to the code requirements and standards for cable construction. Retain the label or package for all components for later inspection."

      "title": "Determine the length of wire needed for your project.",
      "content": "Determine the length of wire needed for your project. Always add 30 centimeter (11.8 in) to your required cable length for any waste/damage. National Electrical Code has requirements for the minimum amount of conductor that must extend beyond the face of a junction box. Local codes may require more. Check your local electrical codes for more information."

      "title": "Cut a 20 centimeter (7.9 in) length of the armored cable.",
      "content": "Cut a 20 centimeter (7.9 in) length of the armored cable. You can use either a hacksaw or an armored cable cutter, which can cost anywhere from $30 to $60 on average. Cut across the armor, not with the spiral. It is not necessary to cut completely through the armor. When the cut is nearly through, grab the cable jacket above and below the cut and twist sharply. This should break the remaining armor without the need for the saw to contact the wires inside. Use caution—the metal edges are sharp. Carefully inspect the interior insulation to make sure none of the conductors have been exposed by nicks or gashes. If there is damage, you may need to try again by moving back and redoing another cut."

      "title": "Push an anti-short bushing onto the wires where it contacts the metal armor.",
      "content": "Push an anti-short bushing onto the wires where it contacts the metal armor. These bushings are made of plastic. You may be required to use bushings that have an indicator tab, tip or tail. Repeat this process at the other end of the armored cable."

    {
      "title": "Insert a BX connector over the end of the newly cut cable.",
      "content": "Insert a BX connector over the end of the newly cut cable. Tighten the screw to secure it to the armor. Remove the threaded ring from the connector to use inside the electrical box. Most BX connectors have a small hole or slot through which you must show the tab, tip or tail of the bushing, so the inspector knows it is in there."

    {
      "title": "Strip the exposed wires.",
      "content": "Strip the exposed wires. Pull them through the knockout hole of the electrical box, along with the open end of the connector. If your project is adding to existing wiring, make sure the power is off for all of the branch circuits feeding power to all of the box locations you're working on."

    {
      "title": "Secure the connector to the electrical box with the threaded ring.",
      "content": "Secure the connector to the electrical box with the threaded ring. Many new installations require an inspection at this stage of \"rough-in\" prior to getting permission to connect any devices to the conductors."

    {
      "title": "Connect the wires",
      "content": "Connect the wires to your switch/outlet/splice in the electrical box. Add any required cable supports (e.g., staples, clamps, brackets). Repeat for the connections at the other end."

    {
      "title": "Visually verify that your wiring is complete.",
      "content": "Visually verify that your wiring is complete. Ensure that no exposed conductors remain. It's a good idea to have someone else double-check your work before turning the power on to the cable. Once your wiring project is done, you can energize the circuit."
