      "content": "Comb the top of your hair into a section and pull it out of your face. Brush the hair on the top of your head forward so it lies flat. Gather the longest part of your pixie up onto the top of your head and clip it in place. If you have a pixie with a lot of length on top, you might comb above your ears around your head and clip the hair up. [1] X Research source Have a super short pixie all around? You may not need to clip any hair back."

      "content": "Wrap a towel around your neck and comb the hair on the sides of your head down. To make cleanup easier, wrap a clean towel around your neck to catch little hairs. In a pinch, you can cut a plastic trash bag and wrap it around you. Tape the bag in place so loose hairs don't fall underneath it. Then, use a comb to smooth the hair down on the sides and back of your head. This is probably where the hair growth is bothering you. [2] X Research source If you have a salon cape, put it on so little hairs don't fall all over you."

      "title": "Choose a guard based on how short you want to go and snap it onto hair clippers.",
      "content": "Choose a guard based on how short you want to go and snap it onto hair clippers. Hair clipping sets come with a handful of guards that clip onto the blades so you can adjust how close the blades come to your scalp. The clippers range from #1, which cuts down to 1 ⁄ 8 inch (0.32 cm) of your scalp, to #8, which leaves your hair 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. [3] X Research source The clipper guard size is totally up to you! Just remember that smaller numbers will cut closer to your scalp while larger numbers will leave more length. If in doubt, start with bigger numbers and work towards smaller numbers if your hair is still longer than you like."

    {
      "title": "Run the clippers down along the back of your neck.",
      "content": "Run the clippers down along the back of your neck. Turn on the clippers and comb them down through your hair. To get rid of shaggy bulk, start near your ear line and run the clippers down the long hair that's at the base of your neck. Work just along the neckline, but don't cut up around your ear or you might make the hair on the sides of your head too short. [4] X Research source If you're trimming all of your hair and don't want any length on top, comb the clippers over your entire head to cut your pixie back to an even length."

    {
      "title": "Switch to a guard with a higher number and run the clippers through the sides.",
      "content": "Switch to a guard with a higher number and run the clippers through the sides. If you want to create a gradual fade from the base of your neck up through the sides and toward the top of your hair, choose a guard that's at least 1 or 2 sizes larger than the one you used for the base of your neck. Start near your temple and run the clippers from the crown of your head down towards the base of your neck. Work gradually around the side of your head until you reach the other temple. [5] X Research source You can leave the sides as long as you like. Some pixie cuts keep the sides pretty short, while others leave the sides a few inches longer than the neckline. If you want the hair on the sides of your head to be really short, just use the same guard that you used to trim your neckline."

      "title": "Brush your top hair down and use shears to trim out of place hairs at the back.",
      "content": "Brush your top hair down and use shears to trim out of place hairs at the back. If you clipped your hair to the top of your head, unclip it and brush your hair down. Pinch a section of hair through your index and middle finger near one side of your head to see how long it's grown out. Then, take your shears and cut as much length from the hair as you want. [6] X Research source For a super short pixie, you can probably skip this step since the hair clippers will evenly trim your hair close to your scalp."

      "title": "Keep trimming the length around the side of your head.",
      "content": "Keep trimming the length around the side of your head. Since it's easy to lose your place when you're trimming your own hair, move your fingers about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the section you just trimmed. Keep them at the same level on the side of your head and trim your hair to the same length. For example, if you trimmed 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the side of your hair near your ears, make sure that you're trimming that same amount as you cut the hair around your head. [7] X Research source Once you've gone around your head, you can trim the hair that's lower down on your head to make a tapered pixie style."

      "content": "Drag a guarded razor along your neckline to clean up tiny hairs. A guarded razor looks like a straight razor that's with a metal comb. It's great for cleaning up fine hairs along the neckline. To use it, stand with your back to a mirror and hold another mirror in front of you so you can see your neckline. Take your guarded razor and gently rub it back and forth below your neckline to shave off fine hairs. This makes your neckline more pronounced and makes your whole pixie cut look polished. [8] X Research source A guarded razor is really just for trimming near the back or sides of your neck— not for shaving your face or legs."

      "title": "Trim length from the nape of your neck so your style looks polished.",
      "content": "Trim length from the nape of your neck so your style looks polished. If you have thick or wavy hair, the hair near the base of your neck will probably flip or curl out as it grows. Put a guard on hair clippers and run it just along your neckline to remove some length. Remember, the lower the guard number, the closer it cuts to your scalp. If you're trying to leave some length, try a #5 or #6 clipper, for instance. Then, take a guarded razor to shave fine hairs that grow below your neckline. [9] X Research source Trim bulk from your nape every few weeks as you grow the style out. Since it can be tricky to cut the back of your hair, ask a friend to help or at least hold a mirror for you. If you have fine or thin hair, you may not need to trim your neckline very often. However, you'll probably need to trim every 4 weeks if you have thick hair."

      "content": "Don't trim the hair on top of your head. We know it's hard, but resist the urge! The hair on top of your head has to grow out so it reaches the base of your neck. Don't cut it unless you see split ends. This is where cute hair accessories like bobby pins, hair scarves, and headbands come in! [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Use pins, scarves, and hair accessories to pull your hair back.",
      "content": "Use pins, scarves, and hair accessories to pull your hair back. As your pixie grows out, your hair will be different lengths. Instead of trying to pull it back into a ponytail, use bobby pins, headbands, or hair scarves to work with whatever length you have. Braid the longest hair, for instance, or pull it into a little bun on the top of your head. [11] X Research source If your hair is wavy, a few strategic bobby pins can pull the sides of your hair up to make a half-updo or use them to tuck longer hair back. For finer hair, a headband or headscarf can keep loose hairs from falling onto your face. A headscarf works like a headband, but it gives your look a fun retro vibe."

      "title": "Change your part to redistribute your hair's bulk.",
      "content": "Change your part to redistribute your hair's bulk. As you grow out your hair, you'll probably find that the top hair gets long and shaggy before the hair near your neck catches up. This can make your hair look poofy on the sides. To prevent this, brush your hair forward and to one side of your face instead of parting your hair and brushing it down on the sides. [12] X Research source Do you have fine, thin hair? Brush the hair on top of your head forward and then part it down the center. Then, brush the sides down to balance the weight of your hairstyle."

      "content": "Curl your hair if you've got uneven lengths. If you're trying to grow out your pixie, it can seem like it's taking forever! To create the illusion of volume or texture, curl the hair on top of your head. This is really helpful if you have fine hair and you can see the different lengths. You can use any size barrel or curling iron to make adorable curls. [13] X Research source Don't have a curling iron? Use your flat iron to make waves or curls in your hair. Straighten a section of your hair and rotate the flat iron so the hair twists around the iron. Then, hold the hair in place for a few seconds before you remove the flat iron."

Create a sophisticated style by spritzing your hair with water. Then, rub a little hair gel or pomade between your palms and work it through your hair. Comb your hair into a deep side part and brush the sides back and down to finish your sleek hairstyle. [14] X Research source To keep your slicked-back look in place, spritz firm-hold hairspray over your hair."
