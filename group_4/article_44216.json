      "content": "Start training early. Train your cat immediately, whether you've brought home a new cat or just noticed your cat jumping on the furniture. Don't assume that the cat will simply stop jumping or will grow bored with it. Instead, show your displeasure and let your cat know that she's not allowed to jump on the furniture. Avoid punishing your cat since she will not understand why you're yelling, hitting, or spraying with water."

Pick her up and remove her from the furniture while saying \"no.\" Set her down in a spot she's allowed to be (like her cat bed, a cat tower, or some other comfy place that she enjoys). Don't punish your cat once you've removed her from the furniture. Let her go find somewhere else to explore."
