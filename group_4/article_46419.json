      "content": "Wash your hair and pat it dry so it’s not dripping wet. Velcro rollers work the best on clean hair, so take a shower before you start. Use a towel to pat your hair dry, then spritz a heat protectant throughout your hair. Use a wide tooth comb to get rid of any tangles before you use your velcro rollers. [1] X Research source While you can use velcro rollers on dry hair, you’ll get more volume and wave if you use them on damp hair. Want to fight frizz? Run a hair serum through the ends of your hair to cut down on flyaways for a silky smooth finish."

      "content": "Choose 1.5 in (3.8 cm) wide rollers for a perfect blowout. While it might seem like a good idea to use tons of little rollers, the big rollers are actually the way to go. When you’re looking for rollers to buy, stick to the larger, wider ones. These will create tons of volume and give you the sleek, shiny waves you want. [2] X Research source Large rollers are also better if you have long hair."

      "content": "Use a brush to separate the top strip of hair, where a mohawk would be. Look in the mirror and separate a 4 to 6 in (10 to 15 cm) wide section on top of your head. Clip that hair up, then pull the rest of your hair back into a ponytail to keep it out of the way. This section on the top of your head is called the “mohawk” section, and it’s used a lot when putting in rollers to create waves. [3] X Research source Sectioning your hair into manageable chunks will make it much easier to use the rollers. To make sure your section is completely straight, use the pointed end of a rat tail comb ."

      "title": "Blow dry a small section to get it ready for a roller.",
      "content": "Blow dry a small section to get it ready for a roller. You know that mohawk section you just created? Now, separate an even smaller, 1 in (2.5 cm) thick piece near the back. Then, use a hair dryer and a round brush to completely dry the section, moving from front to back. [4] X Research source While it is totally possible to add velcro rollers without blow drying first (and you will see some people doing this), you get way more volume and bounce if you blow dry quickly before putting them in. If you plan on using velcro rollers a lot, consider investing in a hair dryer brush . These 2-in-1 tools combine the power of a round brush and a blow dryer, so you only have to hold one thing at a time."

      "title": "Slowly wrap your hair over the roller until it hits your scalp.",
      "content": "Slowly wrap your hair over the roller until it hits your scalp. Once your hair is completely dry, set down your blow dryer and grab your first roller. Push it up against the ends of your hair, allowing your hair to get caught in the velcro. Slowly roll your hair over the roller until it stops at your roots. [5] X Research source If you hit any tangles or loose pieces of hair, unroll the roller and try again. The smoother and sleeker the roller looks now, the better your waves will turn out later. Unlike other rollers, you don’t need to secure velcro rollers with clips. The sticking power of the velcro will hold the rollers and your hair in place, making them super lightweight and easy to use."

      "title": "Keep drying your hair and adding rollers until your mohawk section is complete.",
      "content": "Keep drying your hair and adding rollers until your mohawk section is complete. You can now move forward: section off another small section of hair, dry it with your hair dryer and a round brush, then add another roller. Most people will use 3 rollers in this section, but if you have super thick hair, you might need 4. [6] X Research source For this section, wind the rollers all in the same direction (backwards, or with the hair going over itself). This will help your bangs and face-framing pieces curl the right way."

      "content": "Comb through your hair and dry it to add more rollers. Let the rest of your hair loose, then pick a side to start with. Grab a 4 in (10 cm) wide section and, just like you did before, use your blow dryer and a round brush to dry it completely, moving from front to back. [7] X Research source It’s usually easier to start with the hair near your face, since you can see it well."

      "title": "Roll the roller on top of itself to create waves in opposite directions.",
      "content": "Roll the roller on top of itself to create waves in opposite directions. Instead of adding your rollers all the same way, mix it up to create more dimension in your hair. Start at the ends of your hair, then roll the roller up and on top of itself. [8] X Research source These side rollers tend to fall out a little easier than the top ones do, especially if you have shorter hair. If your roller feels loose, use a clip to hold it in place. Once you’ve done one roller, keep going around the rest of your head. Go from one side, around the back, then to the other side."

      "title": "Let your waves set, then gently unroll each roller.",
      "content": "Let your waves set, then gently unroll each roller. Even though your hair is dry, your rollers still need time to work. Watch a TV show or do some chores, then come back after 45 minutes. Start unrolling 1 roller at a time, gently pulling them away from your hair and unraveling them as you go. [9] X Research source Unroll from the bottom up to avoid laying your hair on top of rollers. The slower you go here, the better. Unrolling your rollers too fast can create frizz and tangles."
