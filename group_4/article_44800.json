      "title": "Be willing to spend a lot of time together.",
      "content": "Be willing to spend a lot of time together. Whether you are trying to befriend a Libra or date one, you should know that Libras don't like being alone (and aren't very good at it.) That means that once you get close to your Libra, you're probably going to be spending a good deal of time with them. Be prepared for that and don't get on their case about it. If you do find that you are feeling a little claustrophobic, be honest about it in a nice way. Just say something like, 'I just feel like being by myself for a bit--sometimes I like to take time to just reconnect with myself. It doesn't have anything to do with you--I love spending time with you!'"
    },
    {
      "title": "Don't make a habit of criticising your Libra.",
      "content": "Don't make a habit of criticising your Libra. Libras are pretty sensitive when it comes to criticism, particularly about their physical characteristics. Don't make a habit of teasing them about their looks--this is one group of people who don't really see the humor in that form of teasing. [1] X Research source If there is something you want to point out to them about their appearance that might embarrass them, do it subtly. Rather than saying 'Holy crap you have a huge chunk of lettuce in your teeth. Gross!' say something that will subtly draw their attention to it like 'Hun, you have a little bit of something in that pretty smile of yours.'"
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to avoid picking fights.",
      "content": "Try to avoid picking fights. Libras are not big on confrontation--in fact, they pretty much just run away from it. If something is bothering you, just bring it up to them in a non-aggressive way. If they don't feel like they are entering into a confrontation, they will be more than happy to talk it out with you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know that Libras can hold grudges with the best of them.",
      "content": "Know that Libras can hold grudges with the best of them. Despite the fact that they don't like confrontation, Libras don't really have any qualms about holding onto grudges, particularly if it really was a big deal (like the time you forgot your anniversary and your Libra got pissed.) To avoid inspiring grudges, try to stay on top of the important dates in your relationship (that means birthday, anniversary, days that are meaningful to your Libra--like the anniversary of a death of a loved one--etc.)"

    {
      "title": "Surround your Libra with beautiful things.",
      "content": "Surround your Libra with beautiful things. Libras have a soft spot for beauty (which means you must be doing alright if a Libra loves to hang out with you.) Take your Libra on a beauty-filled adventure to the Redwoods, the beach, to an art museum, etc. Bring your Libra flowers, or prepare a lovely meal for them. [2] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. You should also be aware that because Libras love beauty, they also love looking their best. Don't get frustrated if your Libra takes a longer time getting ready (or is maybe even a little prideful about their looks.)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give your Libra the benefit of the doubt.",
      "content": "Give your Libra the benefit of the doubt. Libras have a great love of justice, which means that they will almost never resort to dubious means in order to get something they want. Keep this fact in mind if your Libra ever seems to be acting sketchy--it is likely that it is just in your head as your Libra will go to great lengths to uphold justice."

      "title": "Do romantic things for your Libra.",
      "content": "Do romantic things for your Libra. If you are dating a Libra, you should know that Libras eat, breath and drink romance. If you want to treat your Libra right, whip out the romantic gestures. Plan romantic outings for you and your Libra love, bring them flowers, chocolates, whatever they like. If nothing else, just let them you know you really like (or love!) them--cuddle, kiss, and most importantly, be nice to them (but of course that applies to anyone you have feelings for.)

      "title": "Take the lead when it comes to picking activities.",
      "content": "Take the lead when it comes to picking activities. Libras have a tendency to be indecisive. Treat them right by simply deciding what you're going to do. If you guys are going out somewhere, choose the restaurant, or the movie, or the club...etc. Of course, you should always check to make sure that the activity is something your Libra actually wants to do, but if your Libra is struggling to decide between two things, save them the trouble and just make the executive decision."

      "title": "Be willing to share with your Libra.",
      "content": "Be willing to share with your Libra. And by sharing, we mean anything--food, a seat, personal stories. But specifically for this step, know that Libras love to share. This means that if you order separate dishes, be prepared to give away a few (or many) bites--but don't worry, your Libra will be happy to share their last bite of delectable chocolate mousse.

      "title": "Understand that Libras are social butterflies.",
      "content": "Understand that Libras are social butterflies. Libras are one of the most social (if not the most social) of the Zodiac symbols. As such, they like to flit from person to person at social gatherings. Understand that your Libra is not intentionally avoiding you--they just can't help but talk to everyone at a party. It's also good to remember that Libras strive to please everyone--even strangers they meet at parties."
    },
    {
      "title": "Know that Libras will mostly likely not engage in debate.",
      "content": "Know that Libras will mostly likely not engage in debate. This applies particularly to social settings. There is a reason that Libras are represented by the scale--they like to keep the peace by hearing both sides of an argument or debate. That means they won't necessarily back you up in a debate, as they will also want to hear the other side. Don't take this personally--instead, learn from your Libra friend and try to be opened-minded. However, that doesn't mean they don't have your back. If you have a problem that you just can't seem to solve (making amends with a friend, what to do about your renegade younger brother, etc.) your Libra will be there to help you through it. Libras are fantastic at looking at a problem objectively and figuring out how to solve it in the least dramatic way."
