Tie your knot and slide it all the way to one corner -- this is the starting point of your warp. A \"warp\" is simply the first round of rope, pointing in one direction, that gives the weave its shape. You should have the majority of your rope at the other end of this knot. Just keep it attached to the large ball of yarn/rope it came from. Click here to learn how to tie a clove hitch below."

      "content": "Lay the 1\" spacer across the seat, perpendicular to your knot. This spacer will keep some slack in the weave as you start in the first direction. This will make it much, much easier to weave in the opposite side later. If you make this first weave too tight you will have to remove it and start over."

Take your rope and lay it over the spacer, over the opposite seat pole, then back underneath everything to your starting point. This is one loop. You don't want to pull this as tight as possible. It should be tight enough to hold its shape, but not so tight you can't lift it slightly with your fingers."

As you work, you'll likely need to switch to smaller and smaller shuttles in order to fit under the weave, and you may have to switch to using just the thinner, 1/2\" spacer or yardstick instead of both at once.
