      "content": "Go for stay-up stockings for a smoother, simpler fit. This style of stockings, also known as “hold-ups” in the UK, use elastic, nylon, silicone, and Lycra in the top band to grip your thighs and stay up on their own. This style is a great choice if you'll be wearing your stockings under a fitted dress or skirt. Look for a brand that features elastic and other gripping features, like silicone, to ensure a tight fit. Read the sizing guide for your stockings, too. It's important that you get the right fit, since stay-up stockings that are too big will slip down."

      "content": "Wear stockings with a garter belt for an extra sexy accessory. A garter belt is a lingerie accessory, often made of lace, that fits around your waist. It has straps that hang down and clip onto your stockings to help hold them up. A garter belt can be a subtle, sexy addition to your outfit, but could also be visible under tighter clothes. Wear it under a looser fitting dress or skirt to make sure it stays invisible. For a more elaborate, sexy look, try attaching your stockings to a corset or suspenders."

      "title": "Look for stockings with wide bands for a smooth look on your thighs.",
      "content": "Look for stockings with wide bands for a smooth look on your thighs. Stockings with bands 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) wide won't dig into your thighs and will create a smooth look. Look for a pair with thicker, darker fabric at the tops of the stockings, or lace detailing for a pretty touch."

      "title": "Choose a neutral color for a work-appropriate look.",
      "content": "Choose a neutral color for a work-appropriate look. Go for sheer styles, in colors like black or nude, for a great everyday look. Stockings in these colors will look exactly like tights or pantyhose, especially with the wide band at the top covered by your clothes. You could also try colors like brown or gray."

    {
      "title": "Try lace or fishnets for a sexy look.",
      "content": "Try lace or fishnets for a sexy look. Fishnet or lacy stockings are great for a night out or as a seductive lingerie accessory. Make sure you get a pair that fits you well, as a pair that's too small could cause the pattern to cut into your legs and be uncomfortable. If you want your lace or fishnet stockings to blend in more, go for black. For stockings that really stand out, try brighter colors like red or pink."

      "content": "Go for woven socks if you want a cozy, warm style. Look for colors like grey, black, cream, or dark red to pair with a cozy winter outfit. Try comfortable fabrics like wool and cotton, and don't worry if they bag a little around your legs. This look isn't meant to be as tight, so a looser fit is okay. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Trim your nails and shave your legs before putting on your stockings.",
      "content": "Trim your nails and shave your legs before putting on your stockings. Making sure your nails and legs are smooth will prevent the fabric from snagging on jagged edges or poking hairs. Moisturize your hands, legs, and feet to make the process even smoother. Remove any rings or bracelets so they don't snag in the fabric. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sit in a chair to put on your stockings.",
      "content": "Sit in a chair to put on your stockings. It's easiest to start from a comfortable seated position so you won't lose your balance when pulling up your stockings. It's best to use a chair, put you can also sit on the ground with your legs out in front of you. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll up one stocking with both hands. Starting from the top of the stocking, roll up the material on both sides until you get to the foot area. Hold open the round opening at the top so you have room to slide your foot in. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Put your foot in the toe area and unroll to your ankle.",
      "content": "Put your foot in the toe area and unroll to your ankle. Arch your foot and point your toes as you slide your foot in. Make sure the seam along the edge of the foot area lines up straight across your toes, and gently adjust it with your fingers if necessary. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Roll the stocking slowly up your leg.",
      "content": "Roll the stocking slowly up your leg. With both hands, slide the rest of the stocking up your shin and to your thigh. If your stockings have seams, try to keep them running straight along your leg. Go slowly and carefully to avoid causing runs in the material. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Attach your garter belt,",
      "content": "Attach your garter belt, if you're using one. Wrap the garter around the slimmest part of your waist and clip it in the back with the hooks. Slide the rubber nub of one strap underneath the top of your stocking and secure it with the metal clasp. [7] X Research source Choose a thin garter belt if you're planning on wearing it under clothes. For more coverage on your midsection, choose one with a wider band. If you're wearing your garter belt under your clothes for the day, put your panties on over the belt and stockings. This will make it easier to go to the bathroom throughout the day."

      "title": "Pair stockings with a long skirt or dress for work.",
      "content": "Pair stockings with a long skirt or dress for work. The trick to wearing your stockings in a professional environment is to make them look like normal pantyhose, simply by making sure the band at the top is covered. Choose a dress or skirt that hits your knee or just above it. Sit down in the skirt and walk around a bit to make sure the hem doesn't ride up and show the stocking band. To wear stockings with a garter to work, choose a looser or more structured dress or skirt. Choose neutral colors like black or nude with no pattern. Stockings are a great alternative to wear to work during hot weather. Unlike tights or pantyhose, they don't go all the way up to the waist, giving your skin more room to breathe."

      "content": "Wear them with a mid-length skirt for an alluring date night look. Exposing a bit of the band of your stockings can be subtly sexy with the right skirt length. Wear sheer black stockings with a dark pencil skirt or dress that comes down to just below your mid thigh. Once you cross your legs at the dinner table, the hem will ride up just enough to show a hint of stocking band. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear stockings with a garter belt or corset for an intimate style. If you're looking for an enticing style to enjoy with your partner, try a garter belt and bra set, or even a full corset. Corsets come with the same kind of straps as garter belts, so they attach easily to your stockings for a timeless, sexy look. Try stockings made of fishnet or lace. Look for a pair with pretty detailing on the band, or sexy, defined seams. You can get a garter belt or corset in the same color as your stockings, or mix and match. Black stockings will go with just about anything."

      "title": "Clean your stockings after every other wear.",
      "content": "Clean your stockings after every other wear. Washing your stockings too often can cause runs, and they probably don't need to be cleaned that much anyways. Unless you see your stockings getting visibly dirty after one wear, wait until you wear them again to throw them in the laundry."

      "title": "Wash your stockings in a mesh bag to prevent runs.",
      "content": "Wash your stockings in a mesh bag to prevent runs. Using a lingerie bag will protect your stockings from catching on the sides of the washing machine or on other clothes. Look for a bag with super-fine weave mesh, as stockings can slip out of looser bags in the wash. [9] X Research source Avoid placing bras in the same bag as your stockings, as the stockings can catch on the hooks. You can also wash your stockings by hand with warm water and a bit of soap. Let them soak for 10-15 minutes, then rub the fabric against itself to work out any grime."

      "content": "Wear no-show socks under your stockings to prevent holes. If you're wearing your stockings out and about, this cheap, simple strategy will keep your toes from poking through the foot. You can also buy stockings with reinforced toes, but slipping on a pair of socks is the cheaper solution. As a bonus, it will also keep your feet warmer in the winter! [10] X Research source Use thinner socks so they don't make your shoes feel too tight."

      "title": "Roll or hang your stockings to store them.",
      "content": "Roll or hang your stockings to store them. If you have some drawer space, hold both of your stockings from the top and roll down to the toes to create a tight ball. Place them in a drawer, tucked snugly against other stockings, socks, tights, or shirts to keep them nicely rolled. If you're short on drawer space, hang your tights in your closet on a scarf hanger, or on the flat, lower bar of a regular clothes hanger."
