      "content": "Consider the timing and persistence of your nausea. If you’re experiencing anxiety nausea, you’ll probably be able to identify something that you’re feeling stressed or anxious about. If the nausea suddenly came on when you were about to do something stressful or had an anxiety-inducing thought, then it’s more likely that the nausea is related to your heightened emotional state. [3] X Research source However, some people experience anxiety nausea but can’t pinpoint why they’re feeling anxious—the anxiety may be happening in their subconscious or in a way that they can’t immediately identify, which is where speaking to a therapist may be helpful. You should also consider the persistence of your nausea—does it go away within a few hours or days, or does it persist until you address emotional triggers? Gastrointestinal distress caused by illness or a physical ailment will usually resolve itself within a few days at most (unless there’s a more serious underlying issue). [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Anxiety nausea, on the other hand, may require the calming of your mind and nervous system—once you do that, your symptoms should subside. If you’re nervous about a big presentation, for instance, your nausea should go away once you finish the presentation."

      "content": "Rule out any other potential causes of nausea, like GI issues. Consider whether there are any other potential causes of your nausea aside from anxiety. For instance, could you be experiencing a gastrointestinal condition like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) , irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or stomach ulcers ? These are common, everyday causes of nausea, so if you can’t identify any anxiety symptoms or reasons for you to have anxiety, these conditions may be to blame. [5] X Research source You should also consider other causes of nausea like viral or bacterial infections (e.g., the flu, food poisoning, etc.), migraines (severe headaches often accompanied by queasiness), and pregnancy (often inducing morning sickness, which involves nausea and vomiting). If you think your nausea may be due to one of these issues and it doesn’t resolve itself within a few days, consult with a doctor or healthcare provider about your symptoms. Have you started taking any new medications? If so, the nausea could be a side effect. Talk to your doctor about potentially switching medications."

      "title": "Yes, anxiety can cause very real nausea in the body.",
      "content": "Yes, anxiety can cause very real nausea in the body. The body interprets anxiety as a genuine danger, which releases hormones like adrenaline and cortisol that trigger a fight-or-flight response. In turn, this response sparks a series of physiological changes like heightened heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rates. These changes may also impact digestive function, which often manifests as an upset stomach or nausea. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The impact on your digestive function may also cause heartburn, acid reflux, gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or painful bowel spasms. These symptoms are more likely to arise or feel more severe if you have a preexisting digestive condition like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In extreme cases of long-term anxiety, chronic digestive symptoms may arise. These symptoms include a long-term change in appetite or sudden weight loss, both of which should be discussed with a qualified medical professional."

It’s not enough to just manage the symptoms of your anxiety—you will get the most relief by addressing the root causes of your anxious thoughts and feelings. Resolving anxiety is a much more complex process, but here are some potential techniques and strategies to help you deal with anxiety : [8] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Practice mindfulness : Engage in mindfulness meditation to cope with anxious thoughts. Mindfulness and meditation both work well, explains board-certified gastroenterologist Dr. Peter Gardner, and they can help you to stay in the present rather than obsessing about the future or past. If meditation isn’t your thing, try another mindfulness practice like journaling. Try a sensory exercise: Certified anxiety and stress management coach Alexandra Janelli advises to “close your eyes to take away the visual stimulation of whatever’s around you…Focus on getting back into your body and try to have the sensation of what it’s like to sit in the chair, then make your body melt into the chair…[Then] focus on the breath and…focus on each exhale that’s bringing the body down more.” Make small lifestyle changes: Incorporate simple changes into your daily routine like exercising, feeding your body with nutritious foods, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, and getting enough sleep . Lean on your support system: Join a support group for anxiety or reach out to trusted family and friends to talk through your experiences and fears. Talk to a mental health professional : Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other types of therapy (e.g., somatic therapy, art therapy, etc.) can do wonders in treating anxiety and anxiety-related symptoms. As licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Chloe Carmichael explains, “a good therapist is going to teach you skills that you’ll be able to use throughout your life…If you’re wondering if you might benefit from talking to someone…try to find a therapist that offers a free 15-minute phone call so you can give them a little thumbnail of what you're going through and get some basic feedback about it.”"
