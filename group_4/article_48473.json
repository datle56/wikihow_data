It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” (Peter 3:21) “The righteous lead blameless lives; blessed are their children after them.” (Proverbs 20:7) “On this joyous day, may God bless you and your baby.

      "title": "You can address the card to the child, parents, or the whole family.",
      "content": "You can address the card to the child, parents, or the whole family. It’s perfectly fine to write the card to the child or to only address the parents. There’s no correct way to address a christening card, so it ultimately comes down to your preference! For instance: Address the child if you’re a close relative, friend, or godparent and expect to be in the child’s life. The card can be a sweet keepsake for the child to look back on. Address the parents if you’re not very close with them, like a neighbor or colleague, or you don’t expect to form a close relationship with the child. You might choose this option if you don’t feel comfortable addressing the child, either. Addressing the whole family is a safe option if you’re not sure who it’s best to address. You can tailor your message to the whole family or write directly to the parents or child. If you already bought a christening card, check the front and any messaging inside to determine how to address it: If the card says something like “On your christening day,” you probably want to address the child. If it says “On your child’s christening day,” you likely want to address the parents. If you choose to address the whole family, etiquette coach Tami Claytor advises writing “[Last Name] Family” on the envelope so the parents know “the message is for everyone.”"

      "content": "Should you put money in a christening card? Money is a great addition to your christening card, though it isn’t required. Sending a thoughtful card is usually perfectly acceptable. However, many people consider it customary to give some amount of money (or a small gift) if you’re financially able and close with the family (like a godparent or grandparent). Lots of families set aside the money they receive to help support their child in the future or pay for other religious ceremonies (like their first communion or confirmation), which makes it a great gift."

If you don’t want to put money in your card but still want to give the little one a gift, consider one of these sweet ideas: A book Stuffed animal Baby blanket (with name embroidered) Keepsake box Religious jewelry, like a rosary or cross bracelet Bible Tip : You can always ask the family if there’s anything they want or need for their baby. If they had a registry for a baby shower, you can even check that out to see if there are any items they never got but still want."

      "content": "Are christenings and baptisms the same thing? No, christenings and baptisms aren’t the same thing —though they’re often used interchangeably. Christenings are religious ceremonies where a baby is given their Christian name. [4] X Research source A baptism is a religious sacrament where someone, often a baby, is initiated into the church by being splashed with or immersed in water. [5] X Research source Many christenings also include a baptism, which is why they’re often referred to interchangeably. Christenings are sometimes seen as the celebration that surrounds a baptism."
