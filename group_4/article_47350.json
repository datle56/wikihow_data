      "content": "Pretreat any stains with a mild detergent or stain remover. It’s best to apply detergent or stain remover directly to your jacket, rather than into the drum. Pour a mild, bleach-free detergent or stain remover onto any visible stains. Gently rub it into the stain and let it sit for a few minutes. [2] X Research source Bleach can potentially break down the jacket’s fibers, so it’s best to opt for a bleach-free stain-fighting detergent or remover. Avoid fabric softeners, as they can weaken the jacket’s materials. According to Weston, “stains are much easier to remove when they’re fresh,” so try to treat the stains as quickly as possible."

      "content": "Set your washer to a cold, gentle cycle. Set your water temperature to cold to minimize shrinking and fading. Use the gentle cycle to protect the jacket’s materials and preserve the quality. Avoid overloading the washing machine, too, as the jacket needs enough space to be properly cleaned. When it comes to temperature, you’re usually fine as long as the water temperature is warm and below 158℉ (70℃), but different types of jackets require different temperatures. [4] X Research source Cotton Duck Jacket: It’s best to use cold water, but warm water is fine too. Super Dux Jacket: Wash it in cold water. Detroit Jacket: Wash it in cold water. Flame-Resistant Jackets: Wash warm and make sure temperatures don’t exceed 158℉ (70℃). Place a candy thermometer into your washing machine’s water to test the temperature before putting your jacket in."

      "content": "Shape the damp jacket after washing. Once your jacket has made it out of the wash, place it on a flat surface and smooth out any bunches or wrinkles with your hand. By shaping your jacket with your hands instead of an iron, you help it retain its original structure without risking damage to any of the materials. Carhartt jackets are made out of durable materials that don’t typically require ironing. If you do need to iron the jacket to remove any wrinkles, use a low-heat setting."

If you’re using something like a shower or curtain rod, drape the jacket over and make sure the arms and torso are flat. If you’re using a traditional clothesline, hang the jacket using strong clothespins or a hanger. If you are unable to hang the jacket, lay it on a flat surface and flip it occasionally to make sure both sides are dry. [6] X Research source Once the inside of the jacket is dry, flip it back to make sure the outside dries, too."

      "content": "Blot the area in cold water and a baking soda, dish soap, and water paste using clean cloths. Weston says to “soak a clean cloth in cold water and gently blot the area. Then, make a paste by thoroughly mixing ½ cup of baking soda with ¼ cup of liquid dish soap and 4 cups of water. Using a clean cloth, dip it into the foamy solution and soak the affected area. Take another clean, dry cloth and blot the area to lift the stain.” Alternate between saturating the area with the baking soda solution and blotting with the clean cloth until the stain is gone. When it comes to getting rid of old, tough stains, Weston says “try to remove as much of the dry, excess material with a soft-bristled toothbrush” as possible before treating the stain."

Once the stain lifts, wash and dry the jacket . [7] X Research source Make sure you use a non-acetone nail polish remover to avoid staining your jacket.
