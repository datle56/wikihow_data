      "content": "The \"System interrupts\" process you see in Task Manager helps your hardware and software communicate with each other. If your computer is acting normally, you won't see \"system interrupts\" take up too much CPU power, even though it's monitoring for interrupts in the background. Or, you may see it use 100% of your CPU for a few seconds before returning to a lower value. If \"system interrupts\" is using 100% of your CPU for more than a few seconds and it's slowing down your PC, there's either a hardware problem, or a problem with a driver."

      "content": "Disconnect all external devices. If you have any USB devices connected to your PC, such as flash drives, external hard drives, SSDs, or USB hubs, disconnect them to rule out problems with those devices and their drivers. In many cases, the problem is related to external hardware, and disconnecting the problematic device will stop the issue. If your PC \"system interrupts\" stops hogging your CPU when you disconnect a device, there's a problem with that device or its driver. Try connecting the problem device to a different PC to see if the issue occurs. If it does, the hardware is faulty. If the device works fine on another PC, the issue is likely driver-related. Uninstall the device's driver, then reconnect the device to reinstall a fresh version."

      "content": "Check Windows Update. Sometimes Windows' performance slows to a crawl when an update is ready, installing in the background, or is waiting for you to reboot. Updating Windows also updates any outdated driversâ€”if the \"system interrupts\" process is popping up because of a driver, an update could fix the issue. To check for updates: Go to Settings > Updates & Security (Windows 10) or Settings > Windows Update (Windows 11). If updates are available, download and install them. If you see a message that says updates have been downloaded and you need to restart your PC, go ahead and restart it."

If you notice system interrupts consuming 100% of your CPU after installing a new graphics card, sound card, or other type of hardware, you may need to replace the drivers that were installed by default with the ones provided by the manufacturer. Go to the manufacturer's website, select your product, then download and install the software provided."

      "content": "End other processes using too many resources. If another application or service is slowing down your PC, the system interrupts process might appear for a long time in Task Manager to indicate it is currently working in the background to \"interrupt\" the bad communication between hardware and software. To see which processes are using the most resources, open Task Manager and click the CPU tab to display processes in order of utilization. Then try doing the same with the Memory (RAM) tab and Disk tab. If there's a process hogging resources, select it and click End Task . If the system interrupts process stops using 100% of your CPU, the process you ended could indicate where the problem lies."

The yellow yield sign icons indicate warnings that are not critical but still important. Compare the date and time of the critical errors and warnings to when you noticed system interrupts using 100% CPU to identify the problem."
