      "content": "Look for existing groups. Chances are that at least one national group, focused on your particular concern, already exists. You may be able to join an existing group, or if no groups exist in your area, then you may be able to form a \"satellite group\" if you share common values and interests. To find any existing national group, search for the terms or conditions you are seeking with the words \"support group\". You can also narrow your search to your local city or county. Obtain any how-to guide, or group starter kit, that the national organization offers (many provide them free online). If there's no national group, see if your search results revealed any \"model group\" elsewhere in the world, which you can contact and duplicate in your area. Try social groups sites and social media pages to see if local groups exist."

      "content": "Seek out professional assistance before you start a support group. That way, once you organize your group, you will have the guidance you need to get started.

      "content": "Understand your motivation for starting a support group. While it's perfectly acceptable to need the support of others, you should not start a support group solely for your own needs. Use your experience and your understanding of what you need to offer that support mutually, ensuring that everyone in your group will have the support that they need for their problems.

      "content": "Determine the scope of your group. You want to help as many people as possible, but if a group gets too large it may be difficult to allow everyone adequate speaking time. At the same time, you don't want to be too narrow and restrictive with your group's parameters. Knowing the ideal scope of your group will help you when it comes time to open your group to others.

Support for people living with chronic health problems will probably require a permanent group, but a support group for students struggling in school, for example, will probably not need to meet during the summer, when school is out."

The three most common support group formats worth considering: Curriculum-based - in which readings are \"assigned\" and discussions center around a given reading's issues.

Chairs should be arranged in a circle and avoid a lecture set-up. [7] X Research source Look for a room capacity slightly higher than your anticipated crowd size.

This should be done with the help and input of your core group of co-founders, so that everyone feels that they are a part of the process and can provide insight on what they hope to get out of the meetings. The mission statement should provide a structural framework for the group's values, purpose, and goals, and what will be done to meet those goals. Your mission statement should be brief and to the point. Aim for 2-3 sentences at most. Focus on intended outcomes rather than methods when drafting your mission statement. With the help of your core group of co-founders, discuss and revise your mission statement. Do not make any promises of success or achievement in your mission statement. Promising results may deter members from returning if they do not achieve those results in a forecasted time period.
