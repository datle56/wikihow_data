Tinctures, capsules, and cayenne drinks are the most effective way to use cayenne when fighting high blood pressure; however, in addition to getting cayenne in drinks, capsules, and tinctures, you can have a few snacks or meals that incorporate cayenne. Take a measure of your blood pressure before starting your cayenne pepper regimen so that you can track it as time goes on. If you’re using cayenne capsules, you can take anywhere between 30 and 120 milligram capsules three times daily."

You can take it once daily or divide the amount between several meals or drinks. Measure your blood pressure again at this point to see what kind of progress you’re making.

If your blood pressure has not declined to a normal level at this point, continue taking cayenne pepper three times daily until it does. Add more (up to 1 teaspoon, three times a day) if you wish to accelerate the process. Continue to monitor your blood pressure. If it starts ticking back up, add more cayenne to your diet."
