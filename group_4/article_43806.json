It should be around 14 inches or 35 cm long. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Using high-cotton sewing thread will ensure your eyebrow hairs do not snap off between the thread. High-cotton thread tends to grip hair better than synthetic thread. Thread is the best thing to use for threading. Do not use floss or string as this will not be as effective as thread."

      "content": "Position yourself in front of a mirror. To prepare your eyebrows for threading, sit in front of a mirror with your supplies spread out before you on a table. Make sure the room has good lighting so you can clearly see your eyebrows in the mirror. This will make it easier to prepare and thread your brows. Do not use a magnifying mirror, as this can lead to over threading. A standard mirror with good lighting will be fine. Make sure you know your face shape before shaping your eyebrows.

      "content": "Brush and trim your eyebrows. Take the eyebrow brush and sweep your eyebrow hair straight upward. Then, hold one section in place with the comb. Use the small eyebrow scissors to trim a very small amount of the tall hairs that stick out from the comb. Then, sweep your eyebrow hair downward with the comb and hold it in place again. Snip any long, standout hairs with the scissors. [7] X Research source Make sure you do not cut the hairs too short or trim too many of the hairs. You simply want to remove any overly long strands of hair so it is easier for you to thread your brows. Repeat these motions on the other eyebrow so both eyebrows have been trimmed. Comb the hair back in place when you are done trimming them. They should appear more groomed and clean."

      "content": "Use the eyebrow pencil to draw out the shape you want. Once you have trimmed your eyebrows, take the eyebrow pencil and carefully draw out the eyebrow shape you’d like to have. If your goal is to have full, clean looking brows, you may draw out a thicker arch and a higher brow line so you can follow the outline when you thread. Start from the inside of your brow and draw outward in a sweeping motion. Try to make the outline for each brow as even and symmetrical as possible. Customize the outline based on your existing eyebrow shape. If you have thin arches to your eyebrows, for example, you may not draw a thinner arch outline. If you have a lot of extra hair growth around your eyebrow arches, you may draw a thinner arch outline so you can remove these extra hairs when you thread them."

Open one hand with your thumb and forefinger positioned in the loop. Then, close the other hand. The loop’s center twist should move back and forth as you increase and decrease the distance between your thumbs and forefinger. This twisting motion will be what you will use to remove your eyebrow hairs. You may need to practice this motion several times to get the hang of it. If you find the loop is too hard to control, you may try making a new loop that is shorter in length. You may find a shorter thread loop is easier to manipulate between your fingers. You can also use your other fingers to help gain control of the loop. You can use the middle finger and ring finger of your dominant hand in addition to your thumb and forefinger to help you get the hang of manipulating the twisted center of the loop."

The corners of the twisted center will grab your hairs and remove them as you open and close your hands. [9] X Research source Always thread your eyebrow hairs in the opposite direction of their growth. This will ensure the hair comes out easily and reduces your risk of developing ingrown hairs. Do not tug too hard on your skin or press the twisted center too deep into your skin as this can lead to irritation and pain. Instead, glide the twisted center across your skin to remove the hairs."

Once you finish one stroke and remove a section of hair, place the twisted center back to the starting position and do another stroke, removing another section of hair. Make sure you also remove any hair between your eyebrows with the thread, making sure you move the thread in the opposite direction of the hair’s growth. You can remove a small amount of hair or a larger amount of hair depending on how quickly you glide the twisted center over the hair. You may start with a slow glide until you get the hang of the movements and can move more quickly."
