While it learns and updates frequently, the system isn't perfect. It's possible to receive false information or answers that seem right but don't make sense. Be sure to fact-check if you're using the answers as a reference. If you want to use ChatGPT to write an essay for school, be aware that there are many ways to detect AI influence in written works. If you simply copy and paste from ChatGPT, it's very likely you'll be caught. Always follow ChatGPT's usage policies ; if you don't, your account may be suspended or terminated."
