      "content": "Focus on treating the injury first if it’s serious. People can self harm in different ways, like cutting, burning, or swallowing pills and other unhealthy substances. If the person is bleeding, apply direct pressure to the wound until the bleeding stops. If the person is dealing with a burn, encourage them to rinse off the affected skin with cold water for 10 minutes. If you think the person is in immediate danger, don’t hesitate to call emergency medical services. [3] X Research source The best thing you can do in an emergency is call for help. Severe bleeding, burns, and any kind of overdose are best handled by medical professionals."

      "content": "Watch for potential warning signs of self-harm. Unfortunately, self-harm manifests uniquely in different people. Be on the lookout for frequent cuts, wounds or scars, and/or weak explanations for these injuries. Additionally, see if the person is wearing longer sleeves or pants in uncomfortable weather. Individuals who self-harm may be a bit moodier or irritable, as well.

Someone who self-harms may claim that they “tripped” or “bumped into something” to excuse their injuries."

      "content": "Offer safer replacements for self-harm. Self-harm can be a difficult habit to break, and it may be difficult to know how or where to start. If the person wants to recover, you can suggest some harmless activities they can try instead of cutting, like placing an ice cube on their skin, snapping a rubber band, or drawing red marks instead of physically cutting. While these solutions aren’t perfect, they may be a good stepping stone.

      "content": "Teach them different coping mechanisms. Ultimately, self-harm is a coping mechanism for a really tough problem—for some people, it’s a way to deal with intense feelings, while others use self-harm to calm themselves down. With this in mind, suggest different, healthy alternatives that can help them release and channel their emotions that won’t hurt them in the process. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If someone is experiencing really painful emotions, encourage them to draw or paint with red colors. They can also channel their feelings into poetry, or write their thoughts down and rip up the paper afterwards. If a person uses self-harm to calm down, invite them to snuggle with a pet, bundle up in a blanket, listen to relaxing music, or take a hot bath. If someone is self-harming to help feel more connected, encourage them to take a cool shower, chew something pungent (e.g., a chili pepper, citrus peel), or log onto a self-help chat room. If they’re self-injuring to vent their feelings, remind them to do some intense exercise, grip a stress ball, rip up some paper, or bang some pots and pans around.

      "content": "Maintain a compassionate attitude when you speak with the person. There’s no easy way to bring up self-harm, especially if you’re mentioning it for the first time. Don’t worry about following an exact script—instead, stress that you care about the person and that you‘re there to support them. Acknowledge that this is a really tough thing to talk about, and that you’ll support them whenever and wherever they need you.

It's really important to let the person know that you're there for them. [9] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 7 February 2020. Give yourself plenty of time to talk with your friend, family member, or acquaintance. This is a heavy topic, and not something you can talk about in between classes or in a passing conversation. You can say something like: “Hey. I’ve been noticing some cuts and bruises on your arms a lot, and I just wanted to check in and make sure that you’re okay. If there’s anything wrong, please know that you can talk to me.” It’s okay if you don’t know the right thing to say! What matters most is that you’re offering compassion and support to someone who’s struggling."

At the end of the day, remember that it’s up to your friend, relative, or acquaintance to decide if they want help or support. If the person isn’t very receptive, don’t take it personally—self-harm is a tough topic to talk about, and the person may need more time to sort out their own feelings.

Make it clear that you’re still there for them, and encourage them to talk with a professional so they can really get the help they need.

Being supportive and compassionate is important, but don’t say anything that somehow praises or justifies their habits. Focus on acknowledging their pain instead of uplifting and encouraging it. [18] X Research source For instance, don’t say something like: “I wish I was as strong as you.” Instead, say: “You must be going through so much pain right now.

Self-harm can be a scary thing to think or talk about—however, it’s also a very scary, emotional experience for the person participating in it. Expressing disappointment or making idle threats isn’t going to change anything. Instead, you’ll probably make the person feel more upset and isolated. Try your best to keep a compassionate, supportive attitude during your conversations. [19] X Research source Never say something like: “If you don’t stop self-harming, I won’t be your friend anymore” or “You’re just hurting yourself for attention.” Instead, say something like: “You mean a lot to me and I want you to be happy and healthy.

Feel free to share your worries with a trusted adult or person who is able to help. Even if they don’t intend to commit suicide, they could end their life unintentionally through a self-harm attempt. [20] X Research source For instance, you can bring your concerns to a guidance counselor at school, or a Human Resources representative at work. If you suspect that a sibling or other loved one is self-harming, confide in a parent, guardian, or other trusted relative for help."
