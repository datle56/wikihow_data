      "content": "Choose pears that are smooth, shiny, and firm. When you’re choosing pears for your steaming, make sure they are ripe and not rotten. The best way to choose good pears is to pick them up, feel them, and to look for any dark bruising. Good pears will be smooth and firm, but not too hard. Choose pears with bright, shiny skin. Some light bruising is normal, but dark bruising may mean the pear is mushy and will go bad quickly. [1] X Research source Some pears are sold unripe, and this is okay. Unripe pears feel very hard when you squeeze them. You can ripen your pears at home by storing them in a paper bag at room temperature with a ripe banana or apple. Depending on the type of pears you bought, this may take 4-10 days. Bartlett pears are similar to bananas; they change color from green to yellow when they are ripe and ready to eat. [2] X Research source The best types of pears to stem are bosc, Anjou, and French butter pears because they tend to keep their shape when cooked."

Add your pears and stir all of them together in the sink. Let them soak for 10 minutes to remove the wax and dirty film that covers the pears. Rinse the pears with water cool water after they’ve finished soaking. [3] X Research source Make sure your sink is clean before soaking the pears. All you need to do is wipe the sink down with liquid dish soap on a clean, damp cloth. Rinse the soap from the sink when you’re finished cleaning. Dry your pears off when you’re finished soaking them."

Use the peeler scrape the skin off from the top of the pear down to the bottom. Continue this motion of peeling from the top to the bottom of the pear, working your way around until all of the skin is gone.

Make sure to cut away from your body."

When they’re ready, they should pierce easily with a toothpick. [8] X Research source Leave them in the steamer for up to 15 minutes for puree or baby food."

Place your pears inside, making sure they have enough room and you’re able to fit the lid securely on top.
