      "content": "A “pump” is a temporary swelling of your muscles after a workout. When you lift weights or perform workouts that target your muscles, lactic acid builds up and draws blood into those muscles. At the same time, your veins, which carry blood away, contract, while arteries keep delivering blood. The blood then seeps into the surrounding tissue, causing it to swell, and making your muscles appear bigger and stronger. “Pumping” is when weightlifters or bodybuilders swell their muscles on purpose, to achieve the appearance of larger muscles, or to feel satisfied after a workout. It’s most common after high-intensity, high-rep workouts, where you’re pushing your muscles to their limit."

      "content": "Perform more reps and more sets of your target exercise. The typical routine for pumps is 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps of your target exercise. Pumps only really work with weightlifting or resistance training—strength training, not cardio. When you pump, focus on 1 target area, like your biceps or chest, and do the same workout 3-4 times, while pushing yourself to finish a high number of reps, up to 15. This strain often results in a nice pump. [1] X Research source For example, if you want to pump your biceps, do dumbbell curls . If you want to pump your chest, do bench presses ."

      "title": "Use a lighter weight or easier resistance.",
      "content": "Use a lighter weight or easier resistance. When pumping, you don’t want to go with the heaviest weight or highest resistance, or you’ll burn out before you get your pump. Instead, go with a lighter weight to make sure you can actually finish the reps and get a good amount of blood flow into your muscles. [2] X Research source Never overdo it! Stop if you feel lightheaded, exhausted, or in pain. The key to pumping is simply pushing yourself. If you push your limit, you’ll most likely get that pump. No need to go overboard and risk injury."

      "content": "Take short rests in between each set, and move slowly. The name of the game here is doing a sort-of strenuous workout over a longer period of time than your usual workout, to let the most blood flow into your muscles. To do this, only rest for 45-90 seconds between sets. And, when you’re doing your reps, take it low and slow. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Eat carbs and stay hydrated before the workout. Your diet and hydration are important in maximizing your pump. Eat about 50-60 grams of carbs the day before, and drink about 24–32 fl oz (710–950 mL) of water both the day before and the day of. This maximizes the fluid in your body, ensuring you’ve got plenty of liquids to pump into your muscles. [4] X Research source Carb-rich foods include bread (10-20 g of carbs per slice), pasta (45 g per serving), and rice (45 g per 220 g).

      "title": "Most pumps last about 2-3 hours.",
      "content": "Most pumps last about 2-3 hours. That’s the time it takes for the blood to be reabsorbed and exit your muscles, traveling back to your heart for circulation. After that, the swelling goes down and your muscles return to their normal state. That said, there are a few factors that can influence the duration slightly, like: How hydrated you are, and how much fluid is available to be pumped into the muscle. How long you exercise, and at what intensity. Your diet, which feeds into your energy levels, as well as the fluids available in your body."

      "title": "Pumping can build muscle, but isn't the most effective method.",
      "content": "Pumping can build muscle, but isn't the most effective method. There’s research that suggests that pumping increases the creation of muscle proteins, while also preventing their breakdown, but this research is also incomplete. Pumping certainly works muscles, but it may not be the most efficient way to build them. What we know for sure is that the risks of overexerting yourself by pumping constantly far outweigh the benefits. [6] X Research source Proper muscle building involves muscle hypertrophy, which is the growing of muscle cells, while pumping is more focused on hyperaemia, or the concentration of blood in a muscle. [7] X Research source These days, it’s more commonly accepted that training toward muscle failure, like pushing your weight or resistant limits, rather than training toward blood flow for a pump, more effectively tears and rebuilds muscles. Pumps are good exercise, just like any other! But just like any other exercise, do it in moderation and vary your workouts."

      "content": "Feel free to pump on occasion, but don’t make it your whole workout. Pumps do effectively target certain muscle groups, can increase your stamina and overall strength, and they just feel plain good. There’s no harm in going for the pump once a week or so, but don't make it your only workout or overdo it. You won’t gain muscle as efficiently as when you’re pushing your weight limits, and you risk overexerting yourself. [8] X Research source It’s totally fine to pump now and then to get that sick gains selfie, or just to encourage yourself to workout by really feeling your muscles and making yourself feel good. Pumping can also help you train your form through repeated reps, and isolate those muscles that you focus on. The key is not relying on it, or letting it fool you into thinking you're making big gains, when really you’re just temporarily swelling your muscles."

Instead, warm up with a 5-10 minute stretch routine , and then 5-10 minutes of cardio, such as running or biking. This warms up your muscles and gets them working before you really push them, which can contribute to gains while reducing the risk of injury.

      "content": "Cycle through your muscle groups, and intensity, each week. It’s not enough to just use pump training every day. You need a balanced workout plan to give your muscles days off, and you also need to introduce cardio to burn fat. [10] X Research source Dedicate 1-2 days a week to each muscle group, giving each a few days off. Also, take complete rest days, where you don’t work out or only do light exercise, to give your whole body a break. For example, you might do strength training on Monday and Thursday, with cardio on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. You might implement pump workouts on one day of your strength training, then do higher-volume weight lifting on the other. Avoid pure pump training, which doesn’t push the weight limits of your muscles."

      "content": "Pumps are great for making muscles look and feel bigger temporarily. That’s because when you pump, blood is flowing into those muscles faster than it can flow out of it. The effect is only temporary, though, and while pumps certainly work muscles and strengthen your body, like any workout, experts are split on if they’re actually a good way to build muscle. Instead, they recommend gradually increasing your weight and resistance limits. To pump, do one weight or resistance-oriented exercise for 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps at a time. Use a moderate weight, not your max weight, take it slow, and only rest for 45-90 seconds between sets."
