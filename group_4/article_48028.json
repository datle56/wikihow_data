      "content": "In the late 1990s, people feared computers would malfunction after 1999. Most computers in the 1900s formatted the year as 2 digits, like 1999 coded as 99. Computer programmers and world leaders were worried that on January 1, 2000, computers wouldn’t read 00 as 2000 and instead shift back to 1900, 0000, or 1000.

Ultimately, there were no major problems on January 1, 2000. Most companies around the world successfully fixed the date coding bug.
