      "content": "Submerge the leather in cold water for at least 10 minutes. Fill a large bucket or basin with cool-to-room temperature water, and gently submerge the leather. Make sure the entire piece is immersed and that no air bubbles are trapped underneath, as they can lead to uneven soaking. If you’re only soaking the leather in cold water, let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour. If you plan on soaking it in hot water, as well, let it sit for about 10 minutes. [1] X Research source Note that this process works best when used with vegetable tanned leather. It’s possible to stiffen leather in cool water alone, but it will only become a bit harder and you may not be able to shape it. The addition of a hot water step will allow you to make more structural changes while hardening the leather further. This process of soaking leather in water and molding it to your desired shape is called “wet molding.” In some cases, it’s also referred to as “wet forming.” This is one of the simplest stiffening methods, as it doesn’t require a lot of supplies."

      "content": "Heat a pot of water to 180° F (82° C) (optional). If you want to stiffen your leather further, fill a large stockpot with water as the leather soaks in the cool water. Heat the pot until the water reaches 180° F (82° C). If you only want to stiffen the leather will cool water, skip this step and the following. [2] X Research source Use an accurate thermometer to keep track of the temperature. If the water is too hot or too cold, your results can vary dramatically from those described here. If you do not have a thermometer, gauge the temperature of the water by slowly heating it on the stove and testing it every minute or so with your bare hand. If you can keep your hand immersed in the water, it is safe to use for your leather. If it’s too hot to the touch, remove the water from the heat source and do not allow it to get any hotter. Some people prefer to soak the leather in boiling water. Doing so stiffens the leather at a faster pace, but it also gives you less control. The resulting leather can become very brittle and may be unevenly stiff across its surface."

      "title": "Submerge the leather in the hot water for about a minute.",
      "content": "Submerge the leather in the hot water for about a minute. Take the leather out of the cool water and transfer it to the hot water. If the water is hot enough, the edges should curl and darken within the first few seconds. Let it sit for a minute or so, then remove it. [3] X Research source The longer you soak the leather, the stiffer it will become. If you soak it too long, however, it will be more brittle when dry. Generally, soaking the water for 30 seconds after it darkens will result in a piece of leather that is hard but not inflexible. The total soak time in the hot water should be about 90 seconds, or leave it in longer if you want it to be stiffer."

      "title": "Shape the leather as desired.",
      "content": "Shape the leather as desired. After removing the leather from the hot or cold water depending on your chosen method, lay it flat to check for any abnormalities. Pat it dry with a soft, clean cloth, then mold it into your desired shape. It should be fairly flexible after coming out of the water, so wet molding is a great way to shape your leather before it stiffens. [4] X Research source When wet, the leather will be stretchy and easy to form. This stretchiness will vanish within the first minute or two, though, so work fast if you plan to stretch it out. The leather will remain flexible for up to an hour, though. Some abnormalities, like air pockets, may have formed due to over-soaking or excessive heat. Consider letting the leather sit for a few seconds so the bubble disappears and the leather swells evenly. If you’re molding the leather around an object, wrap the object in plastic wrap to protect it, then nail or staple the leather to the object to prevent it from moving as you shape it."

This typically takes 6-8 hours depending on the moisture level and the size and thickness of the leather. Once it dries, the leather should be notably thicker and stiffer. [5] X Research source Stiffened leather will also shrink, so the piece may not end up as large as you started out with. If you stapled or nailed the leather to an object, remove them once the leather is completely dry."

Immerse the leather in the water and let it soak until it becomes completely water-logged. The amount of time the leather needs to soak will vary based on the thickness and quality of the leather. 10 to 30 minutes will usually suffice, and the leather should be notably flexible when you remove it.

      "content": "Preheat the oven to 120°F (50°C). As the leather soaks, preheat your oven. 120°F (50°C) is ideal because it’s warm enough to stiffen the leather without damaging or altering its natural properties. If your oven doesn’t reach a temperature this low, set it to the lowest temperature available (some recommend 150-200°F or 65-95°C). [7] X Research source Move the racks of the oven around as needed to clear enough room for the leather piece. Note that higher temperatures could cause a little steam scalding, which may alter the color and cause greater shrinkage."

After removing the leather from the water, mold it to whatever shape you want the final product to take (like a belt, wallet, etc.) while it’s still flexible and easy to handle. Run your fingers along the edges and creases as you shape the leather and keep molding until the leather holds its shape. [8] X Research source Since the leather is still fairly cool at this point, it may not keep its form when left alone. After shaping it, try holding the new form in place using string, stitching, or nails as needed."

      "content": "Bake the leather for 10-15 minutes, then check its progress. Place the leather on a baking tray and slide it in the oven. The heat will slowly start to stiffen it. After 10-15 minutes, put on your oven mitts and remove the tray to check the leather’s stiffness. If it isn’t as rigid as you’d like, place it back in the oven and continue baking. Continue to check every five minutes or so, so you don’t overbake it. [9] X Research source It typically takes 30-90 minutes for the leather to harden properly. The exact time varies depending on the size and quality of the weather, how long you soaked it, and the temperature of your oven. You can let the leather remain in the oven even after it dries out, but know that dry-baking it will cause the temperature of the leather to rise, resulting in a harder and more brittle structure. Be aware that the leather will shrink slightly, making the grain tighter."

      "content": "Let the leather cool. Remove the hot, dry leather from the oven and let it cool at room temperature until it is safe to handle with your bare hands. As it cools, it will continue to stiffen and retain the shape you molded earlier. Once cool, remove any string, thread, or nails holding the shape in place. [10] X Research source If you plan on working with the leather further, it is ready once it’s cool."

Bake the leather for about 30 minutes to prepare it for the wax application. The leather should be notably hot to the touch when you take it out. [11] X Research source Warning: This method involves boiling wax, which can splash and burn you or anyone nearby. Use caution if you choose to try this method. Make sure the oven racks are rearranged if needed so that the leather piece can fit inside without brushing against the racks or sides of the oven. This method should work with most types of leather, but vegetable tanned leather is the easiest to work with. This is also a good method if you’re trying to stiffen leather that has already been formed and does not need any additional shaping. Be careful not to let the leather get too hot, however, as it can become too brittle by the end of the process."

Place a block of beeswax inside the top part of the double boiler and stir it with a disposable spoon or chopstick until it melts completely. It’s best to do this as the leather bakes so that the leather and the wax will both be hot enough to proceed at the same time. [12] X Research source Beeswax is the preferred wax for this method, but melted candles or nearly any other type of wax will work, as well."

Dip a paintbrush into the melted wax and apply a thin layer to the leather using even strokes, making sure the entire surface is covered. Continue brushing the wax onto the leather until the leather cools and no longer absorbs the wax. [13] X Research source The leather should soak up the hot wax. If it does not do so, the leather is not yet hot enough and should be returned to the oven. Not only will the wax stiffen the leather, but it will also give it a nice, glossy sheen."

Remove it from the oven and brush the surface with an additional coating of melted wax. Repeat this process until the leather no longer absorbs wax, even when hot, then do one final bake for another 10 minutes. [14] X Research source One way to tell that the leather can no longer absorb wax is to look at the coloring. The wax will alter the color of the leather slightly. If the entire surface of the leather is an even color, it has likely absorbed as much wax as possible throughout the entire piece. Doing a final 10 minute bake will ensure the wax sets into the leather so it becomes stiff and durable and has a glossy finish."

Smooth out any wrinkles and make sure it’s perfectly flat. Then, start hammering the surface, preferably with a flat-faced hammer , going over the whole area multiple times. The leather will start to become stiffer with each blow. [17] X Research source The leather will likely take the shape of the hammer’s head as you work, but you can smooth it out with your fingers or a roller when you’re done. Be aware that hammering a stamped , carved, painted, dyed, or burnt piece of leather will likely alter the results. Continue hammering until you achieve the desired level of stiffness.
