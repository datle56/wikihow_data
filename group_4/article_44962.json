In a committed relationship, it’s equally important to know details of how your partner came to be the person they are today and what they envision for your (hopefully shared) future. According to love coach Kate Dreyfus, this “vulnerable intimacy” involves “sharing challenges you’ve faced in your life to feel exposed…(which allows you to let the light in). And, it’s just as important to ask them to also open up…to create a balance in your vulnerable exchange to support the success of your emotional connection.” What is your partner’s relationship like with their parents?

[4] X Research source By challenging you and your partner to answer questions about each other’s values, you’ll be able to know if you’re in agreement on these topics—and jumpstart any important discussions if you aren’t.

Don’t sweat it if someone gets a few answers wrong. Remember that the point of this game is to feel more in sync with each other and to get to know each other even better—so don’t treat it like a test of your relationship or like a competition against each other.
