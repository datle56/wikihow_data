      "content": "The slang term “stan” basically describes a superfan. A “stan” is an incredibly devoted supporter of an actor, musician, or franchise, often to an excessive or obsessive degree. On the flip side, it can also be used as a verb to say, basically: I am obsessed with this . [1] X Research source The term is a combination of the words “stalker” and “fan,” and it can be used as both a noun and a verb. Let's look at a few quick examples: \"I am such a Harry Styles stan. I've been a 1D girl since day 1.\" \"Omg I stan Jenna Ortega! She's so talented, especially in horror and thrillers.\" \"Are you a Hazbin Hotel stan like me? We could stay in and watch tonight if you're down.\""

He’s been to all her tours, listens to her music on repeat, and has a ton of merch.” “It must be really really tough for Taylor Swift to deal with some of her more obsessive stans. They really invade her privacy sometimes.” “My sister is a big Harry Potter stan. She actually decorated her house to look just like Hogwarts, and she’s always talking about the fandom.” “Marvel stans can be super intense. My friend wants to watch all the MCU movies in order.

A lot of them harass people if they say they don’t like her music.”"

      "content": "The term “stan” comes from Eminem’s song of the same name. The song came out in 2000, and it tells the fictional story of a superfan named Stan whose intense obsession eventually leads him to kill the rapper and his pregnant girlfriend. The story is played out in the music video for the track. [2] X Research source Earlier uses of the term had more of the creepy, stalker-ish connotation that Eminem established in the song, but some of this faded as time went on. [3] X Research source Now, major fans of icons like Lady Gaga (Little Monsters), Taylor Swift (Swifties), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), and Beyoncé (the BeyHive) even see the term as a badge of honor.

      "content": "In recent years, celebrities and fans have both criticized “stan culture.” Many believe that online fandoms can take things too far, to the point of invading celebrities’ privacy or even putting them in danger. [5] X Research source For example, in August of 2024, rising superstar Chappel Roan called out obsessive fans “creepy behavior,” including following her around, and even finding out where her parents live and where her sister works. Roan explained that she appreciates her fans’ support, but she set boundaries about this type of behavior. Some overzealous stans even resort to bullying, harassing, or doxxing people who don’t share their appreciation for a musician or actor. [6] X Research source There’s nothing wrong with being a big fan of a celebrity’s work, but it’s pretty clear that stan culture can have some negative effects when it’s taken too far."

[7] X Research source The term has almost the same meaning as “stan,” and it can also be used as a noun or a verb. Here are some examples: “When I was growing up, I was such a 1 Direction fangirl. I literally loved them so much.” “I met Sabrina Carpenter once, and I was fangirling so hard. I could barely remember my name.”"

      "title": "Superfan",
      "content": "Superfan “Superfan” is basically a synonym for “stan,” but with a bit less of the negative connotations of stalker-ish behavior. The term describes someone who is a very devoted or dedicated fan of someone or something. For example: “He’s a Lakers superfan. He never misses a game.” “Superfans lined up for hours to get into the band’s meet and greet.” “She’s a Beyoncé superfan, so I surprised her with concert tickets for her birthday.”"

      "title": "Fanatic",
      "content": "Fanatic Like the term “stan,” “fanatic” describes someone who is excessively enthusiastic or devoted to something. It can refer to fans of celebrities or franchises, but it can also be used to describe someone who is extremely interested in an activity or hobby. [8] X Research source “He’s a Lord of the Rings fanatic. He can rewatch the movies over and over again, and he won’t hear any criticism about them.” “After training for that 5k, she became a fitness fanatic. She goes on a super long run every morning now!”"

      "content": "Groupie A “groupie” is someone who follows a musician or band around in the hopes of meeting them. [9] X Research source For example, someone who buys tickets to several different tour stops to try to catch a musician’s attention could be considered a groupie. “I’m trying not to be a groupie, but I just love the concert so much. I might fly out to the next city she’s going to so I can see it again.”"
