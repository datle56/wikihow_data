      "content": "Share this story when he's sick or injured and needs a pick-me-up. There was a man who was deeply in love with a woman he worked with. She barely noticed him, and he didn’t have the courage to tell her how he felt. One day, he decided to be brave and let her know. As he crossed the road outside their office building to approach her, he was hit by a bus. The woman saw and immediately called an ambulance—he survived, but his legs were paralyzed. The next day, a coworker told the woman about the man’s feelings. She rushed to the hospital right away and told him, “I’ll never find a man that loves me like you do. I want to be with you and support you.” Raise the tension of the story by drawing out the man’s pining for the woman.
