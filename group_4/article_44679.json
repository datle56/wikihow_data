Drop your mouth open, while applying light pressure against the TMJ. Repeat this exercise six times per session, six sessions per day.

Orient the object such that the length of it is sticking out in front of you, rather than out of the sides of your mouth. Now, shift your bottom jaw forward to try to point the object towards the ceiling. When you master one object comfortably, gradually increase the thickness to give you greater range of motion. [8] X Research source Try to select an object that is made to go in the mouth, such as those indicated above. Other household objects may accidentally chip your teeth during the exercise, if you are not careful. Perform this exercise as needed when you feel you need more mobility in your jaw, such as before a meal."
