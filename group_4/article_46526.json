      "content": "Understand what drain cleaners do. Chemical drain cleaners or openers usually rely on a strong acid or alkali to do the job. These substances both break down and dissolve the clog, and react with the water to form heat. Drain cleaners work best on slow moving drains. They are less effective in clogs with standing water."

      "content": "Pick what kind of drain cleaner you want to try. Most drain cleaners are either a concentrated \"gel\" or granulated crystals. There are also special types of drain cleaner for special jobs. Some products use a two part formula to generate a kind of \"foaming\" action. These are good for removing buildup, but should not be used in a completely blocked drain. Enzyme formulas exist, which attack the protein and fat bonds of clogs. These are safer and can be used on toilets and tubs, but are slower and less effective. Heavy-duty formulas usually contain 100% pure lye or sulfuric acid. These are effective but can be highly dangerous to the untrained."
