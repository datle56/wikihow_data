      "content": "Why did Twitch block public access to chat logs? You used to be able to check public chat logs on websites like OverRustleLogs. However, Twitch sent out a cease and desist letter to these websites. Twitch most likely banned this activity because a lot of inappropriate content was logged in those chats and it was almost too easy for anyone to find offensive comments in conversations on Twitch, which wasn't the sort of branding that they wanted. Even though Twitch prohibits public access to logs, you can still check your own channel's chat logs."
