YW is the abbreviation equivalent for “you’re welcome.” Most times, you’ll see this word sent in reply to a “thanks,” “ty,” or “tysm” (thank you so much) message. [1] X Research source YW can be spelled in all capital or all lowercase letters—either way, it has the same meaning. YW isn’t exclusive to just one digital platform.

It’s really no big deal” Person 1: “Ty for feeding Mittens while I was gone! 🐈” Person 2: “YW, I’m happy to watch her anytime 😻”"
