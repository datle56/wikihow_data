      "content": "Start by writing a mission statement that summarizes your goals. Write out a short, clear description of what your organization will do, who you'll help, why your goals are important, and how you're going to reach them. This is your mission statement—use it to help guide you and keep you on track as you get deeper into the planning process. Then, review it regularly as you operate your nonprofit to make sure you're staying true to your original vision. You'll use your mission statement will to inform potential donors, state and federal officials, board members, and volunteers of the purpose for your charity. The nonprofit Feeding America has a great example of a short but thorough mission statement: \"Our mission is to advance change in America by ensuring equitable access to nutritious food for all in partnership with food banks, policymakers, supporters, and the communities we serve.\" [1] X Research source"

In your business plan, explain your strategy for your first 5 years of operation, including how you'll make money, how you'll spend it, and how you plan to operate.

      "content": "Work with legal and financial experts to navigate the paperwork. To register as a charity, you'll need to gain 501(c)(3) status, meaning you'll have tax-exempt status with the IRS. This is a pretty complicated process with a lot of red tape, so it's best to hire an attorney who specializes in nonprofit law, as well as an accountant who has experience incorporating 501(c)(3)s. [4] X Research source However, you can find the paperwork here if you'd like to check it out: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/application-process . In addition to registering with the IRS, you'll need to file paperwork to incorporate your charity with your state. [5] X Research source Once you've been incorporated as a 501(c)(3), you'll need to apply for your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN). To do this, fill out IRS form SS-4—your accountant will give you more information on how to do this. [6] X Research source Your lawyer and accountant will also be able to advise you on the ongoing paperwork you'll need to file to stay in compliance once your organization is running."

      "content": "You'll need to raise enough money to cover all the expenses for a year. This includes all of your startup and administrative costs, so you might have to do a good bit of fundraising before you even get up and running. However, it's good motivation to keep your operating costs low—and that's a good practice to follow, even if the organization becomes really successful later. [7] X Research source It can cost close to $1000 to file for your 501(c)(3), but you'll also need to pay your accountant and attorney—those fees might be anywhere from $2000-$4000 initially. [8] X Research source You'll also need to find and supply your office space, and you may need additional permits and licenses from your city or state. [9] X Research source Once your startup costs are out of the way, only about 20% of your charity's expenses should go toward administration and fundraising. The rest should be dedicated to your main cause."

      "content": "Go with a name that clearly explains your mission. It should be something simple and easy to remember. Also, pick something unique—you don't want donors to get you confused with anyone else who's doing similar work. [10] X Research source For instance, if you're forming an animal rescue, you might name it something like, \"Carrington Wildlife Rescue.\" Check with the Department of Commerce where you live to make sure you're not using a name that's already taken. [11] X Research source Keep in mind that you may not be legally allowed to include certain words in your name, like \"Bank,\" \"Federal,\" or \"Insurance.\" [12] X Research source"

Some donors might find your cause more personal and relatable if you name the organization after a notable person in the field you're working in. You could name it after yourself or your family, someone who was affected by the issue you're trying to overcome, or a generous donor. [13] X Research source For instance, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation was named for the founder's sister, who died of breast cancer at the age of 36. [14] X Research source"

To keep your organization running, you'll need to reach out to donors, have fundraising events, and spread awareness about your organization online. This can take a lot of energy, but it's really the heartbeat of your organization. When you're doing this, it can help if you keep your mind on your reason for starting the charity in the first place. [15] X Research source Popular charity fundraisers include marathons, galas, silent auctions, dinner parties, golf tournaments, art sales, and charity concerts. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cancer Research UK U.K.-based cancer research and advocacy charity Go to source To raise money online, use your website and social media pages, make YouTube videos about your mission, issue press releases, or start a GoFundMe campaign.

[19] X Research source Your board should be made up of people who are experienced in fundraising and running a charity. [20] X Research source The board will be responsible for establishing committees to handle decision-making, managing the charity's finances, and steering the direction of the nonprofit as a whole. [21] X Research source As the CEO of your nonprofit, you'll typically sit on the board—but to avoid a conflict of interest, it may be best if you have a non-voting role. The Board of Directors will oversee your position, including your salary and your job duties. [22] X Research source You might also choose to have an Advisory Board made up of knowledgeable volunteers. The Advisory Board doesn't make formal decisions for the nonprofit, but it can make recommendations to the Board of Directors about things like fundraising, hiring decisions, and outreach.

They'll help with things like administrative duties, organizing and running fundraisers and events, and spreading the word about your mission.

You don't necessarily have to volunteer your time, though; you can build a salary into your operating costs.

If you could change anything about the world, what would it be—and how would you do that? [28] X Research source If you're upset by the sight of your town's crumbling downtown area, you might start a charity to raise funds locally to restore some of those buildings. If you know of a loved one who's suffering from a rare disorder, you might feel led to start a charity to raise money to help people with that disorder pay for their medical bills. You might also create a charity that supports the arts, wildlife conservation, animal rescue, disaster relief, or people in need. [29] X Research source"

There are a lot of other nonprofits out there, and if you're doing the same type of work as someone else, you'll have more competition for donors who care about that cause. Try to find your own angle for whatever you do—if you want to help the homeless population in your area and there are already organizations dedicated to providing food and shelter to people without housing, you might start a charity to collect clothing, instead. [30] X Research source If you're passionate about helping something that overlaps with other charities, come up with unique fundraising ideas that will help you stand out. For instance, the ice bucket challenge was a viral campaign by the ALS Association that raised money for research into ALS. [31] X Research source"
