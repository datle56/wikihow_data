      "title": "Stiletto Heels",
      "content": "Stiletto Heels Stiletto heels are named after an Italian dagger with a slender, pointed blade. Since the stiletto style refers to the heel shape and not its height, they can range from 1 to 5 inches (2.5 to 12.7 cm), but they tend to be on the taller side. For a shoe to be a stiletto, the heel itself must be narrower at the bottom tip. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Block Heels",
      "content": "Block Heels A block heel is a heel that’s chunky and usually square. Block heels give you the glamorous height of the stiletto with the addition of stability and support. They reached peak popularity in the ‘70s, but continue to trend every few years. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Platform Heels",
      "content": "Platform Heels Platform heels have a block heel and a raised sole at the toe of the shoe. [3] X Research source Because they’re raised in the front and back, they offer extra height without forcing your foot to bend down uncomfortably. Similar to classic block heels, platform shoes were popular in the ‘70s. Today, they’ve become a signature of pop artists like Sabrina Carpenter. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cone Heels",
      "content": "Cone Heels A cone heel is just what the name suggests: a triangular heel shape that’s wide on top and narrow at the bottom, similar to a skinny ice cream cone. Cone heels are usually between 3 to 5 inches (7.6 to 12.7 cm), but their triangular shape makes them slightly more supportive and comfortable than a stiletto. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Wedge Heels",
      "content": "Wedge Heels Wedge heels feature one continuous wedge piece as the sole and heel. Salvatore Ferragamo pioneered the modern wedge shoe in the 1930s. [6] X Research source While you might wobble on towering wedges the first time you wear them, they’re surprisingly supportive because of their solid base. [7] X Research source Some wedges are similar to platforms, raised from heel to toe, while others feature a raised wedge heel and a flat toe. Wedges are the most comfortable heel available, says stylist Susan Kim. “Since they have a high platform, it doesn't give you that feeling of literally standing on 3 to 5 inches” like a stiletto, she explains."

      "title": "Spool Heels",
      "content": "Spool Heels The spool heel , also known as the Louis heel, the French heel, and the Pompadour heel, is one of the oldest heel shapes. Spool heels have an hourglass shape, curving inward at the middle and flaring at the top and bottom. [8] X Research source They’re named after King Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame Pompadour, both of whom wore the distinctive heel often in their lifetimes. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Sculptural Heels Sculptural heels don’t have one specific look. Rather, they feature heel shapes that are usually objects or elaborate sculptural designs. Examples of sculptural heel designs include hearts , spheres , and wavy lines. [10] X Research source They’re also known as decorative heels or novelty heels because of their ornamental baubles."

      "title": "Flared Heels",
      "content": "Flared Heels A flared heel is thin at the top and flared at the bottom—essentially, the opposite of a cone heel. It can be thick and chunky or slim like a stiletto. [11] X Research source The heel’s wide base gives you extra support, while its curved silhouette feels playful and fun compared to the more mature vibes of a straight heel."

      "title": "Kitten Heels",
      "content": "Kitten Heels Kitten heels are a specific type of low shoes, ranging from 1.5 to 2 inches (3.8 to 5.1 cm) in height. They typically have a stiletto heel shape. While they were created as training shoes for girls who weren’t ready for high heels, they’re now worn by people of every age. Their smart appearance is associated with the style of the 1950s, the decade they emerged. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Low Heels",
      "content": "Low Heels Low heels are around the same range as kitten heels, averaging 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) in height. Because they’re so short, they barely strain the foot, making them a popular choice for everyday wear. If you’re tall and want to wear heels without gaining too much height, a low heel is ideal. [14] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mid Heels",
      "content": "Mid Heels Mid heels , also called medium heels, are heels that fall between 2 inches (5.1 cm) and 3 inches (7.6 cm). They give you more height than a kitten or low heel, but don’t quite meet the threshold for high-heel status. Mid heels are the most common and classic height, suitable for most dressy occasions—as long as the dress code isn’t formal, which calls for a higher heel. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "High Heels",
      "content": "High Heels High heels are between 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm). They’re best for dressy, formal occasions—but think about how long you’ll have to stand in them before you go for a pair. [16] X Research source Consider practicing walking in your high heels ahead of time so you’re used to how they feel. Fit goes a long way in terms of comfort and balance. Make sure you’re wearing the right size heel for your feet. Consult a footwear professional if you’re unsure—they can help you measure your feet to find your size."

      "content": "Ultra High Heels Any heels about 4 inches (10 cm) get the designation of ultrahigh (or very high). They usually feature a platform toe to avoid overextending your foot when you wear them. Because these are the most difficult heels to walk in, reserve them for occasions where you’ll spend most of your time sitting. Or, bring another pair to switch into after an hour.

[21] X Research source The style has its origins in the French military, as Count Alfred D’Orsay requested a pair to accommodate his wide feet. [22] X Research source While the shoe’s unique design makes for a sexy silhouette, it isn’t the most secure, making it best for short-term wear."

Appearing on runways before making their way to consumers, heelless heels make a bold, high-fashion statement.

    {
      "title": "Square Toe",
      "content": "Square Toe The square toe is a modern, geometric design that offers your toes more wiggle room than a round or pointed toe.

      "title": "Pointed Toe",
      "content": "Pointed Toe Heels with a pointed toe have a triangular silhouette that ends in a point. While they might squish your toes a little, the design visually lengthens your legs to help you look taller. Plus, there’s something undeniably elegant about pointed-toe heels.

[32] X Research source It’s a more conservative version of the open toe, a style that exposes all of the toes. Peep toes offer ventilation, which is good during warmer months so your feet can breathe. Open-toe heels expose all of your toes. It’s the most common toe type for heeled sandals and can be rounded, pointed, almond, or square in shape."

If you’re attending a formal or semi-formal event like a wedding or corporate dinner, pick a heel that’s at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) in height. A stiletto is the standard choice, but you may find that a slim spool heel or a slingback style is also appropriate. The style of the shoe plays a part in determining its formality—look for sleek, simple designs.

Enter heeled sandals, which add a little lift without cramping your feet. Consider heeled gladiator sandals, mules (a kind of peep-toe heel), and cork or espadrille wedges. [35] X Research source Stylist Tannya Bernadette cautions that heeled gladiator sandals are a statement look. “If you want them to be the centerpiece of your outfit, you have to keep everything else more simple,” she says."

Wearing a cute pair of low or mid heels is an easy way to make a jeans outfit feel dressier. “For dark jeans, definitely go with a cami top in the spring or summer and some nice open-toe heels,” recommends Kim. Another option is to wear a bright red or yellow heel with regular or light-wash jeans for a cute pop of color. “Red heels pair well with jeans,” confirms stylist Veronica Tharmalingam. If you don’t own red heels, pick your most eye-catching pair to elevate your denim ‘fit. “Make sure the hem of the denim falls on your ankle or calves (depending on the look/style/fit of the denim) so your heels are not forgotten,” Kim suggests."

Wear a pair of platform heels with a silk midi skirt and sweater to achieve a dressy vibe for a date night, or rock them with a denim mini skirt for a more casual daytime look. [37] X Research source “A mini skirt, dress, or a pair of shorts are great to pair with chunky heels because showing some leg will balance the thicker shoe silhouette,” explains stylist Erin Micklow. If you’re wearing a skirt to the office and want to add heels, opt for sensible pumps or kitten heels that match your workplace’s dress code."

Next, put the heels on over your socks and walk around in them until they’ve cooled—about two or three minutes. [42] X Research source Another method to make new heels feel more comfortable is to wear blister prevention tape around the parts of your foot that get the most pressure when wearing the shoes. Typical problem areas are the back of the heel, the sides of the feet just before the toes, and the sides of the toes themselves."
