Being around other girls tells the girl that you're really interested in that other girls find you safe, reliable, and easy to be around. [2] X Research source If you get other girls to indirectly vouch for you like this, you've made a big step. Make friends with her friends if it's not too big of a step. We know that it can be overwhelming, but just try. If her friends like you, you'll have a better chance of winning her over. After all, girls often turn to their friends for advice and for a second opinion. Make sure they have a high opinion of you."

The opposite, bad hygiene, is usually an immediate deal-breaker. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Believe it or not, fresh, clean-smelling hair is a really good thing. And, a fresh-smelling body is a must-have. Here are three things that you can do right now to improve your hygiene: Rain or shine, sweat or not, shower daily. If you can afford it, it's better to be too-clean than not clean enough. Take pride in how clean you are and in smelling nice. Especially if you play sports, this step is a must. Shave or groom your facial hair daily. Most women like men who don't carry facial hair: it's prickly and unlikely to look good unless you're an adult. So shave that stubble away every day. Use deodorant, not cologne. A lot of guys think they can \"mask\" the scent of their natural body odor with cologne. Instead, the BO and cologne just mixes together to create a very bad odor. Girls would rather not smell you at all than smell this cologne-creation. If you must spray on cologne , spray it on very lightly."

When you do decide to compliment her, take time to reflect on what you like about her, summon up the courage to tell her, and be sincere. It's okay to disagree with her, as long as you don't threaten her, you respect her opinion, and you offer good reasons about why you believe differently. Who knows?

Not only that, a little complimenting goes a long way. Pay attention to these guidelines when you're ready to start showing you like her more than just a friend: Reinforce how she views herself. If she thinks of herself as an athlete, reinforce her competitive spirit or athletic skills. If she thinks of herself as a thinker, praise her smarts. Whatever she thinks of herself as, compliment that aspect of her the most. Stick with safe compliments about her personality. Don't compliment her feminine areas, or too much about her looks; while girls want to feel pretty, they also want to feel like you respect them just as much for their smarts and personality. If you do want to compliment a girl on her looks, stick to these areas: Smile Hair Eyes Lips Clothes Style Try out some compliments like these. They're a rough sketch, so try to think of your own that are more appropriate for the occasion and the girl. \"I'm sorry this is pretty awkward, but I get really nervous around pretty girls.\" \"Maybe you get this a lot, but I love the way your mind works.\" \"I like how the color of your eyes matches your dress. Does one of your parents also have blue eyes?\""

Now it's time to step it up a notch and really show her what your game is about. Whatever you do, visualize success and be confident. You can't flirt if you're not confident in your abilities to win her over. So do whatever gets you pumped up, or wait until you've scored the winning touchdown or won the science fair, and start flirting. Break the touch barrier. Gently start touching her in safe , non-threatening areas. Touch her hand lightly when you make a point or tell the kicker to a joke; rub her back quickly when you're reassuring her about something; touch the top of her shoulder when you want to get her attention. [4] X Research source Playfully tease her. Preferably, tease her about something that she's confident about or good at, so that she knows that you're teasing her instead of insulting her. If she's great at school, for example, say something like \"I wouldn't want to be on a science project with you, because that means I'd be pulling all the slack.\""

If you try to start a relationship on something false (like you say you've had a multi-year relationship yet you've never even had a girlfriend), that is most likely where you will end up. If you think the girl is only in the relationship for one thing, and you're in it for another, don't just play along to keep her with you. Tell her what you're looking for and try to make her see what really counts. Don't play hard to get unless you're sure it'll work. Believe it or not, some guys try to play hard to get. And most of the time, it fails because the girl misinterprets his distance for coldness."

If you let on that you like her, she'll eventually pick up on the hints. You don't even have to come out and say it. If you say you're going to do something, do it. If you talk the talk, be prepared to walk the walk. Girls (and guys, for that matter) hate it when people say they'll do something but never follow through. Don't be that guy. Polish your reputation. Don't have the reputation of someone that she might not want to date. That means: Treating other girls nicely and not harassing them. Having good friends who are likely and willing to vouch for you when you need it. Being somebody who is generally well-liked, respected, and admired."

You need to love her for the things that make her special, for her uniqueness. Tell her so. If she's insecure about something, for example, you'd have a golden opportunity to make her feel better. Say something like: \"I love your freckles. They really highlight your beauty.\" A simple thing like that could boost her spirits and show her that you like her for the right reasons. Be especially careful about her insecurities. Most girls (and guys, too) are insecure about some aspect of their personality and/or looks. As you get to know her, you'll probably come to know and understand that insecurity more.

If she's shown parts of herself that are vulnerable, don't be afraid to show her little bits of pieces of yourself that you're vulnerable about, too. Put yourself in her shoes.

Luckily, you're confident, calm, and you have a plan: You don't have to say it's a date to ask her out. Things can get awkward if you call it a date. Instead, say something like: \"Hey, so I got two tickets to that new movie on Saturday, and my friend bailed. Would you want to go?\" Increases your chances of success on a date by doing something exciting, something that raises her heart rate. Maybe a haunted house, or a theme park with roller coasters, or a horror movie. Dates that are exciting have a better chance of promoting a bond between you two because you feel like you've been through something together. [5] X Research source Be a gentleman. Open doors for her, be on time, pay for the date, and don't expect a kiss on the first date. Move at her pace and make her feel comfortable.
