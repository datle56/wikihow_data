      "title": "Loop the string of beads around your fingers.",
      "content": "Loop the string of beads around your fingers. Move all of the beads onto one side of the string so you have a long empty section on the loop. Hold your fingers together and slide the string onto your hand. Position the empty section of string on your palm and the beads on the back of your hand. [1] X Research source It doesn’t matter which hand you use for your worry beads. Usually, there will be a large bead on the string that doesn’t move around, which is also known as the shield. Keep the shield at the bottom of the loop."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your thumb to pull the top of the string toward you.",
      "content": "Use your thumb to pull the top of the string toward you. Keep your fingers outstretched so you can move the string and beads freely. Press down on the string with your thumb and slide it further down your palm. You will feel the beads moving against the back of your hand. When the first bead on the loop reaches the top of your hand, stop pulling the string. [2] X Research source Don’t pull the string too fast, or else the beads will fall down before you want them to."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tip your hand so the first bead falls down.",
      "content": "Tip your hand so the first bead falls down. Slowly tilt your hand so your palm is nearly face-down. The top bead will slide down the string and quietly click against the shield. Then tilt your hand back to the original position so the other beads stay on the back of your hand. [3] X Research source If the other beads start sliding down, hold them back with your thumb. Use the quiet sliding method while you’re indoors and around other people so you don’t distract anyone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep pulling the loop until you move all the beads.",
      "content": "Keep pulling the loop until you move all the beads. Use your thumb to move the string around your hand until the next bead is on top of your fingers. Tip your hand slightly so the bead falls on top of the first one. Work your way through the entire loop of beads until you reach an empty section of string again. [4] X Research source It may help you calm down more to count the beads or say an affirmation, like “I will be relaxed,” as each one falls down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn the loop around if you want to continue using the beads.",
      "content": "Turn the loop around if you want to continue using the beads. After you go through the loop, you’ll have all of the beads in your palm. Take the loop off and turn it around so the beads face the back of your hand. Slide the loop back onto your fingers so you can let them fall down one by one again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Split the beads into 2 equal sections with empty string between them.",
      "content": "Split the beads into 2 equal sections with empty string between them. Set your loop of worry beads on a table so you can easily move them around. Slide 5–6 beads on each side of the shield, which is the largest bead that doesn’t move. Move the remaining beads to the opposite side of the loop so there are empty lengths of string between the 2 groups of beads. [6] X Research source There are usually around 23 beads on a loop, so your groups won’t be perfectly even. It doesn’t matter which group has the extra bead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the empty string between your middle and index finger.",
      "content": "Hold the empty string between your middle and index finger. Grab the sections of string between your beads and pinch them together. Pick up the strings and make sure the 2 groups of beads stay separated. Drape the string over your middle finger so one group of beads is on the back of your hand and the other group is in your palm. Hold the string down with your index finger so you don’t drop the beads. [7] X Research source Hold your hand out so your palm faces your torso so it’s easier to swing your beads around."
    },
    {
      "title": "Flip the worry beads over your fingers and into your palm.",
      "content": "Flip the worry beads over your fingers and into your palm. Keep your fingers outstretched so you don’t accidentally hit them with your beads. Rotate your wrist in a circle so the beads on the back of your hand flip over the top of your hand. The beads will make a loud click when they hit the group you’re holding in your palm. [8] X Research source Clicking the beads together works well if you’re alone or outside in a noisy area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loop the string back between your fingers.",
      "content": "Loop the string back between your fingers. Pinch the string between your index finger and your thumb so it stays in place. Curl your middle finger behind the string and slide it between the groups of beads. Then pull your index finger out from the loop formed by the string and set it on top. Your beads will be back in their original position. [9] X Research source It will feel awkward the first times you try to move the string back between your fingers, but it will get easier over time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep flipping the beads until you don’t feel anxious.",
      "content": "Keep flipping the beads until you don’t feel anxious. Try to maintain a steady rhythm when you flip the beads so they click together to a beat. As you swing your beads, focus on the clicking sound rather than the thing you’re worried about to help distract yourself and stay calm. [10] X Research source"
