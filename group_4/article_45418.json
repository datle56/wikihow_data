      "content": "Make a long wire hook with a wire hanger to remove clogs. If your shower drains slowly, it’s likely a result of clogged hair. Take a wire coat hanger and straighten it out into a long wire. Bend one end with pliers to make a small hook that will fit down the drain. [1] X Research source You can also use a thick regular wire, bending the end to make a hook shape."

      "title": "Slide the wire down the drain to hook and remove the clog.",
      "content": "Slide the wire down the drain to hook and remove the clog. Unscrew or twist off the stopper from the drain. Shimmy the wire down the drain, using it to pull the clog out. You may need to dip down more than once to get all the hair. Once you’re able to remove it, dispose of the hair in the trash can. [2] X Research source As you pull the hair up, use a utility knife to slice the hair off of the wire so you don’t need to untangle it. Test your shower or tub by running the water briefly. If it’s draining freely again, put the stopper back in. If your shower still isn’t draining properly, try these other methods down below or seek the assistance of a professional plumber."

      "title": "Purchase a chemical drain cleaner that's safe for your pipes.",
      "content": "Purchase a chemical drain cleaner that's safe for your pipes. Products like gel cleaners and other commercial drain products can help you remove clogs from your drain. They work by dissolving the hair or excess product. It’s important to be careful with these products, as they’re powerful and can damage old pipes. [3] X Research source Always read the bottle to ensure your product is safe for your pipes. Chemical cleaners may damage PVC, galvanized steel, copper, or iron pipes. Wear disposable gloves, safety goggles, and a mask to avoid touching or breathing in toxic chemicals. Never mix more than one type of drain cleaner simultaneously. This can expose you to toxic fumes."

      "title": "Pour half a bottle down the drain, wait 30 minutes, then flush with hot water.",
      "content": "Pour half a bottle down the drain, wait 30 minutes, then flush with hot water. Generally, start with half a bottle of chemical drain cleaner and wait 15 to 30 minutes. This will give the product time to trickle down the drain and attack whatever debris lies inside the pipes. [4] X Research source Each drain cleaner may work differently, so follow the manufacturer’s instructions first. After waiting, run hot water down the drain to clear the chemicals and clog. If it’s not draining or only draining a little, use the rest of the cleaner bottle and test again."

      "content": "Pour 1 cup (237 mL) of enzyme detergent down the drain. A popular contender for chemical drain cleaners is enzyme-based liquid soaps. Enzymes are a common ingredient in popular liquid dish soaps like Dawn. Pour 1 cup (237 mL) of dish soap into your shower drain and let it sit for an hour. Then, flush the drain with hot water from the tap. [5] X Research source Enzymes help speed up biological processes, like breaking down grease and clogs. This solution can create large amounts of suds, so be careful."

      "title": "Pour a pot of boiling water down the drain slowly.",
      "content": "Pour a pot of boiling water down the drain slowly. If you have metal or CPVC pipes, boil a large pot of hot water on a stove or with a tea kettle. Then, carefully pour it down the drain in batches. Allow the heat to melt or break up the clog. This is ideal for minor blockages. [6] X Research source You can also add salt to help the water boil faster. Salt is also abrasive and can scrape away at the debris that may be clinging to your pipes. If you have regular PVC pipes, boiling water could cause damage."

      "content": "Pour a mixture of hot water, white vinegar, and baking soda down the drain. When used in conjunction, these ingredients can help break up clogs. Start by pouring a single cup (272 g) of baking soda down the drain, followed by 2 cups (473 mL) of boiling water. Allow it to sit for 4 or 5 minutes. [7] X Research source Then, pour another cup of baking soda down the drain. With the stopper ready, pour in 1 cup (237 mL) of white vinegar. Close the stopper, allowing the baking soda and vinegar to foam. Once the mixture stops foaming, pour another cup of boiling water. Ensure you have CPVC or metal pipes, as boiling water may damage regular PVC pipes."

      "content": "Use a toilet plunger to unclog the drain. Tape over any overflow holes with duct tape to get a better seal. Turn the faucet to cover the bottom of the plunger. Place the plunger over the drain and press up and down a few times. [8] X Research source You may want to get a plunger specifically for this purpose. However, you can use a plunger you already have. Just thoroughly clean and sanitize it, or clean the bathtub afterward."

      "content": "Thread a drain stick or auger into the shower drain. A drain stick, such as a Zip-it, is a mini snake that can remove clogs. Similarly, snakes or auger cables are for clogs deep in the pipes. Remove the strainer or overflow plate and thread the cable into the hole. Keep going until the line hits a clog, then stop pushing. [9] X Research source You can purchase or rent an auger cable from your local home improvement store."

      "content": "Latch onto the clog and twist or pull to remove it manually. Turn the handle of the auger cable clockwise. It will twist the end of the line into the clog. Keep pushing, pulling, and turning to get rid of it. If you’re using a drain snake, insert it until you feel the blockage and twist to remove it. [10] X Research source You can also use a sewer rod, pushing it forward and back to break up the clog. If there’s a clog further down the line, you may need to feed in more auger cable to clear it thoroughly. Run hot water down the pipes to ensure it’s draining properly."
