      "title": "Locate and identify the choker’s type of closure.",
      "content": "Locate and identify the choker’s type of closure. Many chokers will have a metal clasp or hook in the back. However, some chokers may use knots or wrapping instead of clasps, such as plastic, wrapped, or fabric chokers. If your choker has a clasp, check for an adjustable chain with several loops to choose from, or just one loop to attach the clasp to. Plastic tattoo chokers should be stretchy enough to fit over your head and around your throat. Wrapped chokers should comfortably circle your throat several times, with the ends tied or left hanging. Fabric chokers should wrap around your throat once and tie in the back, with the ends loose."

      "title": "Put the choker around your neck and settle it into place.",
      "content": "Put the choker around your neck and settle it into place. Some chokers sit higher on the neck, such as stretchy or fabric chokers, while others settle over the collar bone. The fit will depend on the length of your choker and whether or not it has an adjustable chain. Close the clasp, if the choker has one, once you find a comfortable position. To attach the clasp, you may want to turn the necklace around so the clasp is in the front, then look in a mirror to have a clear view. Close the clasp, then rotate the choker back around so the clasp is at the back."

      "content": "Check if the choker is too tight. A good way to tell if your choker is too tight is fit a finger between the choker and your neck. If your finger doesn’t fit, your choker is likely too tight. You should also be able to rotate the necklace around your neck. If the choker won’t move or pinches and hurts when you try to turn it, then the choker is too tight."

      "title": "Adjust the choker to fit your throat comfortably.",
      "content": "Adjust the choker to fit your throat comfortably. The choker should sit comfortably on your throat without feeling too tight or restrictive. Adjust the length or re-tie the ends, depending on what kind of choker you’re wearing, until the choker feels comfortable and sits where you want it to. If your choker is not adjustable and continues to feel uncomfortable or too tight, it may be too small for you. Look for a different choker that you can adjust to get the perfect fit. If you have trouble finding a choker that fits, measure your neck’s circumference with a tailor’s measuring tape or a piece of string, then look for chokers specifically in your size."

      "content": "Add 2 longer necklaces to make a trio. Choose 2 longer necklace with delicate chains—such as a bar necklace and a pendant necklace—to pair with a sleek, minimalistic choker that rests at your collarbone. Your choker should be a little thicker than the chains of the other 2 necklaces so it anchors the look. Generally, you shouldn’t mix metals, so choose 2 longer necklaces made from the same metal as the choker. For example, pair silver with silver and gold with gold—this will make your necklace trio look more cohesive. Vary the necklaces’ lengths for a more balanced, curated look. The second necklace should be around 22 to 24 inches (56 to 61 cm) and the third necklace should be around 30 to 32 inches (76 to 81 cm)."
