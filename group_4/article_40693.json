      "content": "Figure out your target audience. According to Wu, you should make videos with your audience in mind. Instead of focusing on a specific game, figure out who your target audience is and what they like. You can base your channel around a specific game, but don’t be afraid to expand into other games. Just make sure you are producing content your target audience will enjoy. [2] X Research source Think about what types of games you like to play. Then think about what types of gamers might enjoy watching you play those games. What is the age group and demographic of that audience. For example, if you enjoy playing Minecraft, your target audience is probably people between thes of 15 to 30 who enjoy watching creativity and/or multiplayer interactions. Your audience will probably also enjoy watching other creative games with a community aspect, like Roblox. If you like RPGs, your audience is probably a little older, between the ages of 30 to 40. Your audience will probably enjoy watching you try new RPGs as well as some retro games. Join a gaming community based on the types of games you play. This can be a Reddit forum, a Discord Channel, or a Facebook group. This will let you see what other people who are into the same types of games you are into like and decide what kind of content to produce based on your audience’s preferences."

If you are funny and entertaining, you can attract viewers, no matter what game you are playing. Tips & Tricks: Tips & Tricks videos are meant to show players how to accomplish certain tasks within a game. This may be how to do a build in Minecraft, how to get an achievement point, strategies on how to win at Fortnite, how to defeat a difficult boss or level, how to solve a puzzle, or how to find an item.

Speed Run: Speed run videos feature a particularly talented player playing through an entire game or level as quickly as possible.

However, better equipment will allow you to produce better quality videos. Some of the equipment you might need is as follows: High-end gaming PC: Gaming in general often requires pretty powerful PC hardware. Gaming while recording your screen, webcam footage, and audio is especially taxing on your computer's hardware. Make sure you have a decent i7 processor or above, with a decent graphics card, and about 16 GB of RAM or more. Screen capture and recording software: Both Windows and Mac have built-in screen recording software. You may want to try more robust screen capture and recording software. OBS is a popular screen capture program that is free to download. Capture Card: While PlayStation and Xbox consoles have their own game capture technology built in, the functionality is limited. A capture card can capture a video signal from an external device (such as a game console) and save it to your PC. If you plan on covering game console games on your YouTube channel, you may want to invest in a capture card. Some capture cards include Elgato Game Capture HD60X , AVerMedia , and Magewell USB 3.0 HDMI HD Video Capture . [4] X Research source Video Editing Software: After you capture your gameplay footage, you will need to edit your footage. There are plenty of free video editing software options, including OpenShot, Shotcut, and Lightworks. For a more professional option, you might want to look into Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or Sony Vegas. Video camera: Your computer's camera may be suitable when you first start making YouTube videos, but eventually, you may want to invest in a good-quality video camera to record better-quality video. Microphone: According to Wu, having good-quality audio is an important factor that is often overlooked. While most computers have a built-in microphone, purchasing a decent microphone will make your voice sound a lot better and more crisp in your YouTube videos. Lighting: Proper lighting will make you look much better on camera. Ideally, you should use soft lighting placed in front of you. Avoiding recording in rooms that are too dark or have too much light in behind you. You can use desk lamps placed in front of you, or you can purchase an inexpensive webcam lighting kit. [5] X Research source Green Screen: Many YouTube gamers use a green screen during live streaming and Let’s Play videos. This allows them to remove the background so they can show their head against the gameplay footage."
