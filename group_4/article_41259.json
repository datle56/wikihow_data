      "content": "Set a timer and work on a task for a designated amount of time. Instead of thinking about the total number of hours you’re about to work for, just start. Tell yourself you’ve only got to do it for 15 minutes. This will deal with the intimidation factor, and you’ll likely spend much longer than 15 minutes on your task before you stop working again. [3] X Research source If 15 minutes still sounds too intimidating, start with 3 or 5 minutes to warm yourself up. Once the timer goes off, take a 2-minute break. Then, start up on another set of 15 minutes of work."

You'll be able to get started on the smallest crumb and go forward from there. [5] X Research source For example, instead of thinking, “I need to finish this essay before 10 PM tonight,” tell yourself, “I’m going to make a short outline, fill that in, and then look for quotes.” Consider trying a specific technique like Pomodoro, in which you work from 25-minute chunks and take 5-minute breaks in between. Avoid making a long, disorganized to-do list. This is just setting yourself up for failure. Instead, create subcategories like \"Home,\" \"Work,\" \"Family,\" and \"Fun\" and try to cross off a few entries from each list every day. Similarly, avoid multitasking or working on more than 1 task at once, as this could make you feel overwhelmed or stressed."

      "content": "Make a plan in the morning and pick the hardest task first. You’ll be most energized in the morning once you’ve eaten breakfast and woken up fully. Tackle the hardest thing on your docket right then. You’ll feel better once it’s done, and then you can move on to a few easier tasks for the rest of the day. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that this strategy isn’t for everyone, so stick to tackling your most difficult tasks whenever you feel the most motivated. For instance, if you're a morning person, do your toughest work right after you wake up. On the other hand, if you tend to be groggy in the morning, you risk making careless errors or frustration by going headfirst into a difficult task."
