      "content": "Get 100% cotton terrycloth sweatbands to absorb the most sweat. Terrycloth material is made of cotton, which is super absorbent. It's very effective at soaking up all of the sweat that would otherwise drip onto your face and body. The downside of terrycloth is that it's not very breathable, so heat, dirt, and moisture won't be able to escape. [1] X Research source This can result in skin rashes, irritation, and acne under and around the sweatband. Terrycloth is probably the most common sweatband material on the market. If you sweat a lot, terrycloth is the best option for you. Wash these sweatbands every day or every other day since they absorb so much sweat. Typically, you can toss terrycloth sweatbands into the washing machine with your workout clothes and hang them to air-dry."

      "title": "Try moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester to increase ventilation.",
      "content": "Try moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester to increase ventilation. Unlike terrycloth, which absorbs moisture, polyester has a wicking ability that allows heat and moisture to be released through the fabric. Since it isn't completely absorbing the moisture, polyester will dry much faster than terrycloth. This quality also allows the skin underneath the sweatband to breathe. [2] X Research source Polyester is very durable and doesn't deteriorate as easily as terrycloth. If you sweat a lot, consider washing your sweatband after each workout. Otherwise, it's probably fine to wash it every few days. You can wash it in your washing machine unless the care tag specifies hand-washing."

      "content": "Try a nylon sweatband for stretch and durability. Nylon is easy to stretch around your wrist or forehead and tends to hold up the best because of how strong it is. Nylon also doesn't trap dirt in its fibers, reducing the risk of skin irritation, and has moisture-wicking properties, although it's not quite as effective as polyester at wicking moisture. [3] X Research source If you want extra stretch, look for sweatbands made of nylon spandex blends. Wash nylon sweatbands several times per week, or after every workout if you tend to sweat a lot."

High-performance sweatbands with UV protection tend to cost a little more, but if you work out outdoors, spending the extra money might be worth it. Anti-odor fabrics are a good choice if you work up a sweat in public and are worried about sweaty smells. Sweatbands with reflective logos are great for people who exercise outdoors at night. Look for sweatbands with silicone rubber grips if you want yours to stay put no matter how much you sweat."
