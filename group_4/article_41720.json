[18] X Research source Squat thrusts are also called burpees. Do 8-10 squat thrusts at one time. Try to make your motion as explosive as possible. When you’re in plank position, don’t let your back sag or point your butt up into the air. You can modify this exercise by slowing it down. Instead of jumping, step in and out of your plank position. Then, reach up as you come out of your squat thrust, but don’t jump off the floor."
