      "content": "Do a body safety check before turning on your gas stove. To prevent any fires while using your gas stove, roll up your shirt sleeves above the elbow and tie back long hair with a rubber band. If you have any jewelry on, remove it before starting the stove.

      "title": "Turn the stove dial on to light the stove.",
      "content": "Turn the stove dial on to light the stove. Most gas stoves are equipped with a dial that lights the burner. You can usually adjust the heat to low, medium, and high depending on what you're using the stove for. Twist the dial and wait for the burner to light, then adjust it to your desired heat setting. In some cases, the fire may not light right away. This is common in old stoves and is nothing to worry aboutâ€”try turning the stove dial on again until the burner lights."

      "content": "Try cleaning your burner holes and igniter if it does not light immediately. If your burner is clogged with food residue, it may not light automatically. Clean the burner and the igniter with a stiff toothbrush (without water or cleaning solutions) to remove any grease or crumbs.

      "title": "Light the gas stove manually as an alternative.",
      "content": "Light the gas stove manually as an alternative. If your gas stove igniter is broken, most gas stoves can be lit with a match or lighter. Turn the gas dial to medium, then ignite your match or lighter. Hold the match or lighter close to the center of the burner, then wait 3-5 seconds until the burner ignites. Remove your hand quickly to prevent getting burned. [2] X Research source For the safest option, use a long-handled lighter. Long-handled lighters can be found at most craft or hardware stores. If you have never lit a gas stove before or seen someone else do it, you may not want to do it on your own. Lighting a gas stove manually can be dangerous if you have never done it before."

      "title": "Check your stove's pilot light if it is an older model.",
      "content": "Check your stove's pilot light if it is an older model. Most older gas stoves are equipped with pilot lights, which stay on constantly even if the stove is off. Check with your stove manufacturer to see if your stove has a pilot light. For models with a pilot light, remove the burner grates from your stove and open the cooktop panel. The pilot light should be a small flame located directly below the stove panels. If the pilot light is out and you can smell sulfur, leave your home and call emergency services, as your stove may be leaking gas into the home."
