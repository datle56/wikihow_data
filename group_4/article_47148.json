      "title": "Do your research.",
      "content": "Do your research. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with different beaches and resorts. While most beaches and resorts are technically \"clothing optional\", there are some places where complete nudity is more enthusiastically encouraged. Some resorts and beaches allow nudity or going topless, but it is not necessarily embraced by everyone. At other sites, full nudity is the norm. Read reviews from previous visitors. If you are looking into a resort, look for reviews on travel sites. You'll be able to get a feel for what type of experience to expect. Ask around. If you have heard about a particular beach where nudity is an often, ask people from the area if they have ever been. You should also find out whether nudity is merely accepted, or if it is actually legal. Some towns or states have statutes against public nudity, whereas others allow it in certain areas. Decide whether you want to spend several hours or several days nude. This can help you determine whether you want to just try visiting a beach, or whether you want to book a stay at a resort. Make sure that the resort is reputable. Some resorts claim to embrace the nudist lifestyle but are actually more like a singles scene. A beach that embraces the nudist philosophy will usually not focus on sexuality, whereas that might be a component at some couples resorts. This is a personal preference, but one you should be aware of when deciding where to go. Read reviews from previous travelers or beach goers to get a good sense of the atmosphere."

      "content": "Recruit travel companions. There are many people who go to nude beaches and resorts on their own. This is a perfectly acceptable option if that is within your comfort zone. But if you are nervous to be naked in front of strangers for the first time, you might feel better if you take along a trusted friend or family member. Think carefully about whom you want to invite on the trip. The person you choose should be open-minded and open to the same experience as you. Talk about your expectations before you book any travel arrangements."

      "content": "Pack. This might seem strange, since you won't need to bring many clothes. But there are actually a lot of essentials you want to remember if you are visiting a nude beach or resort. For the beach, your most important item is your towel. You don't want to be completely naked on the sand all day--it's not comfortable. [2] X Research source You should also make sure to bring plenty of sunscreen. You are going to be getting a lot of sun, and some areas of your body won't be used to the exposure. Make sure to fully lotion up several times a day. Weather can be unpredictable. If it grows suddenly cold or rainy, you'll want to be able to add layers of clothing. As with any trip, try to pack for the unexpected cold snap. Most nudist resorts and beaches frown upon cameras, for obvious reasons. You can leave this item at home, unless explicitly told that it is okay to bring."

      "title": "Familiarize yourself with the guidelines.",
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the guidelines. There are many rules to follow when you are visiting a nudist area. Some are unwritten, but some are explicitly stated. Think about things that would make you uncomfortable while you are sunbathing nude. Then avoid doing those things. Pay attention to the behavior of others, and conform to social niceties. Some nudist resorts are adults only. If it doesn't specifically say that in the site's promotional materials, feel free to inquire. If you want your children to visit a nude beach, find an area that is kid friendly. This is much more common in Europe than it is in the United States. Avoid staring at others. No one likes to be gawked at. Pay attention to yourself, and those you came with. Don't make the situation sexual. Nudists are there because they embrace the freedom of the lifestyle, not because they are seeking a romantic encounter. Don't be an exhibitionist. This means not engaging in any sexual activity in front of others, or engaging in any physical acts that could be considered lewd."

Even though it might be uncomfortable your first time, try to be confident in your own skin. You will soon realize that nudism isn't about looking a certain way--it is about feeling at ease. No one expects you to have a perfect body, so just feel good about what you have. Give yourself a pep talk before stripping down. Think of your favorite part of yourself and concentrate on that. Are your legs strong from doing a lot of walking lately? Let that be your focus."

Avoid thinking about people's physical attributes and instead focus on your own experience. Go into this knowing that you will see all types of bodies. [3] X Research source Nudists believe that human bodies are beautiful. Make this your mindset, too."
