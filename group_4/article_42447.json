      "content": "Position your face at a slight angle rather than taking the photo straight on. Different angles will help show off your bone structure and add depth to the photo. Turn your head a few degrees to the right or left to make your features really pop. Hold your camera slightly above eye level to make your jaw look more defined. [1] X Expert Source Crystal Bear Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 21 January 2021. Here are a few other ideas for finding a good angle: Take the photo emphasizing your \"good side,” which is usually the side of your face that looks the most balanced and symmetrical. Angle the camera slightly above yourself and take a snapshot of your face and chest for a slightly more seductive pose."

      "content": "Go for a natural, authentic expression. One way to make it look more real is to try to capture yourself when you're feeling an emotion. Try taking a selfie while you're watching a movie that's making you genuinely laugh, or think of things and people who make you happy. [2] X Research source You can never go wrong with a smile, but a cool, collected expression could also go over well. Think about relaxing your eyes and jaw to help you look more comfortable and natural on camera. Play around with different types of smiles. A closed-mouth coy smile can be just as appropriate and just as flattering as a wide, laughing grin."

      "content": "Take a full-length mirror selfie. If you want to show off your outfit of the day or your hard work at the gym, grab your phone and head to the nearest mirror. To add a little mystery (or if you’re feeling self-conscious), use your phone to cover up half your face. Otherwise, make sure to hold your phone slightly off to the side so the world can see your gorgeous smile. As a pro-tip, turn a little to the side for a more flattering angle. [3] X Research source Not sure what to do with your hands in the photo? With the phone that’s not holding your phone, try playing with a necklace, running a hand through your hair, waving, or even holding up a cup of coffee. Make yourself look thinner by slightly cocking your hip to the same side where you are holding your camera. Your opposite shoulder should come forward a bit, and your free arm should either dangle to your side or your free hand can rest on your hip. Lean your chest forward a little, and cross your legs at the ankle. [4] X Research source When it comes to sexy mirror selfies or gym selfies, lighting coming in from above or in corners will add dramatic shadows to highlight your body. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Grab a few more people (or a pet) to be in the photo. The first requirement of a selfie is that you have be in it, but there's no rule that says you have to be alone! Grab some friends, siblings, your dog, and other people to take a picture with you. The picture won't be as controlled, but it'll be visually interesting and fun for other people to look at and share. [6] X Research source This is a great way to take a selfie in public if you're self-conscious about taking a picture of just yourself. The more people in the picture, the better when it comes to sharing! If you have a group of friends instead of just one or two, the picture is likely to get passed around and liked by more people."

      "content": "Show off your favorite features or accessories. If you're planning on doing a closeup of your face, consider glamming up one feature while downplaying the others. If you decide to take a selfie to show off a new haircut or a new pair of earrings, make sure that you frame the photo in a way that highlights the new feature that has you excited. A selfie showing off your new hairstyle, for example, should show your hair from the most flattering angle. On a similar note, a selfie showing off a mustache should show the mustache straight-on, and the same goes for a selfie showing off a new pair of glasses. For instance, if you love your eyes, play them up with mascara and complementary eye shadow while keeping your complexion and lips fairly natural. If you decide to show off a new pair of shoes, aim the camera straight down. The edge of the frame should land somewhere on your thighs, fairly close to your hips. This angle makes your legs look as long as possible."

      "title": "Use natural light, and take your photo near a window or outdoors.",
      "content": "Use natural light, and take your photo near a window or outdoors. Having a solid light source is an essential part of taking any kind of photograph, and selfies are no different. If you try to take a selfie in a dimly-lit room or one with harsh fluorescent lighting, the shadows might be less flattering. Here are a couple other lighting tips to keep in mind as you shoot: Keep the sun or other light source in front of you, a bit above eye level, for the most flattering shot. The light will brighten and soften your features, rather than casting harsh shadows across your face. If it's off to the side or behind you, your features could appear shadowy or distorted. [7] X Expert Source Crystal Bear Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 21 January 2021. Consider using a thin curtain to diffuse sunlight or a single light source. It makes the light softer and more flattering. It will give the impression of smoother, softer facial lines so that your smile appears more attractive. Natural light renders colors more faithfully than artificial light, but you can use artificial light to fill shadows. If you don't have the best lighting, most modern digital cameras have some automatic color correction to make up for it. Don't use your flash if you can help it. It'll create a forehead glare, distort your appearance and possibly give your selfie the redeye effect."

      "content": "Use your phone's back camera. Many cell phones have two cameras: one in the back, and one in the front. Instead of using the camera in the front to take selfies, use the one in the back. The back camera takes higher-resolution pictures than the front camera, which will end up taking a blurrier selfie. You'll have to turn the phone around, and you won't be able to see your face as you take the picture, but it's worth the trouble to use the back camera.

      "content": "Play around with self-timers and burst modes. Taking a selfie without holding the phone can help you capture action shots or line up the perfect shot. If you have an iPhone, burst mode gives you the option to take multiple photos in a short span of time, so you can pick the one that captures the specific facial expression or pose. [9] X Research source Self timers are a great option to prevent shakiness or blur in your photos."

      "content": "Use portrait mode to add drama and style to your photos. Flipping into portrait mode on your smartphone will create a photo that draws the focus onto your face while slightly blurring out the background. For instance, on iPhone, you can experiment with different lighting modes like “Studio Light,” “Contour Light,” “Stage Light” and more. [10] X Research source Studio Light will brighten up your face. Contour Light adds contrast by amping up highlights and shadows. Stage Light will replace your background with a black one. On iPhone, you can adjust the depth of field (which will impact the background blurriness) by tapping the “f” in the top right-hand corner when you’re in portrait mode."

For both great light and a beautiful background head outside into nature. If you’re inside, take your photos in a place that says something about your personality. Love to cook? Take a selfie in the kitchen. Into surfing or snowboarding? Snap a selfie in front of your board. Make sure to tidy up whatever’s going to appear in your background. You’ll want a background that’s interesting but not too busy."

      "content": "Watch out for photo-bombers. The standard culprits include younger siblings, crying children, and dogs taking a bathroom break on the lawn behind you. Before you snap your selfie, take a quick look around to make sure that no one and nothing is lurking in the shadows, waiting to ruin your moment. Sometimes photo-bombers actually add to the selfie! Don't discount a picture just because it has your little sister in it. Her goofy face juxtaposed with your serious one could make it that much more interesting a picture. If you do not want to re-take your selfie, you can always remove the photo-bomber using an image manipulation program , or just crop your image using your smartphone's built-in image editing features."

Not every filter is right for every selfie, so play around with different options before settling on the best one. You can typically adjust the amount each filter gets applied to the photo to get the effect you want. [11] X Research source The simplest filters are “black and white” and “sepia.\" Even if you don't have an editing app installed on your phone, you probably have these features."

[12] X Research source If you have photo editing software, you can also touch up any blemishes or flaws on the selfie before uploading it. Try to keep any edits looking natural. You can typically dial up or down your changes and even adjust how filters are applied."

In most cases, you can add a caption to describe what's happening in the picture, but you might want to just let it speak for itself. Diversify the poses in your feed. Selfies are great, but you’ll have a more interesting profile if you mix up angles and types of photos. Be sure to leave the types of comments you want to see on other people's selfies. The more \"likes\" and shares you give others, the more you'll get."

[13] X Research source The 0.5 Lens Selfie: To take a “point five” selfie, use the ultra-wide-angle lens on your smartphone for a slightly distorted, wacky pic. [14] X Research source Throwback Thursdays: This one’s an older trend, but still going! Every Thursday, people post pictures of themselves from an earlier time. See if you can dig up a selfie from childhood, or simply post one from last week."
