      "content": "Wash, condition, and towel dry your hair so it’s damp. Ensure your hair is nice and clean before you apply the mask. Wash your hair with your regular shampoo or a clarifying shampoo and apply conditioner to the ends. Then, rinse out your hair and gently pat it dry with a soft towel so it’s damp but not soaking wet.

      "content": "Comb your hair and separate it into sections. Run a wide tooth comb through your hair to remove any tangles, starting at the ends and working your way up your hair. Then, part your hair to help make applying the mask easier. For instance, part your hair in half on either side of your head or section the top and bottom into quarters. [2] X Research source Depending on your hair thickness and length, you may want to part your hair into more than 4 sections."

      "content": "Apply the Fino Hair Mask , working from the tips to just below the roots. Scoop out a generous handful of the hair mask and massage it through the ends of your hair. Then, work the product up through your strands, stopping just below the roots of your hair. Ensure the product is coated evenly through your hair. [3] X Research source Concentrate the mask on the ends of your hair, as this is usually where your hair is the most damaged and dry. Avoid massaging the mask directly into your roots, as it can flatten and weigh down your hair and make it look greasy. The Fino Hair Mask has a thick, gel-like consistency and a floral scent. Tip : Comb your hair with a wide tooth comb after applying the mask. This helps distribute the product evenly through your hair and removes any tangles that might have formed while applying the mask."

Simply leave the mask on your hair for 5 to 10 minutes. [4] X Research source Pamper yourself while you wait for the mask to work its magic! For instance, soak in the tub, do a facial, read, journal, stretch, or meditate."

      "content": "Use the Fino Hair Mask 1 to 2 times per week. Shiseido recommends using the hair mask only 1 to 2 times per week to keep your hair looking its healthiest. Apply it every 3 to 4 days or whenever your hair looks and feels dry or brittle. [7] X Research source Pay attention to how your hair feels after applying the mask. If your hair looks limp and greasy, cut back on how often you’re using the mask. If your hair still feels damaged and dry, apply the mask more frequently. People with fine hair may need to apply the hair mask less frequently than people with thick or textured hair, as it can weigh down thinner hair. Shiseido does not recommend using the Fino Hair Mask every day. Using it every day can lead to a build-up of product that weighs down your hair and causes it to look greasy."
