Button-down shirts, blouses, slacks, and modest dresses are all appropriate choices. [1] X Research source Stick to dark, muted colors like black, gray, brown, navy blue, and dark green. When wearing a print, opt for small, subdued patterns over big and bold ones. Keep your accessories, jewelry, and makeup simple."

[12] X Research source Some families host private wakes that they only invite immediate family members to. If you don’t receive an invitation, respect their wishes and do not go.

Take this time to express your condolences and sympathies . You might say how sorry you are or share a story about the deceased. [15] X Research source If you don’t have anything to say, that’s okay too—a handshake or hug is a simple way to comfort the family. If you don’t know the deceased’s family members, introduce yourself to them. For example, you might say, “Hi, I’m Ted, one of Oscar’s employees. I am so sorry for your loss. He always came to work with a smile on his face.” Don’t talk about your experience with loss, assume you know how the deceased’s family feels, or say platitudes like, “They’re in a better place.” [16] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

[20] X Research source Take the family’s lead on snapping pictures or filming the wake. Wakes are often quiet, reflective events so the family might not appreciate selfies or group photos.

[21] X Research source Wakes are often held before the funeral, or after it. Some wakes may have religious elements, while others are very informal. Sometimes, there is a reception after the wake. The family might invite other visitors back to their house or to a restaurant to eat, drink, and continue sharing memories. Wakes are often used interchangeably with “Visitations” or “Viewings.”"
