      "content": "Prune peonies in the fall to get them ready for spring. Most peony varieties bloom in the spring and die back in the winter. Wait until the leaves of the plant start to turn brown or yellow to start pruning. In most climates, this happens around late September or early October. [1] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source The cuts you make in the fall will affect where new growth appears in the spring. If you live in a super cold climate, your plant may start to brown as early as mid-September."

      "content": "Hold your pruners at a 45-degree angle as you make cuts. Pick up a pair of sharp pruning shears and hold them at a 45-degree angle. Keep them at this angle whenever you make your cuts so that the branches of the peony bush end in an angled point. [2] X Trustworthy Source Missouri Botanical Garden Oldest botanical garden in the U.S. and center for botanical research and science education Go to source Cutting at an angle will prevent water from pooling on the cut ends of the stem, which could lead to disease or rot."

      "title": "Make cuts just above the buds on every stem.",
      "content": "Make cuts just above the buds on every stem. The buds, or the small bumps on each stem, are what produce flowers. As you make your cuts, try to leave the buds intact so that they can bloom into flowers in the spring. [3] X Research source Leaving the buds intact will help your peony bush produce more flowers in the spring."

      "content": "Cut off the buds on the sides at a 45-degree angle to bloom 1 large flower. If you want your peony bush to focus on making large flowers at the end of each branch, use your pruners to remove the smaller buds on the sides of the branches. Remember to hold your pruners at a 45-degree angle as you cut.

      "content": "Remove any branches that are covered in insects. Although it is not common, peonies sometimes get pests like eelworms or caterpillars in and on top of their branches. If you see any branches that are covered in small insects, use your pruners to clip them back.

      "content": "Cut back the entire diseased branch to get rid of it. Take your pruners and hold them just below the diseased part of the branch. Cut it off at an angle so you remove the diseased part of the stem. If the base of the branch is not discolored, don’t cut it off. [6] X Trustworthy Source University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources Extension program of the University of California system devoted to educating and improving local communities Go to source Clean your pruners with rubbing alcohol after each cut you make on a diseased branch. This will prevent the spread of the disease as you cut the rest of the peony bush. Throw diseased and insect infested branches into the garbage, not your compost pile. That way, they won’t be able to infect any other foliage you have."

If there are, cut back the smaller branch to free them up and stop them from rubbing together.

      "content": "Look for discolored or misshapen branches to spot disease. Branches that are yellow or brown are probably dead or dying, so they won’t produce flowers anymore.

However, if there are a lot of dead flowers on your bush and you’d like to get rid of them, make a small cut with your pruners just below the base of the flower to get rid of them.
