Some users have found that lengthy, micro-blogging-type captions do well to reach your audience and build brand loyalty. [2] X Research source However, if you create lengthy captions, be sure you're using line breaks to break up the wall of text you're writing. It's easier to read and understand that way. A good Instagram post caption will also include a call to action (CTA), like visiting a website, or asking a question. You can make it engaging by asking those who agree to double-tap (like) or leave comments on the post. If you want to boost your chances of getting on the Instagram Algorithm, you can also ask your audience to tag a friend in the comments. Make sure, that if you're creating a lengthy caption, that your first sentence is the most powerful. Instagram tends to truncate (shorten) longer posts so they are all the same size, so if your catchy prose is hidden behind the \"More\" link, it has a lower chance of being read. In this case, you could use the first sentence to deliver some staggering stats, jaw-dropping facts, or intriguing statements to get your readers' curiosity. [3] X Research source"
