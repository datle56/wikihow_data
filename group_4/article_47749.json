The size of the section is up to you, but one square foot at a time is usually a good approach; just remember which sections you have done and which you haven’t. This will make the job of sanding the entire car body more manageable. It will also ensure that each part of the surface receives adequate attention."

Otherwise, go straight to the higher-grit paper. Use very little pressure. With your soaked paper in one hand and a wet rag in the other, begin sanding with long strokes all in the direction wind travels across the car: from bumper to windshield, for example. Sand with one hand, and use your other hand to keep the surface wet with your rag. Remember to sand evenly. Periodically take a step back to look at your progress and make sure everything looks even."
