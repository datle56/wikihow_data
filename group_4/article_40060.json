      "title": "Add a bit of water.",
      "content": "Add a bit of water. Sounds too simple, right? It's true, some slimes can be revived this way. Put the slime in a bowl, and add a small amount of water to it. You likely won't need more than spoonful. Then just knead away until the slime softens. [1] X Research source Remember, water can make or break your slime. Make sure you only add a little bit of water if you don't want jiggly slime."

    {
      "title": "Mix in some hand sanitizer or antibacterial gel.",
      "content": "Mix in some hand sanitizer or antibacterial gel. Another way to soften slime is to add a drop or two of hand sanitizer. The brand doesn't matter, just make sure you like the scent. Place the slime in a bowl, and just drip the gel in. Use your fingers to fold the hand sanitizer into your slime until it's a desirable consistency. Bonus, now your slime will be bacteria-free and smell great (for a while, anyway). [2] X Research source You can add more gel if it doesn't soften on the first try."
    },
    {
      "title": "Moisten it with lotion.",
      "content": "Moisten it with lotion. Lotion keeps your skin nice and soft, and it can do the same for your slime. Go figure! Just put a spoonful or two in a bowl (four or five pumps if your lotion comes with a pump). Throw the slime into a bowl with your lotion and poke it with your fingers. Once your slime is covered in the lotion, you can take it out and knead it until it's soft. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add more glue.",
      "content": "Add more glue. If you used a recipe that called for glue plus Borax, laundry detergent, contact lens solution, or liquid starch, adding a bit more glue can help the situation. Add a spoonful or so at a time, and knead it in to soften it. [4] X Research source Be sure you match the type of glue you add with the glue you made your slime with. For example, don't add white glue to clear slime."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the slime soak in warm water.",
      "content": "Let the slime soak in warm water. Pour some warm water into a bowl, and place the slime in it. You can mix it around with your hands a bit. Keep it in the water for a minute or so. It may seem like it's coming apart, but it will still be fine.

      "title": "Microwave the slime for 10 seconds.",
      "content": "Microwave the slime for 10 seconds. Pull the slime out of the water, and squeeze it. You don't want all that water to come with the slime. Put it in a microwave-safe bowl and stick it in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Be careful when microwaving slime, as it can get very hot. Let it sit outside of the microwave for about a minute so you don't burn your fingers. No slime is worth burnt fingers. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Add some lotion for extra softening power.",
      "content": "Add some lotion for extra softening power. Squirt in a spoonful or two of lotion. It doesn't matter what kind. If you use a good-smelling one, then your slime will smell good, too. Use your hands to mix the lotion in. High-five! You've fixed your slime.

Activator is just whatever you used to make the slime in the first place, such as half a teaspoon of Borax dissolved in a glass of water."
