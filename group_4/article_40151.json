      "content": "Examine your dog’s rectum for signs of trouble. Before you do anything, you need to know what you’re dealing with. Gently lift your dog’s tail and look for anything out of the ordinary around their rectal area—fecal debris, discoloration, parasites, growths, rash, etc. [1] X Research source If none are present, and the behavior stops after 1-2 days, it was likely only a temporary problem. If you do spot anything out of the ordinary, or behavior like licking, scooting, and scratching continue after 2 days, take your dog to the vet for a proper diagnosis—there may be more serious underlying causes you’ve missed."

Bathe your dog with a canine-friendly shampoo , targeting their rear, and rinse the shampoo out thoroughly. Then, brush them all over, also paying special attention to their rear. After, keep a close eye on them to see if the irritation persists.

Food allergies or other dietary issues may be to blame for long-term issues, and incorporating more fiber into your dog’s diet may relieve problems like constipation or diarrhea. Offer your dog 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of pure pumpkin, chopped green beans, or sweet potatoes with each meal to give them more fiber. [5] X Research source Also be sure your dog has constant access to fresh water. Hydration is important for maintaining your dog’s general and digestive health.

      "content": "Debris or general irritation Often, an itchy butt is no big deal, and may just be an itch like any other. Other times, it may be caused by hemorrhoids, or a buildup of fecal matter around your dog’s rectum, which can be irritating. Dogs don’t usually need toilet paper, but sometimes things tend to cling, and so they’ll drag or lick their butts in an effort to wipe it away. [8] X Research source If your dog only licks or scoots for a little while before the behavior stops, this is most likely the cause, and there’s no need for concern or further action. If scooting, licking, scratching, or other worrisome behavior persists for more than 2 days, have your dog examined by a vet for other possible causes."

Fleas or ticks may be harder to spot, but appear like very small, round, dark insects. Note that there’s not always external evidence of parasites. Fleas and ticks can often be treated at home, but internal parasites require antibiotics prescribed after a vet’s diagnosis."

      "content": "Digestive issues Common digestive troubles like constipation, diarrhea, or an upset stomach may cause scooting or rectal irritation. In these cases, the culprit may be your dog’s diet or something they ate recently. If the problem resolves within 2 days, it was probably a one-off episode. If not, have your dog examined by a vet, who may recommend a new diet. [14] X Research source If food is indeed the culprit, the problems usually intensify about an hour after being fed or shortly after going potty. If your dog appears sick, withhold all food for 24 hours, then feed them plain, boiled chicken and rice for a day or two. Consult a vet if illness persists."

[16] X Research source If you suspect a food allergy, such as if you recently switched food brands or fed your dog something new, try a different food variety, or talk to your vet about food allergens. If your dog’s irritation is chronic, talk to your vet about possible genetic allergies and how to manage them—currently, atopy is incurable, but by no means fatal."
