According to Tareen, Biore cleansing strips “work best when they are used after cleansing your skin or when the skin.” Use a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser that doesn’t have alcohol, and avoid scrubbing your skin.

If there are any air bubbles that you can't smooth out, press down on them for a few minutes until they no longer pop up. You want the strip to be as flat as possible.

Pull slowly and hold the surrounding skin taut to make it easier to peel off. Do not tear the strip off forcefully—it may cause skin abrasions and won't pull out most of the blackheads. [9] X Research source If the strip is painful to remove, you may have left it on for too long. Dip a cotton swap in some water, and place the tip against one of the edges of the strip. This will dampen the adhesive. Try to get part of the tip under the strip. Once you are able to get a good grip on the strip, put the cotton swap away and try to peel the strip off again."
