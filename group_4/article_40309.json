      "content": "Wash your hair as you normally would. To achieve your desired spiky look, it is important to start with clean hair that is free of any product. Wash your hair as you normally would with a quality shampoo and conditioner made for your hair type. If you have thick hair, avoid using too much conditioner, as you don’t want your hair to be too slick to hold onto your product. [1] X Research source If you have curly hair, opt for shampoo and conditioner that do not contain heavy ingredients, like coconut oil. These ingredients will make your hair curlier and more difficult to spike."

      "title": "Dry your hair, but leave it damp.",
      "content": "Dry your hair, but leave it damp. Once you get out of the shower or finish washing your hair, towel dry your hair until it is just slightly damp. Damp hair is generally easier to style into spikes than completely dry or completely wet hair. [2] X Research source Some hair experts recommend blow drying your hair after you wash it, especially if you have longer strands on top of your head. Then, spike your hair once it’s completely dry. However, this option usually isn’t ideal if you have dry or thick hair, as blow drying can make it more difficult to work with."

      "title": "Remove any tangles or knots with a wide tooth comb.",
      "content": "Remove any tangles or knots with a wide tooth comb. You may need to remove tangles or knots before your hair can be spiked, especially if you have short, curly hair. Gently run a wide tooth comb or a hairbrush through your hair until there are no knots. Make sure your hair is still slightly damp when you comb it. Combing your hair will also reduce frizziness and make it easier to spike."

      "title": "Pour a dime-sized amount of gel, wax, or pomade into your hand.",
      "content": "Pour a dime-sized amount of gel, wax, or pomade into your hand. When using hair products, it’s best to start with a small amount and add more as you go, as it’s difficult to remove excess product once it’s in your hair. Choose your preferred styling product (such as hair gel , wax , or pomade ) and pour a dime-sized amount into the palm of your hand. Rub it between your hands to warm it up and distribute it evenly on your palms and fingers. [3] X Research source Make sure you get the product on your fingers, as you’ll use your fingers to run the product through your hair."

    {
      "title": "Run the product through your hair.",
      "content": "Run the product through your hair. Begin applying your styling product to the front section of your hair, coating it fully. Use your fingers to run the product from the roots to the tips in a combing motion, and repeat 2 or 3 times until spikes form. Then, do the same for the sides and back of your head, as desired. [4] X Research source If your hair feels too thin or limp, apply a small amount of hair mousse to your hands and run it through your hair in an upward motion. If you want more uniform spikes, brush your hair upward with a comb. Do this while the gel or wax is still wet so the uniform spikes stay in place. There are lots of ways to spike your hair. Spike it all over your head, or opt for just the front if you prefer a tamer look. To change the direction of your hair when styling it, Ishii says, “apply styling wax on the roots, not the ends.”"

      "content": "Adjust your spikes in a mirror. Once you’ve achieved the spike hair look, check it out in a mirror to make sure it looks the way you want. Consider twisting a few spikes with your fingers to create a more messy look, or smooth down the sides of your hair for a clean, spiked look."

      "title": "Spray your hair with hairspray (optional).",
      "content": "Spray your hair with hairspray (optional). If you’re worried that your hair may not stay in place, liberally spray some hairspray on your spikes to finish off your look. Make sure to use hairspray that won’t make your hair appear stiff if you don’t want your spikes to appear crunchy or greasy. [5] X Research source Ishii says another way of making the spikes stay put is to “use a [blow dryer] with low power on [a heat setting] for one minute then [on a cool setting] for [another] minute.”"

      "title": "Touch up your hair throughout the day.",
      "content": "Touch up your hair throughout the day. If your hair starts to lose its spike throughout the day, touch it up with a bit of gel, wax, or pomade. You may need to dampen your hair with water, then run the product upward through your hair, as you did when you first applied it."

    {
      "title": "Use hair gel for a wet look.",
      "content": "Use hair gel for a wet look. Using hair gel is ideal if you’re going for a wet, spiked look, as it gives your hair sheen and makes it look damp when it’s in spikes. It’s also a good option for hair that tends to get dry and frizzy, as adding sheen can help your hair appear healthier. [6] X Research source Hair gel may not be ideal if you have oily hair, as it can sometimes make it look greasy. Product recommendation: Got2b Glued Styling Spiking Hair Gel"

      "content": "Go for hair wax for a matte look. Applying hair wax allows you to spike your hair without making it look wet. This product is ideal for individuals with naturally oily or thick hair who do not want their spikes looking greasy. It also works well for those who have long or frizzy hair.

      "content": "Apply pomade for a slick, styled look. Pomade will give your hair shine and luster, as it’s usually wax-based. It provides excellent hold and can be re-shaped throughout the day. Use pomade on wet hair for less hold and more shine, and on dry hair for more hold and less shine. [8] X Research source Product recommendation: Suavecito Pomade Matte Formula"

      "title": "Try hair mousse for more volume.",
      "content": "Try hair mousse for more volume. If your hair lacks natural volume, apply some mousse to your spikes to give them a little extra weight, definition, and texture. Hair mousse is also great for people with curly hair, as it helps define curls and prevent frizziness. [9] X Research source Product recommendation: Avenue Man Sculpting Foam for Men"

      "content": "Look for hair products with protection and hold. No matter which type of product you choose, check the label to ensure that it will protect your hair and provide a long lasting hold. A product with good hold will ensure your spiked hair stays spiky and fresh throughout the day. Some products boost a 24-hour hold, lasting up to a day. Others may advertise protection and hold for your hair. Compare and contrast several hair products before choosing the right one for you."

      "content": "Liberty spikes Liberty spikes are a popular punk hairstyle that involves styling your hair into thick, upright spikes, similar to those on the Statue of Liberty’s crown. To achieve liberty spikes , Ishii recommends “[applying] a super hard gel,” so the thick spikes stay in place. Comb your hair, then optionally straighten it to make it easier to style. Use clips or hair ties to separate your hair into sections, then tease each section and apply your product thickly to shape the sections into spikes. Pull the spike taut and blow dry it until the product is tacky."

To style a mohawk , separate your hair into sections. Starting from the front, liberally spray each section with hairspray so that the bottom is extra stiff. Then, blow dry the section so the spray dries and your hair stays spiked up. Repeat with each section, then use hair gel as needed to touch up the look. [10] X Research source"

After washing your hair, optionally straighten it to make it easier to spike. Then, spray the parts of your hair you want to spike with a strong hairspray and run your fingers through it, working from root to tip, until the hairspray hardens. When you achieve your desired look, spray the hairspray all over your hair so the spikes stay in place."

Then, opt for a hair gel or another product that will give a wet appearance, then rake it through all the hair you want to spike. Then, spike your hair by running your fingers through it from root to tip, and allow the product to dry. [11] X Research source"
