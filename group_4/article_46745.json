[3] X Research source Different car washes charge different amounts, but in general, most of them charge about $1 per minute. If you’re using a credit card, the machine will automatically charge the card from when you turn the machine on until you press stop. If you’re using quarters, the machine will stay on for the amount of time you pay for. If the machine stops, you can insert more money to turn it back on again."
