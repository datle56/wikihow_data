      "content": "Make or buy illustrated alphabet cards. The best way to introduce letter sounds to a child is to associate them with a specific word. Purchase colorful, illustrated alphabet cards (from a book store or online) or buy index cards and draw your own. Letters should be bold and easily identifiable, while the pictures featured should be of things that your child is familiar with. [1] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source For instance, the “A” letter sounds card should feature both a capital “A” and lowercase “a”, and might have a picture of an apple on it."

      "content": "Set up a schedule. Plan specific times to teach your child letter sounds when you know they will be more receptive to the lesson (e.g. after their naptime). Keep lessons fun and enjoyable. If your child gets frustrated or bored, pick the lesson up at a later time."

      "title": "Teach certain letters first.",
      "content": "Teach certain letters first. Start by teaching your child the letter sounds that occur the most frequently in simple words first. Starting with the letter sounds “a”, “m”, “t”, “p”, “o”, “n”, “c”, “d”, for example, will let you use words like “mom, “dad”, “dot”, “nap”, and “mad”. Use your alphabet cards, which should have easy-to-identify pictures for words like “cat” and “pot”. [4] X Research source To use the alphabet card effectively, say the word indicated by the picture and enunciate the beginning sound of the word (e.g. “Eeeeeelefant”)"

      "title": "Introduce lower case letter first.",
      "content": "Introduce lower case letter first. Teach kids to identify sounds for lower case letters first, as these occur more frequently in text. If necessary, block out the uppercase letters on your alphabet cards when first introducing letter sounds to you child. Uncover and revisit them when teaching them capital letters.

      "title": "Introduce short-vowel sounds before longer vowels.",
      "content": "Introduce short-vowel sounds before longer vowels. Short vowel sounds are the most common vowel sounds, and correspond to the letters “a”, ”e”, “I”, “o”, “u”. Vowel sounds are continuant sounds and should be stretched out for 2 full seconds. Using your alphabet cards, introduce each sound to your child with regard to the picture (e.g. a picture of an orange for the letter “o”) and have them repeat the sound after you, multiple times until they can say it on their own. [6] X Research source Be grandiose about your pronunciation of short vowel sounds (e.g. pursed lips, hand gestures) to create a stronger association in your child’s mind."

      "title": "Separate similar letters.",
      "content": "Separate similar letters. Make a point of teaching letter sounds for letters that look the same (e.g. “b” and “d”) at different times. Learning these letters back to back can be very confusing for kids. Leave at least several days in between so that your child can retain associations for one letter and build new ones for the other. [7] X Research source Once your child has a strong understanding of the letter sound “b”, for instance, you can introduce “d” as not being “b”."

Songs for Teaching, for instance, is an educational website that sells MP3s of educational tracks, including a huge selection of phonics-based music.

For instance, set up your child’s favourite stuffed animals and plastic toys on the ground and hold up an alphabet card (or draw a letter on a whiteboard or piece of paper). Have your child pick up the toy that corresponds with that letter – for instance, they should pick up their toy truck if you hold up the letter “t”."
