If you were born between these years, you are part of the Silent Generation. [2] X Research source So, if you were a minor during World War II (1939-1945), then you are part of the Silent Generation. If you were old enough to serve in the military during the war, you are part of the Greatest Generation. If you were born after the war, you are likely a Baby Boomer or a member of a more recent generation."

Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and Chiang Kai-shek mentioned in the news, then you are probably a member of the Silent Generation.

      "content": "See if you have a few memories of World War II. Silents were minors (0-17 years old) during the Second World War. If you remember news broadcasts talking about the war, or if you hid in bomb shelters/were evacuated during the war, then you are likely a member of the Silent Generation, as long as you are in the correct age group. Additionally, if you had an older sibling or a parent that served in the war, you may be a Silent. Your hometown may have been bombed. You may also remember relatives dying in combat. For example, kids in the UK took refuge in bomb shelters, drew blackout curtains over windows, and were evacuated from large cities to small towns in the countryside, which was less bombed. [4] X Research source If you experienced food shortages during your childhood because of the war, you may be a member of the Silent Generation. Food and other materials were rationed heavily during the Second World War to provide enough resources for soldiers. To make the most of what they had, people grew their own vegetables, and made or mended their own clothing. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine if you were part of Japanese internment, in which 112,000 people of Japanese descent were forcibly relocated and incarcerated into ten internment camps. [6] X Research source Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor caused the US to fear and distrust Japanese people. In February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. This was a document that caused Japanese-Americans to be forcibly relocated from their homes into internment camps. These camps were very crowded and had poor sanitation, meaning diseases spread quickly. [7] X Research source You may have faced discrimination if you were a Japanese-American in the 1940s and 1950s."

World War II saw the unfolding of many violent events, such as the Holocaust, and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If you have painful or traumatic memories associated with these events, you are likely a member of the Silent Generation. 60 to 70 million people died during World War II due to starvation, disease, dying in combat, and mass-bombings. These events may well have affected and irreversibly changed the course of your early years. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Think about food shortages. During the Great Depression (1929-1941), millions of people across the world struggled to earn a living. [10] X Research source Many people lost their jobs during the Depression, and many families had to live on meager food and water. Families had to save up most of their money for necessary items (food and water), so anything beyond bare necessities (such as entertainment) were eliminated. If financial strain related to the Depression loomed over your early years, you may well be a member of the Silent Generation. Think about if you lived on hand-sewn clothing or if you grew your own food. Did your parents teach you to be frugal, saving up money for needs and not wants? If you played board games such as Monopoly at home to distract yourself from the turbulent Depression, you may be a Silent. Soap operas and radio shows were popular sources of entertainment. Think about popular shows you watched as a child to confirm that you are a member of the Silent Generation. [11] X Research source The timing and severity of the Great Depression varied significantly across countries. It was particularly long-lasting and severe in the United States and Europe, but much milder in Japan and the majority of Latin America. [12] X Research source"

If you saw movie posters for these iconic movies, or if you saw these movies in theaters at the time, you might be a member of the Silent Generation. American movies from before 1935 were pre-Code, meaning that they didn't follow a strict set of rules regarding morality, which made them more risqu√© and daring. Later, the Hays Code was introduced, banning excessive romance, nudity, profanity, and other elements considered inappropriate. [21] X Research source There were many iconic movies of the 1930s-1950s, with popular actors and actresses starring in them. These included: All Quiet on the Western Front (pre-Code, 1930) Frankenstein (pre-Code, 1931) King Kong (pre-Code, 1933) Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) Gone with the Wind (1939) Casablanca (1942) For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943) It's a Wonderful Life (1946) The Three Musketeers (1948)"
