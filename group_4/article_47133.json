[23] X Research source If you’re not sure if a Taurus likes you, Garbis says, “Taurus tends to keep their social circle small to family and a few friends. It is hard to break in.

They often have completely different interests, so they may struggle to find things they enjoy doing together. This doesn’t mean an Aries/Virgo friendship is impossible. Aries needs to be patient with Virgo’s perfectionism and fussy nature, while Virgo needs to learn to step out of their comfort zone."

They often lead by example and demand excellence from themselves and others. They work well in teams, as they don’t like or cause drama, but they often prefer to do most of their work alone. Because they’re so focused, they often struggle with multitasking and do well when they can be their own boss. [34] X Research source If a Virgo is struggling with tasks at work, they may want to implement a schedule so they spend an ample amount of time on each assignment.

      "content": "Allow yourself to be a beginner. As a Virgo, you’re likely a perfectionist who expects high-quality results from everything you do. You may get discouraged if you aren’t automatically great at something. Remember, even experts were once beginners. Don’t be afraid to fail; in the end, you’ll likely learn more than if you were already good at something. Learn new hobbies to help soften your rigid mindset. [37] X Research source To stop worrying about perfectionism, life coach Sandra Possing challenges her clients “to let go of the need to have the perfect plan and instead just start trying to trust their own desires and their own intuition. Then, try something like taking a painting workshop, taking a dance class, or signing up to volunteer… to get into action.”"

      "content": "Practice mindfulness. Virgos may easily become overwhelmed and anxious, but there are some things you can do to soothe your over-active mind. Set some time aside each day to practice mindfulness. Try meditating or doing yoga, and try to acknowledge your thoughts without judging them. Journaling is another great way to take control of your thoughts. [38] X Research source To incorporate mindfulness into your work day, life coach Michael Stern recommends, “Schedule a short ‘recovery break’ at the mid-morning and mid-afternoon points of the day to do a quick mindfulness exercise, which could include breathing, listening to music, getting some fresh air, gentle stretching, etc.”"

      "content": "Create a work-life balance. If you’re a Virgo, you’re probably a hard worker, but sometimes, this means you bring your work home with you. To avoid getting stressed or burnt out, it’s important to maintain a clear work-life balance. Avoid working overtime and prioritize self-care and spending time with your loved ones. If it helps, make a weekly schedule to ensure you take enough time for your enjoyment. [39] X Research source"
