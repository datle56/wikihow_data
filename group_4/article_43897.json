      "content": "Drive metal stakes into the ground 6 ft (1.8 m) away from each pole of the tent. Use a hammer or mallet to pound stakes into the ground. Leave 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) of the pins above the ground so you can easily tie the anchor ropes to them. Metal stakes can be purchased at hardware stores or specialty outdoor stores. Use a stake on each side of the tent at the corners for additional support. Only use this if you are tying your tent down in grass or dirt. If you are setting up your canopy tent on a hard surface, like concrete , you’ll have to weigh it down."

      "content": "Make clove hitch knots with braided rope. Make 2 loops near the end of the rope so that the end of the left loop is on top of the rope and the end of the right loop is below the rope. Place the right loop over the left loop so they line up. Set the loops over the stake and pull each side of the rope to firmly tighten it. [1] X Research source A clove hitch allows you to adjust the length of the rope easily without undoing the entire knot. Make knots at each of the stakes so the whole tent is secured."

      "title": "Tie the ends of the ropes to the frame of the tent.",
      "content": "Tie the ends of the ropes to the frame of the tent. Sometimes, the frame will have an anchor to tie the rope to. If not, tie it directly to the horizontal frame at the top of the canopy right next to the support pole. [2] X Research source You can use another clove hitch knot or make an overhand knot ."

      "title": "Tie the excess rope around the taut rope close to the stake.",
      "content": "Tie the excess rope around the taut rope close to the stake. Loop the loose end of the rope around the rope pulled taut, making sure the end of the rope goes through the loop. Pull it tight so the excess is taut against the anchor rope. [3] X Research source Keep the excess rope up so no one trips or gets tangled up."

      "content": "Use a heavy-duty metal stake for each tent pole. Most canopies will include the stakes that should be used. If not, purchase a number of T-shaped metal stakes equal to the number of poles on your tent. [4] X Research source Metal stakes can be purchased at hardware or outdoor goods stores."

Use a rubber mallet to pound the stakes completely into the ground. [5] X Research source If you have sandy or loose soil, stakes will not hold the canopy secure."

      "title": "Place sandbags or weights on the legs for added support.",
      "content": "Place sandbags or weights on the legs for added support. Use weights that are at least 20 pounds (9.1 kg) on each leg of your canopy. Though the stakes will hold tightly during small gusts of wind, they may loosen and pull out of the ground during stronger winds. [6] X Research source Sandbags can be purchased at hardware stores. Use dumbbells or other weights from home to save money."

Remove the stakes from each leg before you tear the canopy down. [7] X Research source Some mallets have a stake hook on the ends of their handles to easily get leverage on the stake."

Keep the buckets empty until you get to the location of your tent. Large buckets can be purchased from hardware stores. If you want added support for your tent, purchase 4 more buckets and use 2 at each corner."

      "content": "Fill each bucket with sand or water. Aim to have 40 pounds (18 kg) of material in each of your buckets. [8] X Research source This will firmly hold the tent in place without any worry of it moving. If you’re using sand, you only have to fill it two-thirds of the way full to reach the required weight. If you use water, fill the bucket to the top. Mix concrete in the buckets if you want to make permanent weights, though this will make it heavier and more difficult to transport them.

Pull the knot tight so it is completely secured. If you want added security, make another overhand knot so it is completely tight. If you don’t have handles on your bucket, wrap the rope around the middle of the bucket twice and tie a knot to secure the rope."
