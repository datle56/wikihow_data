      "title": "Most tire pressure sensors are located in the valve stem.",
      "content": "Most tire pressure sensors are located in the valve stem. If your car has a TPMS, it’s likely to have direct sensors. Direct sensors are usually connected to the valve stem and use special technology to read the tire pressure. They send signals (think bluetooth) to a computer in the dash—if you have a live pressure display, you have a direct TPMS. [1] X Research source Here are 3 common types of direct sensors: Snap-in sensors are the most common type. They’re attached to the base of the valve stem and snap into the underside of the rim. Clamp-on sensors are very similar to the snap-in type—they’re on the base of the valve stem, they sit in the rim of the tire—but they’re made of metal and much more durable. Valve cap sensors are the newest and cheapest sensors on the market. Instead of going in the tire, they screw onto the cap of the valve stem and take the pressure from there."

      "content": "In some cases, the sensors are strapped to the barrel of each wheel. Band clamps are the oldest kind of direct sensor and aren’t connected to the valve stem. Instead, they’re strapped to the barrel of the tire itself. Band clamps are in one of two places: either directly above the valve stem or directly opposite it (180º away)."

      "title": "An indirect TPMS uses ABS speed sensors that are plugged into the wheel.",
      "content": "An indirect TPMS uses ABS speed sensors that are plugged into the wheel. The ABS (anti-lock brake system) has speed sensors located in the center of each wheel or the axle. When the sensor sees that one tire is faster than the others, the indirect TPMS calculates the size of the tire based on relative speeds, then uses that figure to calculate the pressure. [2] X Research source Indirect sensors are less accurate and need to be set to a certain “base” speed to work, but they’re also less likely to become damaged and need replacement. Some vehicles have both direct and indirect sensors. If your indirect TPMS needs to be fixed or replaced, consider taking it to a mechanic. The wiring that connects it to the car can often get mixed up in a DIY."

      "content": "Jack up your car and take off the tire. Use a jack to elevate your car, then remove your tire . Use an OBD II diagnostic tool tool to determine which tire to remove if you don’t have a display that tells you which sensor is malfunctioning. [3] X Research source To use the OBD tool , plug it into the port under the steering wheel, read the instructions to see whether your car should be on or off, and open the menu. Select the system for “active” and “pending” codes, then write down whatever code the screen displays. Research the codes to find out what exactly they mean. [4] X Research source If you’re having trouble finding the OBD port, check your owner’s manual for the location. Look in the owner’s manual to determine if you have a direct or indirect sensor. Incorrectly replacing an indirect sensor can affect your brake system, so it’s best to have them changed in a shop."

[5] X Research source Push down on the valve stem to pop up the washer, then take that off too. Push down on the valve stem again to release all of the air. Once it’s removed, the sensor will drop into the tire. When the pressure sensor is loose in the tire, it’s easier to remove the tire without damaging it."

Take the tire off its rim fully by prying it off with a crowbar . [6] X Research source Have a second person watch the process to ensure you don’t hit the metal rim. You can also remove the tire with a tire changer."

      "content": "Remove the old sensor and replace it with a new one. For clamp on and snap in types, take the loose sensor out of your tire, then thread a new sensor through the opening for the valve stem on the edge of the rim (where the old sensor was). Snap it into the lip under the rim and attach it with a washer and a nut. [7] X Research source Most sensors of the same type are interchangeable. If you have a band clamp sensor , undo the plastic clip on the side of the sensor, then use a flathead screwdriver to pry it out of its “cradle.” [8] X Research source Attach the hooked ends of the cradle and sensor together, then press the whole thing back in place. Secure the sensor with a new plastic clip. If you have a valve cap sensor , just unscrew it from the tire and replace it with another. Each vehicle has a specific torque (tightness) that needs to be applied to the sensor to keep it in place. Look up your manufacturer’s specifications, then screw the sensor in with a TPMS hand tool until you hear a click. [9] X Research source Search the make and model of your car online to find out which sensor type you have."

[17] X Research source If you have a GM with a color display, most of the time you can turn on learning mode by putting on your emergency brake, turning the keys one click in the ignition, navigating to tire pressure on the menu, then pressing on the center checkmark on your steering wheel until the horn beeps twice. [18] X Research source You can turn on relearn mode in some Fords by putting the key in the ignition, pressing and releasing the brake pedal, turning the ignition one click three times in a row (and leaving it on), hitting and releasing the brake again, turning off the ignition, then turning the ignition three times to the first click again. The car will honk when it’s in relearn mode. [19] X Research source"

If your battery is dead, it’s easiest to replace the entire thing. The low pressure warning may flash for up to two minutes."
