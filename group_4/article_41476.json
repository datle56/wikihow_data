Lower them as well as you can to the ground, trying to stay out of the way of any flailing limbs. [3] X Research source Place the person on their side. To help the person breathe, turn them so they are on their side. That will help keep their airway clear."

      "content": "Place something soft under the person's head. Often, seizures will result in repeated head movements. That could lead to the person injuring themselves if they bang their head against the floor. Place a pillow or a jacket underneath the person's head to reduce the chance of injury.

      "title": "Stay clear of the person.",
      "content": "Stay clear of the person. Often, with a grand mal seizure, the person may flail their arms or legs. You shouldn't try to restrain the person. In fact, once you have them safe, it's a good idea to stay out of their way. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Call an ambulance if it's the first time the person has had a seizure.",
      "content": "Call an ambulance if it's the first time the person has had a seizure. If you know the person well and they've never had a seizure before, you should call emergency services to get immediate medical care. They can assist in stopping the seizure once they arrive.

      "title": "Call emergency services if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Call emergency services if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes. Even if the person has had a seizure before, you should call emergency services if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes. Begin the timer as soon as you can get the person safe. [8] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You should also call emergency services if the person injures themselves, has trouble breathing, has more than one seizure in a row, or has another health condition such as diabetes or heart disease. Also, call if the seizure happened in water or if the person is pregnant. If you are questioning whether or not you should call emergency services, give them a call. It is always better to call if you're unsure."

      "title": "Stay with the person.",
      "content": "Stay with the person. If you're the only person there, it's important to stay with the person having the seizure so you can monitor them. Plus, they will be disoriented when they come out of the seizure, so they will need someone there. [9] X Research source Try to stay calm and collected. Be sure to check the person for injuries as they come out of the seizure; look for blood or bruises. Keep in mind, they may not be able to answer questions due to disorientation."

      "content": "Help a person who feels a seizure onset by getting them water. In some cases, a person may be able to tell a seizure is coming on. In that case, they may take a pill in hopes of stopping the seizure before it starts. Help the person by finding them some water to take their medication. [10] X Research source Typically, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam, are prescribed for this purpose. If the person is already seizing, you should not put a pill in their mouth, as they could choke on it or inhale it into their lungs."

      "content": "Use a syringe to administer liquid medication to the cheek as an alternative. Open the bottle of medication, typically midazolam, and push a clean syringe into the top, pushing the plunger down. Turn the bottle over and withdraw the prescribed amount of medication, which should be on the bottle. [13] X Research source Hold the person's chin gently and place the end of the syringe between the teeth and cheek on the side that's nearest the ground. Push the plunger down to release the medication. Sometimes, this medication comes in a pre-dosed ampoule that you can squeeze the medication from. The use of this medication in this way hasn't been approved by the FDA outside of hospitals, though it has been approved in the UK. However, it is still sometimes prescribed for this purpose. Generally, this medication is prescribed for children."

If the person is still seizing once emergency services arrive, they will likely administer one of these two drugs on the way to the hospital. They will likely use an IV to administer the drug, though diazepam may also be administered rectally. [14] X Research source"
