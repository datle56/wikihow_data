      "content": "Take your hamster to your vet. Mites are one of the most common skin diseases in hamsters. Your vet will diagnose mites by taking a skin scrape (thin scrape of skin using a scalpel blade) and analyzing it with a microscope. [2] X Research source Your vet may also brush your hamster while holding a white piece of paper to catch the mites. Your vet would then look at the mites with a magnifying glass. [3] X Research source Two species of mites can affect hamsters. One of the species, Demodex criceti, is fairly easy to see and will look short and squat when viewed with a microscope.

      "content": "Isolate your hamster. If you have multiple hamsters, isolate the one with mites until after treatment is complete. [5] X Research source Mites are contagious, so you would not want your healthy hamsters developing a mite problem. If multiple hamsters are affected, treat them all at the same time."

      "title": "Treat your hamster as prescribed.",
      "content": "Treat your hamster as prescribed. Several treatments are available for treating mites. One treatment is medicated shampoo. However, hamsters don’t like baths very much, so your hamster may resist getting bathed with the medicated shampoo. [6] X Research source Another treatment is a medicated ointment that you would apply to the affected skin areas. Oral ivermectin, which kills parasites, is a treatment option. You would place the prescribed number of ivermectin drops into your hamster’s mouth. Anti-mite sprays are available as an over-the-counter treatment. [7] X Research source Talk with your vet before using an over-the-counter medication on your hamster. A whole body dip is recommended for severe mite infestations. This dip would be with a medicated bath product containing ivermectin. [8] X Research source Your vet would explain how to perform this dip at home."

      "title": "Clean your hamster’s cage.",
      "content": "Clean your hamster’s cage. Hamsters can get mites from their cage bedding. Therefore, cleaning and disinfecting your hamster’s cage is essential to treating mites. First, remove everything from the cage and throw away all of the bedding. Wash the entire inside of the cage with hot, soapy water and a sponge or scrub brush. Wash all of cage accessories (food bowl, water bottle, plastic toys) with hot, soapy water as well. [10] X Research source Use a hamster-safe cage disinfectant, which is available at your local pet store. Disinfect the cage and the cage accessories according to product label instructions. Allow everything to dry before placing the items back in the cage. Use clean, fresh bedding."

      "title": "Have your vet diagnose ringworm.",
      "content": "Have your vet diagnose ringworm. The term ‘ringworm’ is misleading because ringworm is actually caused by a fungus ( Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum ). If your hamster has ringworm, you will see patches of hair loss where the skin looks crusty, flaky, and red. Your vet will diagnose ringworm by looking at the affected skin with a special lamp and examining some of your hamster’s fur with a microscope. [11] X Research source The affected areas of skin look like rings. Ringworm is common in older hamsters. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Follow treatment instructions.",
      "content": "Follow treatment instructions. Several treatment options are available for ringworm. One option is medicated shampoo, containing either povidone iodine (antibacterial) or an antifungal medication. Consider trimming your hamster’s fur before the bath so the shampoo is most effective. [13] X Research source Be mindful that your hamster may resist getting bathed. Topical treatment with griseofulvin, an antifungal medication, is another treatment option. Your vet would shave the affected skin areas first, then you would apply the ointment at home as prescribed. [14] X Research source Isolate the affected hamster during treatment. [15] X Research source Treatment for ringworm usually lasts 18‒21 days. Hamster ringworm is contagious to humans, so you should wear gloves when handling your hamster and wash your hands after handling. [16] X Research source"

Throw away all the bedding and put in clean bedding when the cage is completely dry. As with handling your hamster, wear gloves when cleaning its cage. [17] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep the cage well ventilated.",
      "content": "Keep the cage well ventilated. If your hamster’s cage doesn’t get much fresh air, it could become damp inside, which would promote fungal growth and increase the risk of a ringworm infection. [18] X Research source If you do not have a wire cage, consider purchasing one. A wire cage would have great ventilation. If buying a new cage is not practical, purchase a wire cage top to improve the cage's ventilation."

      "content": "Take your hamster to your vet. A hamster can get a skin wound by fighting with its cage mate or getting scratched by sharp bedding. This wound can become infected, causing an abscess (pocket of infection) to form. When you take your hamster to your vet, they will take a sample from the wound to identify the type of bacteria in the wound. [19] X Research source The type of bacteria will determine which antibiotic will work the best. Territorial female hamsters can bite each other. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Allow your vet to treat the wound. If an abscess has formed, your vet will surgically remove it and inject an antibiotic in the affected area. If the abscess ruptures on its own before surgical treatment, your vet will drain the abscess and flush the area with an antiseptic until it’s clean. For at-home care, your vet will prescribe an antibiotic ointment that you would apply to the affected area. [21] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the cause of the wound. If your hamster has a bite wound from its cage mate, put the hamsters in separate cages. If the wound was caused by sharp bedding, replace the bedding with something soft, like shredded toilet paper or paper towel.
