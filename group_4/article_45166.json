      "content": "Use the button on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Siri is enabled by default on all modern Apple devices, so you can usually turn on Siri by pressing and holding the designated Siri button on your device (usually the side, top, or home button). This button's location varies by Apple device: On an iPhone, press and hold the side button (if your device has Face ID), or the Home button (for iPhones with Touch ID), then ask Siri a question. On an iPad, press and hold the top button. If your iPad has a Home button, press and hold that instead. When you release the button, you can ask Siri anything. On a Mac, click the Siri button on the menu bar or dock, or tap the Siri button on your MacBook's Touch Bar. If you have an Apple keyboard with function keys (e.g., F1, F2), you can press and hold the Dictation key (the microphone), release it, and make your request. [1] X Research source If Siri is not in the menu bar, you can add it at Apple menu > System Settings > Control Center . [2] X Research source You can adjust your Siri preferences in Apple menu > System Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri (or Siri ). If Siri doesn't start, it may be disabled.
