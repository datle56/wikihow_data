      "content": "It's unlikely that Hades will decide to appear before you. In Greek mythology, Hades is rarely depicted as leaving the Underworld—most sources say that the only time he left was to kidnap his wife, Persephone, when she was a girl. Between that and his overall surly demeanor, it’s probably not easy for a mortal to summon him. In fact, most ancient people avoided saying his name at all. [1] X Research source However, you might be able to use prayers and offerings to invoke Hades' guidance and power—and if he's feeling generous, he may just appear!"

      "content": "Decorate an altar with items associated with Hades. To create your altar , place a small table in a quiet place where you can meditate without being disturbed. Place a few offerings to Hades on the altar, but otherwise, keep the table clear of any clutter. Items associated with Hades include: [2] X Research source Brass or gold coins Soil (from a burial ground if you can get it) Bones Dark or black stones like onyx, black obsidian, or black tourmaline [3] X Research source Dark red wine, honey, olive oil, vinegar, or milk Plants like pomegranate, asphodel, cypress, tobacco, mint, bay, yew, cinnamon, lavender, and willow Fresh or dried flowers like dandelion, rose, daisy, poppy, and calendula Breads, cakes, or rich meats (especially lamb) Incense like myrrh, amber, frankincense, wormwood, and sandalwood Black, silver, or gold candles"

      "content": "Hit the ground with your hands while you pray to Hades. It’s an ancient tradition to strike the ground with your hands to invoke Hades. Some people say to hit the ground two times, while accounts of the ancient Mycenaeans say that priests of Hades would hit the ground rhythmically while they prayed. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Address him properly and refer to his place in his family.",
      "content": "Address him properly and refer to his place in his family. When you’re praying to Hades, use a title that shows him right away that you are coming from a place of respect and humility. For instance, you might open by saying, “Hades, Lord of the Underworld.” [5] X Research source Many people follow that by acknowledging his place in the family of gods: Son of Cronus and Rhea Brother of Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, & Hestia Husband of Persephone Father of Macaria, Melinoe, Mesperyian, & Zagreus"

    {
      "title": "Offer him praise.",
      "content": "Offer him praise. Greek gods are notoriously fond of flattery. After greeting Hades, praise him by acknowledging his power. Similarly, paint yourself as humble—don’t address him as if you’re an equal. [6] X Research source Say something like, “We are not worthy to stand in your presence,” or “I humbly stand before you with a request.”—although you don’t necessarily have to use formal language."

    {
      "title": "Make your request.",
      "content": "Make your request. Because Hades is fairly reclusive, if you’re calling on him, you should usually have a reason. After you’ve finished appealing to his pride, quickly get to the point. You might say, “I need help coping with the loss of my friend. Please help me to accept that their ending is just a new beginning and a natural part of the cycle of life.”"

    {
      "title": "Bury or pour out your offering if you have one.",
      "content": "Bury or pour out your offering if you have one. Because Hades is the god of the Underworld, offerings should be sent downward to him as a symbolic gesture. The end of the prayer is a good time to make your offering, although some people prefer to make the offering at the beginning of a prayer to get the god’s attention. Bury small cakes, dried flowers, or coins, or pour out dark wine or olive oil. Giving an offering to Hades while you pray to him may create a stronger connection. Traditionally, followers of Hades would sacrifice a dark-colored animal like a sheep, but animal sacrifice is an outdated practice that is no longer encouraged."

    {
      "title": "Wait for his response.",
      "content": "Wait for his response. Because Hades isn’t known for directly addressing mortals, he probably won’t appear to you after your prayer. However, if you have an especially appealing offering or your prayer touches him, there’s a chance you could summon him. If he does appear, keep your eyes on the ground—his ancient priests were required to keep their faces turned away when they offered sacrifices. If you speak, be nothing but polite and respectful, or you risk his notorious wrath. Hades may appear as a full-bodied figure, a shadow, or perhaps even just a voice. If Hades doesn't appear in person, he may still have heard you. Look for symbols associated with him like dogs, snakes, screech owls, gems, metals, and coins that begin appearing in your life after your ritual. You might also dream about him or he might appear to you in a vision. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Finish your ritual by thanking Hades and cleaning up. Thank him for listening, or thank him in advance for his help with your problem. This doesn’t have to be elaborate—a simple “thank you” will do. [8] X Research source However, if you'd like to show more respect or appreciation, encourage him to take hiss offerings and try something like: \"Thank you for answering my prayer, great Hades, Lord of the Underworld. Go in peace back to your realm and take with you these offerings of red wine, olive oil, and coins. Do not harm me or deceive me, as I have been honest and fair with you.\" Afterward, clean up your ritual space. You can leave your offerings to Hades on your altar (if he didn't take them) if you have a permanent setup. Or, store them in a safe place until you decide to set up your altar and summon Hades again."

If you're nervous or unsure about what to say to summon Hades and seek his help, here's a simple template you can use: Hades, Lord of the Underworld and of Wealth, Son of Cronus and Rhea, Brother of Zeus and Hera, Husband of Dread Queen Persephone, I humbly request that you hear my prayer. I seek comfort after a difficult time, and I ask for your guidance and protection. I offer you this gift of wine and incense. Thank you for hearing my call."

      "content": "Tend to cemeteries. Show Hades that you honor the afterlife by helping care for burial grounds. Always be respectful of gravesites, and help tidy the area if you can. Pick up litter, straighten flowers that have tipped over, or lift fallen headstones back into place. It’s a good idea to get permission from the cemetery’s caretaker before you do anything—and only go during the cemetery’s visiting hours so you don’t get in trouble for trespassing. Some people believe that tending to dead or dying plants in the fall and winter can help connect you with Hades. You can also donate to causes that care for those who have passed away, like nonprofits that help preserve cemeteries, bury people who pass away without family, or investigate unidentified bodies."

      "content": "Care for dogs. Hades is often associated with dogs—probably because he is the Master of the three-headed dog Cerberus that guards the underworld. Working as a pet-sitter for dogs or volunteering at an animal shelter might help endear you to Hades. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Appeal to Persephone. Persephone is Hades’ wife and the Queen of the Underworld. They’re often depicted as a pair—and because Persephone is free to travel to the land of the living for several months a year, she may be easier to contact than Hades. By invoking Persephone, you may be more likely to forge a connection with both the King and Queen. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Hades can help you feel peace about the afterlife.",
      "content": "Hades can help you feel peace about the afterlife. As the Lord of the Underworld, Hades is all too familiar with the anxiety and pain surrounding death. Calling on Hades can help you see these things as part of the natural order, which may give you the strength to release your pain. Invoking Hades may also help you with unresolved trauma or grief. Because Hades is frequently associated with precious metals and coins, some people believe that he can also assist people with issues related to money or business."

      "content": "Summoning the Lord of the Underworld as a mortal is potentially risky. Hades doesn’t have much patience with mortals, so you risk attracting the wrong kind of attention. He may not grant your wish or he may feel irritated and punish you for disturbing him. He could also cause hardships in your life to test you afterward. In the worst case scenario, he might even decide to bring you back to the Underworld with him."
