Because video downloaders are sometimes used to skirt YouTube's policies, they often disappear from the internet. We'll give you several options in case one of the options isn’t working. Online converters are often supported by ads, some of which can be invasive or redirect you to strange or sketchy websites. Before downloading files with an online converter, we recommend turning on your ad blocker and making sure your computer or phone has active antivirus and antimalware protection . Avoid websites that have lots of pop-up ads, ask you to pay for the service, ask you to enter personal information, or ask you to download software. We’ll recommend some software you can use to download YouTube videos. iPhone & iPad: Apple makes it difficult to download files from the internet and view them in the Files app. Instead, download and install a third-party file manager app, such as Documents by Readdle from the App Store, and use that to view your downloaded video files."
