  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Ask.",
      "content": "Ask. The only reliable way to determine whether a person is a Republican or a Democrat (or something else entirely) is to ask them directly. Introduce a political topic, then simply ask, \"If you don't mind my asking, are you a Republican or Democrat?\" Be respectful of their answer, even if it isn't the one you wanted to hear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mention the president.",
      "content": "Mention the president. Most people will show respect for the president if they are in the same party, or criticize the president if they are in the other camp. This will only produce an educated guess, however – you'll still need to ask to be certain."

      "title": "Bring up global warming.",
      "content": "Bring up global warming. Republicans and Democrats tend to agree on many science issues, including NASA funding, food safety, and medicine, but most hold differing views on the issue of global warming. [1] X Research source In general, Democrats consider global warming a real problem that needs to be addressed, while Republicans feel it would be a waste of tax dollars. The majority of GOP supporters believe climate change to be rooted in natural causes, whereas most Democrats believe human-generated carbon emissions are to blame."

    {
      "title": "Mention hunting.",
      "content": "Mention hunting. In general, sport hunters and anglers (fishermen) tend to be conservative voters who believe strongly in the unfettered right to bear arms. The average Democrat is less likely to hunt or fish, and is more likely to favor stricter gun control laws."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask their opinion on government energy research.",
      "content": "Ask their opinion on government energy research. Most Democrats support government-funded programs to explore sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, clean coal, natural gas, and hydropower. Republicans are more likely to say that the free market should determine which of these energy sources becomes successful, and that government funds should not be involved in research."

      "title": "Ask them how they feel about legalizing marijuana.",
      "content": "Ask them how they feel about legalizing marijuana. This is a topic that divides people between parties. In general, Democrats favor legalization while Republicans oppose it. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Read their social media posts.",
      "content": "Read their social media posts. Especially around election time, people often post their opinions on political topics and candidates. Scroll through their recent posts to see if you can find anything containing hints about their political leanings. Social media “likes” can be used to predict a user's religion, sexuality, substance use, and political beliefs."

    {
      "title": "Consider their stance on divisive issues.",
      "content": "Consider their stance on divisive issues. If you have heard your friend discuss sensitive political topics in the past, their opinion can give you an idea of which party they belong to. Abortion. Republican voters usually believe that life begins at conception, that abortion should be illegal, and that public funds should not be used to support medical clinics that perform abortions. Democrats are more likely to believe that women should be able to control what happens to their own body, and that the government should help subsidize clinics for women who cannot afford an abortion. Gay marriage. Most Democrats are social liberals who believe in marriage equality for LGBT partners. The typical Republican is more likely to believe that marriage shouldn't be a couple of the same sex, but rather opposite sexes. Sex education. As a general rule, liberals think school programs should educate teens about sex and pregnancy. Conservatives often believe that schools should only tell children to abstain from sex completely."

      "content": "Find out where they get their news. In general, conservatives tend to prefer Fox News, and distrust many other sources of news as having a liberal bias. Liberals are more likely to listen to NPR and read the New York Times. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Note how they dress.",
      "content": "Note how they dress. Although there are tons of exceptions to this rule, in general conservatives tend to dress more modestly (conservatively), and liberals tend to be more adventurous and express themselves more through their wardrobe choices."

      "title": "Consider where they live.",
      "content": "Consider where they live. “Blue states” are those US states in which a given person is statistically more likely to vote Democrat, and “red states” are those states where more citizens vote Republican. A Gallup poll rates each state by voting record the year before, so the color designations change from year to year. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Currently, the “red” states are: Alaska, Alabama, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Indiana, West Virginia, South Carolina, New Hampshire Currently, the “blue” states are: Maine, Vermont, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, New Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii. The remaining states are “swing states,” or “competitive states,” where voters are evenly split between Democrat and Republican."

      "title": "Read their bumper stickers.",
      "content": "Read their bumper stickers. When someone has a political bumper sticker on their car, they most likely hold those views. Be careful, though – this is not a 100% foolproof approach. They might be driving a friend's car."

      "title": "Look for an American flag.",
      "content": "Look for an American flag. In official portraits, Republican state governors are eight times more likely to wear a small US flag pin on their lapel than their Democrat counterparts. They are also more likely to pose in front of an American flag. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Read their shirt.",
      "content": "Read their shirt. When you see someone sporting a Democrat or Republican T-shirt or wearing a partisan button on their coat, you can be fairly certain they belong to that party."

      "title": "Consider whether they live downtown or in the suburbs.",
      "content": "Consider whether they live downtown or in the suburbs. There is a marked preference among Democrats for living in cities and towns with high “walkability” ratings (which measure how easy it is to walk from your front door to shops and restaurants.) In general, Republicans are more partial to the convenience and privacy of the suburbs. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Find out what car they drive.",
      "content": "Find out what car they drive. Although car preference is a very personal choice, some links have been made between overall preferences in red states compared to blue states. This won't tell you whether a person is a Democrat or a Republican, but it might give you a clue. [8] X Research source Cars in Republican voting areas are more likely to be American-made and have V-8 engines. Cars in Democrat voting regions are more likely to be foreign made and twice as likely to have a hybrid engine."

      "title": "Be wary of stereotyping.",
      "content": "Be wary of stereotyping. It's nearly impossible to determine what a person believes without asking them, unless they are taking part in a political rally at the time. It's always safer to ask. It is a misconception that people usually belong to the same party as their parents. People often change their political views once they are out of the house and exposed to new ideas."
