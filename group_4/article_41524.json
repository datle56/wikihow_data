      "content": "Slide the end of the belt the “wrong way” through the buckle. Grab the buckle in one hand and the end of the belt in the other. Instead of sliding the belt upward through the buckle like normal, slide it downward through the top so that the end of the belt is inside the resulting loop. [1] X Research source You can hold the belt up or lay it out on a flat surface—whichever is easiest!"

      "title": "Roll up your belt from the inside of the loop.",
      "content": "Roll up your belt from the inside of the loop. Lay your belt down on a flat surface and start twisting the end of the belt (now located in the center of the big loop) into a roll. Keep twisting until you start to feel resistance and the belt looks neatly rolled with the buckle on the outside. [2] X Research source Try not to wind up your belt super tight, as it might start to look wavy or bent when you eventually unroll it."

      "content": "Slide a hair tie around the belt to secure it for travel or storage. Simply slide the hair tie around the belt to hold your roll in place. This is a great option if you’re traveling and want to keep your belt compact or are worried about it unraveling. [3] X Research source Don’t use a rubber band, as the raw elastic can wear on your belt and rub on the leather or fabric."

      "content": "Put your rolled up belts in a sock or clothing drawer. Stack the belts side to side to conserve space, standing them up on their buckles if they won’t stay upright. [4] X Research source Grouping them by color or style will help you find the right belt when you want to wear one. Tip: For extra organization, consider putting drawer dividers in your drawer to give each belt its own spot."

      "content": "Place rolled-up belts in a separate container to keep them organized. Store your belts in a basket, box, or small container. Just stand them up on the buckle side and stack them side-by-side in your container. [5] X Research source If you like to keep your accessories separated and organized, this is a great option! Tip: If you’re feeling extra ambitious about belt storage, consider getting a special belt storage bin with dividers for even tighter organization. These can be used horizontally or vertically, depending on your display preference and space."

Look for cubbies that match your bedroom or closet design and set them on top of dressers, on large closet shelves, or against the wall (if they’re tall enough to sit on the floor). You could even mount the cubbies higher up on your wall for a true display cabinet effect."

These belt racks look somewhat like regular clothes hangers, but with many small hooks or pegs attached to hang multiple belts on them. Simply hang these on your closet rod by the large hook on top, then hang up your belts by the buckles.

      "content": "Mount a belt rack on a wall or door. For a more permanent storage option, consider a more durable wall mount. These look like thin boards with pegs or hooks on them that you screw or nail into place. Simply hang your belt buckles around the hooks on the belt rack. [8] X Research source You can typically hang multiple belts on each hook when using a belt rack if needed. Closet walls, closet doors, or even bedroom doors are great places for these. DIY tip: You can create your own custom belt rack with a wooden plank and some cup hooks . Make small pilot holes for the hooks, then screw the sharp threaded ends into the holes by rotating them clockwise. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Roll fabric, canvas, and casual belts that won’t crack or bend with rolling. Essentially, any belt can be rolled as long as it won’t damage the material (for example, leather belts that can crack with rolling).

Generally, it’s best to hang leather belts or belts made from materials that may crack, stretch, or deform when rolled tightly for long periods of time. If you must roll a leather belt in particular, clean and condition it regularly to maintain its shine and last longer. [12] X Research source"
