      "content": "Think of a promissory note as a negotiable instrument. A negotiable instrument is a special writing that can be transferred from one person to another and exchanged for money. [3] X Research source If you want to make a promissory note non-negotiable, meaning the note will not be able to be transferred from one person to another, you must simply write \"non-negotiable\" somewhere on the promissory note. [4] X Research source For example, assume you loan money to a friend and execute a promissory note. The promissory note requires your friend to repay the amount loaned, plus interest, on a certain date. At this point, you are considered the \"holder\" of the promissory note, because you have possession of the note and can ask your friend, \"the borrower,\" for the amount of money owed on the date agreed upon. However, because a promissory note is usually negotiable, you may transfer your right to collect to your brother. If you do this, your brother will become the holder of the note and will be able to ask your friend for the money owed when it becomes due. However, let's now assume the promissory note was made non-negotiable. If this is the case, you will not be able to transfer your rights as the holder to another person (i.e., your brother), and only you will be able to collect from the borrower (i.e., your friend). Understanding the idea of a negotiable instrument will help you in creating a promissory note that achieves your desired intentions (i.e., whether you want the note to be negotiable or non-negotiable)."

[5] X Research source Before you create a promissory note, you should try and understand these subtle differences. When you create your promissory note, be sure you word the note in such a way as to make it a promise and not a demand. The most common example of a draft is a bank check. [6] X Research source A bank check effectively orders a bank to pay the person presenting that check the amount owed. [7] X Research source The most common example of a note is a promissory note, which you know is a promise by a borrower to pay a holder an amount owed. [8] X Research source"

In order to create a legally enforceable promissory note, the law generally requires that certain criteria be fulfilled. Most states follow the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\"), which requires that: The note be in writing, be signed, and promises the payment of money; The promise must be unconditional; The amount of money must be a fixed amount (with or without interest); The instrument must be payable to holder; The promise must be payable at a definite time; and The promise must not include any other act in addition to the payment of money.

      "content": "Contemplate an installment loan without interest. If you choose to offer this type of loan, the borrower will pay off the loan in equal payments over a specified period of time. [10] X Research source With this type of loan, you will include a payment provision in your promissory note that looks like this: \"In return for a loan Borrower has received from Lender, Borrower promises to pay to Lender the amount of $[total loan amount - principal]. Borrower will make equal installments of $[monthly payment amount] per month until the principal is paid in full. Payments will be due on the [date of monthly payments] day of each month, beginning on [date first monthly payment due].\" [11] X Research source This type of payment plan is good for loaning small amounts of money to people you are close with. If you are making a loan of more than $10,000 with no interest, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may require you to pay taxes in an amount that reflects interest, even if you received none.

With this type of loan, the borrower pays off the loan in equal payments over a specified period of time, with part of the payment going towards interest and part of the payment going towards principal. [13] X Research source If you choose this type of loan, consider a payment provision that looks like this: \"In return for a loan Borrower has received from Lender, Borrower promises to pay to Lender the amount of $[loan amount - principal], plus interest on unpaid principal at the rate of [interest rate]% per year from the date this note is signed until it is paid in full. Borrower will pay back the loan in monthly amortized installments, which include principal and interest, of not less than $[minimum payment] until the principal and interest are paid in full.\" [14] X Research source This type of payment option is great for loaning larger sums of money. If you are loaning more than $10,000 to someone, include interest so you avoid the potential adverse tax consequences that may otherwise arise. [15] X Research source"

Borrower will repay the entire amount owed by [due date].\" [17] X Research source If you are creating a lump-sum payment provision without interest , use this language: \"In return for a loan Borrower has received from Lender, Borrower promises to pay to Lender the amount of $[loan amount] by [date payment is due].\" [18] X Research source A lump sum payment provision can be used when you want to reduce the potential interest charges incurred by the other party. This is the case because, with a lump sum payment, the party paying back your loan can pay off the loan quicker, therefore avoiding interest payments over an extended period of time."

Borrower will pay interest of $[amount of interest] on the [date of payments], beginning [date first payment due]. Borrower will pay the principal in full on or before [date by which loan must be repaid], together with any accrued interest.\" [20] X Research source Interest only loan payments are great for those that want low payments during the early life of the loan. [21] X Research source This is the case because when you are only making interest payments, they will be lower than a payment that included both interest and principal. However, you may not want to use this type of payment plan if the other party is concerned about the large principal payment that will be due later in the life of the loan."

[29] X Research source With a secured loan, if the borrower defaults the lender can collect the collateral as a form of repayment. If you are choosing to make the loan unsecured, simply state that the note is unsecured. [30] X Research source On the other hand, if you are planning to make your note secured, you will need to include a provision such as this: \"Until the principal and interest owed under this note is paid in full, this note will be secured by a security agreement giving Lender a security interest in specified equipment, fixtures, inventory, or other assets.\" [31] X Research source You will then have to describe the property, in detail, that you are securing as collateral."
