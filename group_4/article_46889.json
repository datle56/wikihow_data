      "content": "Be gentle with the patient. The ear is a very sensitive organ and can injure easily if improperly examined. Avoid pulling, pushing, or generally being rough with the patient you are examining. This can calm your patient and minimize the risk of injury from sudden movements. [2] X Research source Ask your patient if the pressure is acceptable to them. For example, “Is the pressure I’m using ok, Mr. Neumaier? Let me know if you have any discomfort.”"

      "content": "Handle the otoscope properly. Turn the otoscope’s light on and hold your otoscope “upside down” between your thumb and pointer finger like a pen or pencil. Place the back of your hand along the person’s cheek so that otoscope is steady and braced. While the position may feel awkward at first, it soon will feel natural. Use your dominant hand to examine both ears.

Select the largest possible speculum that your patient’s ear will accommodate. When inserted, the speculum should fit snugly into the outer third of the ear canal. Speculums that are too small can cause discomfort and reduce how much of the ear you can examine. Use the following guidelines for speculum size: [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Adults: 4 to 6 millimeters Children: 3 to 4 millimeters Infants: as small as 2 millimeters"

Manipulate the ear gently and ask the patient if there is any pain. With Swimmer’s ear there is often pain, swelling, redness, and discharge that can be observed before even using the otoscope.

Steady your hand on the side of the individuals face if necessary. Slow and gentle insertion can prevent unwanted movement in your patient.
