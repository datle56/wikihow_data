      "title": "Look at the hind legs.",
      "content": "Look at the hind legs. You can tell the difference between a frog and a toad by the length of its legs. If you can get close enough, get a good look at the back legs specifically. A frog's hind legs are very long, as frogs hop more frequently than toads. A frog's hind legs will be bigger than its head and body. A toad's hind legs will be smaller, as toads tend to crawl. Their hind legs will be shorter than their heads and bodies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the feet.",
      "content": "Examine the feet. Frogs have webbed feet, as they spend most of their life in water. They will usually have webbed back feet, and some will have webbed front feet. You may also see sticky pads on a frog's feet. Toad feet are generally not webbed and do not have pads. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider the shape.",
      "content": "Consider the shape. Frogs tend to be slender and athletic in appearance. Toads, on the other hand, are shorter and stubbier. [2] X Research source A slender looking amphibian, with longer limbs, is probably a frog. A short, chubby amphibian, with smaller legs, is likely a toad."

      "title": "Take note of the skin.",
      "content": "Take note of the skin. Frog skin is a lot smoother than toad skin. A toad's skin will be bumpy in appearance. [3] X Expert Source Audra Barrios Marine Biologist & Reptile Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. While a frog will have smooth, rubbery skin, a toad may look like it's covered in warts."

    {
      "title": "Look at the color.",
      "content": "Look at the color. In general, frogs are lighter colored than toads. They tend to look greener. While toads may have a greenish skin, they tend to be darker overall than frogs. Toads come in various shades that range from a dark green to an olive green. Frogs are on the more yellowish, brighter side of the green spectrum. Frogs may have a yellow-olive color. However, do not rely on color alone. Always consider other factors, as some frogs do have a brownish green appearance."

      "title": "Watch how the animal jumps.",
      "content": "Watch how the animal jumps. Both frogs and toads jump. Frogs, however, tend to jump more often and much higher. [4] X Research source Frogs take very high jumps, and can also jump great lengths. Toads take very small hops and lack the ability to jump very far."

    {
      "title": "Notice if the animal ever crawls.",
      "content": "Notice if the animal ever crawls. Toads are much more likely to crawl than hop. Crawling is a toad's main form of movement. You will rarely see a frog crawling. An animal that is crawling is very likely to be a toad. Always consider other factors, as an injured frog may crawl."
    },
    {
      "title": "Consider where you found the animal.",
      "content": "Consider where you found the animal. Frogs need to be close to water to survive, while toads can spend a lot of time out of on land. [5] X Expert Source Audra Barrios Marine Biologist & Reptile Specialist Expert Interview. 18 August 2020. An animal that stays close to water is likely to be a frog. If you find an animal far away from water, it is probably a toad. A frog is unlikely to wander far from a source of water. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Dim your lights to reduce noise from frogs.",
      "content": "Dim your lights to reduce noise from frogs. Frogs can make a lot of noise at night, especially when they're breeding. Frogs eat insects and bright lights can attract insects near your home. This may also cause frogs to gather in your backyard. [7] X Research source Keep things like your porch light off at night. You can also use curtains at night to keep light from inside your house from attracting bugs."

      "title": "Keep dogs away from frogs and toads.",
      "content": "Keep dogs away from frogs and toads. Some frogs and toads may be toxic to dogs. If a dog picks up a toad in its mouth, toxins could be released that are poisonous to your dog. If you see your dog carrying a toad, take your dog to a vet immediately. This is a medical emergency. [8] X Research source Symptoms of toxins from a toad include excessive drooling, pawing at the mouth or eyes, seizures, difficulty breathing, and unsteady moving. If your pet has any of these symptoms, it needs immediate treatment."

      "content": "Wash your hands after handling frogs or toads. In general, refrain from handling wildlife. However, if you touched a frog or toad, wash your hands afterwards. [9] X Research source If a young child picked up a frog or toad, make sure to have them wash their hands."

      "title": "Do not take in wild frogs and toads as pets.",
      "content": "Do not take in wild frogs and toads as pets. It's never a good idea to take in a wild animal as a pet. Frogs and toads in the wild are not raised in captivity, and will not take well to being captured. They may also carry diseases. If you want a pet frog or toad, get one from your local pet store."

      "content": "Care for a pet toad or frog properly. Pet stores do sell frogs and toads as pets. If you want a pet frog or toad, make sure you care for it properly. Provide the right environment and shelter for your pet. [10] X Research source You will have to clean your frog or toad's tank every day. Dirty tanks can pose a major health risk for a frog or toad. Frogs and toads need a varied diet. You can buy food from a pet store, composed of crickets and mealworms, but you will also need to give your frog or toad plenty of other insects to survive. You will need to feed a frog or toad things like grasshoppers, snails, and silkworms as well. Limit touching a reptile or amphibian pet. Even one from a pet store can carry diseases. Wash your hands after handling your pet, do not clean their cage in your bathroom or kitchen, and do not kiss or cuddle a pet frog or toad."
