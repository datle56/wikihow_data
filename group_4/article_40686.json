      "content": "Find a place to store the food you collect. The amount of donations you receive may vary throughout the year, so find a place large enough to accommodate the intake. If you're working with a local church or homeless shelter, they may have a spare pantry or other room that you can fill with food donations. [2] X Research source If you are operating on your own, you may be able to start by storing things in your basement or garage."

      "title": "Reach out to organizations in your area for food donations.",
      "content": "Reach out to organizations in your area for food donations. Working with churches, schools, and local government agencies can help bring in food donations. These organizations can also recommend people in need of food supplies to help you build up a database of people needing food assistance in the community. If there are other food banks in your area, notify them of your operation. Some banks may have food surpluses that you can purchase, or they may be able to share helpful professional tips. Host a food drive with Feeding America ."

      "title": "Hold meetings with people facing hunger.",
      "content": "Hold meetings with people facing hunger. People facing hunger are the individuals and families who will be coming to your food bank to receive food. Follow up with people that were recommended to you by other nearby organizations. You can also post flyers or advertisements around town to reach out in your community. Then, ask people who would like food assistance to meet with you. This will help you better assess the food-based needs of your community. [3] X Research source Figure out how many people (and families) you'll be providing food to, what kind of foods they need, and how often you should distribute."

      "title": "Gather necessary food consumption information from people facing hunger.",
      "content": "Gather necessary food consumption information from people facing hunger. Ask individuals who use your service to write down their dietary needs, the size of their families, and any food allergies. These records can help you better assess what to prepare for them. You can also learn about what sort of food supplies you’ll need to gather in general. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Hold a food drive.",
      "content": "Hold a food drive. This is one of the methods that food banks use to collect donations. To maximize the number of people who find out about, and donate to, your food drive, contact local schools, churches, office buildings, or gyms and ask if they'd be willing to host. Specify which types of food you would like to collect (e.g. canned goods, breads and pasta, etc.). Then, hang posters or flyers around your area of town to draw attention to the drive. [5] X Research source You can also ask local grocery stores to donate to your food drive. It gives them good publicity, and will dramatically increase the amount of fresh and frozen food you collect. For food safety, ensure donated food has not expired and that fresh food is kept refrigerated."

      "title": "Collect food donations from a drop-off bin.",
      "content": "Collect food donations from a drop-off bin. Food bank donation boxes are often set up outside a local grocery store, office, or other business. If you want to set up a drop-off bin in front of an existing business, make sure you have permission from the business owner first. [6] X Research source At times when items aren’t coming in through the drop-off bin, you may need to purchase food when your reserves are low."

    {
      "title": "Reach out to local grocery stores for food donations.",
      "content": "Reach out to local grocery stores for food donations. Stop by store locations in person, and explain that you’re starting up a community food bank. Ask if the store regularly has perfectly good food that is unused that they can donate. [7] X Research source If grocery store managers are skeptical of your claim, you could show them a piece of mail with the food bank’s name and address on it. Alternatively, invite them to come by the food bank on a day when you’re distributing food. Many grocery stores work with Feeding America , the largest food rescue organization in the country, to help redistribute fresh food to people in need. This work involves a matrix of daily deliveries, inspections and sorting and distributing to ensure food gets to those in need at the peak of freshness. If grocery stores agree to donate, you'll likely need to drive to the stores. Don't expect grocery stores to bring the food to you. However, there are food safety protocols that you will have to follow. Fresh food cannot be picked-up and distributed out of personal vehicles."

      "content": "Process items as they come in. Have shelving set up in your bank area to separate the items according to product type (e.g., canned goods, boxes, breakfast items, fresh food, dried goods). Double-check expiration dates and throw out any that are past the freshness date. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Store dietary alternative items apart from the rest. When you collect items that have a specific base (like gluten-free, dairy-free, or sugar-free foods), store them in their own area. When individuals come to the bank who may be diabetic or have special food needs, allow them to look at the items directly and pick out a few they would like. [9] X Research source For example, these items could be kept in a distinct section of shelving or cabinets."

      "title": "Set up a distribution schedule.",
      "content": "Set up a distribution schedule. Once you have food to distribute, figure out when people or agencies will receive food from you. Some food banks may only disperse donations once or twice a month, while others give out food nearly every day. Get in touch with your neighbors and inform them of the hours during which the food bank will be open, and when they can pick up their food. [10] X Research source You may also be able to work with other food banks in your community. For example, if you alternate weeks on which each food bank distributes food, you'll help a larger portion of the community. Find out how you can join the Feeding America network of food banks. It’s the largest food bank network in the country with nearly 200 food banks across the country."

      "title": "Prepare boxes of food donations.",
      "content": "Prepare boxes of food donations. It's best if you put these together the day before you will disperse them, so you're not scrambling to fill boxes while clients wait. Try to have a variety of foods in each box. [11] X Research source For example, each box could have a loaf of bread, a protein (like peanut butter) a few cans of soups or vegetables, and pasta. If you are packaging for individuals, keep in mind the number of people the food has to feed and pack accordingly."

      "title": "Charge neighbors a small fee.",
      "content": "Charge neighbors a small fee. Although some food banks have legal non-profit status and do not charge their clients, many food banks do require that the individuals who need food assistance pay for food. This is typically a minimal fee, say $5 or $10 per week. This fee will help offset your operations expenses and will enable you to purchase goods during months when your donations are slow. [12] X Research source If clients need food but are unable to pay, you could charge a nominal fee. For example, ask for 5¢. Alternatively, you could seek sponsors to help offset the cost of operations."

      "title": "Search for additional funding.",
      "content": "Search for additional funding. Food donations can decrease during certain times of the year, especially around the holidays when they are needed the most. Reach out to local community groups for monetary funding or check for government funding programs. By getting additional funding, you will be able to fight hunger on a more consistent basis. You can also reach out to large national or worldwide food bank organizations for assistance with both finances and food. Feeding America is a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 faith-based and charitable partners that ensure food gets to the people who need it safely and regularly. [13] X Research source"
