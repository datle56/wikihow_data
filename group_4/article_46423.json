      "content": "Visa gift cards are treated as bank cards, not as store gift cards. There is generally no space on a payment method page to enter both a Visa gift card and a bank card as separate payment methods. Visa cards must be entered in the same place that a debit or credit card would be entered. Store gift cards are “closed loop” cards, meaning that they can only be used in one place. On the other hand, Visa gift cards and bank cards are both “open loop” cards that can be used at practically any store. For this reason, online stores will usually not allow you to pay with both a bank card and Visa gift card in one transaction. When using Visa gift cards online , your transaction will typically decline if your Visa gift card balance is lower than the dollar value of your online purchase."

      "content": "Pros: More flexibility and security Visa gift cards can be used at practically any store and can even be used to make bill and rent payments. Unlike buying a store gift card that can only be used at one specific merchant, Visa gift cards are accepted at millions of storefronts worldwide. [8] X Research source Additionally, prepaid Visa cards may be more secure than credit and debit cards. Since they don’t require a linked bank account, Visa gift cards limit the risk of banking fraud while making online transactions. Visa cards are also beneficial for international purchases because they don’t charge currency conversion fees like many popular credit and debit cards. However, some Visa gift cards can’t be used internationally if purchased in the United States. Depending on what company you purchased your Visa gift card through, it may or may not be usable outside of the U.S. Check your card’s specific terms and conditions to find out if you can use it internationally."

Visa gift cards also expire and may deduct fees if they go months without being used."

      "title": "Your Visa gift card may decline if it hasn't been activated or registered.",
      "content": "Your Visa gift card may decline if it hasn't been activated or registered. You must activate your Visa gift card by calling the phone number or going to the link provided on the card, then entering your card details as prompted. You should also be prompted to register your Visa card during this step. If your card still isn’t working after being activated and registered, work through the list below of common Visa gift card problems and troubleshooting tips: [10] X Research source Waiting period on the card: Some merchants (usually drug stores and gas stations) sell Visa gift cards that aren’t usable for a specified amount of time. If your card isn’t working immediately after purchase, check your receipt to see if it mentions a waiting period. Insufficient funds: If your Visa gift card keeps getting declined, check your balance to see if you have enough funds to cover your purchase. Pending transactions: If you’ve made several purchases in a row, your Visa gift card may have a “hold” on its funds until the purchases go through. If you have pending charges on your card, wait a few days and try again. Non-U.S. Website: Most Visa gift cards issued in the U.S. can only be used in the U.S. If you’re shopping online with a Visa gift card, check if the site or business operated outside of the country. Recurring payments not allowed: Some websites don’t allow Visa gift cards to be used for subscription services like dating sites, streaming services, cell phone plans, or utility bills. You can try to contact the company’s customer service to see if they’ll accept your card over the phone. Cash back not allowed: Some websites categorize gift card transactions as “cash” transactions. In these cases, your card may decline even when making a simple online service. Unsecured sites: If the company behind your Visa gift card determines that you’re using it on a questionable site or for an illegal service, it may decline your transaction. For example, some Visa gift cards can’t be used on online gambling or adult entertainment websites. Too many transactions: If your Visa gift card is being declined and you keep attempting to use it, the card may get locked. If your Visa gift card gets locked, contact the issuing company through the information listed on the back of the card."
