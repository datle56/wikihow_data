      "content": "Look for small bare patches on your gerbil's belly. The scent gland itself is a long, yellow patch, but it will become dry if there's a tumor there. You'll notice some flaky skin, or it might look like there's a bit of powder on your gerbil's belly."

      "title": "Look for redness or swelling.",
      "content": "Look for redness or swelling. If a tumor does develop on your gerbil's scent gland, it might cause its scent gland to become inflamed. If you notice a red, swollen area on your gerbil's belly, take it to the vet. Even if it's not a tumor, it won't hurt to get your gerbil checked out. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Run your finger over any bare patches.",
      "content": "Run your finger over any bare patches. Scent gland tumors are usually caused by your gerbil over-marking - running its scent gland over areas it wants to mark over and over. Because your gerbil will be dragging its belly over things, over-marking can also cause their bellies to look over-groomed. A bare patch on your gerbil's belly can indicate that there might be a tumor. Run your finger over the patch and feel for a small, hard lump. If you find one, it's best to take your gerbil to the vet."

      "title": "Take your gerbil to the vet as soon as you find a bump.",
      "content": "Take your gerbil to the vet as soon as you find a bump. The sooner you have the scent gland removed, the sooner your gerbil can start to heal. Most scent gland tumors are easily curable with surgery as long as they're addressed quickly. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Give your vet your gerbil's complete medical history.",
      "content": "Give your vet your gerbil's complete medical history. To remove a scent gland tumor, your vet will first need to give your gerbil a mild anesthetic. Be sure you give your vet your gerbil's complete medical historyâ€”this will help your vet choose the right anesthetic. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Get your gerbil surgery.",
      "content": "Get your gerbil surgery. To remove a scent gland tumor, your gerbil will have to undergo surgery. Your vet can explain the risks to you based on your gerbil's health and age, but it's a pretty low-risk surgery. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Limit the number of male gerbils you keep.",
      "content": "Limit the number of male gerbils you keep. Male gerbils will rub the scent gland over things to mark their territory. If you have more than one or two male gerbils in one habitat, they'll scent more, which can cause a tumor in their scent gland."

    {
      "title": "Consider putting in a scent diffuser.",
      "content": "Consider putting in a scent diffuser. Even if your gerbil is the only male in the habitat, check its marking habits. If you notice it's doing it quite a bit, you might be able to correct the behavior by use a pheromone diffuser in their cage. A pheromone diffuser sort of tricks your gerbil into thinking it's already marked its habitat. If a gerbil isn't over-marking its territory, a tumor has less chance of forming."

    {
      "title": "Check your gerbil over once a week.",
      "content": "Check your gerbil over once a week. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your gerbil might develop a scent gland tumor. Give your gerbil a good check once a week, looking for bald patches running your finger over its belly. As soon as you find something, take your gerbil to the vet."
