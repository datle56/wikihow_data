      "content": "Preserve your curls by spraying hairspray on styled hair. Using hairspray after curling your hair with a curling wand will give your hair a rougher texture, which means it’ll hold its structure over time. If you have naturally straight hair, the added support from hairspray will keep your curls in place for days! [1] X Research source After curling your hair, mist it with medium-hold hairspray from over 15 inches (38 cm) away. [2] X Expert Source Kelsey Morey Professional Hair and Makeup Artist Expert Interview. 11 January 2022. Note that using hairspray before you use heating tools can dry out your hair and exacerbate any existing damage. To prevent doing further damage to your hair, only use it after styling. If you don’t want to use a |curling iron, scrunch or diffuse your hair until it’s dry and wavy then use the hairspray."

      "content": "Prevent static and keep flat-ironed hair looking fresh. Apply hairspray after straightening your hair to keep static away and prolong your straightened strands. Spray on light-hold hairspray after you use a straightener. Using hairspray before straightening can dry it out and cause damage, so only use hairspray after using a straightener. Light-hold hairspray won’t give your hair a rough, crunchy texture (as medium and super-hold hairsprays can do)."

      "content": "Tame frizz and flyaways with a flexible-hold hairspray. Flexible (or light) hold hairsprays are great to use as finishing sprays. After you’ve styled your hair, simply hold the can 8 inches (20 cm) to 10 inches (25 cm) away from your head and spray. Smooth down frizz and flyaways with your hands.

If you’re trying to tame a small area like around your hairline, smooth down unruly strands with a small comb. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Spray it on your roots for extra volume. Lean forward so your hair is flipped over and spray hairspray on your scalp. Hold the can about 6 inches (15 cm) away from your head to avoid spraying large chunks of hair. [5] X Research source You can also lift up certain sections of your hair and spray the roots that way. This is great for adding volume to updos and ponytails."

      "title": "Dab it on your eyebrows to keep them in place.",
      "content": "Dab it on your eyebrows to keep them in place. Eyebrows are hair so it makes sense that you could use hairspray to tame them. First, brush your eyebrows into the position you want them to be in. Then, spray a little hairspray on your index finger and lightly dab and smooth it onto your eyebrow. Brush your eyebrows into place again with a spoolie brush or toothbrush. [6] X Research source Do not spray hairspray directly on your eyebrows! Getting hairspray in your eyes is painful and might cause severe irritation. If you fill in your eyebrows with a pencil, powder, or cream, fill them in before smoothing on the hairspray."

      "title": "Use a hairspray with a high-alcohol content for removing stains.",
      "content": "Use a hairspray with a high-alcohol content for removing stains. Some hairsprays don’t contain high amounts of alcohol because it can dry out your hair. But if you have some lying around that has alcohol in it, it can remove ink and lipstick stains from your favorite clothing. Hold the can 6 inches (15 cm) away from the stain and spray the stain. Let it soak for 1 or 2 minutes and then blot the area with a damp paper towel until the stain is removed. Hairspray is great for removing stains on polyester and polyester blends."

      "content": "Spray it on freshly polished shoes to keep them looking clean. Hairspray acts like a sealant that will keep your polished shoes looking nice and shiny for a longer period of time. It will also help the shoes maintain their color. Hold your shoes over the tub or sink when you spray them."

      "title": "Spray hairspray inside your shoes to prevent slipping.",
      "content": "Spray hairspray inside your shoes to prevent slipping. Slipping around in your shoes can cause blisters and cramping. Spray a little hairspray on the inside of your shoes to add traction. Hold the can 5 inches (13 cm) away from the opening of your shoes and spray. Then tilt the can to spray a little spritz into the toe area of your shoe. Wait for the hairspray to dry before putting your shoes on."

      "content": "Stop runs in your tights from spreading. Just like hairspray adds structure to your hair, it will help strengthen the fibers of your panty hose. If you have a run in your hose and no time to change, hold the can about 4 inches (10 cm) away from your leg and spray it along the entire run. [7] X Research source Make sure to spray a little extra on the side of the run that’s most prone to tearing more."

      "content": "Stiffen up a zipper that won’t stay up. If you have a zipper that slips, spray a light layer hairspray on it to hold it in place. The sticky texture coats the teeth of the zipper to give more traction. Hold the can 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) away and spray a layer along the entire length of the zipper. [8] X Research source Spraying too much hairspray on the zipper may make it harder to unzip later on. If this happens, lubricate the zipper using a bar of soap, cooking oil, or petroleum jelly."

      "content": "Dry and preserve flowers for long-term decor. Drying flowers will keep them looking great for weeks. Simply hold the flowers upside down, spray the undersides of the petals with hairspray, and let them dry (upside down) before placing them back in the vase. [9] X Research source The hairspray will make the flowers’ scent less potent, but it will keep the heads upright and the petals looking shiny and colorful!"

      "content": "Dry your freshly-manicured nails in a hurry. If you’re running late after painting your nails, reach for a can of hairspray—it will help set the polish faster than air-drying alone. Hold the canister 8 inches (20 cm) to 10 inches (25 cm) away from your freshly-painted nails and spray a light layer. Let the hairspray dry for 1 to 2 minutes and then wash your hands with soap and water to get rid of the sticky residue. [10] X Research source This trick won’t work with gel nail polishes because they only dry under direct UV or LED lights."

      "content": "Remove pet hair from clothing, couches, and other surfaces. Don’t have a lint roller handy? Spray a little hairspray on a towel, let it dry for 1 minute, and wipe it across the hair-covered surface. The hair will stick to the towel and leave your furniture looking fresh! [11] X Research source You can use a towel of any fabric, but microfiber towels work best for this method since they’re already known to latch onto pet hair."

      "content": "Use hairspray as a sealant for artwork. Artwork sealants can be pricey or hard to find outside of craft stores—luckily, hairspray will help preserve the art for longer! It works best with pencil, chalk, and chalk pastels on chalkboard, canvas, or paper surfaces. [12] X Research source Hairspray may cause paper to turn yellow. Don’t spray hairspray onto oil paints—it won’t do anything but add stickiness to the painting!"

      "content": "Spray it on thread to help you thread a needle. Threading a needle can be a tedious process. If you have a frayed thread, spray a little hairspray on your fingers and rub it on the end of the thread that you plan to loop inside the eye of the needle. The hairspray will harden the end and keep it from fraying into several little strands. Roll the thread between your thumb and (hairspray-coated) index finger to tame threads with long frays."
