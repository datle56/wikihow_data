      "content": "Decide how you will write your will. You have a few options here: Write your own will. Once you know your state's requirements, decide how you plan to fulfill them. You can write your own will and be responsible for making sure it fulfills your state's requirements. Be aware that state laws can change from year to year, so the process may be more complicated than you think. Hire an attorney. An attorney can review the will you write, provide you with witnesses and ensure that you have met your state's requirements. This can be a costly option depending on your attorney’s fees and how complicated your will is. Wills that “unnaturally dispose” of the testator’s assets should always be overseen by an attorney. Unnatural disposition includes cutting your family out of the will, giving all of your assets to someone that is not in your family if you have living family members and giving your assets to someone that you have not known for very long. Use an online will writing service. This type of service will automatically ensure that your will is written according to your state's requirements. [2] X Research source Online will writing services generally cost between $60 and $100, depending on how complicated your will is."

Identify yourself by name, Social Security number, and address. If you don't have a Social Security number, provide a different form of ID, such as a driver's license or state issued ID number. You may also include your date of birth to further identify yourself."

In the full declaration that follows, you need to state clearly that you are of sound mental health and of contractual capacity, and that this will expresses your last wishes. Without this important step, it could be argued that your will is not legally viable. Use this statement: “I declare that this is my last will and testament.”"

Because wills can be challenged if the testator of the will was not of sound mind (that is, the testator was suffering from dementia or another ailment that prevented him/her from understanding the effects of a will), the testator should include information in the will that proves the testator’s soundness of mind. Include this statement: “I declare that I am of legal age to make this will, and that I am sound of mind.” In addition to including the above text in the will, you may want to videotape the execution of the will to put to rest any future allegations of incapacity."

The disposition of assets in your will must be according to your wishes, and can't be the result of any type of outside influence.

The Executor is known in some states as a “personal representative.” You may also want to name a secondary executor if the first is unable to perform the duties at the time of your death. [5] X Research source The executor is the person who distributes assets and property according to your will. Because executors are so frequently asked to handle assets in a professional manner, you should ideally select an individual with a background in business or law. Increasingly, individuals are selecting professionals -- usually lawyers -- to deal with these matters rather than leaving them for a member of an already grieving family. For example: “I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint [executor's first and last name] as Executor. If this Executor is unable or unwilling to serve, then I appoint [backup executor's first and last name] as alternate Executor.” Determine if your executor should post bond. If the executor must post a bond, this will protect against fraudulent use of your estate. However, requiring the executor to post a bond can be expensive for the executor, depending on the size of your estate, and could prevent your chosen executor from serving."

Pay all of your just debts, funeral expenses, taxes and estate administration expenses. This allows your heirs to take their shares without later deductions or complications. State if your executor should post bond or serve without bond. If your executor must post a bond, the beneficiaries to the will are protected and insured if the executor fails to carry out the distribution as the will stipulates.

You may not actually be able to distribute all of your assets as you see fit, based on certain state laws and prior legal arrangements. You should consider previous legal contracts you have entered, and whether you live in a common law or community property state. In common law states, anything with only your name on the deed, registration papers or other title documentation is yours to bequeath. [7] X Research source In community property states, 50 percent of all accumulations during a marriage legally belong to a spouse, and a will can't supersede that. [8] X Research source There are nine community property states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. Alaska also allows couple to opt into a community property system if the couple so chooses. [9] X Research source Other legal documents, such as pre-nuptial or ante-nuptial agreements and living trusts, can also affect what you can legally bequeath in your will.

In many cases, the will must be signed in the presence of two witnesses, who then sign a statement asserting that you are of legal age and sound mind and that you signed your will in their presence. [12] X Research source Each state has different requirements for what constitutes a legal last will and testament. [13] X Research source The differences in requirements primarily pertain to relatively small issues in execution, such as how many witnesses are required and when those witnesses are required to swear to or sign the will or matters of notarization. Here are a few examples: In Illinois, a will must be signed by the testator and two witnesses. The witnesses should not be beneficiaries of the will. No notarization is required. In Kentucky, wills require only the signature of witnesses if the will itself has not been \"wholly\" handwritten by the testator. In these cases, the witnesses and testator must all be present together and bear witness to all signatures. [14] X Research source In Colorado, there is more than one way to make a valid will. You can have two witnesses sign, but they can do so at any time up to the execution of the will, as long as they attest to witnessing the testator sign the will or they claim to have received acknowledgement of the will from the testator before his/her death. Alternatively, the will can be signed and authorized in front of a notary, in which case no further witnesses are required. Or, as a third alternative, handwritten wills can be acknowledged by a court without need for witnesses or notarization."

It has been adopted in full by 17 states and in part by many other states. To find out whether your state adopted the UPC, check with the American Bar Association. If your will does not meet the legal requirements, it will be found invalid and any property will pass under state laws governing the distribution of assets when someone does not have a will."

In some states, if you do not change your will to account for the death of a beneficiary, the property that was supposed to go to the beneficiary automatically passes to the beneficiary’s heirs. In other states the beneficiary’s heirs do not recover the property, which is combined with the rest of the estate and distributed among the living beneficiaries. For example, if you leave your house to your sister and she dies before you, the house could go to her children. Another scenario would be that, when you die, the value of the course could be split among the still living beneficiaries."
