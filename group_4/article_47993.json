      "content": "S stands for snapstreak. If you receive an S on Snapchat, someone is using it as a brief way to tell you they’re trying to continue their streak with you. Snapstreaks convey that you’ve been Snapchatting each other regularly for 3 days or more. The person who sent you an S is telling you they don’t want this communication to end. Other shorthands for snapstreaks that mean the same thing are “strks” and “🔥🔥🔥” (since the fire symbol is often used to convey a snapstreak on the app)."

      "content": "They want to keep a conversation going. Snapstreaks are great ways to maintain contact with your friends, even if you don’t feel like having a long, meaningful talk every day. By sending S for snapstreak, someone is telling you that they’re thinking about you and don’t want this conversation to die out. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "They want to prove and maintain their friendships. Regular communication is key to maintaining friendships. Snapstreaks are a great way to keep this communication alive. Alternatively, someone may be sending you snapstreaks to prove how highly they value your friendship over others, since you can become “Best Friends” on Snapchat with regular interaction. And you can only have a limited number of “Best Friends” at a time. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Respond within a day.",
      "content": "Respond within a day. The most important part of replying to a snapstreak is sending a message back within 24 hours. If you wait longer, the streak will die and the whole purpose of the S message will be unfulfilled. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use the pen feature. A lot of people like to send S for snapstreaks by drawing it out with the pen feature instead of just typing the letter. After you’ve taken your photo, go to the top right corner, click the pen and draw an S in your favorite color!"

To make your bitmoji, swipe down on the camera screen and hit the “+” in the top-left corner. From there, you can stylize your bitmoji avatar to resemble you. Once you download the Bitmoji Keyboard app, you can add your bitmoji to your pics in all kinds of silly situations. [6] X Research source"

Because digital spaces offer so little context (we can’t see someone’s body language, we can’t hear the intonations of their voice), using tone indicators like /s prevent misinterpretation. Allies of the neurodivergent community, especially, use tone indicators to help people who struggle with nonverbal communication feel accepted. [8] X Research source"
