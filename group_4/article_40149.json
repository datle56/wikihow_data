    {
      "title": "Ask for a Sprite with cherry flavoring and vanilla cream.",
      "content": "Ask for a Sprite with cherry flavoring and vanilla cream. If you’re craving a cream soda, the Pink Lady is the perfect blend of fruity and creamy flavors. It’s a popular pink drink that's sweet, bubbly, and refreshing… What more can you ask for? [1] X Research source If you’re not a fan of cherry, ask for strawberry or raspberry flavoring instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Request a drink that’s half Cherry Limeade, half orange juice.",
      "content": "Request a drink that’s half Cherry Limeade, half orange juice. On a hot summer’s day, there’s nothing more refreshing than a Cherry Limeade… unless you combine it with tangy orange juice! The Sonic Sunrise is a fan-favorite that’s guaranteed to cool you down. Many people compare the taste to a virgin tequila sunrise (but run to your nearest location to try it out yourself). [2] X Research source If you’re more of a strawberry mimosa lover, replace the cherry limeade with a strawberry limeade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Order a Powerade slush with raspberry and lemonade.",
      "content": "Order a Powerade slush with raspberry and lemonade. Like its name, the Slap Yo Mama slush is a bit outrageous (but in the best way possible). Think of it as the cooler cousin of the Baha Blast—it’s sweet, tangy, and frosty… with added electrolytes to keep you hydrated. [3] X Research source If you want to avoid a brain freeze, order the Slap Yo Mama as a normal drink instead of a slush. Just ask for a Powerade with a splash of raspberry flavoring and lemonade."
    },
    {
      "title": "Elevate your Sprite with Powerade, cranberry juice, and lemonade.",
      "content": "Elevate your Sprite with Powerade, cranberry juice, and lemonade. To satisfy your sugar cravings, order the Purple Sprite for a sweet and fizzy refresher. If you really want to get crazy, throw in some Skittles for the ultimate sugar rush. [4] X Research source This is a popular off-menu drink, so you can probably get away with ordering it by name—but some locations call it the Purple O or Purple Passion."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for a Sprite with cherry, orange, and pineapple flavoring.",
      "content": "Ask for a Sprite with cherry, orange, and pineapple flavoring. If you can’t take a trip to the tropics, order the Pink Flamingo for a sip of paradise. This refreshing drink is the perfect blend of tropical flavors, reminiscent of palm trees, sandy beaches, and warm sun. Just close your eyes, turn on a ukulele tune, and sip away... [5] X Research source Ask them to add coconut syrup for even more flavor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Request a combination of Dr. Pepper, Powerade, and lemonade.",
      "content": "Request a combination of Dr. Pepper, Powerade, and lemonade. While the Dr. Pepper O may look (and sound) dirty, the flavor is divine. Dr. Pepper alone has 23 different flavors, but when it’s combined with Powerade and lemonade, it transforms into a soda that’s fruity, fizzy, and guaranteed to blow your mind. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Order a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your Dr. Pepper.",
      "content": "Order a scoop of vanilla ice cream in your Dr. Pepper. Thanks to the Sonic secret menu, you don’t have to reserve this American classic for the Fourth of July. The Dr. Pepper float is a creamy, carbonated drink that tastes like a dessert. If you want to elevate your float, add a splash of cherry or vanilla flavoring. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Request a chocolate shake made with ice cream and coffee.",
      "content": "Request a chocolate shake made with ice cream and coffee. If you need a pick-me-up during the day, head over to Sonic and order the Java Chiller.

[8] X Research source Make sure to ask for \"hard\" ice cream (or, ice cream that isn't soft serve)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask them to batter and deep fry some pickles.",
      "content": "Ask them to batter and deep fry some pickles. If you’re craving a salty and savory snack, order a side of Pickle-O’s instead of your usual fries. This off-menu item is popular in the South, but you can request it at any Sonic location. Since it’s deep fried, order a side of ranch to help cut through the grease. [9] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Top your tater tots with cheese, chili, onions, jalapenos, and ranch.",
      "content": "Top your tater tots with cheese, chili, onions, jalapenos, and ranch. While Sonic’s chili-cheese tots are delicious on their own, you can take them to the next level with a few extra toppings. Order extreme tots for the ultimate flavor explosion—they’re bursting with a variety of tastes, textures, and spices. [10] X Research source You can also order the “extreme” version of their fries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Request chili and cheese on top of Frito chips.",
      "content": "Request chili and cheese on top of Frito chips. Although there’s debate over where Frito pie comes from, there’s no debate that it’s one of the warmest comfort foods. Sonic’s Frito pie features a large bed of corn chips topped with savory chili and melty cheese. It’s a tasty alternative to nachos, but you can always add extra toppings for more flavor. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Add a slice of ham to elevate your grilled cheese.",
      "content": "Add a slice of ham to elevate your grilled cheese. There’s nothing more nostalgic than a toasty grilled cheese, but did you know you can make it even more delicious? For an updated version of the childhood classic, add a slice of ham to make it more filling (and now, it's the perfect sandwich for breakfast, lunch, or dinner). [12] X Research source Instead of ham, you can request bacon, or ask them to add tomato slices for a fresh burst of flavor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and onion rings.",
      "content": "Ask for a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and onion rings. If you’re looking for a hearty meal, look no further—the Ring Leader is the ultimate loaded burger. While this isn’t the best option to eat on a first date, it’s full of flavor. The Ring Leader features a hearty beef patty, a freshly-made onion ring, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes. [13] X Research source Most locations add a single onion ring free of charge, but you can always order a side of mini onion rings to make this item yourself. [14] X Research source"
