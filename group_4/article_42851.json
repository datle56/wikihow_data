      "title": "Relate percentage to everyday concepts.",
      "content": "Relate percentage to everyday concepts. Students usually start learning percentage at around age 8-10, and quite a few will already have a sense of what the concept means. Ask students where they have encountered percentages in everyday life. For example, they might have gotten 100% on a test, or maybe they've seen a 50% off sale. [1] X Research source Begin class by asking, \"Where have you seen the word 'percent' before? What does it mean?\" Come up with a list together. This can help you assess what students already know about percentage and what you need to cover."

      "title": "Explain that percent represents hundredths.",
      "content": "Explain that percent represents hundredths. [2] X Expert Source Jake Adams Academic Tutor & Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. A percentage is a fraction with a denominator of 100. Also explain that in decimal form, a percentage can be found from the first 2 digits after the decimal point. [3] X Research source As long as you have already covered fractions and decimals, this will link percentage back to a familiar concept."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the concept of a century to explain percentage as parts of a whole.",
      "content": "Use the concept of a century to explain percentage as parts of a whole. A century is a single unit of time, but within that unit, there are 100 years. This could be a useful way to help students conceptualize what the term means. [4] X Research source This can be a useful strategy for students that are more linguistically-inclined learners rather than visual learners."

    {
      "title": "Divide a square into a 10x10 grid.",
      "content": "Divide a square into a 10x10 grid. Create a grid with 10 rows and 10 columns to make a square with 100 spaces. You can use a digital version to demonstrate the concept to students on a screen and print copies for students to practice on their own. [5] X Research source You can also find hundred chart templates online. This is a useful visual for introducing young students to the concept of percentage. You can also use circle charts to demonstrate percentages."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask students to create percentage artwork using the grid.",
      "content": "Ask students to create percentage artwork using the grid. Students color each square of a 10x10 grid to create their own unique artwork. Then, have them calculate the percentage of each color on their grid. For example, if a student colored 20 squares red, they would calculate that the grid is 20% red. [6] X Research source Each square should only be one color. This is a good activity for reinforcing the concept of what percentage is for young students."

    {
      "title": "Use a hundred chart to convert between fractions, decimals, and percentage.",
      "content": "Use a hundred chart to convert between fractions, decimals, and percentage. Ask students how many squares they would have to color to fill in 50% of the chart. How do they know? Explain that each row is 10% of the chart, and ask them to convert that to decimal notation. [7] X Research source Do some exercises to reinforce the links between fractions, decimals, and percentage. For example, ask the students to color .47 of the chart, or 1/4 of the chart and convert those numbers to percentages."
    },
    {
      "title": "Double the grid to understand percentages over 100.",
      "content": "Double the grid to understand percentages over 100. Students may struggle to understand percentages over 100. Use 2 charts to explain the concept. If 1 chart is 100%, 2 charts are 200%. They will be able to visualize that 200% represents something doubling. [8] X Research source Reinforce that 100%=1/1, so 200%=2/1."

      "title": "Have students practice representing percents on a strip diagram.",
      "content": "Have students practice representing percents on a strip diagram. To create a strip diagram, or percentage bar, simply draw a long rectangle. Ask students to estimate where certain percentages fall on the bar. For example, have students draw a line in the middle to represent 50%. [9] X Research source This format may be familiar to students who see it represented in battery power. For example, an iPad with 50% battery will show a rectangle half filled in. You can use this method to introduce the concept of how percent, decimals, and fractions are related."

    {
      "title": "Have students quickly convert decimals to percentages.",
      "content": "Have students quickly convert decimals to percentages. Students can convert decimals to percentages by moving the decimal point 2 spaces to the right. Demonstrate this by using an arrow to show the decimal point moving over. For example, show the students that .32 is the same thing as 32%. [10] X Research source [11] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. Have students convert a few decimals into percentages and vice versa on their own."

      "title": "Show students easy-to-remember percentage-to-fraction conversions.",
      "content": "Show students easy-to-remember percentage-to-fraction conversions. Make a poster that shows a few easy conversions so that students can reference it quickly. Tell them to use it to quickly solve problems. For example, if students need to find 25% of a number, they can reference the chart to see that this is the same as finding 1/4 of a number. This way, students will start to make the association between fractions and percentages. This can also be a good reference for older students. You can include: [12] X Research source 25%=25/100=1/4 50%=50/100=1/2 75%=75/100=3/4 10%=10/100=1/10 20%=20/100=1/5"

      "title": "Tell students to think \"out of 100\" when they see percentage problems.",
      "content": "Tell students to think \"out of 100\" when they see percentage problems. When students see percentage in a word problem, tell them to immediately write the number as a fraction out of 100. Students are often used to having 3 numbers to work with to find a fourth. Writing a percentage as a fraction will give them another number to work with. [13] X Research source For example, if a word problem asks students to find out what 60 percent of 20, they will immediately write 60/100. This is a strategy that is helpful for middle school students (around ages 10-13)."
