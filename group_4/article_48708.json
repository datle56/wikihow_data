      "content": "You might struggle with self-esteem or insecurities. One of the key signs of a narcissist is their controlling behavior, telling their partner how to look, where they can go, and what they can do. They might be attracted to you because they think your lack of confidence makes you easier to manipulate. Narcissists tend to love bomb you, or overwhelm you with displays of love and affection, to hook you in. This plays into your insecurities and makes you feel worthy. Anyone can fall victim to a narcissist, so don’t blame yourself. They are expert observers who take advantage of the smallest cracks in your confidence. Be aware of your negative thoughts to help improve your self-esteem . If you think “I’m stupid and can’t do anything right,” pair your thought with a positive one that refutes it. For example, think or write down, “I’m good at my job. I helped Janet write the computer code she was struggling with today.” Most importantly, know that you are worthy of a healthy and positive relationship. If you deal with insecurity, you might find yourself attracted to narcissists. You might enjoy the overwhelming affection they give you at first because it makes you feel valued. Narcissists are actually deeply insecure themselves, and use their manipulation and controlling behaviors to cover it up and project a self-important front."

      "content": "You might deal with codependent tendencies. People who struggle with codependency tend to seek out validation from their partner and cling to them for support. They often lose themselves in their partner despite their own needs and how they’re treated because they fear abandonment. So, a narcissist might be attracted to you if they think they can treat you poorly and you’ll still stick around to nurture them. [1] X Research source People with codependent tendencies often grew up in homes where love was conditional or earned, so don’t be hard on yourself.

      "title": "You tend to people please.",
      "content": "You tend to people please. People pleasers typically put others’ happiness over their own, often because they don’t think they deserve it. They’ll give and give without asking for anything in return while a narcissist just takes. If a narcissist thinks you’ll dote on them and not advocate for yourself, they might be attracted to you. [2] X Research source It’s not a bad thing to be selfless, but it’s important to put yourself first . Say “No” to things when your plate is full and ask for help when you’re struggling."

      "content": "You have a family member or ex who was narcissistic. If you grew up with a narcissistic parent or had a long-term relationship with a narcissist, they likely chipped away at your boundaries and ability to stand up for yourself. Because of your experience, you might tolerate a narcissist's behavior more. These traits are all highly attractive to a narcissist, who takes advantage of your trauma to lure you in. Growing up with a narcissist also tends to lower your self-esteem. While you might get down on yourself, recognize how resilient you are. Low self-esteem is often a coping mechanism that helps you deal with and survive your situation. Talk to a therapist to work through your experiences with a narcissist. They can help you come up with long-term goals and solutions to deal with your pain. You might also be attracted to narcissists because of your prior experiences with one. A narcissist's behaviors can feel comforting or even safe because they're what you’re used to."

      "title": "You’re empathetic.",
      "content": "You’re empathetic. Even though narcissists lack empathy, they are drawn to the attention and validation that a sensitive person gives them. If you’re empathetic, you’re probably a great listener who feels deeply for people and understands where they’re coming from. When a narcissist senses this, they see someone who feeds into their delusions of grandeur, or belief that they're superior, and whose sole purpose is to make them feel important. [3] X Research source Empathy is an amazing quality to have, so don’t feel bad about sympathizing with a narcissist. Knowing the signs of a narcissist can help you stay away and stop you from falling into their trap. Empathetic people are often attracted to narcissists because they get validation from being helpful. A narcissist might rope you in with phrases like, “You’re the only one who understands me,” and, “I don’t know anyone else like you.”"

      "content": "You’re good-looking and successful. A narcissist believes they’re the most fascinating, important, and attractive person in the room. They often treat people as an extension of themselves, so they like to associate with and be around people who have status. If you’re doing well for yourself, know influential people, and appear put together, narcissists might cozy up to you to steal your shine. [5] X Research source Narcissists are often charming themselves and full of flattery in the beginning stages of a relationship.

      "title": "Set clear and firm boundaries for behaviors you won’t tolerate.",
      "content": "Set clear and firm boundaries for behaviors you won’t tolerate. If you’re not used to setting boundaries , it can be difficult at first. Recognize that your needs are valid and important first and foremost. Then, think about what is important to you and what you can’t accept. Use clear, firm language and “I” statements to communicate your boundary to your narcissist. Then, let them know what happens if they violate it. For example, say “I don’t want you to come over to my house without texting me first. If you don’t text me, I’m not answering the door or going anywhere with you. I need you to respect my time like I respect yours.” Lots of narcissists don’t initially take no for an answer, so they might push you on your boundaries. Keep your cool, stay firm in your resolve, and tell them, “No.” Establish boundaries in your daily life to make them easier to do. Tell your coworker that you won’t respond to emails after 5:00, or a friend that you can’t come over on weekdays. Someone who loves and respects you won’t keep pushing or violating your boundaries. If your narcissist can’t honor your wishes, it might be time to reconsider the relationship."

Narcissists typically compliment you profusely, shower you with gifts, and declare their love early on. Then, they keep up their charming appearance in public, but in private criticize and devalue you. When you confront or criticize them, they tend to grow angry, depressed, or spin it on you to make you feel guilty.

[8] X Research source When you get to know a date , ask about their future goals, interests, their past, their family, and what they’re searching for in a relationship.
