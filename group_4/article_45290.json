To send “Hey, how’s everyone doing?” in green, you’d type \"text\":\"Hey, how’s everyone doing?\",\"color\":\"green\" . [5] X Research source Use “@p” to only send the message to the closest player, “@r” to send the message to a random player, and “@s” to send the message to just yourself. [6] X Research source If you’d like to customize your text color even more, copy your desired hex code color from a hex code site and paste it into the “color” portion of the code. Ex: /tellraw @a {\"text\":\"I love apples\",\"color\":\"#f2715d\" } Tip: Make sure that the buttons on your Console Command are set to Impulse , Unconditional , and Needs Redstone ."
