      "content": "It’s a Japanese tale about a girl who finds a white string in her piercing. As the story goes, a young girl once longed to get her ears pierced. Her parents gave her money to see a professional piercer, but the girl decided to pocket the money and had a friend to pierce her ears instead. The day after, the girl’s ear felt itchy and painful, and she noticed a white string sticking out of it. As she pulled, the girl found that the string didn’t have an end; it just kept going. She grabbed a pair of scissors and snipped off the string to get rid of the excess—and lost her vision immediately. Later, she learned that the \"string\" she cut was actually her optic nerve, which is why she went blind. [1] X Research source In one variation of this urban legend, the person in question found a white string sticking out of their nipple piercing. When they snipped the string, they experienced terrible pain, fell unconscious, and defecated themselves unknowingly. (They didn’t go blind, though.) [2] X Research source"

Optic nerve issues can impact your vision, but they don’t manifest as a white string dangling from your ear. Some optic nerve disorders include glaucoma, optic neuritis, optic nerve head drusen, and optic nerve atrophy.
