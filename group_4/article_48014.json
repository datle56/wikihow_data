      "content": "On TikTok, \"talking with teeth” means showing teeth when you talk. The phrase is usually expanded to specify talking with your top or bottom teeth. According to TikTok, you’re considered a top teeth talker if your top row of teeth show when you talk. If the opposite is true, you’re considered a bottom teeth talker. [1] X Research source These are not official dental conditions or terms. They were made up on TikTok to describe a random feature. While people have always shown teeth while talking, in 2022 and 2024, TikTokers turned \"talking with teeth” into a beauty standard. Users expressed preferences for or insecurities about talking with top versus bottom teeth."

      "content": "The \"top or bottom teeth talking” trend first went viral in 2022. User @lifecrisisinducedglowup posted a now-deleted video to TikTok with the text, \"Megan Fox taught me to speak with my bottom teeth.” [2] X Research source Other users decided talking with your bottom teeth showing was attractive and expressed insecurity if they were a top teeth talker. Some users compared talking with your top teeth to having \"American Girl Doll teeth.” American Girl dolls have painted, half-open mouths that show two perfect, white front teeth. In 2021, having American Girl Doll teeth became a beauty standard on TikTok. [3] X Research source Users tried to show their top, central two teeth while holding their mouth slightly open, either considering it attractive or making fun of the dolls."

      "content": "The teeth talking debate resurfaced in 2024. A TikTok of Megan Fox appearing on the podcast \"Call Her Daddy” went viral in May 2024. Users once again fixated on how her bottom teeth showed when she talked. [4] X Research source However, users decided this time that being a top teeth talker is more desirable because it makes you look more youthful. This reversal from 2022 caused some TikTok users and journalists to reflect on the arbitrary, fickle nature of TikTok beauty standards."

      "content": "Record yourself lip-syncing to \"Hide Away” by Daya. On TikTok, users lip-sync to see which teeth show when they talk. In the app, record yourself lip-syncing or singing along to the chorus of Daya’s song \"Hide Away.” Watch the recording and note whether your top or bottom teeth show more. This will tell you which teeth talker you are. [5] X Research source User @ashlynkskaar suggested in a TikTok that the difference between being a top and bottom teeth talker is whether or not you’re smiling. Some users find that both rows of their teeth show equally. They call themselves \"middle teeth talkers.” Remember, talking with your top or bottom teeth doesn’t matter—it’s a made-up beauty standard. Don’t let TikTokers’ opinions make you feel insecure about how you talk."

      "content": "Many English-language idioms involve teeth. Talking with teeth isn’t one of them, but there are several sayings that involve teeth. Some are abstract, while others refer to literal teeth movements. See common examples below. Talking with teeth clenched: Clenched teeth indicate anger. When you read or hear that someone was talking with their teeth clenched, it usually means they were seething or angry. However, talking with your teeth held together might also indicate frustration or pain. [9] X Research source Lying through your teeth: When you lie through your teeth, you’re lying to someone knowing that what you’re saying is a complete falsehood. [10] X Research source Like pulling teeth: If you say completing a task is like pulling teeth, it means it’s difficult and even painful. If you say getting someone to do something is like pulling teeth, it indicates they’re resistant and uncooperative. [11] X Research source Cut your teeth on: When you say you cut your teeth on something, you’re saying that was your earliest training or experience with that thing. For example, you could say you cut your teeth on student theater before appearing in Broadway musicals. [12] X Research source Show your teeth: Showing your teeth is a metaphor for showing your force, anger, or strength. When you say a competitor showed their teeth, you’re indicating that they were aggressive or surprisingly threatening. [13] X Research source Long in the tooth: Calling someone long in the tooth is an informal way of saying they are old. It can also refer to things. For example, a long-running TV show may be described as long in the tooth."
