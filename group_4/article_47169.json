It should be small enough that you can hold it in your hands and hold it up to your face. If you are sick, or feeling nauseous, make sure you are prepared. Keep a bucket near where you are resting. At the very least, make sure it is easily accessible. If you have kids who might vomit, putting the bucket near the bed is a good bit of preparation in case they can't make it to the bathroom. Make sure your children knows what the bucket is for, so they are prepared if they need it. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Hold the bucket up to your face. If possible, you want the bucket at a level that will allow you to keep your head facing forward. While most people will want to tilt their head downward, this makes it more likely that you'll get vomit into your nasal passages. That's an uncomfortable complement to already getting sick. This is a great advantage to using a bucket instead of a toilet."

      "title": "Clean out your bucket.",
      "content": "Clean out your bucket. Once you have finished vomiting, you'll need to clean out the bucket. Vomit, like other bodily fluids, can contain germs that lead to infection. Dump the vomit into a toilet and flush away. Use soap and water to rinse out whatever is left in the bucket. Use paper towels to wipe up anything else, and throw them away when you are finished. You can also use a 1:10 bleach solution (1 cup of bleach mixed with 9 cups of water) to disinfect further. If you do this, make sure to keep the mixture on the bucket for 10 minutes, and keep the room well ventilated. Do not mix with any other cleaning agents. It may be easier to line the bucket with a trash bag before vomiting. A used plastic grocery bag works just fine. Simply line the bucket with the bag, and after vomiting, simply toss the bag in the trash. Great for quick cleanups, and less odor accumulation, since you may replace the bag anytime. Make sure the bag has no holes in it. If you are still feeling sick, and not able to fully clean out the bucket, get away from it. Vomit has a pretty strong smell, which can trigger you into vomiting again. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

Applying occasional pressure to the P-6 pressure point on your wrist, can help lessen nausea and vomiting. [4] X Research source With the palm of one hand facing up, place the first three fingers of your other hand over the wrist while feeling for the two large tendons under the thumb. The point you seek is about three finger lengths below your wrist. Apply pressure to the point using a circular motion while making sure you are pushing down on the point. This should not cause any pain or discomfort and you can continue to apply pressure for two or three minutes. Repeat on your other wrist. Locate the pressure point on your other wrist, then apply pressure in a circular motion for a couple of minutes."
