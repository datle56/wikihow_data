      "content": "Check to see if your phone is already unlocked . Many phones, such as 4G LTE phones from Verizon or the bulk of Androids, are carrier unlocked as soon as you purchase them. Additionally, many carriers will unlock a phone for you as soon as you meet the unlock criteria. If you purchased a phone from eBay or a similar distributor, there's a decent chance that your phone is already carrier unlocked."

      "content": "Verify that you meet your carrier's unlocking criteria. In addition to being an unlock-compatible phone that's licensed to your carrier (e.g., if it's a Verizon phone, you have to unlock it through Verizon), you must meet the following criteria for the following carriers: Verizon - Verizon doesn't lock most modern phones. If your phone is locked for some reason, you can call Verizon customer support to have them unlock your phone for you. [1] X Research source Sprint - Your phone must be active for at least 50 days, and you must own the phone (e.g., it has to be paid in full). The phone also must not be reported as lost, stolen, blocked, or involved in illegal activity. [2] X Research source AT&T - Your phone must not be reported to AT&T as lost, stolen, blocked, or involved in illegal activity. Your phone also must have been completely paid off, and it must have been on the AT&T network for a minimum of 60 days (prepaid phones have to be active for at least 6 months instead). [3] X Research source T-Mobile - Your phone must not be reported to T-Mobile as lost, stolen, or blocked, your account must be up-to-date with payments, and you must not have requested more than two unlock codes from T-Mobile in the last 12 months. If your phone is pre-paid, you must have had the phone active for a year, while phones on payment plans must have been on the plan for at least 40 days. If you're in the military and you need to unlock your phone due to deployment overseas, you can provide any carrier with your paperwork and ask them to unlock your phone on the spot—most carriers have a military policy, and in some places they're legally obligated to unlock your phone anyway."
