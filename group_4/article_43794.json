      "content": "Hair thinning is extremely common in adult males—about 85% of men experience hair loss by the time they’re 50 years old, and many start to lose hair before they turn 21. [1] X Research source This hair loss generally starts as a receding hairline, thinning of the hair, or a bald spot on the crown of the skull. The most common type of hair loss is male pattern baldness (also known as male androgenetic alopecia), which is related to hormones and genetics—although there are many different causes and risk factors involved in hair thinning. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When it comes to treatments for hair thinning , many people view it as a natural part of the aging process, leaving it untreated and unhidden. However, others may choose to cover up their thinning hair with different products, headpieces, or hairstyles . Or, they’ll choose to treat it directly with medication or natural remedies. Before seeking treatment for hair thinning, speak with your primary care physician about the root causes of your hair loss and the best treatment and prevention options for you."

      "title": "Male hair thinning is generally caused by age, genetics, or hormone levels.",
      "content": "Male hair thinning is generally caused by age, genetics, or hormone levels. “Male pattern baldness is usually genetic,” says Foster. Almost all hair loss in men is attributed to male-pattern baldness, which is passed down from parents and occurs in predictable patterns—generally, beginning with a receding hairline and bald spots. While the exact cause of hair loss in men isn’t known, we know that it involves androgens (i.e., testosterone), the hormones responsible for controlling post-puberty bodily processes (including hair growth) in males. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Alternatively, certain medical conditions and drugs may cause hair loss. Conditions like alopecia areata, diabetes, and lupus may lead to hair thinning—although these are more rare than male pattern baldness. Drugs used to treat cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, gout, and high blood pressure may also cause hair loss. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other lifestyle and risk factors associated with hair thinning include: [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Smoking Poor nutrition Lack of sleep Vitamin deficiency (e.g., iron, folic acid, B vitamins) Chronic or intense stress Significant and sudden weight loss Hot-oil hair treatments and permanents Use of chemical hair products (i.e., hair sprays and gels) Excessive exposure to heat, sunlight, UV rays, or air pollution Hairstyles that pull your hair tight (i.e., pigtails, buns, and cornrows) Wearing hats, beanies, helmets, and other headwear These factors are more likely to cause temporary thinning that can be reversed."

      "content": "Signs of thinning hair include gradual thinning or patchy bald spots on the head. The exact symptoms of hair loss depend on the root cause. That said, the most common sign of general hair loss is a gradual thinning on the top of the head, beginning with a recession at the front hairline. You may also see circular or patchy bald spots or a sudden loosening of hair coming out in handfuls. However, hair falling out in bunches is usually caused by a physical or emotional stressor, so this type of hair thinning is generally temporary and may be reversed. [6] X Research source In most cases, after these initial signs of thinning hair , male pattern baldness proceeds through the following stages: [7] X Research source Stage 1: Little-to-no hair loss or hairline recession. Stage 2: Slight hair loss near the skin between your ears and temples. Stage 3: Hairline recession around the temples, creating an “M” or “U” shape. Stage 4: Very deep hairline recession with a circle of hair loss at the crown. Stage 5: Hairline recession connects to the bald spot on the crown. Stage 6 : Hair between the temples and crown is thinning or gone. Stage 7: No hair left atop the head and a thin band of hair on the sides."

      "title": "Medical treatments for hair thinning reversal include topical drugs, injections, & more.",
      "content": "Medical treatments for hair thinning reversal include topical drugs, injections, & more. Foster recommends “visiting a dermatologist to determine the type of hair loss that you have. They can then administer steroid shots or topical creams like a Rogaine or Minoxidil.” Minoxidil (Rogaine) is one of the most common treatments for hair thinning—it’s FDA-approved to slow the rate of loss and can encourage new hair growth. [8] X Research source It’s applied to the scalp twice a day but once you stop using it, hair loss will return. [9] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Here are some other medical treatment options for hair loss: Medications: Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) is a testosterone pill that slows hair loss, although the thinning will return once you cease use. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You'll need a prescription from a doctor to start using Finasteride. Platelet-rich plasma injections: High concentrations of your blood are injected into your scalp, which may help to reduce hair loss-inducing hormones or inflammation. [11] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Laser therapy: Laser technology (administered by a doctor) can “penetrate a laser into the scalp to regenerate and stimulate the follicle or hair root to restart it in the same way you would restart a car,” explains Foster. Transplants: A surgical hair transplant can graft new and healthy follicles onto your scalp. A doctor will “take active follicles and roots from one section of the hair and transplant them into the dormant section to see if that will help to restart the growth,” says Foster. Micro-scalp pigmentation: Another medical but non-invasive option suggested by Foster is scalp pigmentation, which involves “hairline strokes that are drawn in the areas of hair loss.”"

      "content": "You can also try at-home treatments like shampoos, scalp massages, and more. One of the best ways to treat and prevent further hair thinning is to “maintain moisture and shampoo often,” affirms Foster. Look for a shampoo that’s specifically labeled as anti-thinning—these products are formulated to add volume to your hair and nourish its follicles with vitamins and amino acids. These added nutrients and moisture can promote hair growth and follicle health in your scalp. [12] X Research source Other natural and at-home treatments for hair thinning include: Scalp massages: Foster advises to “vigorously massage your scalp to increase blood circulation.” Apply castor oil to your hands and gently use your fingertips to apply pressure to your scalp. Essential oils: Some studies show that essential oils like lavender oil , peppermint oil , and rosemary oil can promote hair growth when applied to your scalp. [13] X Research source Foster recommends “a mix of rosemary or black seed oil with olive oil or almond oil.” Before application, dilute the essential oil with a carrier oil and do a patch test by placing a small drop on your skin and waiting 24 hours. If your skin turns red or itchy, avoid further use. Vitamins: There isn’t definitive evidence that vitamin supplements prevent thinning hair, but they’re worth a try as long as you talk to a doctor first. Once you get the green light, look for supplements containing vitamins A, B, C, D, E, zinc, iron, and folic acid—like this highly-rated men’s multivitamin from Vimerson Health. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Topical supplements: You can also try an over-the-counter treatment from your local pharmacy (although these may be less effective than medical interventions). For instance, The Ordinary (a popular skincare brand) sells a Multi-Peptide Serum for Hair Density . [15] X Research source Diet: Eating an adequate amount of nutritious foods can help with overall health and hair loss. Eat 40–60 grams (1.4–2.1 oz) of protein a day. Eat balanced meals with plenty of leafy greens, mushrooms, egg yolks, and fish. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Try different hair systems or colored sprays to cover thinning hair. “If you have a type of hair loss that…cannot grow back, then you can look into protective stylings like wigs, weaves, hair replacements, and things of that nature,” says Foster. Wigs, toupees, and scalp sprays get a bit of a bad rap, but modern technologies have vastly improved the quality of these hairpieces. You just want to be sure to find one that matches your natural hair color, thickness, and curl level. Here are a few of the best options for hiding or covering your thinning hair : Wigs and toupees : Wigs and toupees can cover large areas of thinning hair, and they’re made of natural hair that can be matched to your hair color. [17] X Research source Crown weave: A barber or hairstylist can give you a crown weave to cover up some of the thinning on the top of your head.

      "content": "Disguise thinning hair with styles like comb-overs, slick-backs, or buzz cuts. Comb-overs , slick-backs , and pompadours are all hairstyles that can be styled to add volume to your hair and cover thinning areas in the back or front of the head. If you’re not sure which style would work for you, try moving your hair around different parts of your head to see how best you can cover up your thinning hair with the hair you still have. [19] X Research source Alternatively, consider just buzzing your hair short or completely shaving off your hair. Many people prefer the buzzed look, so “most men choose to just shave all of their hair off instead of having that…halo of hair,” according to Foster. If you don’t want to actually change your haircut or hairstyle, you can try different hair colors and accessories to complement or distract from your thin hair. For example, glasses, facial hair, tattoos, or piercings may help to balance out your thinning hair. If you have a buzz cut or some hair left, Foster recommends “coloring it red…or blonde…or doing a nice design in the hair.” “If you have a beard,” continues Foster, “make sure the beard is lined-up, shaped, combed, and trimmed. When you’re bald, the focus is your beard. If your beard is not well-kept, then you won’t look well-kept.” Reader Poll: We asked 162 wikiHow readers who are experiencing hair loss, and 77% said that the first new style they'll try is a shaved head.

      "content": "Keep the hair you have by making healthy lifestyle choices and protecting your scalp. “If hair loss is due to hereditary issues,” states Foster, “there’s really nothing you can do to avoid it because it’s starting within the body.” This includes baldness caused by male-pattern baldness or alopecia. However, further thinning of the hair can be prevented or diminished by following certain guidelines that protect your hair and improve your overall health. Here are some of the best prevention tips for thinning hair : Be gentle with your hair. When brushing or combing, use a detangler and avoid tugging. Use a wet brush when your hair is wet. Consider a wide-toothed comb to prevent pulling out your hair. Avoid “shampooing too often…[or using] the wrong ingredients for your scalp type,” says Foster. Avoid harsh treatments like hot rollers, blow drying, curling irons, hot-oil treatments, and permanents. If you do choose to apply heat to your hair, use a heat protectant first. Limit tension-creating styles like slick-backs, pigtails, ponytails, buns, braids, and cornrows. “Pulling, tight ponytails, tight styles, and chemicals—avoid a prolonged use of these to minimize the possibility of hair loss,” Foster recommends. Protect your scalp from sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light by using a hair sunscreen and wearing hats while out in the sun, suggests Foster. Stop smoking . Some studies point to cigarette smoking as a risk factor that increases the chance of baldness in men. [20] X Research source Find ways to cope with stress , advises Foster. Get outside, say positive affirmations , or practice meditation and yoga . Stress and anxiety can disrupt normal hormone processes and follicle-cycling, which may in turn lead to hair loss."

      "content": "Visit a doctor for a diagnosis if you experience sudden or patchy hair loss. Hair loss (also known as male pattern baldness or alopecia) doesn’t usually present a medical issue. In most cases, it’s not harmful for your physical health but may affect your self-esteem and feelings about your appearance. If you’re feeling upset by your hair loss and want to pursue treatment, you can reach out to a medical professional for diagnosis and support. Your doctor may order blood work or other tests to determine the root cause of your hair loss. They may also use a densitometer to examine your scalp or ask about your family history of hair loss. Most likely, they’ll then prescribe a treatment to help with your hair loss. [21] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In some cases, thinning hair can be a sign of a more serious underlying issue. Seek medical help as soon as possible if you notice: Losing large amounts of hair anywhere besides your head. Losing hair in patches or chunks. Losing hair in atypical patterns (i.e., rapid hair loss, widespread shedding, hair breakage). Losing hair after starting a new medicine. Inexplicably losing or gaining an abnormal amount of weight. Chills, fever, or fatigue. Itching, skin irritation, redness, scaling, or pain. Here are some questions you can ask your doctor to learn more about your hair loss: How can you tell that I have male pattern baldness? If I don’t have male pattern baldness, why is my hair falling out? What treatments or medications do you recommend? What side effects may be expected for medications and treatments? What else can I do to keep the hair I still have? Do you recommend that I see a dermatologist or plastic surgeon?"
