      "content": "Implement a marketing strategy. Your success as a business will depend on how you relate to your customers and potential customers Define your core values as a brand . What are three words your customers should think of when they think of your business? You might think of words like \"honest,\"\"loyal,\" and \"dependable.\" [7] X Research source Print eye-catching flyers . You can place them in places where lots of customers might congregate, such as gyms, civic centers, office parks, and the parking lots at universities and college campuses. Establish a loyalty program . You might offer your customers a free oil change after they come to see you for another service (like an engine repair or heating/air conditioning repair).

      "content": "Make alliances with car dealerships. Some car dealers have their own mechanical shops attached to their businesses, but others don't. You should consider approaching dealers and asking them if they could refer customers to your business.

      "title": "Define the scope of your business.",
      "content": "Define the scope of your business. Opening your business plan with its scope provides a general idea of how many customers you will serve and on what scale you will serve them. How many cars do you plan to service in a day and how many staff members will you take on? Will you only offer a specialized service, such as oil changes and tire repairs, or will you offer a more comprehensive range of repairs? Will you buy a currently operating car repair shop or start a brand new one from scratch? What are the costs and benefits of each of these options? Do you plan to remain an independent repair shop or will you join a franchise like Jiffy Lube or Midas? You will generally need $30,000-$200,000 to join a franchise, but the advantage is that they will handle marketing and they often have a nationally trusted brand name for potential customers. If you do not have any existing customers in your current career that you know would follow you to a new business, joining a franchise might be worth the investment."

      "content": "Describe potential locations. Your business plan will be shaped by the potential locations for your car repair shop. Leasing a current repair shop might be cheaper than buying one or building one from the ground up. [9] X Research source Look for locations that are convenient to either highway or main road access. If your shop is very isolated, it is unlikely customers will come to you, especially when towing costs are often tallied by the mile. Your location should also be able to accommodate an office for you to take care of your administrative needs and a waiting room area for your customers."

      "content": "Determine your equipment needs. The price of equipment will most likely be your largest cost after the cost of the location.

      "content": "Detail your sources of funding. With the cost of equipment, insurance, rent , and payment for your staff, you will probably need somewhere between $50,000-$100,000 to open your business, depending on your location. You should clearly detail any loans your plan to apply for in order to fund your business? Will you apply for a business loan from your bank, from the Small Business Administration, or from another source? To get approved, you must have a healthy financial history (with good credit, no history of bankruptcy) and be able to demonstrate that you have roughly 70% of the funding already raised. [10] X Research source If you are denied a loan from the Small Business Administration or your local bank, then you could consider other lenders like OnDeck and Kabbage if you need cash quickly. These lenders are meant for short-term loans because their interest rates are very high. [11] X Research source If you choose to take a loan from friends or family members, still put the repayment terms of this loan in writing. You do not want to risk losing relationships in the event that you cannot repay the loan in a timely manner."

      "content": "Define your Unique Selling Point. Most importantly, you should clearly state in your business plan what your shop will provide that no other shop in your area does. Will you provide the lowest prices, the fastest turnaround, or the best customer service? Why should a customer pick your business over your competitors? You can also consider if you will specialize in a niche field, like restoring old cars, or providing environmentally friendly or \"green\" services to your customers.

[15] X Research source You should only do this if you get to the point where your first branch runs smoothly on a daily basis. Make sure you have reliable and capable managers to help you. If you still have to run daily demands by yourself, then it might not be the best time to expand."
