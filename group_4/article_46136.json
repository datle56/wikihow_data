      "content": "Make sure the incantation you want to use is in your inventory. You can't cast a spell that you don't have. You can buy them from NPCs, find them in prayer books, or loot them from enemies! Incantations have varying ranges and effects, so take that into mind before casting a short-range spell when you intend to stand far away. You might want to level up your Faith and Mind stats first. Many spells have requirements that prevent classes not predisposed to magic from casting incants. However, Elden Ring is created in such a way that anyone can level any stat. Prophet and Confessor are the only classes that start with a Seal and incantations. Faith should aim for level 60 to deal maximum damage from incantations and Mind should be at level 40, to increase your Mana pool."

Only Prophet and Confessor classes have a Sacred Seal when they start the game. Each Seal has pros and cons that you need to consider before using it. For example, the Gravel Stone Seal boosts Dragon Cult incantations, so it's not useful if you're not casting those spells."

The buttons for this vary depending on your setup: For PC, press â†‘ to select an incantation and click the left mouse button. For PS5, press the Left and Right buttons on the D-pad to cycle through your equipment and select the incantation you want to use, then press the right bumper to cast your spell. For Xbox, use the upper button on the D-pad to select an incantation and hit R1 to cast it. [1] X Research source"
