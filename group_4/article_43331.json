      "title": "Make note of how she talks about her future plans.",
      "content": "Make note of how she talks about her future plans. When she’s talking about what she wants to do with her life, career, or general future, pay attention to whether or not she includes you in her plans. If she does, there’s a good chance that she’s interested in a relationship and sees you being a part of her life for a long time. [1] X Research source If she doesn’t, though, don’t worry. She might be nervous about including you in her plans without talking to you about it first."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about whether or not she asks you deep questions.",
      "content": "Think about whether or not she asks you deep questions. Women are pretty good at getting to know others because they know exactly what questions to ask. Make note of when she asks about your career plans, your ideal future family, or your hopes and dreams. These are all signs that she wants to see if your future and hers are compatible. [2] X Research source Listen for questions like “How many kids do you want?” or “Do you believe in marriage?” She might also ask questions about your relationship with your family, your previous romantic relationships, or your general beliefs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask yourself if you think that she has opened up to you.",
      "content": "Ask yourself if you think that she has opened up to you. Along with asking questions comes answering questions! If she’s told you about her beliefs, past relationships, and family, she’s probably very comfortable with you and sees you as someone she can trust. While this is normal for friends, it can be a sign that she’s open to something deeper. [3] X Research source This is especially true if she’s shared stories that are very meaningful, or even painful, for her to discuss. If she feels comfortable talking about topics that make her emotional around you, it’s a good sign that she sees you as someone who is emotionally supportive."

    {
      "title": "Recognize if she gets tongue-tied or nervous around you.",
      "content": "Recognize if she gets tongue-tied or nervous around you. Sometimes, you can tell if she likes you by paying attention to how she talks, in addition to what she’s saying. If she trips over her words when she’s looking at you, or seems flustered, it’s a pretty good sign that she likes you. [4] X Research source If she’s telling an embarrassing story or a funny joke, she might blush when she looks at you, or forget what she was saying."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notice if she touches your hands, hair, or arms.",
      "content": "Notice if she touches your hands, hair, or arms. Lingering touch is a huge sign that a woman is interested in you! If she reaches out to touch your hand while you’re talking, offers to fix your hair, or brushes her hand against your arm, she might think of you in a romantic way. [5] X Research source If you aren’t comfortable with being touched, simply let her know that it makes you uncomfortable and you’d like her to stop. If she’s a good friend, she’ll respect your boundaries. Some women are naturally flirty. Try to pay attention to her around other people to see if she touches them in the same way. If she does, she might just be a flirtatious person!"

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to whether or not she wants to take care of you.",
      "content": "Pay attention to whether or not she wants to take care of you. When women are interested in someone, they normally go out of their way to be helpful toward them. If she offers to help you with things around the house, gets you a small gift, or wants to get dinner for you, she probably views you as a romantic interest. [6] X Research source If you’re also interested in her, be sure to thank her and try to reciprocate her kindness by being helpful, as well! If you aren’t interested in her romantically, try to politely decline her offers, but thank her for her kindness. You could say something like, “That’s okay, I think I have it under control, but thanks so much for offering!”"

      "title": "Make note of whether she’s laughing and smiling while she’s around you.",
      "content": "Make note of whether she’s laughing and smiling while she’s around you. Although she might laugh and smile around her other friends, pay attention to whether she’s consistently happy and giggling around you. She might be trying to flirt with you, or show you that you make her happy! [7] X Research source [8] X Expert Source Christina Jay, NLP Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 11 February 2020. She might even laugh at jokes that you make that aren’t particularly funny. If she’s laughing when no one else is, it’s a good sign that she likes you."

      "title": "Consider whether she notices and remembers things that you say to her.",
      "content": "Consider whether she notices and remembers things that you say to her. While some women are really great listeners, if she’s interested in you, she’ll go the extra mile and make note of the things that are important to you. When you’re hanging out, she might say something like “Oh, that green shirt is so nice, and it’s your favorite color!” [9] X Research source If she’s really serious about you, she might even get you a small gift that has to do with one of your interests or a story that you told her."

    {
      "title": "Wait for her to introduce you to her family.",
      "content": "Wait for her to introduce you to her family. For a woman, introducing a love interest to her family is a huge step because it signifies that she’s serious about her relationship with you. If she asks for you to meet her family, or invites you to events where her family might be, she’s trying to tell you that she thinks you’re special enough to meet them! [10] X Research source If you aren’t ready for a serious relationship, politely decline the invitation. Say something like “I don’t think I’m ready to meet your family right now, but I’m really glad that you thought to invite me.” She might ask you to come to dinner with them, or come to a family event if you already know her parents because you’ve been friends for a while. This is also a pretty good sign that she’s interested in a relationship with you, since you’ll be her “date” for the event or dinner."

      "title": "Decide whether you want the same things from your relationship.",
      "content": "Decide whether you want the same things from your relationship. One of the most important steps of moving from a friendship to a relationship is deciding if you want the same things. Ask yourself if you’re ready to be in a committed relationship, and if you’re really interested in her as a person. Try not to put yourself in a situation where you might change your mind in the future. [11] X Research source It’s also really important to know what kind of relationship you want if you’re planning to ask her out. If you want to go out casually before getting serious, be sure to make that clear by saying something like, “Would you like to go on a few dates to see where things go?” If you’re just interested in a physical relationship, be honest with her. Some girls will be okay with a “friends with benefits” situation, while others definitely won’t."

      "title": "Ask her on a date",
      "content": "Ask her on a date if you do want to get into a relationship. If she’s expressing her interest in you in a few different ways, it’s pretty safe to ask her on a date. Remember to be respectful and honest about your intentions, and tell her how you feel about her. [12] X Research source You can say something like, “I think you’re really sweet and kind, and I’ve be interested in you for a while. Would you want to go out on a date?” If she says yes, get ready to make a great impression on your date. If she says no, try not to get upset or discouraged. You can still be friends, and you can try asking out someone else who you’re interested in sometime in the future. Reader Poll: We asked 613 wikiHow readers who've asked their female friend on a date, and 55% of them agreed that the best way to ask is by asking her on a casual date, then seeing where things go from there.

      "content": "Be honest with her if you don’t want to be in a relationship. In some cases, you might not be attracted to or interested in dating your friend. If you notice that she might be interested in you, the best thing you can do is tell her that you just view her as a friend. [13] X Research source To do this in the nicest way possible, you might say something like, “I noticed that you’ve been acting differently toward me lately, and I wanted to address it now. I really value our friendship and am not really interested in having a relationship beyond friendship. I hope you understand where I’m coming from.” She might be upset for a little bit, but as long as you’re nice about it and make it clear that you still want her in your life, things will likely be okay."
