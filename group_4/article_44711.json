      "title": "Scrape out the stinger",
      "content": "Scrape out the stinger if it’s stuck with a credit card or dull knife. Check to see if there’s a black dot at the site of the sting. If you see one, that’s the stinger. Press a credit card or dull knife against the edge of the stinger and gently scrape it across the sting to pull it out. If you cannot get the stinger out this way, you can try pulling it out with a pair of tweezers. [1] X Research source Yellow jackets don’t usually leave a stinger, but it’s a good idea to check for one. If the stinger is stuck in your skin, it can release more venom and make the sting hurt more. Ask someone to help you if you're nervous or if you can't reach or find the stinger."
