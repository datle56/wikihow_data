      "content": "Whole bell peppers First, put whole bell peppers into a mesh produce bag , or any bag made out of a breathable material like cotton or muslin. Next, place the bag in the “crisper drawer” in your fridge. [1] X Research source This helps control the humidity levels of the peppers, which prolongs their shelf life. [2] X Research source Your refrigerated peppers should stay fresh for about 1-2 weeks . If you're leaving your bell peppers whole, you don’t need to wash them before putting them in the fridge. [3] X Research source Washing may leave excess moisture on the peppers, which causes them to go bad faster. Wait until you're ready to eat or cook your peppers to wash them. Avoid storing bell peppers in the same drawer as fruits. Fruits release a gas called ethylene, which is a ripening agent that can cause vegetables to rot faster. [4] X Research source"

If you’re using a freezer bag, squeeze out as much air as possible before sealing it. Your peppers should stay good in the freezer for 6-8 months. [8] X Research source Write the date on the plastic bag or container using a marker to help you keep track of how long they’ll be fresh. If you want to eat the peppers raw, move them to the fridge to defrost for about 24 hours. If you want to cook with the peppers, there’s no need to defrost them first. Simply toss them into your recipe and cook as normal. [9] X Research source"

Here’s how do it: Wash your bell peppers thoroughly, then cut into quarters and remove cores and seeds. Next, slice the peppers into strips. Add 1 cup (240 mL) water, 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) distilled white vinegar, and ⅓ cup (67 g) of sugar to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add kosher salt to taste. Place your bell peppers in the liquid mixture and bring to a boil again. Then reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 8-10 minutes. Transfer the peppers and liquid mixture to a sterilized glass jar, and store in the fridge. [11] X Research source"

Dehydrated bell peppers are easy to use in recipes, and they have a much longer shelf life. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it: Thoroughly wash your bell peppers, then core them and remove the seeds. Chop the bell peppers into small pieces. Place your chopped bell peppers onto the mesh trays that came with your dehydrator machine. Dry at 125°F for 6-10 hours. Your bell peppers are done when they are no longer bendy or pliable. If they snap easily when you try to bend them, you’re all good. Place your dehydrated bell peppers in an airtight container and store in a cool, dry place (like your pantry). When you’re ready to eat your peppers, soak them in a bowl of hot water for up to 30 minutes to rehydrate them. [12] X Research source"
