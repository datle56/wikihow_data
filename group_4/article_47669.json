      "title": "Consider what you will be wearing with your tiara.",
      "content": "Consider what you will be wearing with your tiara. When choosing a tiara, you should also take into account the dress that you will be wearing with it. The tiara is meant to complement, and not overpower your look. For instance, if the dress that you will be wearing is adorned with crystal beading, then it would be ideal to choose a crystal tiara. If the dress is beaded with pearls, then a pearl tiara would be the best style to match the dress as well. If the tiara is not for a fancy, formal outfit (such as a prom, wedding, or other big event), choose a tiara that will be the focal point of the outfit. Make sure that your tiara matches your jewelry, and does not clash. For example, if your jewelry is silver with diamonds, pick a tiara that is also silver with diamonds."

      "title": "Consider your hairstyle.",
      "content": "Consider your hairstyle. Different tiaras work better with different hairstyles. If you already have a hairstyle in mind to go with your outfit, then choose a tiara accordingly. For example, a smaller tiara will suit an up-do better than a wider, longer tiara."

      "title": "Pick a tiara that complements your face shape.",
      "content": "Pick a tiara that complements your face shape. While there are no set rules as to which type of tiara you should choose, there are certain styles that complement certain face shapes better than others. In general, try to choose a tiara with a shape that is opposite your face shape. If you have a heart-shaped face, choose a tiara with a V-shaped peak. This will create the illusion of a longer face. If you have a long face, go for something with little or no height that extends evenly across the top of your head. Avoid tall or pointy tiaras. If you have an oval face, you can get away with most shapes. You might want to avoid styles with peaks at the center, however, as this can make your face appear longer. If you have a round face, go for tiaras that have a bit of height or a peak. These can make your face appear longer. Avoid rounded tiaras."

      "content": "Get a tiara with an oval-shaped band instead of a round one. Your head is actually an oval, so an oval-shaped band will fit your head better. A round band will leave gaps. It will also pinch your skull painfully."

      "title": "Choose a tiara that has a slight forward lean to it.",
      "content": "Choose a tiara that has a slight forward lean to it. When you place the tiara down on a flat surface, the front should lean forward slightly. This will help the tiara frame your face properly."

      "title": "Check that the fit of the tiara on your head is comfortable.",
      "content": "Check that the fit of the tiara on your head is comfortable. A tiara that is too large may slip down your head. If necessary, bend the arms of the tiara band a bit until it fits. Avoid bending the tiara straight down the middle, however, as this may damage it. Make sure that the tiara is not too tight, or you will get a headache later on."

      "title": "Conceal the ends of the tiara if you choose to wear your hair down.",
      "content": "Conceal the ends of the tiara if you choose to wear your hair down. In general, loose, relaxed hair looks too casual for tiaras, which are often associated with formality and regality. If you do choose to wear your hair loose, then drape several strands of hair over the ends of the tiara. This will make it blend in better. Consider adding some waves or a soft curl to your hair. This will give your hairstyle some movement and grace. For a more casual look, consider going with a simple floral tiara instead."

      "title": "Consider giving the tiara something to hold on to.",
      "content": "Consider giving the tiara something to hold on to. If you are going to wear your hair down, your tiara won't have much to hold on to. Try braiding or twisting some hair to either side of your temple into a rope. Wrap both of these \"ropes\" around your head. Pin them in place just above your ear. When you put your tiara on, the ends of it should slide right behind these twisted or braided ropes."

      "content": "Try an up-do for a classical look and maximum hold. You can pull your hair up into a tight ballerina bun, or a loose/messy bun. You can even try a ponytail or braid. Give a ponytail some volume by teasing the hair at the crown of your hair into a slight bump."

      "content": "Pair tiaras with formal outfits. There are certain accessories that look best when paired with certain types of outfits. Tiaras are one of them. Much how you wouldn't pair sweatpants and a fancy dress shirt, you wouldn't pair a delicate tiara with jeans and a t-shirt."

      "title": "Wear tiaras to formal occasions.",
      "content": "Wear tiaras to formal occasions. Because of their association with royalty and regality, tiaras are best reserved for those special, formal occasions. They are usually too fancy and formal for day-to-day wear. On the other hand, many girls choose to wear a tiara on their 16th and 21st birthdays in order to stand out and feel more special."

      "title": "Don't wash your hair.",
      "content": "Don't wash your hair. It may sound gross, but having day-old hair actually helps the tiara stay on better. If you must wash your hair, avoid using conditioner. This will give your hair some texture and \"grip,\" and help the tiara stay on longer."

      "title": "Style your hair first.",
      "content": "Style your hair first. This include applying hairspray. If you apply hairspray after you put on your tiara, you will dull the surface and make it sticky."

      "title": "Slide the tiara carefully in the middle of the head.",
      "content": "Slide the tiara carefully in the middle of the head. Try to angle it slightly, so that the prongs go into your hair. It will blend in better with your hairstyle. Try not to just plop it on top of your head."

      "content": "Use bobby pins to secure the tiara. To ensure that the tiara will not fall off, use bobby pins to hold it in place. Place the bobby pins in such a manner that they will be hidden, and will not interfere with the design of the tiara."
