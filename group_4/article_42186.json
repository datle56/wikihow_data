      "content": "In the 1800s, the phrase was sometimes used in literature. While it is hard to pinpoint the exact origins of “sweet summer child,” many Victorian authors and poets used the phrase in their work, especially in the 1840s. The phrase was especially popular with American writers, including Fredrika Bremer, James Staunton Babcock (“The West Wind”), and Mary Whitaker (“The Creole”). “Sweet summer child” was also used in a number of novels, poems, and speeches throughout the 19th century. [2] X Research source In “The West Wind,” Babcock writes, “Thy home is all around, / Sweet summer child of light and air, / Like God’s own presence, felt, ne’er found, / A Spirit everywhere!” In “The Creole,” Whitaker writes, “Blue was the summer ah—, and mild / The fragrant breeze,— sweet Summer’s child. / All rob’d in white, dead Stanley seem’d, / And radiance, from his features, beam’d; / Meta, companion of his way,— / Yet pale as when, on earth, he lay.” Some also consider “sweet summer child” to be a Southern phrase, like “bless your heart.” While there isn’t much evidence to support this, it’s worth noting that many of these writers were from or spent time in the South."

In the Game of Thrones world, seasons last for years, and Stark had yet to experience winter. The exact line Old Nan says is “Oh, my sweet summer child, what do you know about fear?”"
