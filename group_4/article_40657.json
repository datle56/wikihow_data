Dating and relationship coach Julianne Cantarella suggests using humor as an icebreaker, since so many people find humor attractive. [1] X Expert Source Julianne Cantarella Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 6 August 2021. Look around and observe what is going on around you. Is there anything funny or interesting that you notice? For example, if it’s lunchtime and the food truck hasn’t arrived yet, you can say “Are they going to get us water for this wait, or do they want us to die?” A humorous or playful comment like this can help keep the mood light and fun. If you’re starting your conversation over text, you won’t be able to comment on your physical surroundings, but you can still make a comment about something that happened during the day. For example, if you’re in the same English class, you could say, “I feel like that quiz in English was super hard! I practically died 😵‍💫 What did you think?” Try not to overthink your icebreaker and don’t worry too much about being “smooth.” The first few comments you make to your crush are not going to make or break the conversation. The important thing is to get the two of you talking."

      "content": "Ask an icebreaker question to get things going. If there's nothing interesting in your surroundings to comment on, try asking them a casual question about how they’re doing or what they’re up to. For example, “I see you have some books with you, what are you reading?” Or, if you’re having a conversation over text, start with something like, “Hey, how’s your day going?” These low-pressure questions let your crush know you’re interested in them in a cool and casual way. After they answer your first question, ask some follow-ups to deepen the conversation. For example, once they tell you what book they’re reading, ask them whether it’s any good, or how it compares to other books by that author. If you go to the same school and you see them at lunch, you could say something like, \"Have anything good to eat today?\" or \"How was class this morning?\" If you’re coworkers, casual questions like, “How’d your day go?” or “What projects have you been working on lately?” work well too."

It's an especially good idea to ask about a topic the two of you have in common, explains matchmaker and dating coach Judith Gottesman. [2] X Expert Source Judith Gottesman, MSW Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 19 October 2021. For example, if you’re taking a class together, you could say “So how’s your midterm paper coming together?” Talking about the things you have in common will make the conversation less awkward, and you’ll also get a better understanding of what’s going on with them. Although it is a good idea to share information about yourself throughout the conversation, Gottesman warns not to talk about yourself too much. “I would advise asking them questions about themselves and talking less about yourself,” she says. [3] X Expert Source Judith Gottesman, MSW Matchmaker & Dating Coach Expert Interview. 19 October 2021. Tell them about what’s going on in your life when they ask or when it comes up naturally, but aside from that, try to keep your focus on them. If you’re going on and on about yourself, they might feel like you’re trying too hard to impress them. “It’s almost like you’re reading a resume off to them, and you don’t want to do that,” Gottesman says.

An unusual or unexpected question can really help you stand out and make the conversation more interesting and memorable. For example, you could ask them something like, “Is there a celebrity that people say you look like?” This kind of question could make them laugh, and the playful topic can help you feel more comfortable with one another. Once they tell you their celebrity look alike, you can tell them who you think yours is. You can even joke around and pick someone who doesn’t look like you to make them laugh more."

For example, you could say, “So how much longer do you think you need to spend on your midterm paper?” This will show that you were really paying attention and locking in the information they shared with you. You can also make inside jokes about what you talked about. For example, you can say, “Well now that we have made it through this lunch period without water, I suppose we can get through anything together.” Making inside jokes can help you cement connections you have made, and it's a good way to make your connection last past the first conversation."

If the conversation seems to be going well, ask your crush if they want to hang out sometime, or ask for their number so you can keep talking over text . Try to do this after you’ve been talking for a period of time, but not at the very end of the conversation. You want to do it after you’re made a solid connection, but before the conversation has become tired or worn out. For example, you could say something like, “I think you’re super cool. Would you want to hang out sometime?” Then suggest a couple of things you can do together, and ask for their number so you can coordinate the plans. Or if you want to play it safer, you can simply ask “Hey, can I have your number? I really like talking to you and it would be cool if we could keep the convo going.” This part can be a little nerve-wracking, but it’s important to put yourself out there. “There are too many good relationships that people miss out on because they’re too afraid to show interest, or they think they should play it cool,” says Gottesman.

This leaves your crush with a good impression and ends the conversation on a high note. Make sure to tell them that you enjoyed talking to them, and that you’re looking forward to chatting again soon. You can keep the end of your conversation casual with something like, “I should be getting home now, but I had a lot of fun talking to you. Let me know how that game goes on Friday!” If you are going to be seeing your crush in the future, try saying something like, “I’ll see you in math class tomorrow! I’m also around later if you have any trouble with the homework—just shoot me a text.” If they gave you their number, send a follow-up text in the next couple of days to say hello and check in with them about the things you talked about."

A good time to start a conversation could be before school, during lunch or a break, after school, or after an event is over. Just make sure they aren’t stressed out or in the middle of something—you don’t want to interrupt them when they’re busy! Make sure you have enough time for at least a few minutes of conversation. For example, you don’t want to try to talk to them right before class starts, since your conversation will likely get cut short. Try to find times when your schedules overlap. If you have two classes in a row together, for instance, you start a conversation while you walk from one class to the next. Think about whether there are any dances, parties, or school events coming up that you’re both going to. These are great settings for you to talk to them! This is less of an issue if you’re starting your conversation over text, since they can reply to your message whenever it’s convenient for them. Just try not to text them super late at night or really early in the morning. You don’t want to wake them up if they’re sleeping!"

Instead, try to use a warm, friendly tone when you talk to your crush, even if you don’t know them all that well yet. This creates a comfortable vibe and helps smooth over any awkwardness. [11] X Research source Say something like, “Hi, I don’t know if we’ve actually met yet, but we’re in the same math class. I’m Tim, how’s it going?” When you’re talking to your friends, pay attention to your tone of voice, the hand gestures you use, and the expressions you make. Try to use these same relaxed and natural mannerisms when you talk with your crush. Try to keep the vibe cool and low-key, and don’t overthink it. If you’ve already been introduced to each other, a simple, “Hey, how are you?” or “What’s up?” can be enough to start a casual conversation. Just make sure not to be overly familiar with them, either. For example, if you’ve never spoken to each other before, you wouldn’t want to say something super casual, like “Hey dude. How’s it?” You’d want to introduce yourself first."

[13] X Expert Source Erika Kaplan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 1 October 2020. These may seem like small things, but Kaplan says good body language can be the thing that keeps you out of the friendzone! Avoid distractions. Don’t send a text or look at your phone while you talk. This will make it seem like you are disinterested, and it might keep you from really hearing what your crush is saying. Repeat what your crush said and ask follow-up questions. Rephrasing what they said lets them know you’re paying attention, and asking a follow-up keeps the conversation flowing. For example, “Wow, it’s so crazy you ran into your best friend from kindergarten! Was it nice to catch up?” [14] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good in Action An initiative by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center promoting science-based practices for a meaningful life Go to source Avoid interrupting them. It’s normal to get excited about what you want to say, but resist the temptation to interrupt while they’re still talking. Wait until they’re done before making a comment or asking another question. Be empathetic. If your crush talks about something hard that is going on with them, make sure to acknowledge their feelings. For example, if they talk about failing a test, you could say something like, “That sounds like a super tough test! I’m sorry it didn’t go well. Are they letting you retake it?”"

You don’t want to act like you know everything about their life if you haven’t hung out that much yet. Stick to talking about things that are public knowledge, like the fact that they are on the football team, or that they’re in the school musical that’s coming up.

Do you like home cooked food or takeout better? What do you like to do on the weekends? What’s the funniest joke you’ve ever heard? What was your most embarrassing moment?
