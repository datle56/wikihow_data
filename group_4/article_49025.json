It may help to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with all of the tips in the related wikiHow article on \"How to Master Do It Yourself Electrical Safety\". Shut off all the individual circuit breakers in the panel and then shut off the main switch that supplies power to the panel. This is preferable as it is much safer to operate many smaller current devices, one at a time; than to operate a single, large current device just once. When all the smaller circuit breakers are off, the amount of current flowing through the larger 50, 100 (or more) amp circuit breaker should be zero."

For flush installation in a drywall wall, you may choose a cut in or repair type , for other installations, a surface mounted cast aluminum or PVC weather resistant ( damp location ) box may be applicable. You will need to determine the path for the wires between the receptacle box and the electrical panel box. You will need to install conduit if you use single insulated wires. Install the actual wires if you use a non-metallic cable (Romex)."

Allow a little extra for corners, especially if you are installing in conduit, since these have ride radius curves for turning sharp angles. Also, allow at least 24 inches for hooking the wires to the breaker or fuse block and neutral and ground terminals in the panel box, and 6 or 8 inches for terminating in the receptacle box.

This way, if your wire touches an exposed live conductor while feeding it through, it won't short out or conduct the current back to you. [2] X Research source If you have installed conduit and the run is very short, you may be able to just push the wire from the outlet box back through to the electric panel. For long runs, you may need to push a \"fish tape\" through the conduit so you can hook onto the wire and pull it through. If you don't have conduit, you will have to \"fish\" the cable or remove wallboard and possibly drill 5/8 inch or larger holes through the wall studs to feed the wire through. Either way, you have to get the wire run between the electric panel and the outlet box in a way that it is not exposed and the insulating \"jacket\" is not damaged."

If you have wire strippers, simply clamp the insulated wire in the slot that matches the size of your wire, turn the strippers half a turn to score the insulation, and pull the wire through. [5] X Expert Source Ricardo Mitchell Electrician & Construction Professional, CN Coterie Expert Interview. 6 May 2020. This will remove the insulation without damaging the copper conductor inside it. [6] X Research source If you can't strip the jacket, use the \"14 gauge\" jaws. Using the 12 gauge jaws of the tool significantly decreases the chance of nicking the wire. When using the 14 gauge jaws, hold the tool at a right angle to the wire, otherwise you will damage the wire. Also strip the end of the ground wire if it is insulated. If you cut too deep, don't worry... Cut the end off and try again. You have 3 or 4 tries before the wires will start to get too short to work with. It is very important to NOT nick the wire."

[10] X Research source NOTE: You can use either the wiring screws or the quick connects. However, the screws are the preferred method as they provide a better contact between the wires and the outlet. Also, if you fail to strip enough wire for the quick connect, the wire can work itself loose over time causing all the outlets downstream to fail."

If you insist on back-wiring, insert the tip of the black wire into one of the holes nearest the dark screws and push it in as far as it will go. You may need to use the needle nose pliers to push the wire in, as these can be really stiff sometimes. The wire should go nearly the full 1.5 cm (5/8\") in.

This is a long bar with many screw terminals with existing uninsulated and green insulated (ground) wires terminated to it and often times will have white wires terminated to it as well. Most properties with only one electrical panel has a single such bus bar (as described above) for the termination of both ground and neutral wires. Most properties that have more than one electrical panel (a second panel for a detached garage or dedicated shop area; or provided during expansion of or addition to a home - are common scenarios), are required to have a bus bar for the termination of ground wires and a separate bus bar for the termination of neutral wires. Suffice to say, if the panel has one bar used to terminate only white wires and another bus bar used to terminate only green or / and bare wires, it is very important to maintain the integrity of these two systems by adding ground wires only to the ground bus bar and neutral wires only to the neutral bus bar. Failure to do so is a code violation and a potential shock hazard. [14] X Research source"
