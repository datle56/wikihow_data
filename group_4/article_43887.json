      "content": "Tickle the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Lightly rotate your tongue in a circle on the roof of your mouth to create a tickling sensation. No one is entirely sure why this body part is so sensitive, but you're welcome to give it a try! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Lightly tickle your skin with a feather or a brush. Use an object with soft tendrils or bristles, such as a feather or a brush, and lightly run it across the bottom of your foot or your neck. You still won't feel like you're being tickled as intensely as when someone else tickles you, but it might still feel good! Make a DIY tickling device by gluing long feathers onto a stick."

      "content": "Move your fingertips in a circular motion on your skin. This technique doesn't always work, but some people report a mildly ticklish sensation when they barely touch their skin with their fingertips and move them around in a circular motion. You can also try stroking your skin back and forth, like you're caressing yourself."

      "title": "Don't tickle yourself by pretending your hand doesn't belong to you.",
      "content": "Don't tickle yourself by pretending your hand doesn't belong to you. Scientists have done experiments where they tried to trick a person's brain into believing that a plastic hand on a table in front of them was their hand. Even when the person's brain believed the plastic hand was theirs, they still couldn't tickle themselves. [2] X Research source Did you know? Some people with schizophrenia can tickle themselves and laugh. This may be because their brains have a harder time predicting the sensations caused by their movements. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't tickle yourself by putting something in your ear.",
      "content": "Don't tickle yourself by putting something in your ear. Not only is it a very bad idea to start putting things in your ear, as you might damage an eardrum, but it also doesn't work! The inside of your ear is no more able to be tickled than the rest of your body. As a rule of thumb, never put anything smaller than the tip of your elbow into your ear. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Don't rub your nails on your skin to get a more pleasurable tickle.",
      "content": "Don't rub your nails on your skin to get a more pleasurable tickle. The idea behind using your fingernails is that you can't tickle yourself because your brain knows it's your own fingers doing the tickling. So, if you use your fingernails, your fingers won't register the sensation. But this trick doesn't work, either. It will still produce a tickle, but once again, you probably won't feel the urge to laugh because of it."

      "title": "Your brain predicts your own tickle and cancels it out.",
      "content": "Your brain predicts your own tickle and cancels it out. When you tickle yourself, the part of your brain called the cerebellum knows the sensation is coming and isn't surprised by it. As a result, it partially shuts down other parts of your brain that interpret the tickle as a touch and a pleasant sensation. When someone else tickles you, your cerebellum can't predict the sensation you're about to experience. This leaves the rest of your brain to respond to the tickle as touch that gives pleasure. [5] X Research source If it's strong enough, you might even laugh out loud! There are actually two different types of tickles: The light tickle you can give yourself is called knismesis . Some people like it, but others compare it to the feeling you get when a bug crawls on your skin. The stronger tickle that makes you laugh out loud without trying is called gargalesis . This is the type that most people (with the exception of some people who have schizophrenia) can't give themselves.

      "title": "You can try lightly tickling yourself, but you won't make yourself laugh.",
      "content": "You can try lightly tickling yourself, but you won't make yourself laugh. This is because your brain knows what you're doing and predicts the tickling sensation before it happens. You can still mimic a mild tickle and find it enjoyable (although some people compare it to the feeling of a spider crawling across their skin). If you really want a tickle that makes you giggle, ask a friend, family member, or partner to intensely stimulate sensitive areas like the soles of your feet , ribs, armpits, and neck. Then, you'll feel the stronger tickle you're looking for!"
