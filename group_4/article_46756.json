      "content": "Understand what kind of smartphone you have. While there many makes and models of smartphones on the market today, the two major platforms they run on are Android and iOS. iOS: iOS is developed by Apple and is used on all iPhone and iPad devices. iOS devices tend to be a little more expensive, but they are also a little more user-friendly and have better security features. Apple is a little bit stricter on what apps are allowed for iPhone and iPad and does not allow you to install apps from unverified third-party sources. Android: Most non-Apple smartphones run on the Android operating system. It's a little more complex and not as easy to use. Smartphone developers can customize the Android operating system for their own phone models. This means that the layout can be a little different from one phone make and model to another. Android is a little less strict on what apps are allowed the platform, and you can install apps from unverified third-party sources. This also means that Android devices have more security flaws and require you to be more vigilant about what you download and install on your smartphone."

The SIM card is provided by your cellular service provider and contains your account information and phone number. A valid SIM card must be installed in your phone for it to work. Most of the time, the retailer you purchase the phone from will install the SIM card for you. If you need to install a SIM card, use the SIM card tool that came with your phone and insert it into the compartment with a tiny pinhole in it. This will eject the compartment. Place the SIM card in the tray and replace it into your smartphone. On iPhone and iPad , the SIM card tray is usually located on the right side of the phone. On Android phones , the SIM card tray is found along to the top or side of the phone. On some older smartphones, you need to remove the back and take out the battery to access the SIM card storage area. If you don't have a SIM card tool, you can use a paperclip to open the SIM card compartment. Some newer phones have an eSIM instead of a physical SIM card."
