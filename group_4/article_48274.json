Only a single tree exists in the wild, on one of the Three Kings Islands off the coast of New Zealand. All other P. baylisiana trees were eaten by goats that were introduced to the island in 1889, making this last tree one of the rarest and loneliest in the world. [4] X Research source In 2005, a team of scientists managed to raise 6 more trees that produced seeds and in 2019, they were attempting to reintroduce new saplings into the environment.

When it does, it generates heat and releases a powerful stink that smells similar to the stench of rotten flesh, luring pollinators like carrion beetles and flies.

[16] X Research source The designs of the lines are usually plants and animals, like a monkey, a killer whale, and a hummingbird, but also include geometric shapes like triangles, trapezoids, and spirals. [17] X Research source The rocks that cover this desert are rust-colored, so the lines were made by removing the top 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) of rock to expose the light-colored sand underneath.

The city is believed to have been constructed before 370 BCE and was carved out with shovels and pickaxes. As one of the largest underground cities in Cappadocia, it’s now a popular tourist destination. [19] X Research source In 1963, a local man noticed his chickens disappearing through a gap in his basement, and after knocking down a wall, he accidentally discovered the sprawling city. The city was most likely originally used for the storage of goods but was then expanded and used as protection from foreign invaders during the Byzantine Era."

Instead, it appears as a rare crimson color because the lake it comes from has been preserved under salty ice for years. The lake is rich in iron, too salty to freeze, and has no oxygen. When the iron-rich water comes in contact with the oxygen in the air, it rusts, creating a disturbingly beautiful red color.

No one knows for sure what causes their vibrantly pink color, but some researchers think it’s because of the pink- and red-colored salt-loving bacteria and algae that live there. [23] X Research source Many of these lakes change color depending on the season, time of day, and cloud coverage.

[34] X Research source Leucism is often confused with albinism, however, an albino bird would have pink eyes, while a bird with leucism does not.

However, they’re still fairly rare and sometimes cost higher prices. [41] X Research source No one’s sure how the orange carrot took over the others, but some believe that purple carrots fell out of favor because they might turn whatever else they were cooked with purple. One story says that the orange carrot was developed in the Netherlands to pay homage to William of Orange, but there’s no evidence to support this claim. [42] X Research source"
