      "content": "Drink fewer cups of coffee. Yes, it’s true: the more coffee you drink, the more likely it is to send you to the porcelain throne. While it is safe for most people to have up to 5 mugs of coffee per day, the more you drink, the more likely you are to stimulate your bowels. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Switch to a low-acid brew. The acidity in coffee may be one of the components that causes you to go to the bathroom. By using a low-acid roast, like a French roast, dark roast, or a mushroom blend, you can neutralize some of that acid and save your stomach in the mornings. [2] X Research source Making cold brew is another great way to neutralize that acid while still enjoying a delicious cup of joe."

      "title": "Drink coffee after breakfast.",
      "content": "Drink coffee after breakfast. Drinking coffee on an empty stomach isn’t bad for you, but it can increase coffee’s effects (and that includes giving you the urge to go). If you tend to drink coffee first thing in the morning, try saving your first cup until you’ve had something to eat. [3] X Research source Researchers aren’t 100% sure about the validity of this method, but it’s worth a try."

      "title": "Start drinking decaf or half-caff.",
      "content": "Start drinking decaf or half-caff. If you’re a daily coffee drinker, you probably don’t want to hear that switching to decaffeinated coffee can solve your pooping problems. However, since caffeine is a big reason why coffee stimulates our bowels, moving to a half-caff or even decaf brew can save you a lot of time in the bathroom. [4] X Research source If you can’t give up your full-caff coffee just yet (which is totally understandable), try drinking 1 cup of regular coffee and then switching to decaf for the rest of the day."

      "title": "Stop adding milk or creamer to your coffee.",
      "content": "Stop adding milk or creamer to your coffee. Do you have trouble drinking dairy? A large percentage of the adult population has a tough time digesting lactose, the ingredient in milk and dairy creamers. If you tend to add anything extra to your coffee, try switching to a lactose-free version to see if it helps. [5] X Research source Rest assured that you don’t have to give up your creamy coffee in the mornings. Most grocery stores sell lactose-free versions of coffee creamer , and you can also switch to a different kind of milk, like coconut milk, soy milk, or oat milk (none of which contain lactose)."

      "title": "Caffeine content",
      "content": "Caffeine content Caffeine stimulates your colon, which sends your body into “I have to go to the bathroom” mode. And since a cup of coffee has about 95 milligrams of caffeine on average, it’s no wonder that a cup of strong coffee will send you jogging (if not sprinting) to the toilet. [6] X Research source For reference, a caffeinated soda has about 35 milligrams of caffeine in it."

      "title": "Acidity",
      "content": "Acidity You often hear coffee connoisseurs talk about the “acid notes” in coffee. While it’s one of the things that makes coffee taste great, those acids also stimulate the muscles in your intestines, causing your stomach to create more gastric acid (which helps break down proteins). The more acidity in coffee you drink, the more gastric acid your stomach creates, which causes you to break down proteins more quickly… leading to a trip to the toilet. [7] X Research source"
