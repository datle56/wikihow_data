      "content": "Keep complimenting her , when appropriate. If she asks you how your day was, let her know that you were thinking about her. Add a slight twist by complimenting her features. Don't make it too smutty though; something like \"I couldn't stop thinking about you and your sexy smile\" does the job. Keep the conversation going by asking questions about her and showing interest in her answers. The way that you start turning her on is by dropping plenty of little compliments. Make sure you think of little things to say just about her to make her feel special. Girls like it when you notice something about them that they also like. So if you know she likes the color of her eyes, compliment the color of her eyes (\"I love the way your eyes shine when you smile\"). If she likes her hair, say something like \"Your hair looks so smooth and comfortable, do you know how pretty it makes you look?\" [3] X Research source Start making the compliments slightly more sexy.

Start with some ambiguous innuendos so you don’t come on too strong. [5] X Expert Source Mark Rosenfeld Dating & Relationship Coach Expert Interview. 16 June 2021. You need to build up anticipation first. You will need to come up with your own suggestions, but an example might be: \"If we were together, I'd run my fingers slowly through your hair while we kissed. I'd massage your back while I kissed your neck. I would lie next to you and trace my fingers over the soft curves of your beautiful body.\" etc. Be creative. Using lots of imagery and imaginative words can also help. Here are some other compliments that you can use: \"I thought about you when I woke up today. Just like I thought about you when I went to sleep last night. You know what I was thinking about? I was thinking about us, together, curled up in bed. That makes me happy.\" Something else you might say: \"You give me goosebumps. Every time you touch me I go crazy inside, because I know it's only you who can do that to me. No one else does that. Even a smile from you is like a punch in the gut, but in a good way.\""

      "content": "Try to use your words in person. When you are getting a girl turned on using words it's important that she can hear your voice. It can be done over text, but your words will have a much better effect if the girl you are talking to can hear the sexy tones in your voice. Try to use your deepest-sounding voice when you talk to your girl. Studies show that people with deep voices have more sexual partners and that girls are more attracted to people with deep voices. [6] X Research source Now, that doesn't mean you should lower your voice if it sounds unnatural, because that won't turn your girl on. But if you're always in the higher pitched level of your voice, try to go down to the lower level when you're talking with your girl."

      "content": "Set the mood. When you start talking to her, it's important to set the mood for the entire conversation by saying things like \"I can't stop thinking about you,\" or \"I've been wanting to hear your voice all day.\" This will help establish closeness, and let her know that you're feeling intimate. Make sure you’re alone and in a comfortable, sexy environment; you may not want to turn her on in public. Other things to say are: \"I never knew it until I spent time away from you, but I missed you today,\" or \"You look stunning, as usual.\" Keep it short and sweet; a very elaborate compliment might come off wrong or be misinterpreted by her. Don't compare her to other women. Even if what you're saying is that she's smarter, or prettier, or more fun to be around, avoid the comparison. She doesn't even want you to compare her to other women, because she doesn't want you to think about other women. She wants you to think about only her. If she thinks you may be thinking about other women, it's a turn-off for her. Have a fun, positive energy when you're flirting with someone since it will make you more approachable and easy to talk to.

      "content": "Say that you want her. One of the most basic things you can say when you want to turn up the heat are these simple words: “I want you.” You can add other variations, but saying this makes the girl see how much you want to be physically close with her and may be enough to turn her on. Look her in the eyes and show that you’re not shy about saying what you want and need. Here are some other things you can say: “I want you so bad right now.” “I’ve been wanting you all day long.” “I’ve never wanted you so badly in my life.” “That dress you’re wearing makes me want you more than ever.”"

As long as you’re sure she’s playing along and that she would welcome compliments about parts of her body other than her face, you can start to take it up a notch by complimenting the parts of her body that turn you on. Just make sure you’re not offending her and that your comments are welcome. Here are some things you can say: “Your chest looks amazing in that dress.” “Your legs are incredible.” “I love the way your hips are moving.”"

You can be a bit more graphic if you want, but in general, just say enough to have her imagine you having your hands all over her body, which should be more than enough to turn her on. Here are some things you can say: “I want to run my hand down your thighs.” “I can’t wait to kiss the nape of your neck.” “I want to caress and kiss every part of your body.” \"I want to run my hands through your hair while I kiss you.\""

This would paint a sexy image in her mind and will have her turned on in no time at all. Of course, make sure she has done many of these things before so you don’t surprise her or come off sounding too graphic or explicit. Here are some things you can say to her: “I want you to take my shirt off.” “I want you to kiss my chest and shoulders.” “I want you to get on top of me and start kissing my neck.”"

They can be related to role-playing, can be about explicit things you’d like to do to her or would like her to do to you, or can be about a place where you’ve always wanted to hook up. Don’t be afraid to tell her what you’ve always dreamed about and see if you can make it come true together. Let her reveal her fantasies, too. This can turn both of you on even more."

Though turning your girl on with words is best done in person, you can leave her feeling sexy even after you’ve said your goodbyes by sending her a sexy text message later on in the day that shows her that you’re still thinking of her and her body. Keep it sweet and simple but also make sure there’s enough subtext to get her turned on and ready for your next encounter. Here are some things you can say: “I can’t stop thinking about what happened last night. I can’t wait to see you again.” “When I close my eyes, all I see is your gorgeous body.” “I had such an amazing time with you last night. I can’t wait to have you in my arms again.”"
