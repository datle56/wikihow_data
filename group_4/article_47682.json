      "title": "Place it on the ring finger of your left hand.",
      "content": "Place it on the ring finger of your left hand. This is the traditional option that many brides and grooms choose. The rings go on the ring finger of that hand, which is the one between your middle and pinky. The order of the rings is up to you, but the engagement ring usually goes on first followed by the wedding band."

    {
      "title": "Put the wedding band on first.",
      "content": "Put the wedding band on first. You can also choose to slide your wedding band on first, followed by your engagement ring. Some people prefer this arrangement for romantic reasons, as it places your band closer to your heart. You could also choose this set-up if it is more comfortable or fits your hand better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move them after the wedding.",
      "content": "Move them after the wedding. Some people choose to wear both rings on their left hand from the start. Others choose to initially put their engagement ring on their right hand ring finger. Then, immediately before the wedding ceremony, they'll transfer the engagement ring over from their right hand to their left one."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place them on separate ring fingers.",
      "content": "Place them on separate ring fingers. If you don't want the heaviness of multiple rings on one finger or if you have shorter fingers, than you may want to separate the rings. One option is to make them parallel by sliding one on each of your ring fingers. This also provides a way for you to showcase each of your rings on their own."

    {
      "title": "Save one ring for special occasions only.",
      "content": "Save one ring for special occasions only. Keep one of your rings in your jewelry box and only take it out for important events. In this case, most people wear their wedding band every day and put their engagement ring on reserve. This has the benefit of keeping at least one of your rings in excellent condition over time. [1] X Research source Some women find wearing one ring simpler, especially if they have to take the ring off for certain activities, such as working out. Since the wedding band is usually simpler, it is often the one that is worn on a daily basis."

      "title": "Do what feels the best to you.",
      "content": "Do what feels the best to you. There really isn't one right or wrong way to wear your rings. It's your choice and something that you'll need to embrace on a daily basis. Remember that you can always mix it up and go from one wearing arrangement to another as often as you like. It can help to understand the meaning behind each ring. An engagement ring is usually a promise of future marriage. A wedding band is given during an actual marriage ceremony."

      "title": "Get a matched set.",
      "content": "Get a matched set. This band and ring are meant to be worn together. They can be made out of the same metal and may also have a similar finish. The style should be complementary too. This is a good choice for someone who knows that they want to wear both rings at the same time, but would prefer to have them perfectly paired.

      "title": "Go with a contoured ring.",
      "content": "Go with a contoured ring. This is a type of matched set where the wedding band conforms to the edge of the center gemstone on the engagement ring. This means that both rings can be worn without them jangling or moving around too much. However, if you wear your band separately it will have an angled appearance in the middle.

      "content": "Get an all-in-one eternity band. While the traditional wedding band is often quite basic, more couples are choosing elaborate bands containing precious stones and unique metals, like platinum. These bands are often called “eternity bands” due to their more elaborate appearance. This is a great option for someone who wants the simplicity of the band with the beauty of an engagement ring.

      "title": "Stack your rings.",
      "content": "Stack your rings. This is when you place a series of rings together on one finger alongside your wedding band or engagement ring. Or, the series could take the place of a single ring or band. To get the best look, its best if the rings match in some way, whether it be through similar stones or metals. It's also a good idea to keep them fairly thin, unless you want your finger weighed down. Some people choose to accumulate a stacked ring gradually by adding a band after special events, such as anniversaries. Over the years this means that you could have multiple interchangeable rings or bands."

    {
      "title": "Weld them together.",
      "content": "Weld them together. Go to a professional jeweler and ask them to solder your band and ring together into a single piece of jewelry. Many people enjoy the symbolism behind this gesture, as the rings become unified in a similar way as a couple does through marriage. But, this process may not be fully reversible, so consider it carefully. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Get them sized properly.",
      "content": "Get them sized properly. Placement is important, but it won't matter as much if one of your rings falls off your hand. Before you purchase your rings, get your finger sized properly by a professional jeweler. Then, test out the fit when you get the actual ring. It should slide over your knuckle easily, but should not be overly loose. Be aware that your ring size might change over time or due to certain health events, such as pregnancy. Check your rings every so often to make sure that they are still fit comfortably on your finger."

      "title": "Get them inscribed.",
      "content": "Get them inscribed. On the interior of your rings you can choose to have a date or a few words etched into the metal. This is one way that couples can enjoy matching rings without it being obvious on the outside. Most rings are capable of inscription, but it's best to talk with a jeweler about the process. [8] X Research source For example, it is quite common for couples to put their wedding date on the inside of their ring bands. You could also get the date of your engagement etched inside your engagement ring."

Educate yourself about traditions that might hold meaning for you and make a choice about whether or not to follow them.
