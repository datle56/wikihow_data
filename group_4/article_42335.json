      "content": "Spritz your hair with water to quickly revive curls. Sometimes, you wake up and your hair may look a little frizzy, or your curls may lose their shape during the day. To revive your curls, spray water onto a section of your hair and scrunch or shape your curls. Do this anywhere your curls look flat or deflated. If you want to restore some shine, rub a few drops of hair oil in between your fingers and carefully work it through your hair.

      "content": "Massage rinse-out conditioner into your hair and leave it on for a few minutes. Buy a conditioner designed for curly or wavy hair so it's super nourishing. Work the conditioner into all of your hair and let it sit for 3 to 4 minutes or as directed on the package. This gives the product a chance to penetrate your hair for deeper moisturizing. You'll notice your hair start to clump or curl. Then, rinse it out using cool water. If you feel like your hair is still dry throughout the week, you may want to do a weekly deep condition where you leave a thicker product on your hair for longer before you rinse it out."

Wrap the T-shirt around your hair and flip your head back. Leave the curls to dry for at least 10 minutes. Then, remove the towel and let your hair finish air drying.

Push it onto your hairdryer and turn it to the lowest setting. Hold the diffuser near the roots of your hair for 10 to 20 seconds. Then, tilt your head and cup the diffuser around a strand of your hair. Dry it for 10 to 20 seconds. Keep moving the diffuser around your scalp and hair until it's mostly dry.

Curly hair that's nourished looks glossy and healthy, but your hair can become dry and brittle if it's not getting enough moisture. Read hair care product labels before you buy a product and choose hydrating, moisturizing products. These are usually cream or lotion based so they cling to your hair better. Look for products that contain argan, jojoba, and macadamia oils, for instance, since these do a great job of moisturizing hair.

Preserve your curls while you sleep by pulling your hair up onto the top of your head and tying it loosely so your head isn't pushing down on the curls. You could also pin up specific curls with hair clips or bobby pins. For even more protection, put a bonnet over your hair. If the outside of the bonnet is satin, flip it inside out so the satin comes into contact with your hair—not the coarse terry cloth."

      "content": "There's not a single perfect hairstyle, but there are ways to get a great cut. Common haircutting mistakes include traditional layers which tend to make your hair frizz out. Talk with your hairstylist about what look you're going for. If you want a soft, look with defined curls, have them cut with the curl. If you like more texture, ask them to cut against the curl. Avoid using hairstylists that stretch your hair out and cut it in a straight line since they're not paying attention to your hair's curl pattern."
