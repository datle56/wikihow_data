Very long text messages. Usually, you can send messages up to 160 characters, but longer messages raise red flags for carriers. Unnecessary capitalization, like \"SIGN UP NOW FOR FREE.\""

If you're sending a lot of texts, your carrier could mark your phone number as spam and filter your messages. Generally, P2P phones can only send one message per second, and there should be an even exchange of sending and receiving messages. If you're sending about 500 messages and only receiving 20 texts in return, that's a red flag to your carrier. If you're a business that markets using group texts, verify your phone number with your mobile provider."

You can have an A2P (application-to-person) number or a P2P (person-to-person) number through your mobile provider. If you have a P2P phone number, you're expected to send personal text messages, and carriers limit how many texts a P2P number can send. You need A2P messaging if you're a business expecting to have text conversations with your customers. There are different services and platforms that you can use to help your business by sending text messaging. To fix this, make sure your carrier supports SMS, MMS, or RCS messaging. If it doesn't support these types of messaging, you know why none of your messages are going through! If you're using Google Messages, open the app, tap the three-dot menu, and then go to Settings > RCS chats . Toggle that feature off if it's on. Although RCS is Android's answer to simplify texting in the future, it could be causing problems with carriers and text messaging platforms."
