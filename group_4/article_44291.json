      "content": "Know what a deed is. A deed is a legal document that transfers ownership in property from one individual to another. [1] X Research source There are different types of deeds you can prepare depending on who you are transferring the property to and how much you want to protect the party getting ownership. A deed must be in writing and must contain certain information in order to be valid."

      "title": "Consider a general warranty deed.",
      "content": "Consider a general warranty deed. Before you prepare the deed, you need to figure out what type you will use to convey your property. One option is the general warranty deed. A general warranty deed conveys the property in question, as well as a number of covenants of title. [2] X Research source These covenants are promises by the seller (\"grantor\") to the buyer (\"grantee\") that the grantor is transferring their entire interest in the property to the grantee. [3] X Research source A general warranty deed guarantees against any acts or omissions on the grantor's part or on the part of any predecessors (i.e., previous owners) that might undermine the quality of the title. [4] X Research source If you are using a general warranty deed to convey your property to a grantee, you are making the following promises: You, as the grantor, are promising that you are the lawful owner of the property at the time of conveyance; You are promising that the property is free from all encumbrances; and You are promising to defend the title so that the grantees can enjoy peaceful and quiet possession of their property. [5] X Research source Consider using a general warranty deed when you are selling property to someone unfamiliar to you. [6] X Research source Buyers will generally not accept anything less if they do not know who they are buying the property from. Use a general warranty deed only when you feel comfortable with the property's ownership history, because you will be responsible for protecting the new owners if a problem from the past comes up."

      "title": "Think about a special warranty deed.",
      "content": "Think about a special warranty deed. A second deed option, the special warranty deed, is similar to the general warranty deed. However, you are only promising to protect the title against defects that arose through your own acts or omissions. [7] X Research source In other words, if you use this type of deed, you are not warranting against defects or claims that arose before you acquired ownership of the property. [8] X Research source You can use a special warranty deed when you are selling property to someone unfamiliar to you. [9] X Research source While some buyers may be wary because you are not using a general warranty deed, others will be content getting the protections offered by a special warranty deed. Use a special warranty deed when you don't feel comfortable with the property's history before your period of ownership."

      "content": "Know about the quitclaim deed. The third deed option, the quitclaim deed, transfers any ownership interest you may have in the property. However, it does not make any promises about what that interest is, if any. [10] X Research source Quitclaim deeds are often used to clear up title problems, to transfer property between spouses, or in informal transactions involving family or friends.

      "content": "Identify the grantee. After commencing an action to transfer your ownership interest in a piece of property, whether by selling it, gifting it, or transferring it at death, you will need to prepare a deed. The first requirement of a valid deed is a satisfactory identification of the grantee, which is the person getting title to your property. [12] X Research source In general, you will need to include their name only. [13] X Research source In some states, you will be required to include their address and other identifying information as well. [14] X Research source The grantee can be one or more persons, a corporation, nonprofit, or any other entity. [15] X Research source For example, your deed might identify the grantee in the following way: \"This general warranty deed made and entered into on this ____ day of _______, _____, for the consideration of $______, and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, ______________ (hereinafter \"Grantors\"), hereby warrants to ______________ (hereinafter \"Grantees\")...\" [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Provide a description of the property.",
      "content": "Provide a description of the property. After identifying the parties you are required to describe the property at issue. [21] X Research source This description must be sufficient to identify the property for legal purposes. [22] X Research source The best place to find the legal description is on the most recent deed to the property (the one that conveyed the property to the current owner). [23] X Research source The legal description should be preceded by words such as \"described as follows.\" [24] X Research source Descriptions found in property tax records, as well as street addresses, are not legally sufficient and should not be used. [25] X Research source There are usually two types of legal descriptions you should use: Lot and block descriptions, which are most often used in subdivisions. [26] X Research source It will most often refer to a lot, the block number, the subdivision name, and the county and state. [27] X Research source For example, a lot and block description may look like this: \"Lot 9, Block 58, Scott Lake Manor Section 8, according to the plat thereof, as recorded in Plat Book 65, at page 117 of the public records of Miami-Dade County, Florida.\" [28] X Research source Metes and bounds descriptions, which are most often used for non-subdivision property. [29] X Research source This type of description identifies the property within a public surveying system. [30] X Research source The boundaries are then described by working around a piece of land, starting with the \"point of beginning.\" [31] X Research source For example, a metes and bounds description might look like this: \"Commence at the NE corner of the East 1/2 of West 1/2 of NE 1/4 of SW 1/4 of Section 17, Township 1 North, Range 12 West and run South 0 degrees 03'08\" E, 28 feet to the South right of way line of Silver Lake Road and the point of beginning; thence continue S 0 degree 03'08\" E, 409.67 feet; thence N 89 degree 54'41\" W, 314.69 feet to the East line of a 20 foot easement...\" [32] X Research source This description would continue until it gets back to the point of beginning."

[34] X Research source The words of conveyance will differ depending on what type of deed you are using. For example, if you are using a quitclaim deed, your words of conveyance may be \"convey and quitclaim.\" [35] X Research source If you are using a general warranty deed, your deed may read \"convey and warrant.\" [36] X Research source Finally, if you are using a special warranty deed, you may insert \"convey and specially warrant.\" [37] X Research source"

      "content": "Deliver the deed. A deed is of no effect and is not valid until it is delivered. [42] X Research source In this context, delivery means much more than simply handing the deed to the grantee. The grantor must have the intention, at the time of delivery, to pass title immediately. [43] X Research source This intention is not present, if, for example, you give a deed to John but you tell him not to record it until you die. [44] X Research source Delivery will be presumed if the deed is found in grantee's possession or if the deed has been recorded. [45] X Research source However, this presumption is rebuttable.
