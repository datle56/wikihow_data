Choose a level surface that’s high up with nothing underneath and at least 12 inches away from walls. Don't place your humidifier underneath a shelf or near paper or curtains. Nearby objects tend to get dampened by the humidifier. Before you turn on the humidifier, check the equipment and the cords to ensure they're in good condition.

However, if your humidifier doesn’t explicitly say it’s compatible with those items, don’t use them. Recommended humidity levels are normally between 30–50%. When not in use, turn off the humidifier.

There are many different types of humidifiers on the market, so finding the best humidifier for your needs and circumstances is very important. A few of the most common humidifiers include: [9] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Central humidifiers . Central humidifiers are used to humidify an entire house. They are built into the house’s heating and cooling system. Evaporators . Evaporators are smaller humidifiers that use filters and fans to add moisture to the air. These types of humidifiers tend to be very affordable. Impeller humidifiers . Impeller humidifiers release a cool mist into the air. This is especially good news for people who have children in the house. These humidifiers use fast-moving disks to release their mist and work best for single rooms. Steam vaporizers . Steam vaporizers heat the water in the reservoirs and force it to cool before releasing it into the air as a mist. These are the most economically friendly humidifiers, but they can release hotter mists, which can cause burns. Ultrasonic humidifiers . Ultrasonic humidifiers use vibrations to release moisture into the air. Since these come in both cool and warm mist variations, they are a good choice for a home with children. Pick one that is sized properly for your intended use and room volume, and be aware that they will vary in cost depending on size and features."
