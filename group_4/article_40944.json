      "content": "Boil the baby bottle components for 10 minutes. Separate the glass bottle components (like the teat and rings) and submerge them all in a water-filled pot. Then, turn on the heat and let the bottle parts boil for 10 minutes. To remove and use the bottles, grab a pair of clean tongs or handle the bottles with washed hands (after the water has cooled down). [1] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Inspect the teats afterward, since they can become cracked or damaged after being boiled. Double-check that there are no air bubbles stuck in the glass bottles before you start boiling them. Lactation consultant Mor Volner urges new parents to strike a balance in their sterilization practices, especially when it comes to boiling. Volner reminds that “you don’t need to boil the bottle for an hour, but you do want to make sure it’s cleaned adequately. The key is learning a balance—you don’t have to go to extremes.” [2] X Expert Source Mor Levy Volner, IBCLC, RDN International Board Certified Lactation Consultant Expert Interview. 5 May 2020. Important note: Always double-check the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure that your glass bottle and its components are safe to boil. For instance, Dr. Brown’s Natural Flow glass bottle is considered safe to boil according to its instruction manual."

Separate your glass bottle components and submerge them in the solution, getting rid of any air bubbles as you notice them. Wait 2 minutes before removing the components with a clean set of tongs or washed hands. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The CDC advises against rinsing baby bottle items sanitized with bleach, since the water can bring in new types of bacteria. Instead, just let the items air-dry on a towel—the bleach residue will disappear quickly and won’t hurt your infant."
