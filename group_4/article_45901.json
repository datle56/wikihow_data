Bissell recommends that you only use Bissell brand cleaning solution in the Little Green machine.

The max temperature recommended for a Little Green cleaner is 140 °F (60 °C). [5] X Research source Most household water heaters are set between 120–140 °F (49–60 °C), so using the hottest water from your tap is probably fine.

Bissell Boost is a concentrated cleaner that may help break down dirt, odors, and stains that might otherwise be tough to remove. Bissell recommends adding a small amount of Boost to each tank of cleaning solution. [7] X Research source Bissell Boost comes in different formulas as well, including pet odor removal and stain removal."

      "content": "Vacuum the area first to pick up loose dirt. Rohr recommends using a traditional vacuum “to remove dry soil and as much hair as possible” before you use a carpet cleaning machine. Dirt, hair, and other debris can clog up your Little Green, so vacuuming first can help extend the life of your carpet cleaner. If you have a pet that sheds a lot, Rohr also recommends using a carpet rake to pick up even more pet hair."

If you’re trying to get rid of an especially stubborn stain, apply a pre-treating solution and let it sit a few minutes before you use the Little Green. [9] X Research source If you use a commercial pre-treating product like Bissell Pretreat spray , check the label directions for specifics like how long to leave the cleaner on the stain and what materials you can use it on. To clean tough stains like spilled wine, Monge recommends using a paste made from baking soda and hot water. Spread it evenly over the stain and let it sit for about 15–30 minutes, then follow up with the carpet cleaner."

Find the size and shape of the cleaning attachment you want to use, then slide it onto the hose until you hear a click. [10] X Research source Depending on the model of your Bissell Little Green, you may have different cleaning tools to choose from. For instance, the Little Green Pet Pro comes with a Self-Cleaning Tough Stain Tool, which is designed to clean yucky pet messes out of the Little Green so you don’t have to touch them.

Then, place the cleaning tool over the area you want to clean. Press and hold the spray trigger until water starts to spray out of the end of the cleaning tool. This is called priming the machine, and you'll need to do it every time you use the Little Green. [12] X Research source Always use a grounded outlet when you plug in your Bissell Little Green. [13] X Research source The spray trigger should be located at the end of the hose near the cleaning attachment. It usually takes about 30 seconds to prime the Little Green, so don’t worry if you don’t see water coming out before then."

Move the cleaning tool back and forth, misting the section you want to clean until it’s thoroughly saturated. But don’t use too much water—Rohr says that oversaturating the carpet is one of the biggest mistakes homeowners make, and it can take days for the carpet to dry afterward. If the area is really dirty or stained, let the cleaning solution sit on the carpet for about 5 minutes, then continue cleaning. [14] X Research source"

Place your cleaning tool at the top of the stain and tilt it forward—there’s a channel running across the top that will suck up water. Slowly move the head of the cleaning tool backward toward you. Then, repeat that process until you’ve picked up as much of the excess water as possible. [16] X Research source You should be able to feel the suction when the opening makes contact with the surface you’re cleaning. Watch the end of your cleaning tool—you’ll be able to see dirty water entering the hose. When you can’t see any more water entering the nozzle, you’ll know you’ve picked up as much as you can."

When it’s time to empty the tank, turn off the power, pull the lever on the tank, and lift the tank away from the machine. Pour the water down a sink drain or into a toilet, then rinse the dirty water tank and cleaning tool to with fresh water to prevent odors. [17] X Research source If you hear a change in your Little Green during the cleaning process and it seems to lose suction, check the dirty water tank—it’s probably full. Do not overfill the dirty water tank. If it reaches the Full line, stop and empty the tank right away. If you’re cleaning a large area or a really difficult stain, you may need to empty and refill the tank more than once during the process. Do not dispose of used carpet cleaning solution outside—not only is it bad for the environment, but in some places, it may actually be illegal. [18] X Research source"

Find the flex hose clip—it should be labeled in your user manual. Then, press it into the opening on the front of the Little Green. You’ll hear a click when it’s correctly inserted. [19] X Research source This process may vary slightly by model, so check your owner's manual for specific instructions.

It’s normal for the Little Green to have less power when the dirty water tank is full—this is actually a feature intended to keep water from getting into the motor. [23] X Research source But if you’ve already emptied the tank and it still isn’t working, try this: Make sure the clean and dirty water tanks are both fully seated in the machine. [24] X Research source Clean any clogs out of the cleaning hose. [25] X Research source Inspect the cleaning tool for damage. [26] X Research source Take off the dirty water tank and put your hand over the duct. If there’s no suction, you may have an issue that requires servicing."

Wipe the area underneath the tank with a cloth or paper towel, then replace the tank and see if the problem is resolved. Sometimes debris can get trapped under the clean water tank, blocking water from entering the hose. [27] X Research source If that doesn’t work, try cleaning out the end of the spray tip with a paperclip or another small object.

But that float can pick up dirt and grime, which can cause water to leak from the water tank. If that happens, rinse the dirty water tank and the float with clean water, then reassemble the machine and see if that helps. [29] X Research source If that doesn’t fix the issue, remove and clean the duck bill gasket. You may need to unfasten a screw to remove the gasket. [30] X Research source If the leaks are coming from the clean water tank, check the tank and cap or valve for damage. You may need to replace them.
