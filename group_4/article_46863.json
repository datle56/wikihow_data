      "content": "Understand that an English wheel is used to bend and form sheet metal to make useable parts. It is, essentially, a rectangular frame bolted to a large stand. The frame is shaped in the form of a closed letter ‘C’. At one end of the frame are two wheels that are used to form the sheet metal. The top wheel is called the rolling wheel, while the bottom wheel is known as the anvil wheel. [1] X Research source On an average, the size of the rolling wheel has a width of 8 centimeter (3.1 in) (3\") and the anvil wheel has a diameter of 25cm (10\"). [2] X Research source The depth of the C frame is known as the throat. The depth determines the size of the sheet metal that can be formed using the English wheel. Equipment manufacturers can produce English wheels with throat depths up to 120cm (48\"). Some machines even have designs that allow the wheels to turn at a 90° angle so as to incorporate larger sheet metal. Two common metals that are formed using the English wheel are steel and aluminum. The lower jaw of the frame that holds the anvil wheel is adjustable to provide a range of forming capabilities as the metal thins. [3] X Research source The die holder for the anvil wheel is controlled by a screw with a handle which adjusts the gap between the anvil wheel and the rolling wheel. There is usually a lever attached to the lower wheel which will open jaws so that the formed metal can be easily removed."

      "content": "Adjust the gap between the wheels. Turn the handle under the lower jaw to adjust the space between the wheels. A smaller the gap will apply more pressure to the sheet metal."

      "content": "Remove the sheet metal after forming is complete. Many English wheels are equipped with a lever just under the anvil wheel. The lever increases the gap so you can remove the sheet metal easily without changing your settings."
