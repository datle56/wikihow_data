      "title": "On Snapchat, “WTV” is shorthand for “whatever.”",
      "content": "On Snapchat, “WTV” is shorthand for “whatever.” Snapchat is all about connecting fast; who has time to spell out “whatever” in its entirety, anyways? “WTV” can be used in all of the ways that “whatever” would be used. “WTV” means the same thing on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, too. There’s no variation from platform to platform. [1] X Research source For example, someone might send a message like: “I’m down for WTV you wanna do.” “It’s WTV.” “WTV. Don’t worry about it.”"

      "title": "\"WTV\" is also short for “whatever” over text.",
      "content": "\"WTV\" is also short for “whatever” over text. This acronym’s meaning doesn’t change outside of social media, so if someone drops “WTV” in a text convo, it’s still “whatever.” Notably, there’s no difference between “WTV,” “Wtv,” or “wtv.” [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Drop a “WTV” to communicate apathy or indifference.",
      "content": "Drop a “WTV” to communicate apathy or indifference. “Whatever” is most often used to convey a laid-back attitude. You could send “WTV” to play it cool when you don’t want to come on too strong or eager, or use it to really let someone know you couldn’t care less. [3] X Research source For example: Them: “Do you want Italian or Indian tonight?” You: “WTV! I could go for anything.” Them: “Do you like Marvel movies?” You: “They’re WTV.” Them: “What do you want to do tonight?” You: “WTV. I don’t have strong feelings about it.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Send “WTV” to describe a large number of possibilities.",
      "content": "Send “WTV” to describe a large number of possibilities. “Whatever” can also convey options! If you want to casually emphasize that someone has a ton of choices (or that their choice isn’t important, but in a good way), this is a chill way to go about it. [4] X Research source Examples might include: Them: “We can either write an essay or shoot a video for Mr. Johnson’s homework, right?” You: ”Yup! WTV you want to do. You can even make a diorama.” Them: “Are we required to show up at 7 pm exactly?” You: “Nah, it’s WTV. Show up when you want.” Them: “Is there an itinerary for this weekend?” You: “Nope. You can do WTV your heart desires!”"

      "title": "Use “WTV” to dismiss someone who is bugging you.",
      "content": "Use “WTV” to dismiss someone who is bugging you. Is someone getting on your nerves a bit? Want to throw a little shade without being too forward? “WTV” can be a sneaky way of writing someone off without being super confrontational. [5] X Research source For example: Them: “I really don’t get why you won’t apologize.” You: “Fine, WTV. Sry.” Them: “Can I come to your house in an hour? I’m bored.” You: “WTV.” Them: “You haven’t congratulated me on my first date haha.” You: “Look, it’s WTV. I don’t care.”"

      "title": "Ask for clarification if “whatever” isn’t enough info for you.",
      "content": "Ask for clarification if “whatever” isn’t enough info for you. If someone has dropped a “WTV” in a convo with you and you want them to give you an actual answer, there’s nothing wrong with asking for more. People occasionally say “whatever” when they want you to make a choice for them or to convey apathy. If that doesn’t work for you, say so. You might say: You: “Do you want to go to New York with me this summer?” Them: “WTV. I’m down.” You: “No, seriously. I’m planning the trip right now. Do you want to go?”"

      "title": "Thank them for their help if they’ve answered your question.",
      "content": "Thank them for their help if they’ve answered your question. If you were reaching out for information and the other person successfully filled you in with a “WTV,” thank them and move on. For example: You: “Hey, can I pay you back on Friday when I get paid?” Them: “WTV works for you.” You: “Sweet, thanks for being flexible.”"

    {
      "title": "Don’t respond to “WTV” if it’s the natural end of the convo.",
      "content": "Don’t respond to “WTV” if it’s the natural end of the convo. “WTV” is often a reasonable closing point for a conversation. If you’re getting the vibe that an interaction is slowing down to a halt and someone drops a “WTV,” you may not need to say anything at all. You: “Can we talk later this week? I’m super busy today.” Them: “WTV works for you!”"

      "title": "What’s the verdict",
      "content": "What’s the verdict In some cases, “WTV” may refer to “what’s the verdict?” This is a way of asking whether a decision has been made. [6] X Research source Typically, someone is looking for you to make a choice when they ask what the verdict is, so don’t hesitate to take the lead here! For example, someone might ask: “Are we going out tonight or staying in? WTV?” “WTV? Are we car shopping today or nah?” “Are we getting Indian or Mexican food tonight? WTV?”"

      "title": "What’s the vibe",
      "content": "What’s the vibe A “vibe” refers to a general mood or energy. A good vibe might include fun in the sun with positive friends, while a bad vibe could refer to an awkward party or cringe-worthy social interaction. [7] X Research source If someone says “WTV” when they’re checking in on how an event or night out is going, they’re likely asking for a vibe check. Someone may say: “You at Randy’s place? WTV over there?” “I’m over at O’Callaghan’s Pub, but it’s kind of slow. WTV over at Smith’s?” “Hey, WTV for dinner tonight? We dressing up or am I good in sweatpants?”"
