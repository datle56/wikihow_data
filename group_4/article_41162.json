      "content": "Understand the basics of grandparent visitation. Every state has different requirements for granting grandparent visitation. In some states, grandparents can only get visitation if the parent who is their child has died or if the parents are divorcing. In other states there is no such limitation. [2] X Research source Furthermore, every state will require that grandparent visitation be in the “best interests of the child.” [3] X Research source This term refers to a variety of factors, including: [4] X Research source the need for stability and continuity the child’s interactions with the grandparents the child’s wishes (if the child is old enough) the age and sex of the child For more information on how your state determines a child’s “best interests,” you should research your state law.

      "content": "Gather evidence. In order to terminate grandparent visitation, you need to show that there has been a change of circumstances and that grandparent visitation is no longer in the child’s best interests. [5] X Research source You should think back to why the judge said he or she was ordering grandparent visitation in the first place. For example, the judge might have believed that the child and the grandparents shared a close bond. If that is no longer the case, then you need evidence to show the judge that the child rarely sees the grandparents. If the grandparents have moved, then collect letters, Christmas cards, or emails that illustrate that fact. Also, your child can testify as to the amount of time that he or she sees their grandparents."

      "content": "Meet with an attorney. Family law is complicated and often changes. You should probably consult with an attorney if you are trying to terminate grandparent visitation. A lawyer can listen to your situation and advise you about what evidence you will need and what your chances of prevailing are. You can find a qualified family law attorney by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. For more tips on locating a family law attorney, see Find a Good Attorney . You might hesitate to call an attorney because you are worried about costs. However, you should realize that most states now allow attorneys to offer “unbundled” legal services (also called “limited scope representation”). Under this arrangement, you can give the lawyer discrete tasks, such as drafting a motion or appearing in court. You can also hire an attorney just for advice. Be sure to ask if the lawyer offers unbundled services when you call to set up a consultation."

Be as specific as possible about why circumstances have changed and why continued visitation is no longer in the child’s best interests. For example, you could argue that the child is now so busy in typical teenage activities that extended trips to visit grandparents is too intrusive. After completing the motion, make several copies. One copy is for the grandparents and another copy is for your records. If the grandparents do not live together, then make sure to send one copy to each grandparent that has visitation."
