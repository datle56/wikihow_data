      "title": "Choose a crop top length.",
      "content": "Choose a crop top length. Some crop tops fall to just below the bra-line, while others stop right above the belly button. Longer crop tops can cover most of the belly and just leave a small strip of skin above your waistband. Paired with the right bottoms, any length can suit just about any occasion and body type, so go with whatever makes you feel most comfortable. [1] X Research source For the most flattering fit on any body type, go for a crop top that lands just above your natural waistline. Highlighting the narrowest part of your torso will give a sleek, slimming effect to your overall look, especially when paired with high-waisted bottoms."

      "title": "Decide on a fit.",
      "content": "Decide on a fit. A tight crop top will look best with a looser pair of pants or skirt, although it can be paired with a tighter bottom if you’re planning a night out. More relaxed, loose t-shirt or tank styles pair nicely with high-waisted jeans or shorts for more casual or edgy looks."

      "title": "Go with whatever style makes you feel comfortable and beautiful.",
      "content": "Go with whatever style makes you feel comfortable and beautiful. Some conventional wisdom says that shorter, fitted crop tops are best-suited to thinner girls, but a few social media or Internet searches will show you that crops tops of all lengths and fits can suit any body type. If you see a crop top you like, just try it on. You may be surprised by what flatters you!"

      "title": "Pair it with high-waisted shorts for a flirty, beachy look.",
      "content": "Pair it with high-waisted shorts for a flirty, beachy look. The loose crop top skims over your tummy while the shorts accentuate your waist for a casual but figure-flattering look. You can tailor the waistline of your shorts based on how much skin you want to show. A high-waisted pair with a loose, longer crop top could cover your whole torso, while a shorter top and lower-riding shorts could reveal a strip of skin. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Layer a short crop top under overalls for a playful vibe. Unbutton the sides of your overalls to expose some peek-a-boo skin on the sides of your torso, creating a look that’s retro, modest and fun.

      "content": "Try a tie-front top for a summery, more conservative look. Tie-front tops give a cute, retro vibe and cover a bit more skin than the usual crop top--just a bit of skin will show over your bottoms. [4] X Research source You can also make your own tie-front top by tying up a button-down shirt. This is a great way to ease into the crop top look, since you can make the top as short or long as you want."
