Some general manufacturer names like \"Flonase\" won't work, but specific product names, like \"Flonase Sensimist\" will. If you don't know the name and brand of the product you want to write a review about, you shouldn't write the review because you could end up writing a review for a similar, but not the same, product! This method works for reviewing movies, products, and places!"
