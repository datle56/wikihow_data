      "content": "Choose your stain for the project. You have a choice of oil based, water based and gel stains. Each one has slightly different qualities that make it ideal for one wood but not another. An example of this is that some trees, such as teak and rosewood, have more natural oil in them than other woods such as oak or hickory. The oily wood will not take a water based stain as well as one of the less oily woods, so this has to be considered when choosing stains. The basic steps for staining veneer are the same but setting and waiting times are different for each of the stains, gel, oil and water."
