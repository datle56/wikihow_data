      "content": "End the relationship if you're still together. If you're trying to stop loving someone who you're currently with, it's time to break up with them. Whether this person doesn't love you back or if your relationship has taken a turn for the worse, sit them down and break the news gently but firmly. [1] X Research source Say “Though I love you very much, it's time for me to move on. You told me that you don’t love me, and I'd like to have a relationship with someone who cares for me as much as I care for them.” You can also say “Though I love you very much, we haven't been happy for a long time. I cry more than I smile and I don’t think this is healthy. We can talk about it more, but I have made my decision.”"

      "title": "Limit seeing the person you love.",
      "content": "Limit seeing the person you love. When you're trying to move on from someone, spend as little time around them as you can. Drive a different route to work or walk an alternative way to class. If you have mutual friends, hang out with them less if you know the one you love will be around. If you work or have class together, only talk when necessary."

      "content": "Unfollow, unfriend or block them on social media. Remember: out of sight, out of mind. Avoid seeing the person you love both in person and online. Block them from all your social media accounts so neither of you has access to one another. If you don’t want to block them, at least unfriend or unfollow them so you don’t have to see their posts in your newsfeed."

      "title": "Cut off any unnecessary communication with them.",
      "content": "Cut off any unnecessary communication with them. Avoid speaking to this person even if they reach out to you. The less you communicate with them, the quicker you can fall out of love. However, it's necessary to communicate in some instances. If you have a child together, are working on a project at work, or if they are asking for their things back, you will need to talk. [2] X Research source If you must talk, do so in a neutral location that won’t bring up old feelings, like a coffee shop. Be civil with them but avoid being too friendly. When you talk, it’s okay to be polite and ask how they’ve been, but get to the point of the conversation quickly. Say something like “I’m glad you’re doing well! So let’s talk about Josiah now. His first day of Pre-K is tomorrow and we need to make a schedule for picking him up every day.”"

      "content": "Focus on their flaws instead of the good times. You might be thinking of the laughter and fun that you shared with the one you love; instead, remember the not-so-good times. There’s a reason you don’t want to love this person anymore. Focus on what led you to this decision. Think about the time they were rude to your mother, made you cry on your birthday, or how selfish they were in general."

      "content": "Get support from your friends. Letting go of the love you have for someone is tough, but with a little help from your friends and family, you can do it. Rather than isolating yourself, call up a friend to talk. You can talk through your feelings for the person you’re trying to fall out of love with or just catch up on other things in your lives. [4] X Research source Try not to call them too often upset about the relationship ending, however. No matter how good a friend they are, they won’t want to hear sad news all the time. Reader Poll: We asked 523 wikiHow readers who they’d reach out to if they needed to vent about someone they love, and 53% said they’d connect with their closest friends to find the support they need.

Though new relationships are exciting, avoid rebounds. Don’t start going out on dates until you have moved on completely. Some signs that you’ve moved on are crying less often, not thinking of them when you wake up or go to bed, and not getting emotional when you hear your old songs."
