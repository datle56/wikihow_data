      "content": "FedEx Home Delivery is their residential ground-only priority shipping service. If you’re going to ship something to a home, you’re shipping it in the domestic United States, and you require the package to arrive in 1-5 days, Home Delivery is likely an attractive option for you. Importantly, Home Delivery operates every day of the week and during the evenings, so it’s a great option if you want your package to arrive on a weekend or after 5 pm. [1] X Research source You cannot ship to a business or PO box with Home Delivery. Packages shipped via Home Delivery will not be placed on a plane. However, unlike USPS Ground Advantage , you cannot ship HAZMAT materials that require ground shipping with FedEx Home Delivery. Packages cannot be shipped using Home Delivery if they’re bigger than 108 inches (270 cm) in length and 165 inches (420 cm) in length plus width and height."

The most unique thing about Home Delivery is that FedEx will deliver your package during the weekend or after 5 pm. This is a big draw, especially in an age where packages tend to go missing during the day when porch pirates are running around.
