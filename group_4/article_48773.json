      "content": "Are you signed in somewhere else? If somebody starts listening to a song or podcast on another device that's logged in with your Spotify account, Spotify will pause on your device. For example, if your Spotify account is connected to an Amazon Alexa speaker at home and someone asks Alexa to play a song while you're listening to Spotify in your car, your Spotify will stop so the other person can listen. To see where your Spotify account is currently in use, click or tap the speaker icon near the bottom-right corner of Spotify. You can disconnect other devices remotely by tapping the three dots and selecting Forget Device .

      "content": "Some mobile games and video apps pause Spotify automatically. Does Spotify pause when you open another app on your Android, iPhone, or iPad? While most apps won't stop your music or podcast, Roblox , Genshin Impact , and apps and websites that automatically play videos will pause Spotify to take control of your speaker. If you're playing a game with in-game music and/or sound effects, try disabling those in the game's settings. This works for some games but not others. When using headphones with audio controls ( such as AirPods ), try starting the music again from the headphones after opening the offending app or game. If Spotify pauses while you're browsing the web, social media, or a news app, a video is probably auto-playing on the page. The only fix is to avoid that site or app while using Spotify."

      "content": "Your device settings may prevent Spotify from running when minimized. If you're listening to Spotify but not actively using your device, Spotify may pause the music after a period of inactivity.

      "title": "If your internet or Bluetooth connection is poor, Spotify may pause at random.",
      "content": "If your internet or Bluetooth connection is poor, Spotify may pause at random. Spotify may stop if your internet connection is slow or overloaded because it can't load the music. If you're listening to Spotify using a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth speaker or headphones, something may be interfering with your listening device. If you're using Wi-Fi to listen, try moving closer to the Wi-Fi access point. You can also run a speed test to see if there's something wrong with your connection. Try restarting your router and connecting to a different network. If Spotify keeps pausing when you're using Bluetooth or wireless speakers, make sure you're in range. Also, try pairing your device with a different speaker or headset to see if that fixes the problem. You can also try lowering the streaming quality in the Spotify app to prevent it from pausing to buffer. Setting the quality to \"Automatic\" can help when your connection is slow: Mobile app: Tap your profile photo, select Settings and privacy , tap Audio quality , and select Automatic . Desktop app: Click your profile photo, select Settings , and select Automatic from the \"Streaming quality\" menu."
