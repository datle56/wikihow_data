[5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you start feeling back pain, stop whatever you’re doing.

If your doctor says it’s okay, take over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve) to relieve your pain and reduce the inflammation in your body that’s adding to your symptoms. However, your pain may persist if you severely injured your muscles or spine. In this case, your doctor might prescribe prescription painkillers, muscle relaxers, or corticosteroid injections to control pain and reduce inflammation. [17] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source If you can't take NSAIDs, you may be able to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead. Although it won't reduce your inflammation, it can help relieve your pain. It’s best to use as little pain medication as possible because it can get addictive. Always follow your doctor’s advice and read the labels on your medications. Don’t take more pain relievers than are recommended, even if your pain doesn’t go away. Interventional pain specialist Stuart Rammell suggests that making lifestyle changes, such as focusing on weight loss and cardiovascular health, can also help minimize back pain.
