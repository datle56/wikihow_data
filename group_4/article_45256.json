      "content": "A stimulating chat can get an Aquarius woman in the mood. An Aquarius woman appreciates intelligence. Bring up thought-provoking subjects like philosophy, art, and humanitarian causes to get her really hot and bothered. Make your conversation more flirty by engaging in a fiery debate. An Aquarius will be super turned on by a battle of wits with a potential suitor. After a movie date, take out your Aquarius for a nightcap or a treat to talk about the movie. You might say, \"I didn't love the ending of that film. I felt like the audience deserved more closure. What about you?\" Text her a link to a thought-provoking article or even a poem. Add the caption, \"I'd love to hear your interpretation of this. Can't get enough of your mind ðŸ˜Š\" Respect her point of view in the conversation to keep things light and flirty. Getting super emotional or dismissing her point of view might turn off an Aquarius woman."

      "content": "An Aquarius woman is turned on by a good sense of humor. Text her funny memes and GIFs, make humorous observations when you're out and about, and laugh at her jokes, too. Joking around with you will help her relax and get in the mood. [1] X Research source Text her a GIF from a funny TV show. An Aquarius will likely enjoy something from a more offbeat comedy, like Futurama or Daria. Try a humorous or relatable meme. This zodiac sign is interested in all things strange and whimsical, so she will likely really appreciate an astrology meme about her sign. When you're out with her, point out things you find humorous in conversation. An Aquarius will think it's hilarious if you point out a funny squirrel at the park, for example, even if you're in the middle of a romantic stroll. This may not seem like a turn-on, but an Aquarius woman needs to feel like you're her friend first and lover second. To an Aquarius, friendship with her romantic partners is the ultimate aphrodisiac."

Walk tall with your head held high, and remind yourself of all of your talents and accomplishments anytime your confidence falters. [8] X Research source"
