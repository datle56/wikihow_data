Once you reach level 20, you'll learn the Summon Sayeed skill immediately. [1] X Research source You used to need Soul Shards to cast this spell, but that feature has been removed. Instead, you use 100% of your base mana. [2] X Research source This spell uses 10 seconds to complete casting, so summoning your Succubus before a fight is a good idea."

As of Dragonflight patch 10.1.5, you can swap between your Summon Sayeed spell summoning an Incubus or a Succubus at the Barber.

      "content": "What are their skills? The Succubus/Incubus minion is more like a rogue in the shadows, with more CC and slow skills than damage. These minions have: Lash of Pain. This melee attack deals Shadow damage at 30% of your Spell power. This crits more often than not if your minion has Lesser Invisibility active. However, if the enemy you're fighting is resistant to Shadow damage, they can resist Lash of Pain. [4] X Research source If you cast Curse of the Elements from your warlock to your target, Lash of Pain can deal more damage. Lesser Invisibility. This skill allows the Sayeed to become invisible for 5 minutes. [5] X Research source Whiplash. This skill whips the enemy, which reduces their movement speed by 50% and increases damage taken from the demon minion by 1% for 15 seconds. It stacks up to 10 times. [6] X Research source Seduction. This skill disorients the enemy, which causes them to walk toward the demon for 30 seconds. Damage can break this effect. The Sayeed can only use this skill against humanoids. [7] X Research source This skill can have diminishing returns if used in PvP. This is a great CC spell!"
