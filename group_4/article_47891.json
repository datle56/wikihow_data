      "content": "The TikTok acronym “BBL” stands for “Brazilian Butt Lift.” A Brazilian butt lift is a cosmetic surgery procedure where a surgeon removes excess fat from the hips, abdomen, lower back, or thighs with liposuction, then injects the fat into the butt—making it look larger. [1] X Research source On TikTok, many users post “BBL transformation” videos to show off their results, while others use the term to discuss celebrities who may have gotten work done. “Do you think J-Lo had a BBL?” “I can’t believe she went to Miami to get a BBL.” “Did you see the results of her BBL? Her body is insane!” “Peep Laura’s 🍑 I think she might have gotten a BBL👀”"

      "content": "The acronym “BBL” also stands for “Be back later.” People use the acronym “BBL” when they have to leave a text conversation but plan to return soon. They’re likely running an errand or helping someone out, so they won’t be able to respond to any messages for the time being. [2] X Research source “The plumber’s here to fix my sink. BBL.” “BBL, gotta pick up my sister from school🏫” “Heading out to eat dinner with my fam. BBL.” “At the post office to drop off a package📦 BBL✌️”"

      "title": "\"Big Booty Latina\"",
      "content": "\"Big Booty Latina\" Some guys consider “BBL” to mean the sexual expression “Big Booty Latina.” [4] X Research source Because it’s a common stereotype that Latina women have curvy, hourglass figures, the acronym is a way to refer to (and objectify) the type of women they want to hook-up with. “Bro, do you know any BBLs?” “Check out that BBL by the bar.” “ GYATT ! That BBL on Kai’s livestream is an 11/10.”"

      "content": "Many users choose to document their “BBL transformations” on TikTok. Since cosmetic procedures are becoming more normalized on social media, many people feel comfortable sharing videos of their bodies before and after surgery. [5] X Research source The Brazilian butt lift is particularly popular because it has instant (and often dramatic) results. Most people with BBLs transfer fat from their waist and thighs to their butt, getting an hourglass shape . [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source People who are interested in getting a BBL often comment on these transformation videos to get more information. They usually ask the creator about the cost, their “stats” (weight and height before surgery), and where they got their procedure done (country, clinic, and doctor)."

      "content": "Some users joke that those with BBLs adopt entirely new personalities. Known as “The BBL Effect” on TikTok, this viral trend of parody videos claims that when someone gets a Brazilian butt lift, they transform into the definition of “bad and boujee.” In other words, they always look their best, believe they’re better than everyone else, and seem to be mildly unimpressed no matter how much money is spent. [8] X Research source In April 2021, TikTok user @antonibumba posted a parody video of how someone with a BBL might eat takeout food. The video quickly went viral, and many users began creating videos reenacting the mannerisms of those who get BBLs."
