      "title": "Say thanks with a thoughtful gift.",
      "content": "Say thanks with a thoughtful gift. Party favors are great ways to show you appreciated someone’s presence as well as give them something tangible to remind them of your party for years to come. Send them in the mail with your thank-you notes—or hang them out at the door as your guests leave the party! For a kid’s birthday party, you could send guests off with a goodie bag of generic plastic party favors, but if you want to be more eco-conscious, try something more creative, like cool rocks, or even money! [2] X Research source Don’t be afraid to get creative or try to match the party’s theme. For instance, after a tea party, you might send guests away with tea cups—don’t want to break the bank? Try thrifting tea cups!—and put a few of your favorite tea bags or cookies in the cup for guests to enjoy later. For a more elegant, formal event, like a wedding, consider doing a bit more planning: for instance, you can make (or hire a professional) bespoke perfume or a bespoke candle that will remind guests of your special day whenever they smell it."
