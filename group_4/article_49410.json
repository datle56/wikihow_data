      "title": "Write about the events of your day.",
      "content": "Write about the events of your day. Think about everything that happened that day and record any highlights or feelings that stand out to you. Even if you had a pretty standard day, you might be surprised by deeper thoughts and feelings that come up as you write down details about your day. Feel free to veer off into any topic you want as you're writing about the day's events. For example, you could write about the English exam you took at school that day. Are you feeling good about the exam? Do you wish you had studied more? Are you nervous to receive your grade?"

      "content": "Contemplate your goals for the future and how to achieve them . Make a list of your short-term and long-term goals. Then, go through each item on the list and write in detail about your plan to accomplish the goal. Breaking each goal up into smaller tasks that you can work on can make your goals feel less overwhelming. [1] X Research source For example, you could write about short-term goals like studying for your algebra exam or hitting the gym for a cardio session. Long-term goals would be stuff like choosing and applying to colleges or saving up money to buy a car."

      "content": "Jot down your current feelings or mood. Don't worry about providing any context for your emotions, just focus on accurately describing what they are. You can then use those feelings and thoughts as prompts for creating detailed diary entries. Work on one thought or emotion at a time and explore it as fully as you can. For example, if you're feeling sad, you can write a diary entry about why you feel that way and any events that may have contributed. You can add a line from the lyrics of a song you are often listening to in your entry to preserve the current mood. Reader Poll: We asked 487 wikiHow readers what type of emotion they draw the most inspiration from, and 46% of them said sadness. [Take Poll]"

      "content": "Write down inspirational quotes and what they mean to you. Inspirational quotes can come from anywhere—a famous person, your favorite book or movie, or even a friend or a family member. Any quote you find inspiring is a great starting point. Record the quote in your diary and note where it came from. Then, explain what it means to you in your own words. [2] X Research source For example, you might write down a quote like, \"The secret of getting ahead is getting started,\" which came from Mark Twain. Write a diary entry about what this means to you and what things you need to get started on to achieve certain goals."

The subjects can be anything you want, as long as they interest and inspire you. Then, choose one item from the list and create a diary entry about it. [3] X Research source For example, if you love sports, write about why you love a certain sport, your favorite teams, and personal goals you have if you play any sports yourself.

      "content": "Write the date in the corner or on the first line. You may not write in your diary every day, so dating your entries can help you keep track of when things happened. Since you'll be writing in your diary over a long period of time, dates will also help you stay organized and provide context when you look back on your entries in the future.

[5] X Trustworthy Source Reading Rockets Online resource supported by PBS providing research-based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers Go to source Once you start writing, you're free to veer off into any subject you like!

      "content": "Open with \"Dear Diary\" if you want to. This is a completely personal choice, so go with what works best and feels right for you. At first, addressing the \"Diary\" can feel almost like reaching out to a friend rather than simply writing or talking to yourself. You may find this helpful if you're new to journaling."

      "title": "Write in the first person by using \"I\" statements.",
      "content": "Write in the first person by using \"I\" statements. Diaries are very personal items, and they typically work best when you speak in the first person. In your diary, you are free to make everything about you! Many people find this aspect extremely cathartic, especially when it comes to exploring personal thoughts, emotions, and reactions. For example, you might write something like, \"I'm worried about volleyball tryouts this week. I've practiced a lot and I feel ready, but I'm so nervous I can hardly eat.\""

      "title": "Be honest",
      "content": "Be honest in your entries. Many people find diary writing cathartic because they can let go of inhibitions on the page and truly be themselves. Feel free to record your emotions, both positive and negative, in their entirety in your diary. Remember that no one will ever see what you've written, so you can write honestly about anything. This is for your eyes only. For example, you might write, \"I feel jealous of Shaun's new car. I'm happy for him, but it seems really unfair that his parents bought him a brand new car. I'm working every day after school just to save up for a used car.\" If you're afraid someone will find and read your diary, there are things you can do to prevent this. Physical diaries with locks and password-protected digital diaries are two of the most popular ways to control privacy. Many people have epiphanies about themselves and their relationships through honest diary writing. Be open to learning about yourself as you write."

      "content": "Use lots of details to preserve moments in time. Diaries help you preserve thoughts and feelings as they're happening. You're also able to record events immediately after they happen when details are still fresh in your mind. Since memories can become unreliable, especially as time passes, recording precise details vividly can help you preserve moments in time exactly as they occurred. [7] X Research source Detailed writing isn't for everyone, so don't feel like you have to write long, wordy sentences. If you find it easier to express your emotions in short bursts or even bullet points, feel free to do that."

      "content": "Keep your writing sessions short in the beginning. You don't have to set aside a huge chunk of time every day for writing in your diary! 10-15 minutes per session is a great goal when you're just starting out.

[9] X Research source For example, you could write a few key bullet points in your diary when you're pressed for time. Setting an intimidating schedule for yourself could be counterproductive. You want journaling to be an outlet, not a chore, so go easy on yourself. Pick a time to write when you don't have other obligations or time constraints."
