      "content": "Research local cell phone carriers in your area. Depending on your region, there will be numerous phone companies with a variety of plans. Go on their website or to their shops and ask for information about their services. Or read reviews and ask others what their experiences are like with their provider. The amount of people using a certain provider is a good indicator of which carrier is the best in your area."

      "title": "Look for a provider with the best network coverage.",
      "content": "Look for a provider with the best network coverage. A good company should be able to provide a large range of reliable coverage and reception. This usually means they will own the most number of cellular towers in order to provide network service to more areas. It ensures that your calls won't be dropped while you're moving from place to place and you'll be able to receive service in low populated or underground locations. Most countries will have a map of all cellular towers that label which towers are used by which provider that you can find by doing a quick internet search. A good provider should have the most towers in your area or areas where you frequent most. A company might advertise plans with great deals but this doesn't necessarily mean they will have a reliable network. A great plan is only useful if you're able to carry out calls and receive service where ever you are. If you travel a lot, consider looking for a carrier that provides national or international coverage."

      "content": "Evaluate data network speeds of cell phone providers. Like network coverage, data coverage depends on your region and the carrier. Data is useful if you plan to use the Internet on your phone or if you have a smartphone. Compare data network speeds between carriers. You can usually find this information on their website or from a sales representative. The higher the number of kilobits per second (kbps), the faster you'll be able to use the internet to upload and download data. Technology is always updating. The latest data \"G\" or generation of mobile technology will be the fastest. However, not all phones can support the latest and fastest data connection. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Decide what cellular service plan is right for you. The plan you choose will dictate what kind of phone you can get, what you can do with your phone, how long you have to stay with the carrier, and how much you'll have to pay each month. Choose a plan that is within your budget but still allows you to have the features you want to use on your phone.

Some common features include: Minutes: How many minutes of call time are you offered per month? How much does it cost to go over the maximum? Do these minutes rollover to the next month if left unused? Some providers designate certain times of the day or days of the week where you can use an unlimited amount of minutes to make and receive calls. Some may offer unlimited calling. Texting: Today, texting is probably the most important must-have feature of cell phones. And most providers will offer unlimited texting or a certain number of free texts. Be careful, some providers may charge you just for opening texts. Data Usage: Providers will offer varying amounts of data you can use each month to download and upload from the Internet. This can range anywhere from 500 MB to 6 GB to an unlimited amount of data usage. Voicemail: There is often an additional charge to use this feature. It is very useful when you can't always answer your phone. However, calling your voicemail box may count towards using up call time minutes. Caller ID: Caller ID is essential in today's world. Most plans will include caller ID now that it is a highly demanded and expected feature. Contracts: Most plans require you to sign a one to three year contract with the provider. Usually, you'll receive a discounted price for the cost of the physical phone up front or a way to finance your phone throughout your contract. However, you'll still be paying the cost of the phone plan through the span of your contract, along with any fees for additional features and taxes. Family Plans: If several members of your family use cell phones, then it may be more affordable to go with a family plan. The number of minutes, data, and texts are shared among your family to use each month."

If you have bad credit, want to save money, or you simply want to try having a cell phone without signing up for a long contract, you may want a prepaid or pay-as-you-go plan. However, some of the cons are: Phones cost full price and you have to pay for it all at once. Although, some older models of phones are relatively cheap. Your coverage is not the carrier's top priority. Even though you may opt for a carrier that has the best coverage in your area, contract users will have top priority when it comes to their network.

The most popular OS systems are: Apple's iOS: This OS has the largest variety of content and applications, and is known for its ease and polished user interface. It is most popular for mainstream consumers who just want to absorb content (like watch video, play games, or connect with friends) rather than create content for professional uses. For this reason, many work professionals may prefer another OS. Google’s Android: Android offers more flexibility for developers or those who want to customize how their OS looks and works. The OS is highly customizable if you know the basics of tech education and is useful if you'd like to develop applications. Microsoft’s Windows: If you're a business owner, then this OS might be right for you. Windows integrates many traditional Windows applications such as Microsoft Office, Exchange, and its cloud.
