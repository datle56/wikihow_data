      "content": "A pattern of 4 beeps followed by a short pause indicates an emergency. If you hear this pattern, it means your CO alarm has detected dangerous amounts of carbon monoxide and you need to evacuate the building. Review your owner’s manual before there’s an emergency so you can quickly recognize what your alarm’s different beeping patterns are telling you. [1] X Research source To stop the sound: Press and hold the test/silence button for 5 seconds to reset the alarm . A light will keep flashing to indicate CO levels are still high. [2] X Research source You may have to press the button several times to stop the sound. The alarm may beep again after a few minutes if CO levels stay unsafe. The test/silence button might also be called test/mute, mute, reset, or a combination of those terms. Consult your user manual for specifics."

Most wired alarms are mounted on a circular plate—just twist counterclockwise until it comes off. [4] X Research source If the alarm keeps beeping with a fresh battery, it means it’s nearing the end of its life and should be replaced as soon as possible. [5] X Research source To stop the sound: Remove the old battery and wait 30 seconds to put in a new one. Match the positive end of the battery with the positive terminal. [6] X Research source Replace the alarm, then press and hold the test button until you hear a beeping sound (this may take up to 30 seconds depending on the model). Most carbon monoxide detectors use 9-volt batteries , but some use AA or AAA batteries.

      "content": "A continuous beep or random chirps means there’s a power issue. Depending on your model, you’ll hear beeping when the alarm is unplugged or there’s a power outage, a wiring problem, or an issue with the CO sensor. If your power and wiring are working fine and the alarm is still squealing, call a professional to inspect the device and consider replacing it. To stop the sound: Make sure the alarm is plugged all the way in or that any wire connections are secure and unbroken. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the alarm or wrapping frayed wires with electrical tape . Wipe the air filter with a damp cloth, but don’t get the alarm wet. Sometimes, a clogged filter can trigger the alarm as well."

      "content": "Gather your family and head outdoors as soon as possible. Silence the alarm by holding the test/silence button if you pass the alarm on your way out, but this isn’t necessary. If you’re unable to get outside, stand by an open window or on a fire escape to get fresh air. Do a headcount to make sure everyone is accounted for and away from the potential CO leak. Remember that carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless. Always evacuate regardless of whether you observe a direct threat or not."

The dispatcher will send a crew with detection devices to locate the source of CO in your home (or confirm whether the alarm was accurate or not).
