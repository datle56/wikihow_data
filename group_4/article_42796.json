      "content": "Your tattoo is going through the normal healing process. A new tattoo, at its core, is a colorful injury, and your skin needs time to heal after being pricked with needles and injected with ink. As it heals, your newly inked skin will scab and peel off, revealing milky, not-fully-healed skin beneath. This milky skin sticks around for 1-2 weeks, and it might make your tattoo ink appear less vibrant. [1] X Research source A lack of ink isn’t a problem if your tattoo is still peeling and healing. Chances are, your skin won’t all heal at exactly the same rate, which may leave you with a patchy, inconsistent-looking tattoo. Just keep caring for your tattoo properly and let it heal at its own pace. [2] X Research source It’s also totally normal to lose a little bit of ink. As your tattoo heals, your body’s immune system tries to clear away as much of the new ink as it can. Tattoo artists anticipate this by injecting extra ink into your tattoo. As your skin starts to heal, your body gets rid of some of it. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Your tattoo artist overworked or underworked the tattoo.",
      "content": "Your tattoo artist overworked or underworked the tattoo. Tattoo ink needs to be injected into the middle dermis layer of the skin to look sharp, beautiful, and long-lasting. [4] X Research source Tattoos get overworked when the artist injects the ink too far into the skin, and underworked when the artist doesn’t penetrate the skin enough. Either result can leave your tattoo looking unfinished. [5] X Research source Underworked tattoos don’t go deep enough into the skin, which creates broken, inconsistent, or barely visible lines. Overworked tattoos (also known as blowouts) go too deeply into the skin, causing the ink to blur and smudge. These tattoos tend to ooze plasma and blood in the first few days without developing scabs, and may also have lifted lines or dramatic pits in the ink. [6] X Research source Overworked and underworked tattoos aren’t ideal, but they aren’t the end of the world, either. Just focus on taking great care of your tattoo so it looks as healthy and vibrant as possible. If you still aren’t happy with the way your overworked or underworked ink looks, you can always get it touched up by a different artist. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "The average tattoo peels for around 1 week.",
      "content": "The average tattoo peels for around 1 week. As a general rule of thumb, big tattoos peel longer than small tattoos—that’s because the tattoo “wound” is bigger, which creates more scabs to peel. Your peeling time also depends on your skin type and the location of your tattoo, so don’t panic if your tattoo takes longer than a week to heal. [8] X Research source Tattoos on your wrists and elbows will take a longer time to peel, while back tattoos won’t take a long time to peel at all. Tattoos typically peel in 2 phases. The first involves a lot of peeling, while the second one is very light. Some people don’t even notice their second peeling phase!"

[10] X Research source After Inked Tattoo Aftercare Lotion , Tattoo Goo Aftercare Salve , and H2Ocean Aquatat Tattoo Aftercare Healing Ointment are all great moisturizing options. You can also apply some antibiotic ointment to your tattoo instead. [11] X Research source To protect your skin, your tattoo artist will wrap up your tattoo with plastic wrap or sterile pads before you leave. Keep this wrapping on for at least 2 hours, and clean your tattoo as soon as you take it off."

Other removal methods, like dermabrasion, surgery, and chemical peels, can be even more expensive (especially if you need multiple sessions).
