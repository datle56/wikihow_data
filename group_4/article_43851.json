      "content": "Keep your wrist loose. Make sure your wrist is not stiff because it will need to be able to snap quickly."

      "title": "Understand the overall motion.",
      "content": "Understand the overall motion. Any baseball pitch requires the pitcher to shift weight in order to gain momentum for the pitch. The dominant leg will step back before sweeping forward across the body as the hands come up and then down in preparation for the throw. You may want to look up video that shows you a standard pitch before you attempt to try it: [1]"

      "title": "Step back.",
      "content": "Step back. Take a small step backwards with the same foot as your pitching hand. Youâ€™re pitching hand is usually called your stride hand. As you do that bring your pitching hand and glove to your head."

      "title": "Bring your leg up.",
      "content": "Bring your leg up. Bring your stride leg up and over across your body, bending the knee as it rises parallel to the ground. Tip: Keep your back knee slightly bent to improve balance."

      "title": "Position your hips.",
      "content": "Position your hips. Make sure your hips are facing to the side. If you are pitching with your right hand, your hips will be rotated to the left. If you are pitching with your left hand, your hips will be rotated to the right."

      "title": "Pull your arm back.",
      "content": "Pull your arm back. As you lunge forward, pull your pitch arm behind you and above your shoulder. Your glove hand should be pulling your shoulder toward the target. Rotate the arm counter-clockwise behind you. Your arm should be making a circular motion."

      "content": "Rotate your arm. Rotate your arm away from the body. After you have pulled the arm back, rotate your arm forward and away from the body with your palm facing third base for a right-handed pitcher and first base for a left-handed pitcher. The pitching arm will come forward and down so that the back of your hand will face you."

      "content": "Twist your arm. Make sure that the palm of your hand faces away from you with the thumb toward the ground. This begins before the release to create the side-over-side spin."

The gyroball does spin not backward (like a fastball) or forward (like a curveball) but in a spiral (like a well-thrown football)."

      "title": "Follow through.",
      "content": "Follow through. Do not let the arm drift back in toward the body, as per normal American baseball customary motion. Your arms should be totally across the body."
