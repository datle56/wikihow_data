Getting angry is probably just going to get you in trouble, and expressing frustration will either give your sister what she wants (if she’s doing this on purpose) or just confuse her (if it’s not on purpose). Keep your cool! Try not to take it personally and realize they are acting out because they have some unmet need.

If possible, get away from your little sister. Talk to her once you’ve calmed down. If you can’t get away, try to keep your head. Blowing up at her will only make things worse.

Instead of saying, “You are such a brat!” or, “Why won’t you leave me alone?” try telling her, “When you behave like this, it makes me sad. It hurts my feelings. Do you like it when people hurt your feelings?” This will help her understand the impact of her behavior without making her feel bad. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Using “I” language rather than blaming, criticizing, or accusing your sister will also show her that you respect her.

Even if she is bothering you, she is probably doing this because she wants to follow your lead and be a part of your world. Her annoying behavior is very likely just her way of trying to get your attention.

      "content": "Listen to your sister's side of the story. How is she experiencing your conflict? Even if you continue to disagree, understanding where she's coming from will help you both move toward a solution. It’s extremely likely she doesn’t even realize she’s annoying you. [5] X Expert Source Rebecca Kason, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 12 August 2021. You might ask, “Hey, how do you think you’d feel if I asked you to keep hanging out while you were working on your homework?” or, “Why are you still asking me to come to your room?

She genuinely wants to spend time with you and show you that she loves you, she’s just choosing to express it in a really funny way right now.

[7] X Expert Source Rebecca Kason, PsyD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 12 August 2021. Consider the consequences of responding harshly. For example, if you give your sister the silent treatment she will become desperate for your attention, which may make her even more annoying. Try to be relatable and approachable. Being mean to your sister will only drive a wedge between you two, and there is a good reason she is following you around and annoying you.

[10] X Expert Source Supatra Tovar, PsyD, RD Licensed Clinical Psychologist (PSY #31949), Registered Dietitian, & Fitness Expert Expert Interview. 6 October 2021. When you interact with your little sister, ask yourself, “How would I feel or react if she treated me this way?” If you mess up and raise your voice in a moment of anger, apologize to her later, when you’ve calmed down.

When you are angry, it can be tempting to lash out at your little sister, but it is never okay to hurt someone, even if they hurt you first.

When you ask her to stop pestering you, you might say, “Hey, you know I love you and I’d really love to hang out, but I’m just kind of busy right now.” There’s nothing wrong with saying, “It’s not you or anything, but I need some space.”"

[13] X Research source For example, if you’re letting her tag along with you and your friends to the movies, you might say, “Now no talking during the movie, okay?

On the other hand, if you tell her a certain behavior will have a negative consequence, make sure that consequence happens if she doesn’t behave. [14] X Research source This also means that you should avoid saying things like, “If you don’t leave me alone, I’m never talking to you again!” Your sister knows that you will have to talk to her again at some point, so your threat will be meaningless, and she will have no reason to listen to you. If she expects you to lie to her or trick her, she probably won’t listen to what you say."

Saying, “If you need to be upset for a while, that’s okay, but I can’t talk to you while you’re like this,” and then calmly disengaging yourself, can be far more powerful than yelling and screaming at your little sister to leave you alone. [15] X Research source It may lead to a tantrum at first—your sister is desperate for your attention, and being annoying is one of the easiest ways to get it. Don’t leave your sister alone and unsupervised if she is very small, but don’t try to calm her down or reason with her while she is kicking and screaming. Negative attention is still attention, and if you respond to her tantrums by engaging with her, she will learn that throwing tantrums is a good way to get you to interact with her. Once she's calmed down, be ready to re-engage."

Inhale slowly through your nose for about 4 seconds, hold your breath for about 2 seconds, and then exhale slowly for another 4 seconds. Pause for a couple of seconds and repeat.

Remind yourself that you love her and that this moment won’t feel very important in another week or so. [19] X Research source Try to recall the many positive aspects of having a sibling. You and your sister will always have each other. It's highly likely that the person you find so annoying at this stage in your life will grow into a lifelong friend.
