Its plastic comb is used to brush through eyelashes; its thick bristle brush is used to tame and shape brows. The angled brow brush, also known as the slanted liner brush, is used to apply eyebrow filler. You may also use the slanted tip brush to apply eye liner to your lids."

      "content": "Line up your brows. There are three important areas of the brow to consider when shaping and filling in your eyebrows: the starting point, the peak, and the ending point. To identify each of these points, follow these steps: To locate the start of your brow, place a brush vertically along the outside of your nostril so that the top of the brush intersects your brow. Your brows should begin at this point. Remove any hairs that fall beyond the brush (towards the center of your face) with a pair of tweezers. To locate the peak of your brow, slide the brush diagonally across your brow until the brush reaches the outer edge of your iris. This point of your brow should be the highest part of the arch. To locate the end of your brow, slide the brush diagonally until it reaches the outer corner of your eye. If any hairs fall beyond the point, remove them with a tweezers; if your brow does not extend to this point, you can add length to your brow with a filler. You may mark these three points on each of your eyebrows with a small dot of filler. [8] X Research source"
