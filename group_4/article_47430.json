      "content": "Tripped breaker If there’s a power surge or if your water heater draws too much power, then it may trip the breaker. When the breaker goes off, it cuts power to the unit and it won’t be able to heat your water properly. For gas water heaters, a tripped breaker can prevent the pilot light from lighting. How to Diagnose: Calame says, “If it is an electric water heater, I would check the breaker and make sure that the breaker isn't still tripped.” How to Fix: Flip the breaker back into the On position. Calame also mentions that if there’s a deadman switch or on-off switch on the power source, turn it on as well."

      "content": "Unlit pilot light The pilot light is a flame that ignites the burner on a gas water heater when the water gets too cold. If the light ever goes out, then your water heater will not turn on or heat the water properly. [1] X Research source How to Diagnose: Remove the bottom panel from the side of your water heater to expose the burner or the viewing glass. If you do not see a flame, then the pilot light has gone out. How to Fix: Calame explains “to follow the instructions that are labeled right there on the water heater” because they can vary. To light your water heater , follow these steps: Turn the pilot light knob, push it in, and hold in position. Hit the spark igniter a few times, which is usually a button on the gas intake.push that ignites the spark igniter on the inside of the water heater. Release the knob when the indicator light starts blinking green. You should see the pilot light’s flame from the small glass viewing window if everything is working properly."

      "content": "Water leak Water can leak out from the supply lines, valves, or directly from the tank. When the unit loses water, then your fixtures may have weak or not flow when you try using hot water. [2] X Research source How to Diagnose: Check around the base of your water heater for puddling water and inspect all the pipes and valves for drips. Be sure to check the supply lines, drain valves, and bottom of the tank. How to Fix: Start by turning off the water supply valve going into your tank. If the leak is happening on one of the supply lines on top of your water heater, then unscrew the lines from the tank and attach new lines . If the leak is coming from the bottom of the tank, then check and replace the drain valve. If your tank is old, then it may be rusted and you may be better off replacing the unit.

      "title": "Closed or broken gas valves",
      "content": "Closed or broken gas valves If you have a gas water heater or a tankless water heater that uses gas, then it has to burn natural gas in order to heat the water inside. If the there isn’t enough gas getting into your water heater, then the water in the tank will stay cold. [4] X Research source How to Diagnose: Check the gas intake pipe, and turn the valve so it’s parallel to the pipe to make sure it’s on. Try lighting the pilot light, and if it continues to go out, then there’s an issue with the gas supply. How to Fix: If you notice a rotten egg or natural gas smell near your water heater, turn off the power and contact your gas company to tell them there’s a leak. No matter the repair, have a professional utility person replace any gas valves or lines that are damaged."

If either of the heating elements are not working correctly, then the water inside of the tank won’t heat properly and it may be cold. [5] X Research source How to Diagnose: Disconnect power from your water heater and remove the panels on the side of the tank covering the heating elements. Unscrew the elements and pull them out of the tank. Hold the probes of a multimeter against the connections to test for continuity .

If the connection is broken on the thermostats, then the heating elements may not turn on and the water will stay cold inside of the tank. [6] X Research source How to Diagnose: Start by removing the panels over the heating elements and pressing the reset button on the thermostat to see if it fixes your water heater. If not, set a multimeter to the lowest ohms setting. Disconnect the wires on the thermostat’s screws, and press the multimeter probes against the screwheads. If the reading is anything other than 0, then the thermostat is faulty. How to Fix: Unscrew the thermostat from your water heater and pull it out to remove it.

If the dip tube is damaged or corroded, then cold water may leak into the top of the tank and drop the temperature. [8] X Research source How to Diagnose: Turn off the cold water supply to your water heater, and disconnect the dip tube. Unscrew the dip tube and pull it out to check for damage.

Over time, these deposits can build up on the heating elements inside the tank and make them work less efficiently. [9] X Research source How to Diagnose: Turn hot water on from one of your fixtures, and if it looks cloudy, then there’s buildup in your water heater. Many tankless water heaters have notification systems to alert you if there is buildup or a clog. How to Fix: Flush your water heater . Attach a hose to the bottom drain valve, and place the other end in a drain. Turn off the power and water supply to the heater. Release the pressure valve at the top of the water heater. Then, open the drain valve and let all the water flow out."

If you’re using hot water in multiple fixtures or appliances, then the heater might not be able to keep up and water can start feeling cold. [10] X Research source How to Diagnose: Check the flow rate or capacity on your water heater, and look around your home for fixtures that are using hot water at the same time. How to Fix: Run fewer fixtures at a time. Alternatively, replace your water heater with one that has a larger capacity or flow rate."

This is especially an issue with tankless water heaters because they only heat water as it passes through the system. [11] X Research source How to Diagnose: Check the water supply pipes going into your water heater to see if they feel cold or are exposed to temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C). How to Fix: Insulate your pipes to keep them warm and prevent them from freezing."

When the anode rod is completely rusted or worn down, the water may damage the tank and prevent your water heater from working properly. [14] X Research source How to Diagnose: With your water heater turned off, locate the six-sided screw on top of your water heater and loosen it with a wrench. Carefully pull the anode rod straight out of the water heater and check it for corrosion. How to Fix: Pull out the old anode rod, and install a replacement in its place.

If you’re hearing a hissing noise, it may be caused by a leak or condensation on a heating element.

To completely flush the tank of old water and sediment: [19] X Research source Disconnect your water heater from power and let the tank cool. Shut off the water supply valve going into the top of your tank. Connect a garden hose to the bottom drain valve on the water heater tank. Place the other end of the hose in a drain.

This protects you from getting shocked or injured while you’re working. For electric water heaters, use the power switch to turn it off, and then switch off the breaker in the electrical box. For gas water heaters, find the gas supply valve on the intake pipe near the water heater. Turn the valve perpendicular to the pipe to shut off the gas. Then, turn off the water heater’s breaker at your electrical box."
