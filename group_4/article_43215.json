      "title": "Lick the inside of your wrist.",
      "content": "Lick the inside of your wrist. Wait 5-10 seconds for the saliva to dry. Try to do this discreetly–when you're alone–and not in a public place, or you may get strange looks from those around you. Avoid trying this test just after you've brushed your teeth, used mouthwash, or eaten something minty, as a freshly-cleaned mouth may give you inaccurate results."

      "title": "Smell the inside of your wrist where the saliva has dried.",
      "content": "Smell the inside of your wrist where the saliva has dried. This is, more or less, what your breath smells like. If it smells unsavory, then you may need to improve your dental hygiene and overall health. If it doesn't smell like anything, then your breath probably isn't too bad--but you might need to try another self-test to be sure. Bear in mind that this method primarily pulls saliva from the tip (anterior portion) of your tongue, which is fairly self-cleansing. Thus, smelling your licked wrist will only tell you how the best-smelling part of your tongue smells--and most bad breath tends to originate from the back of the mouth where it meets the throat. [1] X Research source You can wash the saliva off of your wrist, but don't worry if you don't have access to water or sanitizer since the smell will dissipate quickly as the skin dries. If your breath problems are relatively minor, you may not be able to smell much. If you're still worried, consider trying another self-testing method to give yourself a \"second opinion\"."

      "title": "Try swabbing the back of your tongue.",
      "content": "Try swabbing the back of your tongue. Use a finger or a piece of cotton gauze to reach deep into your mouth–but not so far back as to trigger your gag reflex–and wipe the surface of your tongue at the back of your mouth. Any bad-breath bacteria lurking back there will come off onto the swabbing tool. Sniff the swab (your finger or the cotton) for an accurate sense of how the back of your mouth smells. This method may reveal bad breath more precisely than merely licking your arm. Chronic halitosis is caused by bacteria that breed on your tongue and between your teeth – and most of these bacteria congregate near the back of your mouth. The tip of your tongue is fairly self-cleaning, and you may clean the front of your mouth more regularly than the back of your mouth. [2] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Try swishing with antibacterial mouthwash–in the front and the back of your mouth–to keep bacteria from hiding out on the back of your tongue. Gargle with mouthwash, if you can, to keep bad-breath bacteria from congregating in your throat opening. When you brush your teeth, make sure to brush your furthest back teeth, and be sure to brush your tongue and gums."

      "content": "Cover your mouth and nose with both of your hands. Form a cup so that the air you breathe out through your mouth has nowhere to go but into your nose. Breathe out, slowly, from your mouth, and quickly inhale the hot breath through your nose. If your breath is especially rank, you may be able to tell – but the air can quickly escape through the cracks between your fingers, and it's difficult to get a precise diagnosis using this method. It is, however, one of the most discreet ways to check for bad breath in public."

      "content": "Breathe into a clean plastic cup or container. Take a deep breath, and then hold the cup so that it covers both your nose and your mouth, with minimal ventilation, so you can get a close to accurate answer. Breathe out through your mouth, slowly, filling the cup with hot breath. Inhale quickly and deeply through your nose--you should be able to smell your breath. This step may be slightly more accurate than merely cupping your hands around your nose and mouth, but its accuracy is heavily dependent upon how tightly the cup seals in your breath. You can try this out with any container that traps your breath in a circuit between your nose and your mouth: a small paper or plastic bag, a tight-fitting surgical mask, or any manner of air-retentive face-mask. Be sure to rinse out the cup before breathing into it again. Wash it with soap and water before storing it or using it for anything else."

      "content": "Get an accurate reading. Avoid trying these methods directly after you've brushed your teeth, swished with mouthwash, or eaten something minty. These things may make your breath smell better, but the way your breath smells immediately after brushing your teeth is not necessarily the way that it smells most of the time. Try smelling your breath at various times--right after brushing your teeth, but also in the middle of the day, when you're most likely to encounter people--to better understand the difference. Bear in mind that your breath may smell bad after eating a spiced meal"

      "content": "Consider asking a trusted friend or family member whether your breath smells bad. You can try to smell your own breath, but you can only ever approximate what someone else smells. The best way to know for sure is to swallow your pride and ask, \"Be honest. Does my breath smell bad?\" [3] X Research source Choose a person that you trust--someone that won't go around telling people, and someone that will be honest with you about your breath. Ask a close friend who you know won't judge you. Avoid asking a crush or a romantic partner, as serious bad breath might be a turn-off. Avoid asking strangers, unless you're feeling particularly bold. It may seem embarrassing, at first, but you may find it a huge relief to get a trusted opinion on the matter. It's better to hear it from a close friend than from, say, someone you'd like to kiss."

      "content": "Be considerate. Don't just breathe into someone's face and say, \"How does my breath smell?\" Bring up the topic delicately, and always ask before demonstrating. If you spend a lot of time in close contact with the person, they may have already noticed that your breath smells bad; they may have just been too polite to bring it up. Say, \"I'm worried that my breath might smell bad, but I can't really tell. This is embarrassing, but have you noticed anything?\" Say, \"This might sound strange, but does my breath smell bad? I'm taking Jenny out to a movie tonight, and I'd rather deal with it now than wait for her to notice.\""

      "content": "Determine whether you have morning breath or chronic halitosis. Check your breath in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening, before and after you've brushed your teeth, and figure out how persistent the problem is. If you know why your breath smells bad, you can take steps to fix it. Morning breath is normal. You can fix it by brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash right after you wake up. Halitosis is a more serious bacterial infestation, but it is still common and still treatable. To fight halitosis, you'll need to keep your mouth clean and manage the bacteria that make your breath smell bad. The most common causes of bad breath are dental cavities, gum disease, poor oral hygiene, gastrointestinal conditions, and coated tongue (a white or yellow coating on the tongue, usually due to inflammation). If you can't tell from inspecting your mouth, your dentist should be able to tell you what's causing your bad breath. If someone tells you that your breath doesn't smell so great, don't be embarrassed. Think of it as constructive criticism."

      "content": "Keep good dental hygiene. Brush your teeth more thoroughly, gargle with antibacterial mouthwash, and floss between your teeth to keep plaque and bacteria from hiding out there. Drink plenty of water, and swish cool water around in your mouth to freshen morning breath. It's very important to brush your teeth before going to bed. You might try an additional round of brushing with baking soda to reduce the acidity in the mouth and make it difficult for the bacteria that cause bad breath to grow. Use a tongue scraper (available at many drugstores) to remove any residue that may be building up between the taste buds and folds in the tongue. If you don't have a tongue scraper, you can use your toothbrush to brush your tongue. Replace your toothbrush every two to three months. The bristles will become less effective over time, and your brush may accumulate bacteria. Replace your toothbrush after you've been sick so you don't give the bacteria a place to hide out.

Keep your nasal passages clean and clear, and manage allergies before they escalate. A neti pot can be helpful in rinsing mucus buildup from your nose. Drinking hot water with lemon, using nasal saline drops, and taking vitamin C can help alleviate a stuffy nose. When taking vitamin C, follow the dosage recommendations on the package. Adults should not exceed 2000 mg of vitamin C per day. [6] X Research source"

Cut back on processed foods, red meats, and cheeses. Focus on eating fiber-rich foods like oatmeal, flax seeds, and kale. You should also incorporate probiotic-friendly foods into your diet, like unsweetened kefir, kimchi, and plain yogurt. Alternatively, you can take a probiotic supplement."

      "content": "Neutralize bad breath. Chew gum, eat breath mints or use Listerine strips before sensitive social situations. Ultimately, you may want to treat the roots of your problem and banish your bad breath for good, but it never hurts to make your breath smell better in the meantime. Keep gum with you so that you can use it in emergencies. Chew a handful of cloves, fennel seeds, or aniseeds. Their antiseptic qualities help fight halitosis-causing bacteria. Chew a piece of lemon or orange rind for a mouth- freshening burst of flavor. (Wash the rind thoroughly first.) The citric acid will stimulate the salivary glands—and fight bad breath. Chew a fresh sprig of parsley, basil, mint, or cilantro. The chlorophyll in these green plants neutralizes odors."
