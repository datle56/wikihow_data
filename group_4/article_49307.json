      "title": "Choose a figure who interests you.",
      "content": "Choose a figure who interests you. Start by checking your assignment’s guidelines. They might require you to stick to a historical period, part of the world, or academic field. Browse textbooks, articles, and websites about the broader topic, and look for a figure who’s life appeals to you. [1] X Research source For example, suppose you need to write a biographical sketch of poet who lived in the 19th century. Look up poets you’ve covered in class, browse your textbook or anthology of poems, and search online for poets that fit your assignment. After reading his blurb in your anthology, you might be interested in learning more about Charles Baudelaire, so you choose him for your sketch."

      "title": "Search for books and articles at your library.",
      "content": "Search for books and articles at your library. Check you school or local library’s catalog for sources about your figure. Look for books and magazine, journal, and newspaper articles, and ask a librarian for help if you run into trouble. For a major historical figure, you’ll probably have more results than you can handle. Search online for your historical figure and “authoritative biography” to find the most important sources. If you have trouble finding information about your subject, you might need to choose another option."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for reliable sources online.",
      "content": "Look for reliable sources online. If you don’t have access to a library, you can still gather reliable sources online. Including “.edu,” “.gov,” or “.org” with your search terms often generates more credible results. While Wikipedia itself isn’t reliable, you could check the references on your figure’s page for links to credible sources. If you’ve chosen a contemporary figure or famous person, searching online might be your best bet. The most credible sources would include reputable news publications, such as the BBC, The New York Times , and NPR."

    {
      "title": "Gather primary and secondary sources.",
      "content": "Gather primary and secondary sources. Primary sources might include an autobiography or letters your figure composed. Things your figure wrote aren’t necessarily trustworthy, so you’ll also need secondary sources, which are scholarly texts written about your figure. You should be able to track down sources at your library or through its interlibrary loan program. If an autobiography or published collection of letters are available, you could also purchase them online or at a bookstore. To find good secondary sources, use search terms such as \"authoritative\" or \"definitive biography\" of your figure. When you find scholarly articles about your figure, check their footnotes or references. You'll definitely want to acquire a book or article about your figure that's referenced in lots of other sources."

      "content": "Review your figure’s life, achievements, and importance. Once you've done your research, ask yourself how the historical figure was shaped by their time period and environment.

      "content": "Explain what motivates you in a college or scholarship essay. If you're applying to college or for a scholarship, don't simply list your activities and accomplishments in your personal statement. Instead of writing that you've done something impressive, describe why you chose to undertake that challenge. [3] X Research source For example, writing, \"My proudest moment is when I was elected class president,\" simply states that you're in student government. Instead, write why you wanted to be class president: \"On a school trip to the state capitol, my congressperson described public service to my class. As they spoke, I remember looking up in awe at the capitol building's towering dome. However, it wasn't awe that inspired my interest in politics; it was the notion that governing is service.\""

If you need to write about yourself for a job application, read the qualifications listed in the position's description. Include details about experiences that helped you hone these attributes. [4] X Research source As is the case with a college or scholarship essay, tell a story about these attributes instead of merely listing them. [5] X Research source Suppose a job description lists the skill \"Cost management.\" Writing, \"I cut operating costs by 17% at my prior position,\" just restates a line on your resume. Instead, write in your bio, \"The complex purchasing system at my last position was like a many-headed Hydra. For every challenge I solved, 2 more came my way. Ultimately, I managed to conquer the beast, consolidated our vendors, negotiated new contracts, and cut our spending by 17%.\""

      "content": "Keep your bio concise and focused. For a college or scholarship application, your personal statement will likely have 1 page limit. Professional bios are usually a maximum of 2 paragraphs. You can't cover your whole life story in that amount of space, so focus on the main point you want to convey to readers. Come up with a thesis as if you were writing about a historical figure. Instead of trying to cover everything you've ever done, focus on 2 or 3 key qualifications. Try summing yourself up in a thesis statement, such as \"Jane Doe encountered hardships, but every pitfall provided an opportunity to grow.\" You don't have to include your thesis verbatim in your bio, but it can help you keep your writing focused."

After researching your figure, choose a key detail for your sketch’s focus. Then write a sentence that sums up the main point you want to make about your figure. [6] X Trustworthy Source Read Write Think Online collection of reading and writing resources for teachers and students. Go to source A thesis statement for a biographical sketch could be, “The principal themes of Charles Baudelaire’s poetry are rooted in his experience of urban life in Paris and his 1841 voyage to India.” If you're writing about yourself, focus on the achievements you're proudest of or those that are most relevant to an application.

Thesis: The principal themes of Charles Baudelaire’s poetry are rooted in his experience of urban life in Paris and his 1841 voyage to India. II. Emerging urbanism in Paris A. Describe city life in the 19th century B. Discuss Baudelaire and tavern culture C. Cite and analyze poetic elements: corruption of the city, melancholy, “Spleen” III. Romantic voyage A.

[8] X Research source Your intro should let your reader know what to expect in the coming paragraphs. For instance: \"Baudelaire's personal letters and journal entries detail his life in Paris and travel abroad. Analyzing examples from his body of work will demonstrate how these encounters with urbanism and exoticism laid the foundation of his poetry's principal themes.\" For an autobiography, summarize what makes you a winning applicant or state the main points you intend to make about yourself.
