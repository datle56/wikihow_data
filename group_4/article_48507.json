      "title": "He carefully analyzed his feelings and decided to kiss you.",
      "content": "He carefully analyzed his feelings and decided to kiss you. Even if the kiss took you by surprise, it was no fluke or accident. Methodical Capricorn guys dislike spontaneity and never do things on a whim, so if he kissed you, rest assured that he thought long and hard about it before making a move. After realizing he likes you, he made the conscious decision to act. Capricorn guys are extremely dedicated to upholding their responsibilities—and to them, a kiss is like a promise. If they go in for one kiss, they’re fully prepared to do it again in the future. Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of rules and responsibilities, which means no zodiac sign is more reliable. Every action he takes is carefully considered and planned."

      "title": "He’s ready for a serious and committed relationship.",
      "content": "He’s ready for a serious and committed relationship. Kissing is a big deal in your Capricorn’s book; he’ll only do it when he’s ready to take your relationship to the next level. This traditional sign prefers long-term relationships to flings, and he’s extremely cautious; he won’t pursue a relationship until he’s sure of his feelings. If he kisses you, that’s his way of saying he’s serious about you. It also means that he trusts you completely. Earning his trust is the key to winning a Capricorn guy’s heart and making him commit. So, if he decides to kiss you, it’s because he trusts you enough to do it."

    {
      "title": "He’s confessing that he cares about you deeply.",
      "content": "He’s confessing that he cares about you deeply. Capricorn men don’t kiss simply because it’s fun or because it feels good—that’s just a perk. When a Capricorn guy kisses you, he’s doing it because he has developed strong feelings for you and wants to show you how much he cares. It’s a declaration of love, affection, and the desire to be closer to you. Capricorns have a lot of internal barriers and defenses. They’re protective of their emotions, making many think they’re cold and distant—but that’s not true at all. Capricorn men are downright tender around the person they love. It just takes time for him to lower his guard, and he’s doing exactly when he kisses you!"

    {
      "title": "He’s expressing his feelings physically rather than verbally.",
      "content": "He’s expressing his feelings physically rather than verbally. Verbal affection isn’t always Capricorn’s strong suit. When they struggle to convey the depth of their emotions with words, they express themselves through physical affection instead. So remember: even if your Capricorn hasn’t yet verbalized his feelings, you can be sure they exist if he kisses you. He might do other sweet things to show his affection, too, like holding your hands and sending quick messages just to check in and see how you’re doing. Subtle yet meaningful acts of love are his specialty!"
    },
    {
      "title": "He’s sure that you feel the same.",
      "content": "He’s sure that you feel the same. Capricorn guys don’t like to deal with unknown variables. They want to be sure of themselves (and you) before they make a move. Therefore, if your Capricorn guy goes in for a kiss, he’s probably feeling fairly confident that you share his feelings and want to be with him as much as he wants to be with you."

      "title": "His kisses are long-lasting and romantic.",
      "content": "His kisses are long-lasting and romantic. You might be surprised by how gentle and sweet this reserved sign becomes when he goes in for a kiss! A Capricorn guy will give you his entire focus when he kisses you and put all his energy towards making you feel comfortable, happy, and loved. His kisses will also usually linger; he likes long kisses because they express how deeply he feels for you. [1] X Research source Some kisses will be passionate, and others chaste, depending on where you are and whether he’s trying to be romantic or make things more heated. Still, all of his kisses will be satisfying!"

    {
      "title": "He’s a sensual earth sign and loves physical touch while kissing.",
      "content": "He’s a sensual earth sign and loves physical touch while kissing. All earth signs (Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo) are known for their sensual natures. For them, kissing is about more than touching lips; they want to touch you as much as possible. When you kiss a Capricorn man, he might go so far as to press his body against yours, run his hands through your hair, or find other ways to be close."

    {
      "title": "He changes up his kissing technique based on how he’s feeling.",
      "content": "He changes up his kissing technique based on how he’s feeling. Capricorn guys have a different kiss for every mood, and he’s not the type to kiss you the same way every time. After all, kisses are his way of communicating. For example, he might express appreciation or gratitude with a gentle, romantic kiss—and later convey desire with a more sensual and passionate kiss. He might also shake things up by kissing you in other places. For example, Capricorn guys will kiss your forehead, cheek, and hands as simple gestures of affection. It’s how they show their fondness for you! Similarly, when a Capricorn guy hugs you, it’s another sign of affection. He wants you to feel protected and supported. When he’s feeling flirty and wants to test the waters, he might kiss your neck instead. Keep in mind that he’ll only do this if he’s comfortable with it and knows that you are too."

    {
      "title": "He’ll usually want to kiss you in private, not in public.",
      "content": "He’ll usually want to kiss you in private, not in public. Your modest and conservative Capricorn values privacy, which means he won’t be very demonstrative in public. He’s not trying to keep you a secret or ignore you; it’s just how he is. Public displays of affection make him feel uncomfortable and awkward, whereas he’s more than happy to let loose and enthusiastically kiss you in private. [2] X Research source Don’t worry: your Capricorn guy might still hold your hand or give you a chaste kiss on the cheek in public. He just doesn’t like doing things that’ll draw too much attention to himself."

    {
      "title": "He’ll ask for consent before he kisses you for the first time.",
      "content": "He’ll ask for consent before he kisses you for the first time. A conscientious Capricorn man will always do his best to be respectful of your feelings. That’s why he might seem hesitant at first, and it also means he’ll check beforehand so he can be sure you’re ready. Expect a Capricorn guy to ask for permission and act based on your response. If you tell him no, he’ll back off right away. And if you return his feelings, he’ll eagerly kiss you. He values knowing how you feel, and he’ll always respect your decision regardless."

      "title": "Send signals that you share his feelings and want him to kiss you.",
      "content": "Send signals that you share his feelings and want him to kiss you. Remember how Capricorn men like to get a sense of your feelings before kissing you? Help your Capricorn do just that and show him that you like him . He’s reserved and needs a little encouragement before taking a big step like a first kiss, but once he knows where you stand, he’ll be happy to make a move. Remember: Capricorn guys aren’t indecisive, only in need of reassurance. He knows how he feels and wants to be sure you do too. On that note, playing hard-to-get isn’t a good idea if you want him to make a move. When a Capricorn guy gets mixed signals, he can’t be sure of how you really feel—and he’ll likely back off until he gets some clarity."

      "title": "Touch him to appeal to his sensual nature while you kiss.",
      "content": "Touch him to appeal to his sensual nature while you kiss. Just as your tactile Capricorn man will try to get as close to you as he possibly can during kisses, return the gesture by wrapping your arms around his neck, putting your hands on his waist, or caressing his back. Your Capricorn guy is sensitive to touch. The more sensual you are, the more interested he’ll be. Remember, you don’t have to do anything you aren’t comfortable with—and your gentle Capricorn certainly doesn’t want you to. Feel free to take it slowly, especially when you’re just starting out. He won’t mind! In fact, he’ll probably prefer it that way."

      "title": "Tell him what you like and whether you want to try something new.",
      "content": "Tell him what you like and whether you want to try something new. A Capricorn man aims to please! He expresses his affection by doing everything in his power to make you feel good while kissing. He wants you to walk away feeling satisfied, so he’ll appreciate it if you tell him how you like to be kissed—even if it’s different from his usual style.

He cares about your needs first and foremost, and he’ll get the most satisfaction if you’re happy."

      "title": "Be patient and let him take the lead when he’s ready.",
      "content": "Be patient and let him take the lead when he’s ready. Despite their initial caution, Capricorn guys are leaders at heart. Your Capricorn prefers taking charge when kissing you, so let him be the initiator, too. Even when you’re sending signals that you’d like to be closer to him, stop short of actually kissing him first. He’ll appreciate your patience if you let him come to you instead. As a cardinal sign, Capricorn is one of the zodiac’s natural initiators and go-getters. That’s where Capricorn’s dominant, take-charge attitude comes from, influencing everything from work ambitions to romantic preferences. Once he’s sure of your feelings and committed to you, you won’t have to worry about waiting around for a kiss from your Capricorn. He’ll be happy to give you all the affection you want!"

      "title": "A Capricorn guy’s kisses are considerate, sensual, and loving.",
      "content": "A Capricorn guy’s kisses are considerate, sensual, and loving. In short: yes! Capricorn guys are great kissers, and they definitely enjoy doing it. It’s Capricorn’s favorite way of showing affection. The trick is that they typically only kiss when they feel a real connection—but, of course, the upside is that when a Capricorn man does finally kiss you, you’ll know he really means it."
