      "title": "Separate the shower curtain and the shower curtain liner.",
      "content": "Separate the shower curtain and the shower curtain liner. You can wash them both the same way, but, depending on what the actual shower curtain is, that could change. You might want to add something to the soap, or wash at a different temperature, for a cloth curtain as opposed to the plastic-y liners. It is ok, however, to wash them together if they are the same material. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Set your washing machine for a small to medium sized load with warm water. Place the liner in the wash, then set the machine to warm water. Liners made from plastic can become brittle when washed in cold water, while the warm water in your washing machine is no more damaging than the warm water coming out of your shower head. Fabric liners will also get cleaner if you use warm water. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Let the washer start filling up and pour in about a cup of vinegar. You can pour this right where the soap is supposed to go. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Add as much soap as you deem appropriate.",
      "content": "Add as much soap as you deem appropriate. A half-portion of your normal soap amount should be fine, as this is about half the size (or less) of a normal load of laundry. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not use fabric softener on your liner.",
      "content": "Do not use fabric softener on your liner. The liner is not fabric -- it is plastic. The softener will do nothing but give a strange, chemically smell to your liner. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a gentle, regular cycle.",
      "content": "Choose a gentle, regular cycle. Because the liner is the only thing in the wash, you could choose a shortened cycle if you have the option. Otherwise, just let the washing machine do its job. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Once washed, hang it right back up to dry.",
      "content": "Once washed, hang it right back up to dry. You must, however, be prepared for the dripping water. Do not put the liner in the dryer to heat dry it. While you could stick it in the drier for a few minutes on cool to shake off excess water, be careful. Hot air can melt the liner and ruin both it and your dryer. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the shower curtain liner and throw it in the wash to remove surface stains. Simply take it off, remove the big plastic cuffs, and put it in the washing machine. This method is more for surface stains, not removing mold."

      "content": "Add a towel to the load. This will be used to \"scrub\" your liner. Again, this method is more to wipe up surface stains than do a deep cleaning. [8] X Research source"
