      "content": "Start by texting something casual, especially if it's a new relationship. It's important that you don't come on too strong with a new romantic interest. Text something light and innocent to start the conversation. For instance, you could say something like, “Hey, hope you're well. Just thinking about you” or “Hey, I can't stop thinking about that cute, boyish smile of yours.”"

      "content": "Text him a compliment to get his attention. [1] X Expert Source John Keegan Dating Coach Expert Interview. 5 November 2019. Compliments are a great way to increase intimacy and can act as a lead-in for more steamy conversations. Just make sure the compliment is sincere and something you think he'll appreciate hearing. “Hey handsome!” is always a good start, especially if it's a relatively new relationship. Or you could try something funny and a little more bold like, “I can't stop laughing about our conversation the other night, I love how dirty-minded you are.”"

      "title": "Flirt",
      "content": "Flirt to gradually build up to more evocative topics. The key to turning him on is to start slow and work your way up (just as you would in person). Try to make him laugh, show him how funny/clever you are, and/or show him you care about him. For instance, you might text, “I think that story you told me last night broke my abs from laughing too hard” or “How did your interview go today? Did they appreciate your sharp wit like I do?” Texting him something hot and heavy from the get-go can be awkward (and creepy if you don't know each other that well yet)."

      "title": "Tell him what you're doing as a lead-in.",
      "content": "Tell him what you're doing as a lead-in. Use what you're doing to shift the conversation to something more suggestive. You don't necessarily have to stick to the facts here—he won't know either way! For example, you might say, “I'm trying to work but can't stop thinking about this really sexy, smart man that I went out with last night…”"

      "title": "Keep the conversation short to leave him wanting more.",
      "content": "Keep the conversation short to leave him wanting more. Think of texting dirty messages as a form of mental foreplay—you want to turn him on without letting it go on for so long that he gets bored. Furthermore, long-winded flirty texts could create awkwardness and kill the mood. [2] X Research source Cut the conversation short with a simple closing line like: “Can't wait to see you later,” or a simple flirty emoji (like 😘, 💋, or 😉)."

      "content": "Don't text him something naughty when you know it's an inappropriate time. Trying to turn him on when he's in an important meeting or at a somber event is ill-advised. If you know he's at a funeral, family event, or in an important meeting, don't try to divert his attention away from where it should be in that moment. [3] X Research source Ask him what he's doing if you're not sure if it's a good time."

      "content": "Avoid sending a lot of texts back-to-back. If you're trying to turn him on, don't annoy him! If he's a new interest, he might think you're needy. And if he's a stable partner, he might get irritated instead of turned on. Don't send more than two texts back to back without a response. [4] X Research source If he doesn't respond, don't freak out and flood him with messages. He's probably busy! If you overdo it and he responds in a way that suggests he's annoyed or intimidated, take it as a lesson and be more conservative with how you text."

For instance, he might receive the text or open it when someone is in viewing range (like his mother, boss, or child!). Don't send one unless the two of you have talked about it and laid out some ground rules (like only sending them when both of you aren't at work). [5] X Research source Don't let anyone pressure you into sending nudes! There's always a chance that someone unexpected might see them, so be smart about your privacy (e.g., don't show your face in the actual photo). [6] X Research source An example of a good ground rule is to delete photos shortly after sending and receiving them."

Asking a suggestive question will excite him and get his imagination going. It also invites him to reply with something equally suggestive.

Game for round 2?” “I'm crazy flexible. All that yoga's really paying off...wanna see later?” “Want to play dare or dare?”"
