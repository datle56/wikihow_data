      "content": "Wrap the apples in cellophane. Wrapping the apples in cellophane will keep the sticky coating from coming in contact with dust and other particles that might be in the air. You can even use a ribbon tied around the stick to hold the cellophane in place and give a fancier appearance. [2] X Research source The cellophane should completely cover the apple, but it is okay if some of the stick is left uncovered."

      "content": "Keep the apples in a covered container out of the way. If you are storing the apples somewhere in your home or place of business, keeping them in a container will ensure that they are safe from any bumps that could damage their coating, or contaminants from the environment. [3] X Research source If you don’t have a container large enough, organize the apples on a flat surface with the sticks upright. Cover them with a sheet or light blanket to keep them protected."

      "title": "Store apples away from heat and light.",
      "content": "Store apples away from heat and light. If you are serving the apples shortly after making them, it is still best to store them in a location that is away from heat and light. Avoid storing the apples in areas near windows, radiators, heating vents, and air returns, as they can cause the candy coating to melt. [4] X Research source You can store the apples outside of the refrigerator for up to an hour. If they won’t be eaten within an hour, it’s best to keep them in the refrigerator until you’re ready to eat. If you notice a brown coloring on the inside of the apple when you cut it open, immediately throw the apple away and don’t eat it. A brown apple is the only way to tell that the candy apple has gone bad."

      "title": "Separate apples with wax paper.",
      "content": "Separate apples with wax paper. Wax paper will keep your apples from touching and sticking together. It will also help them to stay cool and dry in the refrigerator over long periods of time. The wax paper only needs to cover the apple portion of the treat, and should stick to the coating. If you would like to, you can use a rubber band or ribbon to tie the wax paper to the stick. [5] X Research source Avoid using plastic “cling” wrap for long-term storage because it can make the candy coating taste like plastic."

    {
      "title": "Place apples in an airtight container.",
      "content": "Place apples in an airtight container. Keeping the apples in an airtight container will prevent the apples from becoming sticky or tacky due to any dampness in the refrigerator. Tupperware-like containers are the best option for the storage of multiple apples, but any airtight container, such as a ziplock bag, will work. [6] X Research source Ensure that the container or bag is properly closed before storing."

      "title": "Refrigerate the apples for up to two weeks.",
      "content": "Refrigerate the apples for up to two weeks. To prevent foodborne illnesses, it is best to keep any apples that you won’t be eating within an hour refrigerated. Refrigerated candy apples can last for up to two weeks before they should be discarded. [7] X Research source If you remove an apple from the refrigerator and it is brown when cut open, unfortunately that means that the apples have gone bad. You should throw them away immediately to prevent any foodborne illness."

      "title": "Remove apples from the refrigerator 45 minutes before eating.",
      "content": "Remove apples from the refrigerator 45 minutes before eating. If you’re planning to eat the apples at any point, make sure you remove them from the refrigerator 45 minutes before you are going to eat them. The candy coating will be easier to cut through when they are room temperature."

    {
      "title": "Ensure the coating is firm before packing the apples for travel.",
      "content": "Ensure the coating is firm before packing the apples for travel. Place apples in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes before travel. This will make the coating as firm as possible and avoid damage to the apples during transportation. [8] X Research source You can test this by poking the coating with a toothpick near the area where the stick is inserted into the apple. You should find it slightly difficult to break the coating."

    {
      "title": "Wrap the apples in individual cellophane or plastic bags.",
      "content": "Wrap the apples in individual cellophane or plastic bags. The bags will keep the apples from touching during the ride and keep the sticky coating safe from any contaminants during transportation. You can secure the bags to the sticks using ribbon, rubber bands, or even twist ties. [9] X Research source If you don’t want to wrap them in individual bags, make sure that the apples are separated by wax paper wrapped around the apple to keep them from sticking together."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the apples in a large container with a lid.",
      "content": "Place the apples in a large container with a lid. Place the apples upright in the container with little space between them. This will keep them from sliding around in the container and bumping into one another. A large plastic container with a lid will work best. [10] X Research source If you don’t have a large plastic container available, you can use a sturdy box or a few individual smaller containers. If you don’t have a lid, a towel or sheet draped over the top of the container will keep your apples safe from heat and light. If the coating is firm, it is safe to place the apples on their sides, but be aware that it may cause some damage to the coating."

      "content": "Pack the apples in a cooler for trips longer than an hour. If you’re going to be travelling a longer distance, you should pack the apples into a cooler with ice packs to keep them from going bad. You could also use a styrofoam container if you don’t have a cooler, or any container that will insulate the apples."
