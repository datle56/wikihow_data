      "title": "Untie the existing knots and tie a new knot lower on either lace.",
      "content": "Untie the existing knots and tie a new knot lower on either lace. Untie the default knots in the laces, then pull on them until the fit is snug, but not too tight. [1] X Research source Tie an overhand knot in the lace near the eyelet, then repeat on the other side. [2] X Research source To position the knot, thread a toothpick or needle through the knot’s loop, then position the toothpick right next to the lace’s hole. Pull on the end of the lace to tighten the knot down to the toothpick. This method works with any Hey Dude slip-on style including the Wally, Walsh, Jack, Paul, Wendy, and Polly shoes."

      "content": "Tie the laces together for a traditional look and a temporary fit. Hold a lace in either hand, pull them taught, and tie your shoes on top (like an ordinary sneaker) to make them feel tighter. This method works for any lace-up style of Hey Dude shoes."

      "title": "Wear thick socks to make your shoes more snug.",
      "content": "Wear thick socks to make your shoes more snug. Wearing thick socks with your Hey Dude shoes removes some of the room between your feet and the shoe itself, providing for a tighter fit. We recommend wearing ankle or no-show socks with slip-on boat shoes, but a high sock is also a classic look to rock."

      "title": "Use insoles to make Hey Dude shoes tighter.",
      "content": "Use insoles to make Hey Dude shoes tighter. Insoles rest at the bottom of your shoes and offer arch support. They also fill some space inside your shoes to make them more snug. Buy and place insoles in the bottoms of your Hey Dudes for a quick and easy way to tighten them. If you prefer not to buy insoles, make some yourself by tracing your feet on a bit of cardboard or a section of yoga mat, then cutting out the tracing. Hey Dude shoes come with their own insoles, so purchase insoles thicker than the original insoles."

      "title": "Place your shoes in the dryer to shrink them.",
      "content": "Place your shoes in the dryer to shrink them. Spritz your Hey Dude shoes with some water, then stuff them with old socks so they keep their shape in the dryer. Place the shoes in the dryer and run a normal, warm cycle. This shrinks your shoes slightly, making them more snug on your feet. To better protect your shoes, place them in a dryer bag to keep them from tumbling around. Altering your shoes this way may void their warranty or shrink them too much. When in doubt, use another method."

      "title": "Wash canvas shoes with liquid detergent on a delicate cycle.",
      "content": "Wash canvas shoes with liquid detergent on a delicate cycle. Remove the laces and insoles from the shoes. Then, place the shoes in the washing machine with about 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of liquid detergent, and run a delicate or light cycle. Air-dry your shoes somewhere well-ventilated but out of direct sunlight, like near an open window, for 2-3 hours. [3] X Research source If your shoes are especially dirty, use a stiff-bristled brush to scrub away grime or caked-on dirt before you toss them into the wash."

      "content": "Scrub suede Hey Dude shoes by brushing them with a suede brush. Clean suede shoes by gently scrubbing away dirt or grime with a suede cleaning brush , brushing in the same direction each time. Dampen the outside of the shoe with a thin coat of water, then use a sponge to dry up the excess to remove stains. Let them dry overnight, then use a suede brush to brush away the residue. [4] X Research source Use a dampened nail brush to gently scrub away other more stubborn stains, like oil. Preserve suede shoes by spraying their upper, outer portion with a protective suede spray ."

      "title": "Hey Dude shoes do run true to size, but don’t have half sizes.",
      "content": "Hey Dude shoes do run true to size, but don’t have half sizes. For the most part, Hey Dude shoes run true to size, but there may be slight differences in sizing between shoe styles. Consult the Hey Dude official size chart for specifics. Hey Dude doesn’t offer half sizes, so if you wear a half-size, buy the next size up to ensure a comfortable fit. [5] X Research source As a slip-on style, Hey Dude shoes might fit a bit loose, which is natural."
