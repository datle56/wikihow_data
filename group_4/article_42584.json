When exposed to cold temperatures, our body produces several naturally occurring chemicals, such as melatonin and adrenaline. Research suggests that ice baths could be highly beneficial, aiding in the following: [2] X Research source Mood and energy booster: A cold plunge might be just what you need to snap your brain into action. This polar plunge sends signals of adrenaline and endorphins to your brain, leaving you feeling more alert and in a better mood.

If you feel like your water level is too low, you can always turn on the cold water to raise the water after you’ve added your ice and gotten in. If you don’t have a bathtub, use a kiddie pool or large plastic tub for your ice bath and fill it with your garden hose.

Workouts can get you grimy— sweat, dirt, and germs from gym equipment, flooring, or terrain can expose you to bacteria you wouldn’t want to bring into your ice bath and potentially spread in the water. While it’s rare, it’s possible that bacteria or grime on your skin can lead to a skin condition if you get in an ice bath dirty. Before your bath, take a short, lukewarm shower to soap up so that you’ll be clean when you get in the bath.
