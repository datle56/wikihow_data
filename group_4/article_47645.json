      "content": "Choose a contemporary model of watch to closely match your jeans. Jeans look very modern, so wearing a very modern style of pocket watch is a terrific way to match the different pieces of your ensemble. Opt for a pocket watch with sleek sides and a minimalist aesthetic to best match the contemporary look of denim jeans. [1] X Research source A rectangular pocket watch, for example, is a highly contemporary model of watch that only a modern person could wear. By contrast, it would look out of place next to blue jeans. If you want to go with a very modern look, you might even consider wearing a pocket watch with a digital clock face instead of an analog one."

      "content": "Go with an antique-style watch to contrast with your jeans. If you want to create a contrasting look with your ensemble, pairing your jeans with an old-fashioned pocket watch is a great way to do this. Opt for an antique watch from the 19th century, for example, or a watch with very elaborate designs on the clock face. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Opt for a belt loop or bolt ring chain for the most convenience. Belt loop and bolt ring chains have a shackle or other type of metal loop on the end of them that is meant to attach to the belt loop on a pair of pants. Since all blue jeans have belt loops around the waist, this makes using a belt loop or bolt ring chain the easiest means of attaching your pocket watch to your jeans. There are 2 main types of chains that work well with belt loops: the belt loop chain and the bolt ring chain. Bolt ring chains use a bolt ring instead of a clip to attach to the belt loop. Both types of chains can be worn with jeans, although belt loop chains are most common."

      "title": "Select a watch and chain made of the same metal for a neater look.",
      "content": "Select a watch and chain made of the same metal for a neater look. Your ensemble will look more matching and coordinated if your pocket visually matches the chain attached to it. For example, match a gold watch with a gold chain or a silver watch with a silver chain."

      "title": "Mismatch the metals of the watch and chain to make a contrasting look.",
      "content": "Mismatch the metals of the watch and chain to make a contrasting look. Some people may find this to have a jarring effect, while others tend to appreciate the more “chaotic” aesthetic. If you have a golden watch, for example, pair it with a silver chain."

      "title": "Wear a dark pair of jeans to match the semi-formal look of your watch.",
      "content": "Wear a dark pair of jeans to match the semi-formal look of your watch. Bleached or otherwise light-colored jeans tend to have a very casual feel to them, which can clash with your pocket watch. Wear a pair of jeans that look “smart casual” rather than just casual. By the same token, make sure your jeans fit your body. Avoid wearing jeans that are baggy or torn while you’re wearing a pocket watch. If you’d rather accentuate the clash between a casual aesthetic and your “smart casual” watch, go with bleached blue jeans or even jeans of a lighter color."

      "title": "Attach the chain to one of the belt loops of your jeans.",
      "content": "Attach the chain to one of the belt loops of your jeans. If your chain has a clip on the end of it, simply clip the chain to your belt loop. If you want to leave the chain hanging down the side of your jeans, attach it to the belt loop on the side of your waist “behind” your pocket. If you plan to leave the chain in your pocket along with your watch, clip it to the belt loop immediately above your pocket instead."

      "title": "Place the watch in your fob pocket with the chain hanging down.",
      "content": "Place the watch in your fob pocket with the chain hanging down. The fob pocket is the tiny pocket on the inside of the front pocket on a pair of jeans. If your watch doesn’t fit in this pouch, simply place it in your actual pocket. Be sure to place the watch in your pocket with the front of the watch facing you. That way, you’ll easily be able to see the time when you pull it out. Although you can technically leave your watch hanging off of your belt loop, this tends to look very unkempt."

      "title": "Leave the chain in your pocket as well for a neater look.",
      "content": "Leave the chain in your pocket as well for a neater look. If you place both the pocket watch and the chain in the front pocket of your jeans, your outfit will look much more dapper. However, this will also make your pocket watch less noticeable to other people."

      "content": "Wear a slightly formal top to round out your smart casual ensemble. Wearing a loose T-shirt or tank top may look too casual next to your semi-formal pocket watch. Instead, go for a smart casual or business casual look that will work in tandem with your pocket watch. For example, the jacket, T-shirt, and jeans combination is a very popular outfit for people who wear pocket watches."

      "title": "Wear a vest with your watch and jeans for a more classic style.",
      "content": "Wear a vest with your watch and jeans for a more classic style. A colored vest and a button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up are a great top ensemble to pair with your watch and jeans, especially if you want your overall ensemble to match. Better still, if your vest has a pocket on it, you can place your pocket watch there instead of in your jeans pocket! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Match your shoes to the level of formality you’re trying to achieve. Whether you’re trying to look formal, business casual, smart casual, or simply casual, your shoes will play a big role in cementing the overall look of your ensemble. Go with black shoes for more formal affairs, brown loafers or blue dress boots to look more business casual, or sneakers for a completely casual look."

      "content": "Pair the color of your belt to your shoes, if you decide to wear a belt. In case you weren’t sure, yes, you can wear a belt with your pocket watch! If you decide to go this route, opt for a belt that matches the color of your shoes to make your outfit look more coordinated. [4] X Research source For example, if you’re wearing formal black shoes with your attire, go with a leather black belt to match."
