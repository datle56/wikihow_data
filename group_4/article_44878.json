This dilates the blood vessels and the warm sensation diminishes the pain by acting as a counter-irritant that masks the pain brought about by the inflammation. [4] X Research source Sebaceous cysts may be covered if not causing the patient distress; most are non-dangerous and are only bothersome aesthetically. However, if it's infected, seeking medical treatment is wise."

Pat dry the skin using a clean cloth or towel and cover with a sterile gauze when it starts to drain – keep the gauze dry at all times.

Medical intervention is a simple operation in which the cyst is completely removed. Don't worry -- the area around the lesion is numbed with a local anesthetic. Here's what you need to know: [14] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source After the local anesthetic is applied, the surgeon will either perform an oval incision on both sides of the lesion’s center or a single incision down its center. If the cyst is small, the doctor can lance it, instead of cutting it. The keratin around the cyst will be squeezed out. A retractor will be used to hold the edges of the incision apart while the doctor will use a forceps to remove the cyst. If the lesion is whole when removed, the operation is a success and the cure rate will be of 100 percent. If, however, the lesion is fragmented, the wound will be sealed by stitching after the procedure is complete. In the case where the cyst was infected, the same antibiotic treatment will be prescribed for a week after the intervention."

[17] X Research source Soak a piece of cloth in castor oil and place it on the cyst. Place a hot compress on top of the castor oil-soaked cloth and hold it for 30 minutes. The heat will help the oil diffuse into the skin a lot easier. Again, the science is lacking. It may potentially have some antibacterial effects, but its efficacy on cysts is dubious. It likely will not be harmful, and can help moisturize the skin, but there are likely many other products more effective than castor oil. [18] X Research source"

This, however, is very general and does not specially apply to cysts. In other words, do not rely on this remedy alone. [21] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Always dilute apple cider vinegar before applying it to the skin. Some apple cider vinegar in stores can be strong enough to cause chemical burns to the skin if not diluted. Even if diluted, people with sensitive skin may still experience irritation. Be cautious when applying this to your skin! Apply the diluted vinegar on the affected area and cover it with a bandage. Remove the bandage after 3 or 4 days. You will notice that a hard layer is formed on top of the lesion. When you remove the crust or when it naturally falls off, pus will ooze out along with the bacteria. Clean the area and apply a new bandage, without vinegar. After 2 or 3 days, the cyst should be healed."

      "content": "Know that abnormal cell proliferation is a cause. The skin surface is made out of keratin, a thin layer of cells which protects the skin. The keratin layer is continuously shed and replaced with a new batch of cells. Instead of a normal exfoliation, the cells can move deeper into the skin and continue to proliferate. Keratin will be secreted towards the inside of your body, creating a cyst. [23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This is, in itself, not harmful or dangerous -- it's simply not aesthetically pleasing. It's only if a tumor or infection develops that this abnormal proliferation is something to worry about."

When this is the cause, a small pocket of modified skin found in the dermis, which is the second layer of the skin, is referred to as a hair follicle. Each hair grows from one of these pockets. Follicles damaged by a constant irritating factor or surgical wound will suffer damage and scarring, leading to an ingrown hair."
