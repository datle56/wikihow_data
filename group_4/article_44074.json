Think carefully about what color you choose. The darker your hair, the darker the shade of tint you should get. Blondes shouldn't get black eyebrow tint, as the contrasting shades would clash."

Some kits come with a black and a brown paste. If you want darker eyebrows, put a dab of each into a paper cup. If you want lighter eyebrows, only use a dab of brown. Also add as many drops of eyebrow tint developer or conditioner as recommend by the kit instructions, then mix. [1] X Research source Your kit might come with its own mixing cup. If so, you can use that. Otherwise, you can use any small cup or plate. Some kits will come with a spatula or wooden sticks to mix the tinting components. You can either use that or a small brush.
