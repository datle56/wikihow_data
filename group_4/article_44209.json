      "content": "Lip trill to prevent vocal fry. You'll damage your voice over time if you frequently speak or sing with vocal fry. Instead of making a low, creaking or rough sound based in your throat, practice bringing the sound from the front of your mouth. Take a full deep breath, bring your lips together and blow the air out of your mouth so your lips vibrate quickly or trill. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Trill through your entire range and play around with the sounds you make.

Remove your fingers and bring your tongue towards the front of your mouth so the tip is near your bottom teeth. [7] X Research source Practice singing with your tongue forward and mouth open. You should notice a better sound because there's more space in your mouth for the sound to resonate."

      "content": "Study other singers, but sing within a range that's comfortable for you. Pay attention to how other singers breathe, hold themselves, and move their voices. You may learn little tricks such as tucking your chin on high notes or bringing your chest up to maintain energy. It's important to remember not to push your voice out of its comfort range or you could damage it. Instead, work on improving your tone and breathing so the quality of your voice improves."

You can also try clearing your voice by gargling salt water for about 30 seconds. Sucking on a cough drop or lozenge is safe for your vocal cords and will stop a cough."
