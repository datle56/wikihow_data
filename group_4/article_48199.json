Even though the term has been around since the 90s, it’s become more widely used on TikTok and other social media sites. Someone who is neurodivergent may have different strengths or challenges completing a task compared to another person. Rather than using words like “normal” or “abnormal” that are hard to define or could sound hurtful, “neurodivergent” is a much kinder term when you’re talking about someone with mental differences. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Someone who isn’t considered neurodivergent is “neurotypical,” which means their brain works similarly to most other people's brains. “Neurodiversity” means that there is no single definition for “normal” thinking, learning, or behaving. According to the neurodiversity paradigm, these differences should be celebrated rather than looked down on.

If you're neurodivergent, you face barriers and obstacles that other people don't have to deal with. Creating a more inclusive and accessible world is important to help neurodivergent people flourish and live their best lives. Neurodivergent people may be able to get accommodations at school or work to help them reach their full potential. Accommodations help remove some barriers to give a person more equal access."

Suppressing this behavior is often stressful, so in many cases, they're more comfortable when they can do what they need to do. Stimming and tics are two types of repetitive behavior. Stimming is another way to describe fidgeting. Examples include rocking, lining up pencils, shaking a leg, and humming. It can be automatic or on purpose. It helps people self-regulate so they can better manage feelings, focus, and sensory needs.

Some neurodivergent people have more sensitivity to intense stimuli, so they could feel uncomfortable or anxious if they’re put in these situations. [10] X Research source Others may have reduced sensitivity, so they may seek out intense sensory input to help them regulate their nervous systems. If someone often struggles with this, they may be diagnosed with sensory processing disorder (SPD). You may also be sensitive to certain textures or objects, such as preferring a smaller spoon over a larger one or finding clothing tags uncomfortable. Some kids with sensory issues grow out of them. But for many neurodivergent people, SPD is a lifelong issue. While most people associate SPD with autism and ADHD, these aren't the only conditions it's associated with. It can also come with dyspraxia, [11] X Research source PTSD, [12] X Research source and more."

Even though some neurodivergent conditions share traits, it’s important to find the underlying cause so you find coping strategies that are the most effective. Talk openly to your doctor about what you’re experiencing and what you struggle with. They may run tests or recommend a screening from a specialist to diagnose what you have. [17] X Research source Ask your doctor if there are any medicines you can take to help you with specific symptoms, such as to help you focus or feel less anxious. While the medication won’t completely eliminate your symptoms, they may be a bit easier to manage.

Being neurodivergent is not a condition on it own, and doesn't tell you anything about what specific support you need.

When you feel your nerves start to go away, try to slowly reintroduce yourself into the situation again.

Rather than putting pressure on yourself to do something in the same way as a neurotypical person, practice some self-compassion and recognize all the hard work you’ve already done to get to this point. [21] X Research source Don’t be afraid to try something different if you need to pivot. If what you’re doing already isn’t working, take a breath and brainstorm a new way to overcome the issue.
