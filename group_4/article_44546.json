      "content": "Drink at least 68 oz (2 liters) of water or electrolyte-rich fluids per day. Stay hydrated when you have food poisoning, to ward off nausea and to prevent dehydration, which can be dangerous. You’ll know you’re getting enough fluids if you’re urinating normally and your urine is clear or pale yellow. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You're dehydrated if your urine is dark-colored, or you’re urinating less frequently than usual, or not at all. [3] X Research source When you have food poisoning, try to drink about 7 ounces (200 mL) of fluids after each bout of diarrhea, in addition to your daily 68 oz (2 liters). You will need to drink even more than this if you’re dehydrated. [4] X Research source If you’re having trouble drinking large quantities of fluids, try taking small sips of water or sucking on ice chips. Sports drinks are high in electrolytes and can help you stay hydrated. Try to drink about 2 to 4 ounces (60 to 119 mL) of one every half hour to an hour. Be sure to avoid sports drinks that are high in sugar since they can make diarrhea worse. Fruit juice and coconut water can replenish lost carbohydrates and ease fatigue. You can make your own rehydration drink by mixing 6 teaspoons (24 g) of sugar, ½ teaspoon (2.8 g) of salt, and 1 qt (.95 L) of water."
