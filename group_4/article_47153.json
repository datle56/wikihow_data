      "content": "“Viva La Vida” is a song about a ruler who is being overthrown. At the end of his reign, the fallen king reminisces about the influence he used to wield, while also acknowledging the fleeting nature of power. [1] X Research source He expresses pain and regret about the end of his rule, but as revolutionaries call for his death, he ultimately accepts that his fate is unavoidable."

      "content": "In a more symbolic sense, it’s also about fame, ambition, and corruption. Just like a king may do corrupt things in the pursuit of power, a celebrity may do corrupt things in their pursuit of fame and success. With this in mind, “Viva La Vida” may be a symbolic commentary on the dangers of power, as well as its fleeting nature. Kings rise and fall, and celebrities also go through cycles of being adored and criticized, depending on how they use their power. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "The song may be inspired by King Louis XVI and the French Revolution.",
      "content": "The song may be inspired by King Louis XVI and the French Revolution. King Louis XVI was the last king of France before the French Revolution, when he was imprisoned and ultimately sentenced to death. [3] X Research source As he approached the guillotine for his public execution, he attempted to make one final speech to the crowd, but a loud drumroll drowned out his words. [4] X Research source Many people believe that “Viva La Vida” imagines the lost speech that King Louis would have given right before his execution. The album cover, which is a portion of the painting “Liberty Leading the People” by the French artist Eugène Delacroix, also seems to support this theory. The painting depicts revolutionaries fighting for freedom, with a female figure (presumably Liberty) waving the French flag near the center. Some people, however, believe that “Viva La Vida” is an exploration of revolution and the impermanence of power in general, not just in relation to Louis XVI."

      "title": "The title “Viva La Vida” itself was inspired by a Frida Kahlo painting.",
      "content": "The title “Viva La Vida” itself was inspired by a Frida Kahlo painting. Kahlo, who was an incredibly influential Mexican painter in the 20th century, inscribed the words “viva la vida” on her last work before she died . Translated from Spanish, the phrase means “long live life.” [5] X Research source Speaking about the title, Chris Martin (the lead singer of Coldplay) said he was inspired by Kahlo’s boldness and ability to find beauty in the midst of her struggle with illness and chronic pain.

      "content": "“I used to rule the world / seas would rise when I gave the word / now in the morning I sleep alone / sweep the streets I used to own.” The opening lines of the song immediately illustrate the king’s reversal of fortunes. He used to be the most powerful person in the world—armies would rise up and people would do his bidding at the snap of his fingers. Now, he’s a completely powerless person in the kingdom he used to rule."

      "title": "“Listen as the crowd would sing / now the old king is dead, long live the king.”",
      "content": "“Listen as the crowd would sing / now the old king is dead, long live the king.” King Louis XVI rose to power when his grandfather King Louis X died, and in many monarchies, it is tradition to say the phrase “the king is dead, long live the king” when a new ruler ascends. [7] X Research source With this in mind, it seems like the king is reminiscing on the beginning of his reign, when he still enjoyed the adoration and well wishes of his subjects. The lines may also be a commentary on the temporary nature of power. An old ruler must die for a new ruler to emerge, and this cycle goes on and on throughout history."

      "title": "“I discovered that my castles stand / upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.”",
      "content": "“I discovered that my castles stand / upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.” In these lines, the fallen king reflects on the fact that his reign was actually fragile and temporary, no matter how powerful and untouchable he felt at the time. His monarchy crumbled when the revolutionaries challenged him, just like a castle would crumble if it was built on an unstable foundation of salt or sand. This line is also an allusion to the story of Lot’s wife in the Bible. According to the story, God instructs Lot and his wife not to look back as they escape the burning cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot’s wife does look back, and as a consequence she’s turned into a pillar of salt. [8] X Research source With this in mind, the line may also be commenting on the pain of reflecting (or “looking back”) on something as it all comes crashing down."

      "title": "“Shattered windows and the sound of drums / people couldn’t believe what I’d become.”",
      "content": "“Shattered windows and the sound of drums / people couldn’t believe what I’d become.” In these lines, the king reflects on his subjects’ change of attitude toward him, leading to their decision to overthrow him, which also connects to the history of King Louis XVI. Although the French people may have had hope for the king’s success in the beginning of his rule, they ultimately lost faith in him as he failed to address economic and social issues. [9] X Research source The “shattered windows” and “sound of drums” may also be a reference to the revolutionaries’ marches and protests against the monarchy, including their storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, which was considered a turning point in the French Revolution.

      "title": "“Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate.”",
      "content": "“Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate.” This line is another strong clue that “Viva La Vida” is inspired by the death of King Louis XVI during the French Revolution. King Louis himself was in fact sentenced to death by revolutionaries, who essentially called for his “head on a silver plate.” He was killed using the guillotine, the French execution method that was infamously used to cut off aristocrats' heads.

      "title": "“I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin’ / Roman cavalry choirs are singin’.”",
      "content": "“I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin’ / Roman cavalry choirs are singin’.” In these lines, the doomed king compares himself to Jesus as he’s waiting to be crucified. [12] X Research source He imagines Jesus hearing the bells of the city of Jerusalem and the Roman army coming for him, just like the king himself is hearing the revolutionaries as they close in."

      "title": "“For some reason I can’t explain / I know St. Peter won’t call my name.”",
      "content": "“For some reason I can’t explain / I know St. Peter won’t call my name.” According to Christian tradition, St. Peter is the angel guarding the gates of heaven. In these lines, the fallen king seems to acknowledge that he made mistakes and acted immorally during his rule, so he’s aware that St. Peter won’t be welcoming him in through the pearly gates of heaven when he passes away. [13] X Research source This is one place where the song notably differs from the real history of King Louis XVI. Although he wasn’t able to make a full speech at the time of his execution, he did say the words, “I die innocent. I pardon my enemies and I hope that my blood will be useful to the French.” [14] X Research source With this in mind, it seems like the real King Louis wasn’t feeling quite as reflective or penitent as the fictional king in “Viva La Vida.”"

      "content": "The official music video expands on these revolutionary themes. The band performs in front of a backdrop of the painting “Liberty Leading the People,” which shows soldiers fighting in a revolutionary battle. The video is shot with the visual effect of cracking paint across the entire screen, making it appear as if the band members themselves are part of the painting, and therefore joining in the revolutionary fight.

[16] X Research source The song also enjoyed critical acclaim, earning Coldplay the award for Song of the Year at the 2009 Grammys. [17] X Research source In the years following the track’s release, it has remained one of Coldplay’s most appreciated and well-known songs, and it currently has over 2.5 billion streams on Spotify."

      "content": "“Clocks” by Coldplay If you’re looking for another Coldplay song with a beautiful, epic-sounding instrumental arrangement, you should definitely check out “Clocks.” The song features one of the most recognizable and beautiful piano melodies of Coldplay's career, and it has a big, sweeping feel, similar to “Viva La Vida.” The lyrics are also similarly introspective and metaphorical. For example, in the opening lines, Martin sings, “The lights go out, and I can’t be saved / tides that I tried to swim against / have brought me down upon my knees.”"

      "title": "“Take Me to Church” by Hozier",
      "content": "“Take Me to Church” by Hozier “Take Me to Church” has a very different subject matter from “Viva La Vida”—it’s about a romantic relationship, not a king being overthrown—but the two do have one major thing in common. Their lyrics feature several allusions to Christianity and the Bible, so if you appreciated these references in “Viva La Vida,” you might enjoy “Take Me to Church” too!"

It features powerful vocals and choral-sounding harmonies, plus a drum-heavy instrumental arrangement that gives it a very big and intense feel, just like “Viva La Vida.”"
