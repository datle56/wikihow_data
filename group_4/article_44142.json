Not all images are suitable for tracing in Adobe Illustrator. Photo-realistic images with lots of detail may take a long time to trace, use up a lot of computer processing power, and produce large files. The best images to trace tend to be simpler images with relatively few colors and details, such as logos, cartoon images, and illustrations the best images for tracing. You should also use a high-resolution image."

      "content": "Adjust the Tracing options. The options in the Tracing Options menu are as follows: Preview: Click the checkbox next to Preview to see the results of the tracing options you select in real-time. Presets: Use the drop-down menu next to \"Presets\" to select a preset tracing option. This will automatically set all the other tracing options in the menu. Mode: This selects the color mode you want to use. Your options are \"Black & White,\" \"Greyscale,\" and \"Color\". \"Black & White\" uses only black and white colors. \"Greyscale\" uses black and white and a variety of shades of grey. \"Color\" allows you to use different colors. Threshold: Threshold is used only in black and white mode. It sets what shade colors are converted to black or white. Pallette: This allows you to select a specific color palette to use when converting images to color or greyscale. This option is not available for black and white mode. Max Colors: This sets the maximum number of colors or shades of grey that can be used in the image trace. Output to swatches: Click the checkbox next to \"Output to swatches\" if you want to save the colors used in the image trace as swatches that you can use later on. Blur: This blurs the original source images before tracing. This can help smooth jagged edges and reduce the number of blemishes. Use this slider bar to select how much blurring you want to use before tracing the image. Resample: This option re-samples the original image to a specified resolution before tracing the image. This can help speed up the tracing process but also result in degraded results. Fills: Click the checkbox next to \"Fills\" to create regions filled with color or shades of grey in the tracing results. Strokes: Click the checkbox next to \"Strokes\" to create strokes around the filled regions, which can be used to outline the filled regions. Max Stroke Weight: This specifies how large an area in the original images needs to be in order to be converted into a stroke. Areas larger than the specified stroke weight will be converted into fills instead. Min Stroke Length: This specifies the minimum length an area of the original image must be in order to be traced as a stroke. Path Fitting: This specifies how much distance is allowed between the pixels in the original image and the traced shape. A lower setting creates a tighter path around the pixel image. Minimum Area: This specifies the smallest number of pixels in the original image that can be traced. Corner Path: This specifies how sharp a corner must be in order to be traced as an anchor point in the trace results. Raster: Use the drop-down menu next to \"Raster\" to specify how the original image is displayed in the trace results. Vector: Use the drop-down menu next to \"Vector\" to specify how the traced image is displayed."
