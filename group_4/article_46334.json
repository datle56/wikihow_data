This shows you your stats for the chapter (like your accuracy, clear time, and so on). After this, you'll have access to the Skill Settings menu, where you can spend your skill points (SP) and assign your different skills."

These are your different skill presets. For each preset, you can assign up to three skills. Depending on the skills you want to use for the next chapter, you can pick whichever preset suits your needs best. Select the first icon (labeled \"1\"). Three slots will pop out to the right. Select any one of these slots, then browse through the list of skills you want on the right. Select a skill from the list to add it to your preset. You can assign the other two skills the same way."

Their price (in SP) will be listed to the right. If you have enough SP to buy the skill, you can select it to purchase it. After you've purchased the skill, you can assign it to any of your preset slots. Note that when you highlight a skill, a description of what it does will pop up below. Use this to decide whether the skill is a good use of your SP. You can find a complete list of every skill in the game here . [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Upgrade multi-level skills to improve them. Some skills can be upgraded again for extra SP after you've already purchased them the first time. Each upgrade level makes the skill more powerful. However, each level costs more to upgrade than the one before it. Some skills have a maximum of two levels, some have a maximum of three, and some don't allow any upgrades. For example, the first time you buy the \"Firearm\" skill for 12,000 SP, it will increase the damage your guns do by 10%. The second level, which costs 29,000 SP, increases the damage by 20%. The third and final level, which costs 75,000 SP, increases the damage by a whopping 50%. [2] X Research source"

In the campaign, when you kill enemies, break boxes, and open chests, you'll sometimes get an item that looks like a chess piece. This item gives you SP when you pick it up. The better the chess piece, the more SP you'll get! Chess piece drops range from the very common pawn (worth just 50 SP) to the ultra-rare gold king (worth 10,000 SP).
