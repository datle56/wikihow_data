[4] X Research source For example, you could say: “How many klicks is it to the gas station?” “There are 4 klicks between my house and school. It’s barely outside of walking distance.” “There are 1,000 meters in a klick, so a marathon would be a little over 42 klicks.”"

      "content": "It’s clearer and easier to understand over radio. People in the military spend a lot of time using the radio, which isn’t always the easiest or clearest way of communicating. Since it’s easy to mishear people, “klick” is preferable to “kilometer” because the sharp sounds of the “ick” are easier to hear. This is also why soldiers and air traffic controllers use the phonetic alphabet to spell things out over the radio. [5] X Trustworthy Source Federal Aviation Administration U.S. government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation Go to source Truckers spend a lot of time talking over the radio when they’re driving, so the usage of “klick” is common among CDL drivers, too. Many radio users will use “mikes” instead of “miles” for the same reasons."

      "content": "Normally, no, “click” and “klick” almost always mean the same thing. You’ll normally see klick spelled with the K because it’s short for kilometer, which also starts with a K. “Klick” also doesn’t have any alternative definitions, which isn’t true for “click.” However, you can totally use click the same way you’d use klick.

      "content": "“Click” may refer to adjusting a weapon’s sights in the military. Soldiers “click in” when they adjust their weapon’s sights, so any reference to a “click” could specifically refer to sight adjustments. When you adjust a weapon’s sights, you calibrate the line of aim so that you have a better idea of where a bullet will land. [7] X Research source The proper term for this process is “sighting” or “sighting in.” The term “click” probably developed because you have to turn a dial that makes a clicking noise to adjust most sights."

American soldiers started saying “klick” as a shortened version of “kilometers” and the term stuck! [9] X Research source"

[10] X Research source The story goes that Australian soldiers would pick someone to measure the number of steps. Every time they took 100 steps, they’d move the gas regulator one tick on their rifle to keep track. After 10 rotations, the regulator would reset and make a “clicking” noise. So one “click” became a kilometer."
