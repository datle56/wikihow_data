An indicator light next to the camera will turn on if that camera is active, so you can figure out if your external camera or your built-in camera is currently in use. If your webcam is not appearing to work with your Chromebook (it doesn't appear as an option when you plug it in), you might not have a compatible webcam.

If the camera still doesn't work, try resetting your Chromebook to factory settings. If the issue persists, the hardware may be damaged and you'll need to talk to the Chromebook's manufacturer.
