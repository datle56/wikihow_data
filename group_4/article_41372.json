      "content": "Bedwetting is considered normal up to the age of 7. Most kids will stop wetting the bed after the age of 5, but 15% of children will continue to wet the bed up to the age of 7. As a result, this probably isn’t anything to be seriously worried about—even if does get irritating. Children have smaller bladders when they’re young, and the nerves that let them know they’ve got to urinate aren’t fully developed yet. As they get older, this problem is likely to solve itself. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If they’re older than 7 and they’re still wetting the bed, your child has other symptoms associated with the bedwetting, or they start wetting the bed after a few months with no problems, see a doctor. [2] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source It’s unlikely there’s anything wrong, but it’s worth checking out. It can be frustrating to deal with this, but remember that your child isn’t wetting the bed on purpose. Do your best to be supportive, loving, and encouraging. You’re more likely to see progress if your child feels comfortable with talking to you about the issue."

      "content": "It may not be a big deal, but it’s important to have this checked out. Schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor and let them know what’s going on. There are several medical conditions that can cause bedwetting, and there may be treatments out there. On top of that, bedwetting is occasionally a side effect of certain medications, and they may be able to prescribe you something else. Potential underlying conditions include: [3] X Research source Hormones imbalances Muscle spasms and muscular disorders Diabetes Stress and anxiety Kidney issues Urinary tract infections It is very possible that there’s no underlying condition here. Some adults just have active or small bladders, and everyone’s body is different. If nothing is wrong, you may just need to come up with a strategy to deal with the issue."

      "content": "Drink more during the day, and less at night. You don’t want to totally cut fluids off if you or your child is thirsty, but the more hydrated you are during day, the less thirsty they’ll be at night. Children aren’t always great at identifying when they need to urinate, and they may be going to bed with a full bladder without even knowing it, so the less they drink before bed, the better. If you’re wetting the bed, don’t drink anything and empty your bladder before bed. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your child does get thirsty before bed, try giving them less water than you’d normally give them. Even moderately decreasing how much they’re drinking may make a huge difference."

If you or your child don’t need to go, that’s okay, but at least give it a shot. Time the schedule so that you or your child is using the bathroom right before bedtime. [5] X Research source This way, the bladder will get used to the habit of urinating at specific times, which will decrease the odds that you or your child need to go in the middle of the night.

You might even consider giving them some kind of reward if they buy-in and give it a shot."

[7] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Improve sleep hygiene by maintaining a regular bedtime—even on weekends.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If your child is having other issues going to sleep or staying asleep, it may be better to address these issues first before focusing on the bedwetting.

      "title": "A midnight bathroom break is likely to help out dramatically.",
      "content": "A midnight bathroom break is likely to help out dramatically. However, the trick here is that you need to set the alarm to go off at a different time every night. If you get up at the same exact time every night, your bladder is going to pick up the habit of always emptying out at that time, which can make the problem worse in the long run. One night, get up at 2 am. The next night, get up at 4 am. Keep mixing it up so your bladder doesn’t get used to any one time. This is not a good solution for children. For one, it’s hard for kids to get up in the middle of the night. On top of that, the goal is ultimately for your child to sleep through the night. There’s also not a lot of evidence that waking kids up will help curb the bedwetting.

[12] X Research source Kegels are the gold standard when it comes to pelvic floor training (yes—even if you’re a man). This involves flexing your pelvic floor muscles for a few seconds over and over again. Sit down and imagine that you’re sitting on a marble. Try flexing like you’re trying to lift the marble up in the air. Hold it for 3 seconds before relaxing. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps throughout the day.

      "content": "Protecting your sheets and mattress can help in the short-term. While you’re working on fixing the source of the bedwetting, buy some absorbent briefs so that your bed doesn’t get soaked every time you wet the bed. Get a mattress cover if you don’t already have one so that your bed doesn’t get dirty. You can always sleep on top of an absorbent towel if you want to protect your sheets as well. [14] X Research source If your child is bedwetting, it may be tempting to put them back in diapers. There’s some evidence that this may actually make the problem worse though, so you’re better off not going this route. [15] X Trustworthy Source Nature Respected Multidisciplinary Scientific Journal Go to source You can sleep in adult diapers if you’re wetting the bed and you’re tired of cleaning up every other night.

It’s possible that they’re forgetting to use the bathroom, or sneaking drinks in the middle of the night after you’ve gone to bed. They may not be sleeping particularly well, or struggling to notice that they need to go. Either way, you may learn more about what’s going on, which can help you help them! Be supportive while talking to them about it. If they get the sense that you’re asking because you’re mad at them, they may not be honest with you. Even worse, they may internalize what they’re feeling and blame themselves for wetting the bed. Remind them that it’s not their fault and you aren’t mad at them!"

Everyone has something called an antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and this hormone basically tells your kidneys to stop making urine when it’s unnecessary. If you wet the bed after drinking, cutting back (or quitting entirely) may put an end to the problem. [16] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Caffeine has a similar effect, but unless you’re drinking coffee late at night, cutting back on the caffeine is unlikely to have a huge impact. If you’re only an occasional drinker and you’re only going to bed after one or two glasses of wine, it’s unlikely that this is the root cause of the problem. It’s worth trying, though!"
