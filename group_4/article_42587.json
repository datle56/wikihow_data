      "content": "Find the areas where the infant's pulse is strongest. An infant's pulse is stronger in the apical area, or left part, of the chest near the heart.

It is also strong in the brachial area, or the inner bend of the arm at the back of the elbow."

      "title": "Wash your hands.",
      "content": "Wash your hands. Infants have weaker immune systems than adults. Because of this, is it important that you rinse your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap. This will help to prevent you from transmitting any harmful microorganisms to the infant."

      "title": "Prepare the necessary materials.",
      "content": "Prepare the necessary materials. When taking an infant's pulse rate, it is helpful to use a stethoscope to allow you to hear the pulse. A stethoscope can be purchased at your local pharmacy. You will also need: A watch that counts seconds. Pen and paper."

      "title": "Place the infant on his or her back.",
      "content": "Place the infant on his or her back. Doing this will help to keep the infant's pulse rate from increasing, which could throw off the accuracy of your results. You can place the child between two pillows so that she cannot roll away, or you can ask someone to hold the infant on her back while you take the reading. [3] X Research source Circulatory Response to the Upright Posture by James J. Smith (1990, September 24), page 15-16. When an infant is placed in a vertical position, blood flows to the lower extremities due to the force of gravity, which causes the heart to beat faster. The heart beats faster because the heart has to work harder to pump blood to the different parts of the body. [4] X Research source Circulatory Response to the Upright Posture by James J. Smith (1990, September 24), page 15-16."

      "title": "Make sure that the infant is not crying before taking the pulse.",
      "content": "Make sure that the infant is not crying before taking the pulse. Extreme emotions activate the sympathetic nervous system (a part of the brain that increases vital signs such as the heart rate, breathing and blood pressure). As a result, if the infant is unhappy, the heart rate will increase suddenly. [5] X Research source Fundamental Nursing Skills and Concepts by Barbara Kuhn Timby (2009), page 195. If the infant begins to cry, soothe her and wait for her to calm down before you try taking her pulse."

      "title": "Locate the apical pulse.",
      "content": "Locate the apical pulse. If the baby is wearing a dress or shirt with hook-and-loop fastener straps or ties, undo these so that you can expose the baby's chest without removing the entire dress. To find the apical pulse [6] X Research source Fundamentals of Nursing 6th Edition Volume 1 by Potter and Perry (2005), Vital Signs, pages 637-44. : Place your pointer finger on the middle part of the baby's left clavicle, or collarbone (this is the long bone in the chest that is near the shoulder blade). Glide your finger down slowly to locate the first intercostal space (this refers to the space between each rib). Move down to the second and third intercostal space, until you reach the fourth space. This is where you should be able to feel the apical pulse most strongly. This spot is known as the spot of maximal impulse."

      "title": "Place your stethoscope on the baby's chest.",
      "content": "Place your stethoscope on the baby's chest. Warm the stethoscope up by placing the large metal circle (this is known as the diaphragm) in the palm of your hand for at least 10 seconds. Warning up the diaphragm will help to keep the infant from being startled by the cold metal and beginning to cry."

      "title": "Listen for the pulse.",
      "content": "Listen for the pulse. Insert the earpieces of the stethoscope and place the diaphragm on to the apical pulse, or the fourth intercostal space. Again, this should be the fourth space you find between the ribs when you run your finger down from the baby's left collarbone. You should hear a loud “lub-dub” sound when you put your stethoscope over the apical pulse. The “lub-dub” sound is considered one whole beat."

Get the pen and paper and record the number of pulses or heartbeats you hear in the space of 60 seconds. Wash your hands thoroughly when you are done recording the pulse rate."

      "content": "Gather your supplies. You will not need a stethoscope to listen to the brachial pulse, as it is not as loud as the apical pulse so you will most likely not be able to hear it. Instead, you will use your pointer and middle finger to feel the pulse. [8] X Research source Fundamentals of Nursing 6th Edition Volume 1 by Potter and Perry (2005), Vital Signs, pages 637-44.

Again, as mentioned above, it is important to take the infant's pulse when she is lying on her back because when an infant is held in a vertical position, her heart rate tends to increase. . [9] X Research source Circulatory Response to the Upright Posture by James J. Smith (1990, September 24), page 15-16.

The sympathetic nervous system, when activated, will increase the heart rate. [10] X Research source Fundamental Nursing Skills and Concepts by Barbara Kuhn Timby (2009), page 195. Do your best to soothe the infant and make sure that she is calm before you take a measurement of her pulse, otherwise you may not get an accurate reading."

Press your fingers firmly but gently against the baby's skin to try to feel the pulse. Count the pulse rate of the infant for one full minute for accurate results. Get the pen and paper and record the number of times you feel the infant's pulse beat in the span of 60 seconds. Consider repeating this process for another 60 seconds to double-check your findings."

A fast heart beat does not allow the heart to have sufficient time to fill before it contracts, so blood flow to the different parts of the body is compromised.

Normally, the heart makes two sounds during each beat: “lub”, which is considered the first heart sound (S1) and “dub”, which is the second heart sound (S2). A third heart sound (S3), is often described as a horse gallop sound, which makes the heartbeat sound like “lub du bub”.
