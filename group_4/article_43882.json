This number operates from 9am to 8:30pm (local time) on weekdays, 9am to 7pm on Saturdays, and 9am to 6pm on Sundays. [1] X Research source When you call, follow the voice prompts to provide more information about your account and what you need help with. There’s no guarantee you’ll get connected to a live person. Ticketmaster has cut many real life agents from their phone lines in recent years, although some segments of their market may still have actual employees answering the phone. [2] X Research source The average wait time is about 3 minutes, with the longest waits on Fridays and the shortest waits on Sundays. If you live in Alaska or Hawaii, the phone line’s hours of operation follow Pacific Time. For international customer service, call 1 (310) 867-7000 ."

Since you can only access the chat icon from your upcoming or previous orders, you’ll need to have placed an order first. This option is good if you need day-of assistance with tickets or are having difficulty getting through to an agent on the customer service phone line. A virtual chat assistant is available 24/7. To speak to an actual agent, use the chat feature between 9am and midnight (Eastern Time). [3] X Research source"

Some customers report waiting days for a reply or not hearing back from Ticketmaster until after their event has passed.

      "content": "Ticketmaster’s market dominance is the cause of their low ratings. Once Ticketmaster merged with Live Nation in 2010, they basically formed a monopoly, or a market without significant competition. Because of that, they don’t have much motivation to improve their customer service (or the services they provide to venues, artists, and artists’ management, either). [7] X Research source Gary Witt, the executive director of the Pabst Theater Group in Milwaukee, WI has even gone so far as to say, “Nobody likes Ticketmaster.” [8] X Research source A great example of Ticketmaster’s failure to serve customers was the platform’s meltdown when singer Taylor Swift announced her Eras tour. The heavy web traffic broke the site and caused huge wait times and high ticket prices because there was no alternative to find tickets. The monopoly has become so severe that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) may file an antitrust lawsuit to reverse the merger, although many are skeptical this will do much to curb Ticketmaster’s power."
