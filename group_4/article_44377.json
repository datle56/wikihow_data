      "content": "Use two sticks, a cord, a rock, and your pocketknife to build to an Ojibwa Bird Pole. This trap has been used in Canada since prehistoric times. It looks a bit like an upside-down \"L.\" Birds will perch on the smaller stick, which is rigged to a simple noose that tightens when a bird lands on the perch. While it requires some knowledge of knots, the Ojibwa Bird Pole is the simplest, easiest trap you can make in the wilderness. You'll need: A large branch, roughly the width of a few fingers and 5-6 feet long. A pencil-thin stick, roughly six inches long. A rock, roughly the size of your fist. A 3-4 foot cord or rope. This can be a shoestring, a sleeping bag cord, a sturdy vine, or twine. A sharp pocket knife."

      "content": "Wedge the thin stick into the hole you drilled. It should be right next to the string, but the string should still move freely. You don't want to put the stick all the way in, just enough to keep it in place. This \"perch\" needs to fall under the weight of the bird in order to snare it."

      "title": "Thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it.",
      "content": "Thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it. The weight of the rock will try and pull the string back through your hole. You want to make it so that, combined, the knot and the stick hold the rope in place, with the rock hanging freely about halfway up the pole. This may take some trial and error since your hole and stick size will be different depending on your materials. The knot should be able to move freely through the hole in the pole when the stick isn't jammed in. Some trappers tie the small knot first, then put the stick in. Experiment with what works for you. You should have two feet of string or more on the other side of your knot."

To make a slip noose: Double the string back on itself to make a U-shaped loop. Run the end of the string back towards the top of the loop. It will look a bit like a flattened \"S.\" Wrap the end of the rope around the doubled line 2-3 times. Pull the rope tight, cinching the wrap around the doubled string. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Test the trap by gently pushing the perch down. As you do, the weight of the rock should pull the rope through the hole, which will quickly tighten the noose and grab your finger. Note, however, that these traps are very variable. Play with the size of the noose and the perch -- the closer they are to the same size, the more effective your trap will be. Also, try and tie the smallest knot possible in the beginning so that the rope can move freely through the hole -- you want it to snap shut quickly once the stick is removed."

Their parents are likely nearby, keeping an eye out, and they should be left alone unless they are injured. [13] X Research source If you think a baby bird has been abandoned, call a wildlife rehabilitator. You can find one through your local veterinarian or wildlife agency.
