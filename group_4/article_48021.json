      "content": "“WTM” is usually short for “what’s the move?” If a friend of yours hits you up on a Friday or Saturday night with a text that just says “WTM?” it’s short for “what’s the move?” This is a laid-back way of asking “what are we doing tonight?” Notably, they’re also presuming that the two of you are automatically meeting, so this is for sure what they mean if the two of you discussed hanging out previously. Someone might say: “Jimmy! WTM tonight?” “WTM? We going to Sandy’s place, or what?” “Hey, WTM tomorrow?”"

      "content": "“WTM” may be shorthand for “what’s the matter?” If you’ve been dealing with a tough issue lately or someone in your life knows that you’re in a rut, “WTM” is likely short for “what’s the matter?” This is your friend or family member’s way of checking in to see if you’re alright. Someone could text or message you: “Hey, you’ve seemed down lately. WTM?” “WTM? I just saw you posted you’re going through a rough time. Anything I can help with?” “U ok? WTM?”"

      "title": "In some cases, “WTM” stands for “whatever that means.”",
      "content": "In some cases, “WTM” stands for “whatever that means.” If someone seems frustrated by unclear instructions, confusing homework, or vague comments, “WTM” probably means “whatever that means.” It’s their way of venting frustration about something that’s annoying them. For example, someone might say: “Casey told me to ‘go for it’ WTM.” “I asked the teacher for help and they just said, ‘use the formula’ WTM. It’s like, c’mon now, actually help me!” “Apparently Jason wants us to meet up for a pow-wow tomorrow WTM.”"

      "content": "Send a sole “WTM?” (what’s the move) to ask your friends what’s up. You can use “WTM” to probe your friends for info on what’s going on. When you use it this way, the connotation is that you’re trying to meet up and do something, but you don’t have any particular plans. [1] X Research source If you’re looking for something to do, you might text or message someone: “WTM tonight? Are you trying to hang?” “I heard Jane is throwing a party tonight, but idk. WTM?” “Are you going out tonight? WTM? I need something to do.”"

      "content": "Use “WTM” (what’s the matter) to check in on people. If you see someone posting on Instagram about how sad they are, or you get a Snapchat message from a friend who “needs to talk,” you might send them a “WTM” message. You could say: “Hey, WTM? You doing alright?” “I saw you were upset at school today. WTM?” “Are you okay? WTM? I’m worried about you.”"

      "content": "Send “WTM” (whatever that means) when you’re confused. If you want to convey annoyance or frustration with someone’s vagueness, you could use “WTM” to signal that you aren’t happy with the info you’ve been given. Whether you’ve got a boss who fires off ambiguous memos or a teacher whose homework looks like hieroglyphics, you can use “WTM” to let some steam off. You might say: “It sounds like Ms. Jones wants us to ‘find the cosign of the value’ WTM. It’s unclear on what value she’s talking about.” “They used the word ‘flabbergasted’ WTM lol.” “I freaked out when they asked me where I saw myself in 5 years. I said ‘On top,’ WTM.”"

      "content": "Respond to “WTM” (what’s the move) by explaining where the party is at. If someone wants to know what the move is, it means they want the scoop on where you (and all of your mutual friends) are hanging out. Respond to this kind of “WTM” message or text by telling them what your plans are. If you don’t have a move to make, let them know. You might reply to a “WTM tonight?” inquiry by saying: “Mike and Angie are going to the Wu-Tang Clan concert, then I’m meeting them at Sharod’s place afterwards. Want to meet me up with us at Sharod’s?” “I don’t have anything to do tonight. If you’ve got anything on the radar, let me know.” “I think there’s a block party on 24th tonight. I was going to check that out if you want to come!”"

      "content": "Reply to “WTM” (what’s the matter) by explaining what’s upsetting you. If someone reaches out to you with a “what’s wrong?” style message, reply by letting them know how you are. If you need help, ask for it! They’re reaching out to support you, after all. If you’re doing alright or you don’t want to talk about it, at least let them know why you don’t want to engage. You might reply to “WTM, you okay?” with: “Hey, thanks for reaching out. Just going through a tough breakup.” “I’m okay. I was just venting because I’m really annoyed at work.” “I’m having a really rough week, but I’m doing alright. Thanks for checking in.”"

      "content": "Respond to “WTM” (whatever that means) by clarifying or agreeing. If a friend seems confused by something in their “WTM” message and you happen to know what’s going on, help them out! If you’re not sure what’s going on either, or it seems like they simply want someone to complain to, reply by agreeing with their assessment. For example: Them: “My doctor says I’m at a normal BMI, WTM…” You: “BMI is your body mass index. That’s a good thing, it means you’re a healthy weight!” Them: “My boss said they want a quarterly assessment, WTM.” You: “Yeah, that’s pretty confusing. I don’t think that’s a real thing haha.”"

      "content": "What They Meant In some instances, “WTM” might be shorthand for “what they meant.” This isn’t a particularly common usage, but it’s close enough to “whatever that means” that you can use it this way instead. Someone might say: “They said that they wanted to buy an Nbox, but WTM was ‘Xbox.’” “I know Mr. Tilsen said not to include references, but WTM was not to include a bibliography. I can almost promise it.” “Melissa said to call her after 11. I know you think that’s PM, but WTM was AM.”"
