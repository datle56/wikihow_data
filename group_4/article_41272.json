      "content": "Avoid foods and odors that cause salivation. Limit your consumption of citrus fruits, sugary foods, and sour foods, which can send your salivary glands into overdrive. Do your best to steer clear of any other foods and odors, such as cooking smells or personal fragrances, that cause you to salivate. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Eating any food can stimulate salivation, but bland, dry foods such as crackers or toast might help absorb excess saliva and provide immediate relief. If someone nearby is cooking or eating and you can’t avoid them, try to distract yourself . Keep yourself busy with an activity, sing a song in your head, write a story, or chat on the phone."

Aim to drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of water per day if you're a man, or 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) if you're a woman.

      "content": "Chew on a piece of gum or suck on hard candy. This can help to stop mild to moderate drooling, especially if you’re unable to control it. By keeping your mouth busy with something, you’ll be less likely to drool. Always keep some gum or candy on hand in case you need it.

      "content": "Drink a glass of dark grape juice. When you’re salivating excessively, pour yourself a glass of grape juice. The tannic acid in dark grape juice can make your mouth feel dry and decrease saliva production. [4] X Research source Other beverages that contain tannic acid include green and black teas, coffee, and red wine. Keep in mind these beverages can lead to tooth decay and staining. Be sure to floss once a day and brush your teeth at least twice a day. As a bonus, brushing could temporarily relieve excessive salivating."

      "content": "Try using sage or ginger to dry out your mouth. Drinking a cup of ginger tea or sage tea could help dry out overactive salivary glands. Chewing sage leaves or a piece of ginger root could do the trick, too. You could also drink a sage tincture once a day: add 15 to 20 drops of sage extract to a glass of water. [5] X Research source You can find sage tea bags at grocery stores, health stores, and online. Alternatively, steep 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of fresh sage leaves or 1 teaspoon of dried sage in 1 c (240 mL) of hot water for 3 to 5 minutes. Some medical professionals recommend using sage and ginger to decrease salivation in patients with conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and ALS. However, consult your doctor before taking any medicinal herb or supplement, especially if you have a medical condition or take any medication. Avoid using sage extracts or tinctures if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Consuming more than 15 g of sage leaves or 0.5 g of sage oil extract per kg of body weight could lead to hypersalivation, among other undesirable effects.

For small children or adult patients with difficulty swallowing, training the muscles involved in swallowing can help keep saliva from pooling.

[14] X Research source If you have dentures or braces, these can also cause you to hypersalivate.

      "content": "Ask your doctor about medications that can manage salivation. Medications called anticholinergic drugs block the nerve signals that tell the salivary glands to produce saliva. They’re available as 0.5 g tablets or as a patch worn behind the ear. Typical dosage amounts are 1 to 3 tablets per day or 1 patch applied daily. Side effects may include constipation, excessive dry mouth, decreased urination, irritability, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, vomiting, constipation, flushing, headache, and blurred vision.

      "content": "Ask your doctor about 1% atropine eye drops. This medication can be taken sublingually (under the tongue) to help produce a local drying effect in the mouth. Atropine is an anticholinergic medication, but since it’s being administered at a low dose in the mouth, the side effects that these medications usually cause are much less likely.

Using an ultrasound as a guide, a medical professional will inject the salivary glands with a toxin that temporarily blocks their function. [20] X Research source Botox injections need to be administered every 5 to 6 months in order to manage excessive salivation. Make sure that you see an experienced ear, nose, and throat doctor for this treatment option."

      "content": "Consider surgery as a last resort. Surgical removal of the salivary glands is rare, and only advised if hypersalivation significantly impacts quality of life. For instance, choking on excess saliva is potentially life-threatening for a person with an advanced motor neuron disorder, so surgery might be the best solution. [21] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source There are a variety of surgical options available. Your doctor, or the medical team of the person in your care, will help determine which is appropriate. Generally, salivary gland surgery is fast and simple. Some surgeries only require local anesthesia, which means the area would be numbed and you’d stay awake during the procedure."
