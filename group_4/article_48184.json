      "content": "Niji is one of Midjourney's AI image generation models. Midjourney has a number of models you can use for various applicationsâ€”and Niji is best used when you want to generate an anime-style or illustrative image. According to Midjourney, Niji's AI has better knowledge of anime styles and aesthetics than other Midjourney models. Niji was created as a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush, which is also known as Sizigi Studios. Sizigi Studios is the creator of the mobile game Arrowmancer and the card game Cake Duel.

      "content": "Niji can be used in Midjourney's Discord or in the Nijijourney Discord. You can use Niji in either Discord and get the same results, as Nijijourney's Discord bot uses your existing Midjourney account that you use in the Midjourney Discord. While Nijijourney is a separate Discord server from Midjourney, you will still need a Midjourney subscription to use it."

      "content": "Niji has four distinct styles that can be altered with parameters. While you can use Niji without designating a style, you can include one to better fine-tune your images. The four styles are as follows: Cute style will typically generate images in a pastel color scheme with a cutesy anime style, sometimes called super-deformed, chibi, or kawaii. Expressive style will usually create images with a saturated color scheme with a style that evokes western or U.S. animation studios. Original style makes images with muted color schemes that look similar to traditional anime from Japan. Scenic style generates images with bloom, ambient occlusion, and dramatic lighting, and is a good choice for fantasy or cinematic prompts."

      "content": "Type out a prompt. Like any Midjourney prompt, you should start with /imagine . Then describe your image, such as three birds sitting on a fence . Finally, add the --niji 5 parameter as well as your --style parameter with your chosen style, if using. Your full prompt should look something like this, in this example: /imagine three birds sitting on a fence --niji 5 --style expressive ."
