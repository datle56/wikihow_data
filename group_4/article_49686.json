Does it express a complete idea?\" [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, \"Eggs near river\" is not a sentence because it does not express a complete idea. \"I ate eggs near a river yesterday\" is a sentence because it has a clear, complete meaning. \"Because I ate eggs\" is a sentence fragment because it is incomplete; \"because\" sets the reader up for a cause-and-effect, but there is no effect here. \"Because I ate eggs near a river, I got wet\" is a sentence because it completes the cause-and-effect established by the word \"because.\""

Proper terminal (end) punctuation includes a period (.), question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). Punctuation marks inform the reader when your sentence is finished, as well as the tone of voice they should use when reading.

She is the person being discussed. \"Writes\" is the verb. It is the action that the subject (Janet) is doing. Remember, the subject can be a person (I or Janet), place (Baltimore or Bathroom), thing (Chocolate), or idea (Jealousy). [5] X Research source"

Here is an example: \"Janet writes romance novels.\" The phrase \"romance novels\" is the direct object here: they are what Janet writes, so they receive the action of the verb. Simple sentences can also have compound subjects or compound verbs. A compound subject could look like this: \"Janet and Sujata write romance novels.\" \"Janet and Sujata\" is a compound subject here, since there are two people doing the action. A compound verb could look like this: \"Janet writes and publishes romance novels.\" Janet is doing two things here, writing and publishing, so this is a compound verb."

A plural subject and verb looks like this: \"My sons are doctors\"."

The two simple sentences are joined by a comma (,) followed by one of seven words called coordinating conjunctions. The seven coordinating conjunctions are: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. To help you remember, use the mnemonic FANBOYS. Here are some examples of compound sentences. Note the use of the coordinating conjunction. [7] X Research source He was happy, for he just passed his exam. The road was long, and we could not see the end. She was not wrong, nor was she entirely right. She would have fallen, but Sally helped support her. Deon is smart, or Deon is lucky. I am eating steak, yet I really wanted lamb. Jack was wet, so he changed his clothes."

A dependent clause is a group of words that contain a subject and a verb but do not express a complete thought by themselves. In other words, a dependent clause is not a simple sentence by itself. [11] X Research source There are several words, called subordinating conjunctions, that indicate the beginning of a dependent clause. Examples of subordinating conjunctions are as follows: after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, if, in order to, since, though, unless, until, whatever, when, whenever, whether, and while.

You do not provide a comma before the dependent clause if the independent clause comes first. Commas are only used if the dependent clause is introducing the simple sentence.

[17] X Research source This is a fragment because it does not provide a complete thought; there's meaning here that isn't explained ( Although ...what?). \"Hit something with my car.\" While you might use type of language in everyday speech, it's technically a fragment because it lacks a subject (who did the hitting).

Run-on, or fused, sentences happen when you include more than one independent clause (a clause with a subject and verb that expresses a complete idea) in your sentence. [18] X Research source For example, this is a run-on sentence: \"I went to the store I got bread and milk.\" Each of the parts, I went to the store and I got bread and milk have a subject and verb, and each expresses a clear, complete idea. You can fix run-ons in a few ways. You can separate the clauses with a semicolon, or you can use a comma and a conjunction, or you can break the clauses up into separate sentences: I went to the store; I got bread and milk. The semi-colon shows the close relationship between clauses here. I went to the store, and I got bread and milk. This conjunction shows less of a close relationship than the semi-colon, but it communicates that they're connected ideas. I went to the store. I got bread and milk. This full break indicates that the ideas aren't all that related."

Comma splices are very common errors, but are often considered major errors by teachers. [19] X Research source For example, this is a comma splice: \"I texted my friend, she didn't reply.\" Both of these are independent clauses, because they have subjects and verbs and express a complete thought. You can fix comma splices the same ways you fix run-on sentences: With a semi-colon: \"I texted my friend; she didn't reply.\" With a comma and coordinating conjunction: \"I texted my friend, but she didn't reply.\" By splitting into two sentences: \"I texted my friend. She didn't reply.\""

      "content": "Stay parallel. If you have a fairly complex sentence, it can be easy to lose track of the nouns or verbs in it. However, if you don't maintain parallel structure, your sentences become difficult to read and lose a lot of their impact. [20] X Research source For example, this sentence lacks parallel structure: \"I enjoy fishing, swimming, and hike.\" Instead, keep all the verbs in the same form: \"I enjoy fishing, swimming, and hiking.\" This can be a particular problem if you have a lot of clauses in your sentence. For example: \"My teacher told me that I should submit my essay on time, that I should proofread it carefully before turning it in, and to not email her the night before.\" Instead, keep all the clauses in the same structure: \"My teacher told me that I should submit my essay on time, that I should proofread it carefully before turning it in, and that I should not email her the night before.\""

A common mistake, especially with beginning writers or writers in a language they are still learning, is to write all your sentences in the same basic structure. Varying your sentences makes your writing read more smoothly and is more pleasant for the reader.

I tripped over a rock. I got up again. I kept running.\" All of the sentences have the same word order (subject-verb-direct object) and begin with the same subject. Now look at a spiced-up version: \"I saw a zombie and started to run, but I tripped over a rock. Panicked, I picked myself up and kept running.\""
