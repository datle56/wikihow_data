      "title": "Pick out appropriate glass jars and bottles.",
      "content": "Pick out appropriate glass jars and bottles. Look for jars or bottles designed for canning purposes. They should be made of tempered glass and free of nicks and cracks. [1] X Research source Be sure they each have appropriate tight-fitting lids. Jars should have flat, gasket-lined lids with screw bands. Screw bands can be reused, but you'll need new flat lids. Bottles should have rubber seals that are in good condition."

      "content": "Wash the jars and bottles. Use hot water and dish soap to thoroughly wash the jars and bottles you plan to sterilize. Make sure they are completely free of dried pieces of food and other debris. Wash the lids as well. They must be scrupulously clean."

      "content": "Boil the jars and bottles. Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. If you're at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet (304.8 m), boil them for 10 minutes. Add an additional minute for each additional 1,000 feet (304.8 m) of elevation.

      "content": "Set the jars on a rack inside a deep pot. The wire rack will keep the jars from touching the bottom of the pot, helping the contents of the jar get evenly cooked and ensuring that the jar seals properly. Use a jar lifter to place the jars on the rack. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Boil the jars. Fill the pot with water until the jars are covered by 2 inches (5.1 cm). Boil the jars for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pot with a jar lifter and place them on paper towels. [6] X Research source Wait 24 hours before handling the jars. They should be completely cool before you put them into storage. Check the jar lids. A slight indentation in the flat lids shows that they have been properly sealed. If any of the lids are not indented, open the jars and use the contents instead of storing them."
