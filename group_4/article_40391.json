      "title": "Look for deep blue laminated letters that spell boost on the box.",
      "content": "Look for deep blue laminated letters that spell boost on the box. Turn the closed box so the white label on one end is facing you. On real NMD shoes, the oversized word “boost” appears, starting with the B and O on this panel of the box and wrapping around. The word appears in a shiny, slightly darker shade of dusty blue than the surrounding background color. Fake NMD shoes often start the word boost on another panel or in the wrong color."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the shoe’s model photo on the box.",
      "content": "Inspect the shoe’s model photo on the box. Look for a picture of the shoe on the end of the box with the label. Often fake NMD shoes exaggerate the curve of the sole of the shoe in this photo. The toe of the shoe should lay flat rather than point upward. [1] X Research source Real NMD shoes are more wedge-shaped than curved and will appear so in this photo."
    },
    {
      "title": "Observe the spacing around the model number on the box’s label.",
      "content": "Observe the spacing around the model number on the box’s label. Look for the shoe’s proper model number (S79168) on the white label at the end of the box. It should be in the top right hand corner. On real NMD shoes, this number is spaced evenly between the black line below it and the top of the label. On fake NMD shoes, it’s often printed on or near the black line below. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Notice embossing on the sole beneath the foot plug.",
      "content": "Notice embossing on the sole beneath the foot plug. Flip your shoe over to the sole, and look underneath the front foot plug. This foot plug is a decorative accent that is royal blue in original black NMDs. On real NMDS, there will be some slight dot-pattern embossing on the white diamond under sole beneath this foot plug. On fake NMDs, this embossed detail is often missing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the foot plugs for the appropriate logo and notch spacing.",
      "content": "Examine the foot plugs for the appropriate logo and notch spacing. Turn the shoe in profile so you are looking at the outside edge of the exterior sole. On real NMD shoes, you should see two foot plugs: a royal blue foot plug under the ball of the foot with the Adidas name and logo in black, and under the heel, a red foot plug with 8 evenly spaced notches. The colors of these foot plugs may vary if you have real NMD shoes in a color other than original black. The appearance of the logo and notches should remain the same though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for pin-sized dots on the outside edge of the exterior sole.",
      "content": "Look for pin-sized dots on the outside edge of the exterior sole. Turn the shoe so you’re looking at the side with the foot plugs. If you look closely between the two foot plugs, on real NMD shoes there will be 4 vertical lines of pin-sized dots in the white boost material of the soles. Starting at the blue foot plug working backward, there will be 2 vertical lines of 2 dots each then 2 vertical lines of 3 dots each. Fake NMDs are often missing these telltale manufacturing dots. They are a part of the signature boost material in NMD soles."

      "title": "Read for a gender on the tongue’s label.",
      "content": "Read for a gender on the tongue’s label. Look on the underside of the shoe’s tongue for a white label. Beneath the sizing information, real shoes have the intended gender of the wearer—either Male or Female—listed in both English and French as the shoes are made in Vietnam. Fake NMD shoes often skip the gender and simply list the model number. [3] X Research source So for example, real men’s shoes will read “Male/Mâle” and real women’s shoes will read “Female/Femelle.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for a unique security number on each shoe.",
      "content": "Check for a unique security number on each shoe. On the tongue’s underside label, look for a 13-digit security code in the bottom-most right hand corner of the label. On real NMD shoes, your left and right shoes will each have a unique number. If this number is the same on both shoes, your NMDs are fake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for underlying texture through the 3 signature side panels.",
      "content": "Look for underlying texture through the 3 signature side panels. On each side of the upper, look for the 3 signature side stripes that are typical of Adidas shoes. On real NMD shoes, you will still be able to see the texture of the prime knit material of the uppers through the side panels. The panels should not be perfectly smooth. These panels are embedded in the shoe and should not protrude significantly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect for a heel overlay with the Adidas logo.",
      "content": "Inspect for a heel overlay with the Adidas logo. Check the heels of your NMD shoes for a rubber heel overlay with the trefoil Adidas logo as well as Adidas lettering. On real NMD shoes, a small trademark symbol is located above the letter s and slightly to the right on both shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for two identical bulges around the collar of the shoe.",
      "content": "Look for two identical bulges around the collar of the shoe. Look at the ankle collar or foot opening of your NMD shoes. Right above the laces on each side, there should be a slight bulge in the collar fabric that’s there to help your shoes fit more snugly. If your shoes don’t have this bulge, they may be fake NMD shoes."
