If you are travelling to a country where you plan to use Uber, make sure you have a payment method that works in that country. Credit cards are a popular way to pay for Uber, and many credit card companies will have no issue overseas. However, some cards may prevent international purchases, and that can hinder your ability to use Uber. If you live in the US or Canada and have cellular service through T-Mobile, AT&T, or Bell and Rodgers, your phone is compatible with GSM networks. [4] X Research source Other providers may also have phones that use GSM—call your carrier if you are not sure. Some CDMA providers (like Sprint and Verizon) have a range of “world phones” that can be used on either CDMA or GSM networks. If your phone is not GSM-compatible, you can still use the Uber app when you have access to Wi-Fi. This can be dangerous to rely on, as Wi-Fi networks are not always available."

A few weeks in advance (if possible), call your carrier’s customer service phone number and ask if your phone is locked. If it’s not—great! If the phone is locked, as the customer service agent to unlock it for international travel. [5] X Research source The agent may offer you an international roaming plan as an alternative. These plans do not come with a local phone number in the company where you are traveling and cost far more money than you’re used to paying for calls, texts, and data.
