      "content": "Find a good time. It's important to choose a good time to talk. You don't want him to be distracted, upset about something else, or just downright busy! That will kill your chances before you even get started. Talk to him about setting aside some good time to talk, or try to catch him at a time when you know he won't be busy."

      "content": "Talk to him in private. Talk to him in private. Confessing your crush in front of other people will make him feel pressured and embarrassed, and you don't want that!

      "content": "Say it - it's simple. The most basic way to confess your crush is to just come right out and say it. This can take courage, but generally people will appreciate your honesty and will be flattered by your bravery. This avoids gimmicks and shows how much you really think they're worth. Here are some examples of how to say it: \"Hey, Brian. I thought you deserved to know that I have very strong feelings for you. You don't have to return my feelings, but I thought it was only right for you to know.\" \"Michael: you're special. You're kind, smart, and funny and I am so much happier when you're around. I want us to be more than friends. I hope you see, like I do, that we could be something really great.\""

      "content": "Use a song. You probably don't remember what mixtapes are, but using songs to confess feelings is still a viable option. Find a song you know he'll love. Ask to borrow a USB drive from him to transfer a file from a school/work computer to your personal computer. Leave the mp3 of the song on the USB, specially named so he'll know: \"MIKE - Tessa Wants to Hold Your Hand\" or some other reference to the song. Good song options include: \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" by the Beatles, Frank Sinatra's \"Let's Fall In Love\", or Daft Punk's \"Digital Love\"."

You want to avoid speaking in definite terms about the future because this creates a lot of pressure and expectations for him...which is stressful and can scare him away! Instead, speak in terms of what you want to try or what you hope might become real eventually. \"I hope we can try being more than friends,\", etc."
