You could also address your parents, or maybe a specific teacher as a joke, or someone who helped you write the speech. This is always a good way to start a speech and it helps you warm up as you get into it. For example \"I'd like to thank my Grandparents for traveling all the way down from Alaska to be here today.\" or \"I would like to thank my 11th grade teacher, Ms. Johnson, who developed my love for writing poetry.\""

Generally you want to end your speech with a message, rather than saying thank you. It's not like a movie where the credits roll at the end. Try to think who is important to you and whom you owe. Who put you in the position to make this speech at all?"

      "title": "Thank the school.",
      "content": "Thank the school. The school is giving you the opportunity to address the whole student body, the teachers, and maybe even the board of trustees.

      "title": "Use your own voice.",
      "content": "Use your own voice. Don't use difficult vocabulary just for the sake of it. You want to keep your own voice in the speech as much as possible and avoid sounding too stale. You can be formal, but don't try to sound like an academic paper. You want people to pay attention to what you are saying. For example, \"It's been four years that we've all been to school together, and we still don't know who stole that headrest from the bus on that 9th grade field trip - but we've learned a lot of other things\""
