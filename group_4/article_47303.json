      "content": "Wash your skin with rubbing alcohol if you don't have access to soap. You might find yourself on a trail without access to soap, but if you have rubbing alcohol in your first aid kit, you could use that. Pour the rubbing alcohol onto poison ivy-exposed skin and gently rub your skin to loosen the urushiol. [5] X Research source Be sure to rinse the rubbing alcohol off with cool water."

      "title": "Wear vinyl or cotton gloves to handle the clothes.",
      "content": "Wear vinyl or cotton gloves to handle the clothes. If your clothes or shoes have brushed against poison ivy, the urushiol oil might have transferred to the items. Since urushiol can stay on clothing for years, it's important to effectively clean the materials. Put on a pair of vinyl or cotton gloves so your bare skin doesn't come into contact with the oil again. [6] X Research source Avoid using thin rubber or latex gloves, because urushiol can get through these materials."

      "title": "Put the contaminated clothing into the washing machine.",
      "content": "Put the contaminated clothing into the washing machine. Don't add clothes that weren't exposed to poison ivy into the machine. Combining the clothes could transfer urushiol oil to the unexposed clothing. Instead, put only the poison ivy-exposed clothes into your machine. Then, discard the gloves you wore when you handled the clothes. [7] X Research source If you can't wash the poison-ivy exposed clothes right away, wear gloves to put the clothes into a plastic trash bag. Once you empty the clothes into the washing machine, discard the bag."

      "content": "Add a full scoop of laundry detergent. Poison ivy is difficult to wash out, so put a full scoop of powdered laundry detergent in with the clothes even if you're only washing a few articles of clothing. The detergent will mix with the full tub of water to create a powerful solution. [8] X Research source If you use liquid detergent, add a whole capful to the load."

      "content": "Run the machine on the hottest, largest, and longest cycle settings. Poison ivy's oil doesn't break up easily in water, so fill your machine full of hot water and set it to run for the longest cycle. This gives the soapy solution the best chance to wash off the urushiol oil. [9] X Research source If you have the option, select a deep-fill rinse to remove the urushiol oil and prevent it from redepositing on the clothes. To wash a large amount of contaminated clothing, divide them into small loads. Smaller loads agitate the clothing better and ensure that the urushiol oil rinses off."

      "content": "Wear new gloves to transfer the clothes to the dryer. Although the urushiol should be off of the clothing, it doesn't hurt to wear a new pair of vinyl or cotton gloves to transfer the wet clothes to the dryer. Run the dryer on whichever setting you usually use. [10] X Research source Remember to discard the gloves after using them."
