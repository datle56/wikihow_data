      "title": "Attend a Catholic mass and wait for the sacrament of Communion.",
      "content": "Attend a Catholic mass and wait for the sacrament of Communion. Communion can be taken at any mass, and occurs toward the end of the ceremony. Prepare yourself mentally during the Consecration of the Eucharist (when the priest raises the host and it is changed into the body and blood of Christ) to participate in Communion by giving your thanks, appreciation, and reverence to Jesus Christ through prayer . [1] X Research source Note that only baptized Catholics can receive Communion, but anyone may attend mass."

      "title": "Approach the altar in the Communion procession.",
      "content": "Approach the altar in the Communion procession. The priests and altar servers will prepare to give Communion by taking their customary places, standing at the head of the Church, in front of the altar. If there’s an usher, wait for them to guide your row to walk up. When leaving the pew there is no need to genuflect (to kneel and cross oneself). Wait in line and do not skip people. [2] X Research source If there is no usher, wait until the people in the pew in front of you have processed out of the pew, then stand and join the procession. Since the sacrament occurs while the congregation is kneeling, lift your kneeler before you proceed, so others can walk through the pew."

    {
      "title": "Bow slightly before you approach the priest.",
      "content": "Bow slightly before you approach the priest. This is a show of reverence. Once the person ahead of you has received Communion, bend slightly at the hips, then step forward within arm’s length of the priest so that you may receive the sacrament yourself. When you approach the priest or Extraordinary Minister, they will proclaim, \"The Body of Christ.\" Proclaim your faith by replying, \"Amen,” which means, “I believe.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Receive the host in your hands or on your tongue.",
      "content": "Receive the host in your hands or on your tongue. Depending on the church and your personal preference, you can either have the host fed to you or handed to you. In the Traditional Rite, the host is fed to you. Open your mouth and extend your tongue so that the host does not fall. The host will be placed on your tongue. Close your mouth and allow the host to dissolve on your tongue while thinking of the sacrifice made. If you wish to have the host handed to you, hold out your hands, left on top of right. Do not take the host from the priest, but rather allow them to place it in your hand. Some Catholics kneel to receive Communion. This is more traditional and isn’t required, and has become more and more unusual, but is a powerful show of faith and obedience."
    },
    {
      "title": "Receive the Precious Blood.",
      "content": "Receive the Precious Blood. After receiving the host, you may choose to receive the Blood of Christ. Take a small sip from the chalice that is offered to you. The person offering the cup will say “the Blood of Christ,” and you respond (as before) with a bow and a proclamation of your faith: \"Amen.\" [3] X Research source The lip of the chalice is wiped off after each member receives the blood as a way to limit germs, but if you are ill or contagious, refrain from receiving the Blood of Christ."

      "title": "Return to your seat and pray as you kneel.",
      "content": "Return to your seat and pray as you kneel. This is a time to reflect and thank Jesus for coming to you in the Holy Eucharist. [4] X Research source Return to your pew and pray, until the priest is finished offering the Blessed Sacrament. Follow the lead of more established church members if you are unsure what to do."

    {
      "title": "Be baptized into the Catholic Church.",
      "content": "Be baptized into the Catholic Church. You must be of the Catholic faith to take Communion, and baptized into the Catholic Church. Taking Communion is a show of faith, and by taking it, you’re saying that you believe everything the Catholic Church teaches. That’s why even non-Catholic Christians usually don’t take the sacrament at a Catholic mass, since their beliefs differ, even if only slightly. To become Catholic , adults take a class called RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults), learning what the Catholic Church teaches, and preparing you for Reconciliation, first Communion, and Confirmation. Children take a similar course called the Rite of Initiation of Children. If you were Baptized in another Christian denomination you will make what is called a \"Profession of Faith\" to convert to Catholicism."

    {
      "title": "Take your First Communion as a baptized Catholic.",
      "content": "Take your First Communion as a baptized Catholic. Before you can receive communion regularly, baptized Catholics first must receive their First Communion. This is a special occasion that’s often accompanied by other sacraments like your first Reconciliation. Adults who are baptized into the Church often take their First Communion and Reconciliation shortly after baptism. [5] X Research source Baptized children often wait until they’re older and can fully comprehend the sacraments."

      "title": "Accept Communion in a state of grace, without mortal sin.",
      "content": "Accept Communion in a state of grace, without mortal sin. The Eucharist may not be received by a person who’s committed a mortal sin and hasn’t repented. If you have committed a mortal sin, you must go to Reconciliation and repent before receiving Communion. To receive communion knowingly in a state of mortal sin is a sin of sacrilege. [6] X Research source A mortal sin is a major sin which has seriously damaged your relationship with God and fulfills 3 requirements: full knowledge of the sins’ grave nature, complete and unhindered consent to commit the sin, and grave matter."

    {
      "title": "Believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation.",
      "content": "Believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation. You must believe in transubstantiation, which means that the bread and wine are actually transformed into the body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ. The offerings only appear as bread and wine, but are believed to actually be parts of Christ himself. [7] X Research source This is an important aspect of the Catholic faith, and of Communion. For Catholics, there’s not much point taking Communion if you don’t believe this."

    {
      "title": "Fast for an hour before taking Communion.",
      "content": "Fast for an hour before taking Communion. This is known as the “Eucharistic Fast,” and is a show of faith, reverence, and devotion. It means you cannot eat or drink anything for at least one hour before taking Communion. Water and medicine are excluded from the fast. Those who are elderly or ill can be excused from fasting, with the priest's permission. [8] X Research source This practice began in 393 and was instituted at the Council of Hippo, then affirmed in 397 at the Third Council of Carthage."

      "title": "Ensure you are not under ecclesiastical censure.",
      "content": "Ensure you are not under ecclesiastical censure. Those who are under ecclesiastical censure, meaning they have been excommunicated from the church or continually commit grave sins, cannot receive Communion. [9] X Research source If you’re not sure whether or not you’re under censure, you’re probably not. It’s a big deal, and there’s no way you wouldn’t be told directly by the Church."

      "title": "Communion was started by Christ at the Last Supper.",
      "content": "Communion was started by Christ at the Last Supper. Before he was crucified, Jesus assembled his apostles for a meal, where he shared with them bread and wine. He said, “Take and eat; this is my body,” and, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.” [10] X Research source Jesus instituted the Eucharist, or Communion, as a way to share his grace, offer forgiveness for sins, and remain physically with us on earth. These words are echoed by the priest during the transubstantiation at mass."

    {
      "title": "Communion was taken like a regular meal for a while.",
      "content": "Communion was taken like a regular meal for a while. In the early Church, believers would gather for a Communion that more closely resembled a regular meal, where bread and wine were blessed and shared around a table. This practice changed and morphed, and the liturgy and ceremony developed around 150 CE. [11] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Communion was preceded by many related rituals and events.",
      "content": "Communion was preceded by many related rituals and events. Both the Old and New Testaments are full of “foreshadowing” for the Eucharist. The Israelites sacrificed a lamb at Passover and made unleavened bread. Thousands of years later, we acknowledge Jesus as the sacrificial lamb that saves us, and eat our own form of unleavened bread in his memory. [12] X Research source God provided manna for the Israelites as they wandered the desert in exile. Jesus multiplied the fishes and loaves to feed the crowd during the Sermon on the Mount."
