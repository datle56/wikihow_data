      "content": "Prepare your skin with primer. Start by squirting a dime-sized amount of primer onto the back of your hand. Apply it to your face using your fingers to gently massage it into your skin. Use more primer as needed. [1] X Research source ”Primer gets the skin smooth and ready. It fills in any fine lines and pores and helps to lock on the foundation that you're about to apply,” makeup artist Cassandra McClure explains. Exfoliate before applying primer for the best results. This will get rid of all of the dead skin on your face and create a smoother base for the makeup."

Next, swipe concealer under the eyes (starting from the inner corner) to help conceal dark circles. [3] X Research source Use a small makeup sponge or your fingers to blend. [4] X Research source “For scars or dark circles, find a concealer that will cancel out the purple/bluish tones by [choosing] a salmon or orange color corrector,” advises professional makeup artist Stephanie Navarro. To find the right concealer, start by identifying your skin tone and undertones. If you’re unsure, go to a makeup store or counter and ask an associate to help you find your shade.

      "content": "Apply light-coverage foundation. Place a small amount on the back of your hand. Use a flat brush or your fingers to apply. For soft glam, less is more—focus on your T-zone (the forehead, nose, and chin) and your cheeks. [6] X Research source If you’re using a brush, try to dab instead of swiping to prevent creasing. [7] X Research source When testing several foundation shades to find the best match, instead of swatching them on your hand, swipe them along your jawline. That way, you’ll find a shade that works for both your face and neck. [8] X Research source Try using a BB or CC cream instead of a heavy foundation. These lightweight options even out your skin tone while maintaining a natural finish, perfect for the soft glam aesthetic."

      "content": "Brush and pencil in your brows. Use a two-sided brow pencil with the pigment on one end and the spoolie or brush on the other end. Pick a pigment that’s close to your natural brow color. [9] X Research source Start by brushing your brows to groom and straighten them, using small, upward strokes. Then, gently swipe on the pigment in short strokes that arc in the same direction as your brow hairs to help fill your brows. [10] X Research source Makeup artist JoAnn Solomon emphasizes to “brush your eyebrow in the direction in which you choose for it to flow.” If you like high, arched brows, brush them upward. For a more tamed look, brush them up and then down toward the edges. Apply a clear brow gel with your finger to polish the look. Alternate between brushing and penciling until you’re satisfied."

See suggested steps below for a subtle contour that will make your soft glam look even more snatched. Use a foundation brush to begin contouring along your cheekbones. Start by dabbing a cream bronzer or the darkest powder in your contouring palette along your cheekbone. [11] X Research source Layer on lighter shades just above the cheekbone. Swipe across the high center of the forehead, down the center of the nose, and along the underside of the jawline. Use a makeup sponge to blend your contour into your foundation. Use gentle rolling motions to help stipple the product into your skin. Finally, use a thin brush to apply highlighter to the tip of your nose and the inner corners of your eyelids.

Start near the nose and dab up toward the temple. Apply more blush for a bolder flushed look. [13] X Research source Go over your blush with a makeup sponge to blend it further into your skin and foundation for a more natural appearance. Opt for a matte blush that will build with your foundation, typically in a light pink shade. Soft glam is all about light colors and a neutral base. [14] X Research source"

Also referred to as a transition shade, this is the color that will be the backdrop of your soft glam eye look—usually a nude, light brown, or dusty rose. Swipe it over the lid, packing more on the outer corners of your eyelids and the crease. [15] X Research source You can also use your bronzer or highlighter on your eyes for extra shimmer in place of a base eyeshadow. [16] X Research source Use a small smudge brush to apply the base shade along the lower lash line for a more defined eye look. [17] X Research source For a smokier and bolder soft glam eye look, apply a medium or dark brown shadow on the outer corners of both eyelids in small, circular motions that extend upward and outward like a wing. Use a blending brush to help diffuse it into your base shade. [18] X Research source"

Place the brush at an angle beside the upper lash line and flick outward like you were applying an eyeliner wing. Repeat on the other side. Smudge gently with your finger for a softer look.

      "content": "Line your lips and apply a matte nude or pink lipstick. Use a brown or soft pink liner that will compliment your lipstick, taking into account your skin tone and natural lip color. Once you’ve lined around the edges of both lips, use your finger or a lipstick brush to apply a matte lipstick to your lips. [21] X Research source Solomon says a darker lip liner can help accentuate the lips and make them appear larger, while a lighter lip liner will help them look a bit smaller. When using matte lipsticks, it’s important to find a hydrating formula so you can nourish your lips and ensure they won’t dry out or flake. [22] X Research source Solomon also recommends applying lip balm right before you put on your matte lipstick. After applying your lipstick, swipe on a clear lip gloss for an optional shiny finish."
