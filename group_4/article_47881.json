      "content": "The numeric code “143” stems from Minot’s Ledge Lighthouse. In the late 1890s, Lt. Frederick Mahan of the Lighthouse Board advised that all lighthouses have numerical flash sequences. Minot’s Ledge Lighthouse chose a 1-4-3 flash at random (no one knows why), which people on shore associated with the phrase “I love you.” Afterwards, Minot’s Ledge became known as “Lover’s Light.” [2] X Research source Some people believe that “143” became synonymous with “I love you” in 1915. During this time, a new assistant lighthouse keeper, Winfield Scott Thompson, came to Minot’s Ledge, while his family lived on a nearby island. His wife told their kids that the 1-4-3 flash was their father’s way of expressing love to them across the water. [3] X Research source"
