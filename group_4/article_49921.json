In this tutorial, the stitch just before the yarn over will be called the \"first stitch.\" The stitch after the yarn over will be called the \"next stitch.\" Pay attention to your stitch pattern. When working the English style, you will need to move the yarn into the correct position. This will depend on what the first stitch was, and what the next stitch will be."
