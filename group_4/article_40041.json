      "content": "Soft Classic is a body type with a soft, rounded hourglass figure. In the fashion world, there are 13 Kibbe body types. As defined by David Kibbe in his 1987 book Metamorphosis , these types focus on the body's overall structure and its proportions following a yin/yang spectrum. [1] X Research source On the far right of this spectrum sits yin, the softest and most feminine or romantic figure; on the far left is yang, which represents the most dramatic or masculine figure. [2] X Research source Soft Classic is near the center of the spectrum, representing a slightly more feminine figure with round features. Those with a Soft Classic body type have a balanced bone structure and yin-influenced body flesh (distribution of weight) and facial features. The Kibbe scale has 3 Classic body types: Dramatic Classic, Pure Classic, and Soft Classic. Dramatic Classic has a slightly angular frame and sophisticated essence. Pure Classic has a symmetrical frame and reserved essence. Soft Classic has a slightly rounder frame and refined essence. If a Soft Classic gains weight, the body and face will become even more soft and round. The waist will likely lose its hourglass shape, as the weight distributes throughout the bust and hips."

      "content": "Clothing Soft Classic body types should opt for a symmetrical and feminine style that narrows the waist. Items that aren’t too tight or oversized fit best on a Soft Classic’s softer frame. Along with this, a Soft Classic must always define the waistline. Drawing the eye to the waist exaggerates the hourglass figure, providing a flattering and feminine silhouette. [5] X Research source Take a look at which items suit Soft Classics best for even more guidance: Tops: Round necklines, turtle necks, and tampered sleeves Bottoms: High-rise, wide-leg, and skinny jeans that end above the ankle Skirts: Midi-length, flowy, and flared Dresses: Waist definition, short to midi-length, A-line silhouette Sweaters: Turtlenecks, crewnecks, and fitted cardigans Outerwear: Longer coats and jackets with built-in belt Shoes: Rounded or almond toes [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Fabrics Lightweight materials move with the body to accentuate a Soft Classic’s feminine features. Clothing made out of cotton, wool, linen, and silk are ideal for this body type because of how they delicately drape over the frame. Plus, their neutral, minimalistic, and soft texture appeals to the body’s feminine attributes."

      "title": "Prints",
      "content": "Prints Loud and bright prints can draw the eye away from a Soft Classic’s gracious essence, making them appear larger than they are. Instead, Soft Classics should opt for smaller prints and monochromatic combinations to emphasize their even proportions. [7] X Research source Lace amplifies a Soft Classic’s soft features with its undefined edges and neutral tones. Watercolor shades accentuate a Soft Classic’s femininity and soft features. Dainty floral prints bring out this body type’s femininity or yin even more. Horizontal stripes help a Soft Classic look taller and can exaggerate their waist when cinched."

      "content": "Accessories Soft Classics should always reach for belts and classically elegant jewelry when accessorizing. Clean-cut shapes look best on this body type because they add dimension to the slightly rounder frame. So, a Soft Classic can wear pearls, minimalist gold jewelry, cat-eye sunglasses, and slim to medium-width belts."

      "content": "Hair Soft Classics look best with wavy, shoulder-length hair. Kibbe suggests that those with a Soft Classic body type should have soft, wavy hair that’s about shoulder length with a simple curtain bang. Hair accessories are also suggested to be minimalistic, as too much in the hair could pull attention away from a Soft Classic’s large eyes and soft features. Keep in mind that this hairstyle is only a suggestion. If you’re a Soft Classic, opt for whichever hairstyle or haircut you feel the most confident in (even if it doesn’t follow Kibbe’s “rules”)."

      "content": "Makeup Soft Classics appear the most youthful in soft, muted, and natural makeup looks. With their large eyes and full lips, experts recommend this body type to draw attention to their natural beauty rather than sculpting away their rounder features. Because of this, Soft Classics should avoid heavy eyeliner and contour. [8] X Research source If you’re a Soft Classic, rock a natural makeup look with pink cheeks, rosy lips, and minimal eye shadow."

Do people often think you’re shorter than you actually are? Are your shoulders sloped and tapered? Are your arms and legs shorter than your torso? Do you have small and wide hands? Do you have a symmetrical figure? Is your chest full and round? Do you have a soft and defined waist? Do you have a rounded chin? Are your cheeks round and full?"
