      "content": "It depends—sometimes a watery consistency is normal. When cottage cheese ages or is exposed to warm temperatures, the curds separate from the whey. This creates a soupy appearance similar to when yogurt has a watery top layer. If there are no other signs of spoilage (sour smell, mold, or sour taste), you’re fine with mixing the cheese up and eating it. However, if there are signs of spoilage, the watery texture likely means the cottage cheese is bad. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Store cottage cheese in the coldest area of your fridge. Cottage cheese may not be a potent cheese, but it is very delicate. Cottage cheese must remain at a stable, cold temperature; otherwise, the curds will start to separate and cause the cheese to spoil. To avoid this, make sure to store your cottage cheese in a consistently cold area of your fridge. The coldest part of the refrigerator is typically the back of the bottom shelf.
