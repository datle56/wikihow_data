      "content": "Swab the belt with rubbing alcohol. Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball for an easy applicator. Then, wipe the leather surface thoroughly with the rubbing alcohol. This should clean the leather and open up the pores of the material. Make sure that the alcohol is deeply soaked into the leather. You may need to apply many coats. [2] X Research source You can buy isopropyl rubbing alcohol at most drugstores and grocery stores. You may already have some in your cabinet! If you don't have a cotton ball, use a towel, a tissue, or a clean piece of cotton. You can also use your fingers. Be careful, though: rubbing alcohol can dry out your skin with prolonged contact."

      "title": "Follow up with petroleum jelly.",
      "content": "Follow up with petroleum jelly. Put petroleum jelly or another petroleum jelly product onto your finger or a cotton swab. Then, spread the petroleum jelly across the belt so that it covers the entire surface. Let the petroleum jelly soak into the leather. [3] X Research source You don't need to lump a goopy mess of petroleum jelly onto the belt in order to soften it. A thin, slick layer will do."

      "content": "Clean the belt. Wipe the petroleum jelly away with a rag or tissue. Leave the leather out to dry before you wear the belt. If you want it to dry a bit more quickly, try leaving it out in the sun."

      "content": "Prep the leather in the sun. Lay the leather belt outside on a sunny day. Leave it out for about ten minutes to open the pores and prepare the material."

      "title": "Choose your oil.",
      "content": "Choose your oil. Coconut oil (the organic kind that you'd use for cooking) is a great easy-to-find softening agent. Try avocado oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Use any natural oil that you would put onto yourself as a skin-softener. Leather is the dried and treated skin of a cow – so it essentially made from the same stuff as your own skin. Natural oils have the added benefit of smelling pleasant. Rubbing alcohol and petroleum jelly will do a great job of softening up your belt, but you might be off-put by the decidedly chemical scent. Pick an oil that you like to smell. Avoid using chemically hydrogenated oils – namely, most commercial corn oils and vegetable oils."

      "title": "Rub the oil into the belt.",
      "content": "Rub the oil into the belt. Simply dip your fingers into the oil, then rub it thoroughly over the surface of the belt. Add multiple layers of oil for an improved softening effect. The more oil you use, the softer the leather will get. [4] X Research source Don't worry about using too much. Most natural oil should not damage leather."

    {
      "title": "Let the oil dry into the leather.",
      "content": "Let the oil dry into the leather. Note that the oil—especially coconut oil—may slightly darken the belt. However, it also turns your stiff leather into a smooth, wearable material. If your belt is not soft enough, try repeating the oil treatment. You can use this darkening effect to change up the look of your leather belt. Just make sure that you apply it evenly so there aren't any mismatching lighter splotches!"
