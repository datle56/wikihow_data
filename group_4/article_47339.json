      "content": "Stimulate blood flow, clean your pores and get off built up grime, use your finger tips to scrub your scalp . Start by making a circle on the top of your head in the area you'd wear a crown. Focus on the back of this circle to begin with. Next, fill in the circle. This is where your part will be; grease here affects the way your hair looks. Trace while still scrubbing with your fingertips around the bottom edge of the circle. Keep making scrubbing circles underneath each one, drawing lines in circles around your head. [2] X Research source Lastly, scrub the back of your skull and your temples/sideburns. This will result in less grease and more growth. After doing this, your scalp will feel alive. Some people say their hair grows faster after a visit to the salon â€” it does, and this massage method is why."
