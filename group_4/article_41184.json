      "content": "What triggers you, and what is your motivation for hitting him? Intimate Partner Violence doesn’t just happen for no reason. In fact, there are usually multiple reasons—which include both motivations for using it and triggers that unleash it. Take some time to yourself to consider your own IPV triggers and motivations. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Common triggers for IPV include: Alcohol or drug use. Arguments over issues like money or childcare. Your boyfriend’s refusal to talk or engage with you. Stressors that have little to do with your boyfriend. Violence (physical or non-physical) by your boyfriend. Common motivations for IPV include: Releasing bottled-up, negative emotions (like anger).

All your efforts to reduce your anger, manage your stress, and improve communication can be lost if you let substance abuse result in new violent episodes. It’s vital to seek professional treatment if you’re abusing alcohol or drugs. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"

      "content": "Simple calming techniques can stop anger from turning into violence. People who engage in IPV often speak of feeling like “something just snapped” or that they “just lost it.” Fortunately, strategies like taking several deep breaths really can help to reduce anger before the switch is flipped and self-control is lost. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Try out anger management techniques like the following: Breathe slowly and deeply from your diaphragm, so that you can feel each breath coming from deep down in your abdomen. Repeat a calming word like “relax” or “peace” to yourself. Visualize a calming memory, like helping your grandma bake cookies, or a calming image, like an isolated and pristine beach. Relax your muscles section-by-section, imagining your anger releasing along with your muscle tension. Engage in vigorous physical activity (like running or shadow boxing) to release pent-up anger. Make lifestyle changes to ensure you’re getting enough sleep, eating healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Keep an anger journal to track your feelings, triggers, and management efforts. Attend an anger management program with a trained instructor."

      "content": "By walking away, you can give your anger the chance to pass. Calming techniques can work wonders to reduce anger, but sometimes walking away is the best solution. Head to another room and close the door, go sit in your car, or take a walk around the neighborhood. Use your calming strategies while you’re alone until you feel ready to re-engage with your boyfriend. [8] X Research source If your boyfriend is angry too and says something like, “Don’t walk away from me,” respond as plainly and calmly as you can: “I need a minute to cool down. I’ll come back when I can think and act calmly.”"

By lowering the overall temperature in your life—that is, by identifying and reducing stressors —you can reduce the likelihood that you’ll lash out in frustration, anger, and violence. [9] X Research source You might need to cut back on your work schedule, reduce your social commitments, stop trying to be the “world’s most involved parent,” ask for help from friends and family, or end a toxic friendship."

      "title": "A genuine apology includes a plan of action to prevent future violence.",
      "content": "A genuine apology includes a plan of action to prevent future violence. More than just a quick \"I'm sorry,\" this is a full apology that happens when you’re both calm and you have clearly thought through what you want to say. Keep the “3 Rs” of a good apology — regret , responsibility , and remedy —in mind during your planning and presentation. Speak from the heart and make it clear that you’re being fully honest. [10] X Research source Let him know that you realize your use of violence is wrong and not justifiable in any way, and that you are truly dedicated to making sure it doesn’t happen again. For example: “John, I apologize for slapping you last night. I know I said it wouldn’t happen anymore and I’m so sorry that I hit you again. I really do want it to stop and am going to start counseling. I hope that you can forgive me but also accept that you have every right to leave.” Especially since this isn’t a one-time episode, your boyfriend may not accept your apology and choose to end the relationship. Respect this choice, even if you wish it wasn’t so, and focus on your plan for self-improvement for your next relationship. Reader Poll: We asked 293 wikiHow readers what would make them willing to forgive a partner, and 0% of them said focusing on the future. [Take Poll] If you truly want them to believe you're willing to change and save the relationship, you can't sweep the past under the rug."

      "content": "It’s up to him if he wants to share, but listen carefully if he does. The point here isn’t to punish yourself by having to hear exactly what kind of pain you put him through. Rather, the goal is to better understand the impact of your violence on him, on the relationship, and even on you. This is also a way to demonstrate your dedication to be a better listener moving forward. [11] X Research source Here’s one way you might be able to encourage him to share: “I’m going to try to explain how I feel when I start hitting you. Then, if you’re okay with sharing, I’d really like to hear how you feel when this happens.” You might discover that he feels scared, angry, confused, ashamed, disrespected, or a combination of emotions all at once."

      "content": "IPV often happens at least partly due to a lack of communication. If your boyfriend refuses to talk about something with you—maybe something important like finances or suspicions of infidelity—you might turn to violence because you, on your own part, don’t have strong communication skills. To help build up your communication skills, consider setting aside time each day to talk openly, honestly, and calmly about whatever is on each of your minds. [12] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Women who use IPV against male partners frequently cite poor communication as a trigger, and “making him have to respond to me” (or something similar) as a motive. This can occur in any type of intimate partner relationship, though. [13] X Research source"

While you definitely can succeed in no longer hitting your boyfriend, there’s no shame in admitting that you need help achieving this goal. The support of your boyfriend, as well as friends, family, and mentors, is very helpful, but often what you really need is the guidance of a professional therapist. Attend sessions with an open mind, a determination to change, and a genuine belief that you can succeed. Therapy can help in areas like the following: [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Dealing with past trauma, which might include your own experience as a victim of IPV. Working to control your anger if you’re struggling to make this change on your own. Improving your coping skills so you can handle stressors and disappointments better. Improving your problem-solving skills so smaller issues don’t balloon into big ones. Increasing communication and trust in your relationship, perhaps by attending couples therapy sessions with your boyfriend."

Hitting your boyfriend does not give him the right to hit you back, beyond any necessary actions he needs to take to protect himself. The same is true for you if you’re also a victim of IPV. If you're in a relationship that has two-way IPV happening, you both either have to dedicate yourselves to change or the relationship needs to end. Otherwise, the cycle of violence will only get worse over time. [15] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If your boyfriend chooses to break up with you or even contacts the authorities after you hit him, that’s absolutely his right and you should accept the consequences of your actions. But he has no right to inflict violence on you because you “deserve” it for your own actions. Two wrongs do not make a right."
