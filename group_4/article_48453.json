      "title": "Opt for a bra and underwear, a thong, or nothing—it's totally up to you.",
      "content": "Opt for a bra and underwear, a thong, or nothing—it's totally up to you. If you want underwear, wear something minimal (like a thong) to prevent patches. Wear a black or dark bra or underwear in case some of the tan gets on your undergarments. The tan will wash out easier from dark fabric. [1] X Research source Wear a hairnet or shower cap to protect your hair, but keep your ears out (even though it might feel silly). Most salons provide disposable thongs you can wear and throw out at home and sticky pads to put on your feet so you don’t get blotches on the bottom of your feet."

      "title": "Choose breathable, loose clothes that won’t rub or streak your tan.",
      "content": "Choose breathable, loose clothes that won’t rub or streak your tan. Your tan needs some air to settle into spots like your underarms or cleavage, so opt for flowy, comfortable garments that don’t hug your body. Go for cotton fabrics, too—the bronzer in the tan doesn’t stain cotton, so you can easily wash the tan out if it rubs on your clothes. [2] X Research source Think loose sweatpants, cotton t-shirts, or flowy A-line dresses. The fewer seams there are to dig into your skin, the better. Avoid tight clothing, like jeans or leggings, that you have to pull or rub over your skin to get on. Go for long sleeves to protect your new tan from the sun while it’s still setting in (and to keep the tan from rubbing off on your car seat, couch, or bedding)."

      "title": "Wear black so any bronzer that rubs off on your clothes doesn’t show.",
      "content": "Wear black so any bronzer that rubs off on your clothes doesn’t show. Spray tan solutions contain chemicals that can leave brown blotches on light-colored clothing. Dark or black clothes, however, are less likely to react with the bronzer and get stained. Spray tan day is the perfect excuse to pull out your sleek black sweats! [3] X Research source Did your tan already rub off on your clothes or couch? Use water and a few drops of dish soap to get spray tan out of fabric."

      "title": "Try not to wear a bra",
      "content": "Try not to wear a bra for at least 6 hours after your tan. Preferably, wait until after you take your first shower and the tan has fully set (usually 4-6 hours minimum after the tan, or the following morning). The straps can dig into your sides and back and cause streaking or dark spots. [4] X Research source If you’re uncomfortable going braless or have to go somewhere right after your salon appointment, opt for a black strapless bra or bandeau . [5] X Research source Wear disposable underwear or loose, black cotton underwear that you don’t mind throwing away if it gets stained."

      "title": "Choose loose footwear to let your feet breathe and avoid streaks.",
      "content": "Choose loose footwear to let your feet breathe and avoid streaks. The fewer straps, the better—this prevents tan lines and streaks from forming on top of your feet. When you get home, go barefoot so the tan settles evenly all over your foot. [6] X Research source Try not to wear socks. They’ll absorb the tan and make your feet sweat, which leads to streaking. If you have to, wear loose cotton socks as little as possible. Avoid boots, pumps, strappy sandals, or other shoes that will rub against your feet and ankles."

      "title": "Go with a loose, black jumpsuit to safely cover you from neck to ankle.",
      "content": "Go with a loose, black jumpsuit to safely cover you from neck to ankle. Make sure there aren’t any sections that are too tight or elastic-y (the baggier, the better) or any aggravating inseams. Choose one that’s machine washable so you’ll have a go-to spray tan outfit for next time! [7] X Research source Some brands market their jumpsuits as “spray tan onesies” specifically, but any loose, breathable, dark-colored jumpsuit will work."

      "title": "Choose a loose, cotton dress if you can’t go straight home.",
      "content": "Choose a loose, cotton dress if you can’t go straight home. This way, you can head to work, class, or dinner in an outfit other than sweats (if you prefer). As always, choose black or dark colors. Choose longer dresses to shield your legs from moisture while still letting them breathe. [8] X Research source Alternatively, pair a flowy skirt with a loose top. If your dress is sleeveless, try dressing it up with a loose, soft scarf to cover more of your tan until it’s fully set."

      "title": "Go for bottoms like loose jogging pants, harem pants, or slouch pants.",
      "content": "Go for bottoms like loose jogging pants , harem pants , or slouch pants . Whatever you choose, make sure the fabric around your legs is loose and that the waistband isn’t cutting a line into your skin. Avoid jeans, leggings, or any other tight pants until your tan is set. Wait 10 hours before wearing shorts. Long pants will keep your tan (and any seats you encounter) safe until the tan sets."

      "title": "Wear t-shirts or other loose, cotton tops with boat, scoop, or V-necks.",
      "content": "Wear t-shirts or other loose, cotton tops with boat, scoop, or V-necks. When the neckline is loose, you don’t have to worry about pulling or tugging the shirt over your head and rubbing your fresh tan. Try putting a t-shirt on and taking it off before your appointment to test how easy it is. Avoid strappy tank tops or other complicated shirts. Simple and loose is always best."

      "title": "Sleep in garments without inseams that press against your skin.",
      "content": "Sleep in garments without inseams that press against your skin. That way, you won’t wake up with streaks or dark marks in the morning. Go for a long-sleeve tee with a loose neckline or a hoodie so there’s no crease around your neck. Loose, billowy sweatpants or pajama bottoms are great too. [9] X Research source Try wearing loose socks with ankle cutoffs to avoid rubbing a line around your ankle (or leaving tan stains at the foot of your bed)."

      "content": "Rain will streak your tan, so pack protection if it's a rainy day. If you’ve got long sleeves on and the rain is light, unfurl your umbrella to stay dry when you walk out of the salon. If the rain is heavy, try a loose, baggy poncho or rain jacket instead. [10] X Research source Water is a fresh spray tan’s #1 enemy. If the weather’s bad during the first few hours of your tan, plan to stay indoors."

      "title": "Wear a jacket (not a thick coat) when you leave the salon in winter.",
      "content": "Wear a jacket (not a thick coat) when you leave the salon in winter. A full coat might make you sweat a little bit underneath, which will make your tan run. Wear something thinner instead to keep you cooler, and make sure it has a hood to shield your face from snow. If needed, wear a pair of loose-fitting gloves (no leather). Wear soft boots if there’s snow on the ground. Structured, harder boots will rub against your feet, ankles, and legs."

      "title": "Stay away from the shower, pool, or anything that’ll make you sweat.",
      "content": "Stay away from the shower, pool, or anything that’ll make you sweat. The exact amount of time it takes for your tan to set and become waterproof depends on the tanning formula, so ask your technician to confirm before you leave the salon. When you take your first shower , use cold water to close your pores and seal the tan. If possible, wait until the next morning or even up to 24 hours after your tan to shower. Stay hydrated after your appointment to nourish your skin. Drink lots of water and avoid alcohol for a few hours."

      "content": "Take off jewelry and big piercings and replace them when the tan sets. Remove necklaces, bracelets, or any other jewelry besides small stud earrings before your appointment. Keep them off while your tans sets so the jewelry doesn’t rub, streak, or block air from your skin. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Skip your beauty routine for the first evening and morning. Wait until after you’ve showered (4-6 hours), but preferably a full 24 hours. Makeup and deodorant contain chemicals that might react with your spray tan, causing dark spots, streaking, or irritation. [12] X Research source If you’re bothered by the smell of the tan, put some perfume on your clothes (not your skin) to cover it up. Oil-free moisturizers are safe to use on fresh spray tans."
