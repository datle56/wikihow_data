      "content": "“Wife material” describes a woman with the qualities to be a good wife. Also referred to as “wifey material,” a woman is “wife material” if she has the ideal qualities someone is looking for in a lifelong partner. Perhaps she knows how to cook or is always there to listen. Either way, if someone says their girlfriend or crush is “wife material,” they believe she’d be the perfect wife. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that “wife material” is a trendy pop culture term used to describe an ideal partner in a heterosexual relationship; it isn't definitive. Your “wife material” can be different from your friend’s “wife material.” Everyone has different partner preferences. Know that not every woman aspires to be wife material, and that’s okay! Women are more than their wifely duties—they’re individuals first and foremost."
