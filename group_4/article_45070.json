      "content": "The person you texted has notifications silenced. This is because they've turned on a Focus mode like Do Not Disturb, Sleep, or Driving Mode, which turns off their notifications. Your text message was still delivered to the person's iPhone, but quietly —meaning they won't see a notification or hear a sound until they turn off DND, Sleep, or their chosen Focus Mode. When you see \"Delivered quietly,\" you'll also see some text at the bottom of the conversation that says, \"(person's name) has notifications silenced.\" If the message is very important, you can tap Notify anyway to bypass their Focus mode and notify them of your text. Depending on why the person is using Focus mode, this could make them mad—it's best just to send the message quietly unless you absolutely have to interrupt this person."

      "content": "Stop sharing your Focus status. If you don't want people to see \"Delivered quietly\" when they text you, you can turn off Share Focus Status. This also gets rid of the \"(your name) has notifications silenced\" message in iMessage, making it so nobody will know you're in Sleep, Do Not Disturb, or any other focus mode. You'll also be preventing people from tapping Notify anyway and sending you a notification when you're trying to avoid them. Here's how to turn it off: Open your iPhone's Settings app. Tap Focus . Tap Focus Status at the bottom. Tap the switch next to \"Share Focus Status\" to turn it off for all Focus modes. Alternatively, if you just want to stop sharing your Focus status for a specific Focus mode, you can use that mode's toggle switch instead. [1] X Research source"
