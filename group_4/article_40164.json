      "content": "Say “Sorry not sorry” as a sassy comeback. It’s especially common on social media for people to use “Sorry not sorry” when talking about an unpopular opinion. So, if someone isn’t happy with one of your opinions and you’re looking for a sassy way to show them you aren’t going to change your mind just because they disagree, “Sorry not sorry” can do the trick.

Sorry not sorry, people. 🐟” In this context, “Sorry, not sorry” can also come off as rude (if that’s how you want to sound). If you do something to upset someone and then say, “Sorry, not sorry,” you’d be genuinely dismissing their feelings in a disrespectful way rather than joking around."

      "title": "It’s better to use “Sorry not sorry” when you’re clearly joking.",
      "content": "It’s better to use “Sorry not sorry” when you’re clearly joking. If you’re worried about seeming rude or malicious, avoid saying “Sorry not sorry” unless you’re joking around with friends who understand your sense of humor well enough to know you aren’t being disrespectful. Since “Sorry not sorry” can be a dismissive and insincere phrase, people who don’t know you may think you’re being rude. For example, you might say “Sorry, not sorry” to a friend after they jokingly say you’re weird for liking pineapple on pizza or a jerk for getting an annoying song stuck in their head. On the other hand, you shouldn't say “Sorry, not sorry” to someone like a coworker or boss since it’s a very casual, irreverent phrase and wouldn’t be appropriate in a professional environment."
