      "title": "Rinse the rice.",
      "content": "Rinse the rice. Place the rice into the rice cooker. Fill the bowl with water, or enough to cover the rice plus an extra inch (2.5 cm) of head room. Use your hand or a spoon to stir the rice and swirl the water around. Drain the rice by pouring it into a fine-mesh sieve. Rinsing rice may prevent it from sticking together, and it will also help rinse off traces of arsenic. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Combine the rice and water.",
      "content": "Combine the rice and water. Transfer the rinsed rice back to the rice cooker. Add the water. For flavored rice, you can also add a bouillon cube in with the water, or salt, pepper, herbs, or other spices to taste. For different types of rice and other foods, you'll need a different ratio of water per cup of: Long-grain brown rice, use 3 cups (705 ml) water Wild rice mix, use 3 cups (705 ml) water Quinoa, use 1½ cups (353 ml) water Polenta, use 2 cups (470 ml) water Couscous , use 1 cup (235 ml) water"

      "title": "Secure the lids.",
      "content": "Secure the lids. Most microwave rice steamers come with an inner and an outer lid. You're supposed to use both when you're cooking food. Place the inner lid into the recess. Place the outer lid over top of the inner lid. Latch the handles in place if your cooker has locks. [2] X Research source If your inner and outer lids have holes in them, offset the holes to ensure the best results."

    {
      "title": "Set the microwave.",
      "content": "Set the microwave. Set your microwave to 70 percent power if your microwave is 1,000 watts or more. This will prevent the water from evaporating too quickly and the rice from becoming crunchy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cook the rice.",
      "content": "Cook the rice. Place the rice into the microwave. Set the timer for 13 minutes and press “start” to cook the rice.

      "title": "Rest and fluff the rice before serving.",
      "content": "Rest and fluff the rice before serving. When the microwave has finished, carefully remove the rice cooker and place it on a heat-proof mat. Set the rice aside and let it stand for five minutes. When the time is up, remove the outer lid, followed by the inner lid. Remove the far side first to let the steam escape away from your body. [3] X Research source Before serving, stir the rice with a fork to fluff it up and let excess moisture out."

      "title": "Insert the steamer basket.",
      "content": "Insert the steamer basket. Some microwave rice cookers come with a steamer basket that fits inside the cooker. You add food to the basket and water to the bottom of the cooker. Because the food is not sitting directly in the water, it gets steamed instead of boiled. Place the empty steamer basket directly inside the rice cooker."

      "title": "Add the food and water.",
      "content": "Add the food and water. The steamer basket is ideal for pasta and vegetables, including potatoes, greens, corn, carrots, and more. Add the desired vegetables to the steamer basket and add ½ cup (118 ml) of water to the bottom of the cooker. For pasta, it’s better to boil than steam. For every 12 ounces (340 g) of pasta you use, add about 7 cups (1.65 L) of hot water, or enough to cover the pasta. [5] X Research source Do not fill the steamer basket more than three-quarters full to leave room for expansion."

Let the vegetables or pasta stand for two minutes. Then, remove the lids, pull out the steamer basket, and discard the excess water. Transfer the veggies or pasta to bowls or plates and serve. Spinach should not be left to stand after cooking. When the cooking time is up, remove it from the cooker immediately to prevent wilting and sogginess."
