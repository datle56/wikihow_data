      "content": "Lots of names are used regarding the lead-up point to the Saw Mill River- heading northbound. However, when you reach there you'll see one name; other names appear below this in other counties. Where this highway begins heading northbound, there is a merge point between the Henry Hudson Parkway heading north, along with the Mosholu Parkway at the Henry Hudson Parkway's last exit at the Bronx-Westchester county line. However, when the Henry Hudson Parkway merges to become this highway, it will zipper-merge into this parkway's southern terminus. But, even further south where this highway begins is the West Side Highway between 72nd Street and Battery Park, near the Brooklyn Battery Terminal and Interstate 478. [3] X Research source Google Maps lists the complete highway names scattered sporadically along that portion of the route, including the Joe DiMaggio Highway between 55th and 72nd Streets, Hudson River Greenway between 40th and 55th Streets, and 12th St below 40th Stâ€”though the route between 55th and South is littered with traffic lights at every block."

      "content": "In this section of highway, the road stays pretty much on an even track north from Van Cortlandt Park, [4] X Research source until just before the I-87 exit, where it turns straighter east. It then intersects with I-287 and heads north-northeast. However, this span also begins as a freeway until after exit 7 for NY-9A before exit 9 with Executive Parkway, then becomes an expressway with at-grade intersections for the rest of the route. In this area, it has interchanges for big roads/highways for the Henry Hudson Parkway (southern terminus), Cross County Parkway (in Yonkers), NY-9A (in Yonkers), I-87 (in Elmsford), NY-119 (in Elmsford), and I-287 (in Elmsford). In this span, you'll encounter several exits, including those in Yonkers, Hastings on Hudson, Dobbs Ferry, and Elmsford. Travel in Yonkers. Here, you'll find exits for the Henry Hudson Parkway (southbound only), McLean Ave (exit 3), Cross County Parkway (exit 4), Rumsey Rd (4A), Yonkers Ave (5), Palmer Rd (5A), Lockwood Ave (6), NY-9A/Tuckahoe Rd (7), Executive Blvd (9), Hearst St (10), and Tompkins Ave (11). Prior to exit 5, the highway parallels an unused railroad tracks into Yonkers, as exit 1 is southbound only, just before passing Tibbetts Lake, [5] X Research source then the western terminus of the Cross County Parkway then narrows and forks to exit 5. At exit 5, you'll have access to Dunwoodie Golf Course - a popular golf course for the area. However, watch out for the 180 degree turn. [6] X Research source Just past exit 7, you'll spot the freeway's ends and the expressway's beginnings with at-grade intersections. [7] X Research source At exit 7, the highway will begin paralleling the namesake river (Saw Mill River) in Runyon Heights (neighborhood). Also there, you'll find the railroad returning near the Odell Ave Overpass (northbound). Near exit 9, a series of signals are on the highway. However, you won't stop losing signals until after exit 12 (located in the next township). [8] X Research source Travel in Hastings-on-Hudson. Here, you'll find exits for Farragut Parkway (12), Farragut Ave (13), Clarence Ave (14), and Cliff St (15). At exit 13, you'll find a right-in/right-out interchange in both highway directions, as well as a new beginning for non-signaled interchanges. [9] X Research source Travel in Dobbs Ferry. Here, you'll find exits for Lawrence St (16), Ashford Ave (17), and Cyrus Field Rd (18). Travel in Elmsford. Here, you'll find exits for Mountain Rd (19), I-87 (20), NY-119 (21), and I-287 (22). As this highway travels through Irvington from Cyprus Field Rd (Dobbs Ferry section), it'll parallel the New York State Thruway with flyover ramps, but then proceeds northeast paralleling NY-9A and Saw Mill River leaving Greenburgh to Elmsford, before passing under the Cross Westchester Expressway (with no northbound ramp) and forking to westbound Cross Westchester from southbound at exit 22."

      "content": "In this section from the I-87/I-287 area, the highway parallels the Saw Mill River as it curves northwest into Graham Hill County Park then curves northeast where it stays on an almost northeast course until Thornwood. Here, it makes a big U-shaped loop, straightens out and runs from there past Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Mt Kisco, Bedford Hills and into Katonah. In its path, it interchanges with big roads and highways such as NY-9A (in Greenburgh), the Taconic State Parkway/Sprain Brook Parkway (in Hawthorne), NY-117 (in Pleasantville), NY-120 (in Chappaqua), NY-133 (in Mt Kisco), and several exits for NY-117 (in Bedford Hills and Katonah).

Here, the exit splits northbound towards Hunts Place and towards NY-120 for Mill River Rd southbound [10] X Research source , before the highway becomes a split two-lane roadway northbound edging a ridge in New Castle. Also at the NY-120 exit, you'll find the location of the northern terminus of the parallel to the named river - Saw Mill River. At this point, the two go their separate ways! Travel in New Castle.

You'll reach northern Mount Kisco for southbound lanes (exit 36) and for both (exit 37). At exit 36, you'll have access to a Tesla location [13] X Research source - one of only four in New York State. However, trees are between the highway and the location. [14] X Research source Travel in the town of Bedford. Here, you'll find an exit for Green Ln (38) from northbound, though southbound it's at-grade. Still, this is the first at-grade on the parkway southbound. [15] X Research source You'll have a second right-in/right-out interchange here for both directions. [16] X Research source Travel in Bedford Hills. You'll find an exit for NY-117 (39) at this location for southbound only.
