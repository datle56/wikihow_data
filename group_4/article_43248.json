      "content": "There’s no verifiable evidence of a domestic cat/bobcat hybrid. While stories and legends abound, there’s no scientific proof that mating could produce kittens. But your cat is still adorable, even if it isn’t part bobcat! There have been multiple cases where people rescued a kitten they found, only to have a veterinarian drop the shocking news: surprise, it's a bobcat! Domesticated cats don’t care for monogamy; they often mate with multiple partners. Even if a house cat has a litter after a liaison with a bobcat, it isn’t proof that he’s the daddy. Scientists have even tried to produce a domestic cat/bobcat hybrid via in vitro fertilization. Sadly, their attempts to create a new hybrid cat breed failed."

[1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In 2017, Dr. Joy Halverson of Zoogen Labs created a definitive DNA test to screen for bobcat genes in domestic cats. However, commercial usage of the test isn’t available. [2] X Research source Mitochondrial DNA tests can determine which species a cat’s mama is. One way researchers can determine a feline’s heritage is by looking for a specific genomic sequence: any feline with domestic cat parentage will have multiple copies of the endogenous feline leukemia virus (enFeLV).

After Rocky escaped from his enclosure on 4 separate occasions, a judge ordered a DNA test to determine whether Rocky was a bobcat or a hybrid. The results? Rocky’s mama was pure bobcat. [4] X Research source In an epic plot twist, the judge declared the results of the mitochondrial DNA test “inconclusive,” since it only examined the maternal line and provided no info about Rocky’s father. The judge ruled that Rocky could stay at his home. [5] X Research source In yet another plot twist, Rocky escaped once again in 2015. After fearful neighbors called the police, Rocky’s owner permanently surrendered her wild child to the zoo. [6] X Research source Some news reports claimed Rocky was a fifth-generation domesticated hybrid. If that were the case, chonky Rocky would have been closer to the size of an average house cat."
