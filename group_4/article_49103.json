Two of the easiest kind are the \"reverse snow angel\" and the \"dolphin kick.\" For the \"reverse snow angel,\" lie face down with your arms and legs at your sides. Your palms should be facing down. Move your hands and shoulders a few inches off the ground and move your arms up to your shoulders until your thumbs meet. Then, return to the original position. Keep your arms straight and elbows locked throughout the entire movement. Strive for two to three sets of five repetitions, resting for about 30 seconds between sets. [1] X Research source To do the dolphin kick, you will need a workout bench. Position yourself face down on the bench, with your hips at the end of the bench. Your hands should grasp the underside of the bench for support. Pointing your toes away from your body and keeping your hips straight, point your legs upward and then hold the position for 5 seconds. Slowly return to the original position and then repeat. Aim for two to three sets of six to 12 repetitions, with 30 second breaks in between. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Try the superman. The superman is a great activity for your lats. To start, you'll need to lie face down with your chin facing the ground, your ankles touching, your arms spread forward, and your toes pointed outward. By contracting your back and shoulder muscles, pull your arms and legs a few inches off the ground. Try to get your hand and feet elevated around the same height. Try to hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds. [3] X Research source Do six to 15 repetitions of this exercise, with 30 to 60 seconds of rest in between. [4] X Research source"

The hip hinge means standing up straight, with your hands on your hips, and your feet spread apart slightly wider than your hips. Bend forward slowly, while keeping your shoulders and hips aligned. Bend until you are parallel to the floor and your body has formed a 90 degree angle. [5] X Research source Bring yourself back to the starting position and then repeat.

      "content": "Use a weight machine. One of the most effective ways to work your lats is making use of a weight machine at your local gym. Exercises involving weight machines are great for the lats. A weight machine is a kind of gym equipment where weights are attached to a bar that the user pulls up and down to help build muscle. A weight machine is often the best way to start lifting weights if you haven't before. [7] X Research source Usually, you sit on a moveable seat and pull the bar down while squatting. The seat and level of weight may need to be adjusted for your size and fitness level. Talk to an instructor at the gym if you have any questions about adjusting the machine. [8] X Research source To work your lats, do an exercise called the lat pulldown. Sit down on the weight bench and place your hands slightly wider than shoulder length apart. Slowly, pull the bar towards your chest, keeping your shoulder blades rolled behind you. Then, slowly return to the starting position. Strive for one set of 12 to 15 repetitions.

      "content": "Buy a resistance band. A resistance band is an elastic strap with handles on either end used in workouts that can be purchased at most sports or gym stores. You can also buy one online. There are a variety of exercises you can do using a resistance band that work the lats. Try the bent over row. In this work out, you will stand on the center of the band with your feet spread slightly apart. Bend over slightly, with your knees somewhat bent, and grab both ends of the band. Form a 90 degree angle. Pull the band up towards your hips, squeezing your shoulders as you go, and then return to the original position. Do this for two to three sets of 10 to 12 reps. [11] X Research source You can also try a lying pullover. Anchor the band around a low lying immovable object, such as bedpost. Lie on your back, knees bent, and grab either end of the band with your arms held over your head. Then, pull the band in towards your torso and return to the original position. Do 8 to 10 repetitions. [12] X Research source The lat pulldown focuses more on the upper back. You will have to anchor the band around a high up object, such as a tree or a horizontal bar at your local gym. Kneel facing the anchor and grip either end of the band with your arms extended over your head. Bend your elbows to pull the band towards the floor. Contract your back muscles as you do this. Then slowly return to the starting position. Do two to three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions. [13] X Research source"

Grab onto a pull up bar with your palms facing towards your torso. Keep your grip close to the width of your shoulders. [14] X Research source Keep your back straight and your lower back curved. Your chest should be sticking out slightly. [15] X Research source Pull yourself upward, breathing out, until your head is level with the pull up bar. Breathing in, lower your body back to the starting position. [16] X Research source If you are new to doing chin ups, it may take practice before you are able to successfully incorporate them into your workout. The number of repetitions depends on your overall fitness level. Start off by seeing how many chin ups you can do successfully before becoming tired and gradually build up from that number.

Without positioning your hands and elbows correctly, you may be inadvertently targeting your biceps. When doing lats workouts, make sure our elbows are not held too tightly. This puts pressure on your arms, resulting in a workout that targets the biceps. [22] X Research source Keep your wrists pronated during lats exercises. This means keeping your palms pointed down or otherwise away from your body. This helps you work out your lats and not your biceps. [23] X Research source"

      "content": "Use proper form and technique. You should always make sure you use proper form and technique in any work out routines you engage in. Proper form is vital, especially for weight lifting as you engage a wide range of muscle groups. If you're unsure whether your form is correct, consider asking a personal trainer or a work out friend for advice. If your muscles become very sore after workouts, even after a day of rest, your form may be off and this is your body's warning sign. [24] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You should never start weight training or using gym equipment without learning technique. Unfortunately, this can be difficult to learn through observation as what works for one person is not necessarily safe for you and your body type. You should always talk to a trainer, physical therapist, or other fitness professional before adding weight training to a workout routine.

Work on building muscle at least two to three days a week — you can do more days if you are careful about not working the same muscles back-to-back. Stick to aerobic activity on the other days.
