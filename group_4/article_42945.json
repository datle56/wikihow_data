      "title": "Check your pack’s production code.",
      "content": "Check your pack’s production code. Most cigarettes have a Julian Date Code printed on the bottom of the pack that details when the pack was manufactured. The code is usually 6 to 7 digits long, where the first 3 numbers indicate the day of the year the pack was produced and the 2 numbers after indicate the year. [1] X Research source For example, the first 5 digits of the production code may read ‘14422.’ The ‘144’ indicates the day of the year the pack was manufactured on, starting from 001, or January 1st. The 144th day of the year is May 24th. The ‘22’ refers to the last 2 digits of a year in the 2000s, so this means the pack was produced in 2022. [2] X Research source Unopened cigarette packs will typically stay fresh for up to 2 years."

According to the World Health Organization, an expiration date may make consumers think that it’s safe to smoke the cigarettes before the printed date, while smoking cigarettes at any time can cause health problems.

      "title": "Instead of expiring, cigarettes go stale.",
      "content": "Instead of expiring, cigarettes go stale. Cigarettes are filled with tobacco, which is an organic material that has a shelf life like any other product. When a cigarette pack is opened, the tobacco is exposed to air and begins to lose its moisture. The loss of moisture and the passage of time causes cigarettes to drop in quality and grow stale. [4] X Research source After opening a pack, cigarettes can start to lose their flavor and go stale after 2 days. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Smell your cigarettes for a dull or papery aroma. Place a cigarette under your nose and inhale. Fresh cigarettes should have a sweet, earthy scent, or a fresh, minty smell if they are menthol. If your cigarette smells plain, it’s stale. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Taste your cigarette for a harsh or sharp flavor.",
      "content": "Taste your cigarette for a harsh or sharp flavor. You don't have to light and smoke the cigarette to check its taste, just simply place the end in your mouth. A stale cigarette loses its normal tobacco flavor and becomes bitter and unpleasant tasting. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Pinch your cigarette to see if it’s dry.",
      "content": "Pinch your cigarette to see if it’s dry. Cigarettes go stale when the tobacco loses its moisture and dries out. Hold the cigarette between your fingers and lightly press down. A fresh cigarette should have a slight bounce when you pinch it. If the cigarette feels brittle, hard, or any tobacco comes out the end, it’s gone stale. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for brown or yellow spots on your cigarette. When cigarettes are exposed to air, the tobacco inside begins to lose its moisture. Brown and yellow spots may appear as the oils and other chemicals in the tobacco leak through the cigarette paper, showing you that the cigarette has gone stale. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Rehydrate stale cigarettes to return them to freshness.",
      "content": "Rehydrate stale cigarettes to return them to freshness. Bring back moisture to your stale cigarettes by placing them in a plastic bag with a slice of bread. After a few hours, check on the cigarettes to see if they are moist. They should no longer be hard and instead, have a slight bounce when you pinch them. Avoid keeping your cigarettes in the bag for too long. The cigarettes can become too moist and develop an unpleasant flavor."
