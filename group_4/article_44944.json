Whenever you see leaves that aren't healthy, use your sanitized shears or scissors to cut off the damaged leaves. Cut close to the base of the stem so you don't leave long, scraggly stems on the plant. [6] X Research source Keep in mind that yellow leaves might mean that the plant is getting too much water. Leaves that are turning brown at the ends mean that the plant isn't getting enough water."

      "content": "Cut off stems near the main branch to control the size of the plant. Step back and look for branches that are sticking out awkwardly or don't have many leaves. To cut back scraggly branches or reduce the size of your monstera, take sterilized shears and make a clean, straight cut across the branch where it meets the base stem. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that when you cut off branches, you'll encourage the plant to put on new growth near the base of the plant. You can make a cut below any node on a branch if you don't want to completely remove it. For example, cut back each branch by 1/3 or 1/2 if you simply want to control the size of the plant."

      "content": "Cut back 1/3 of the roots if you want to repot it. Can you see roots growing out of the pot's drainage holes? If so, carefully pull out the plant and loosen the roots with your fingers. Then, snip 1/3 of the root ends off with sterilized shears and fill your pot 1/3 full of fresh soil. Place the trimmed monstera into the pot and surround the plant with soil before you water it. [8] X Research source If you can't pull the plant out, turn the pot on its side and cut the roots that are sticking out of the holes. Then, you should be able to pull the plant out. Dealing with a really big plant? Ask a friend to help you lift the plant out of the pot and hold the plant. Throw these cuttings into the trash since they can take root and grow in your compost pile."

      "content": "Fill a pot with well-draining soil mix when you're ready to plant the cutting. Pick out pot that's at least 6 inches (15 cm) across and has drainage holes in the bottom. This prevents water from pooling near the roots of the plant. Then, fill the pot 1/3 full with a mixture of well-draining soil. [12] X Research source To make your own soil mixture, combine 3 parts potting soil with 2 parts perlite, pumice, or sand."
