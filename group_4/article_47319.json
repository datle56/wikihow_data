If the spill can stain the suede and you know the towel treatment alone will not suffice, then use a suede cleaning kit on the exterior. A suede cleaning kit will come with a stain eraser and a small, stiff suede brush with which to work in the eraser. A suede brush, nail file, or soft-textured sandpaper can also remove mud or scuff marks. This will also return the nap texture to the suede. Once the exterior of the slippers is clean, consider applying a suede-safe waterproofing spray to make cleaning them easier in the future."
