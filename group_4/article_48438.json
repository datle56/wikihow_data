      "content": "A simple expression of concern can go a long way. Whether you're talking to an acquaintance, friend, co-worker, or partner, \"I'm sorry\" shows them that you understand and are sympathetic to their struggles. Acknowledge the situation so that the other person can see you're willing to talk openly and honestly with them, and then offer your sympathies and condolences.

      "content": "If it's an employee or co-worker, thank them for notifying you. Because family emergencies are often sudden and extremely draining, some find it tough to reach out and notify work promptly. Whether you get plenty of forewarning or a last-minute note, acknowledge the time and energy that person spent telling you about their current situation. \"I appreciate you checking in, and I'm so sorry to hear about your mother's illness.\" \"Thank you for the update—I can't imagine how stressful this must be. I wish your family nothing but the best!\" \"Thank you for the heads-up. Please don't worry about that assignment we're working on; I'm more than happy to wrap it up myself.\""

      "content": "Let them know you're thinking of them to help them feel less alone. It's a good idea to tell them that you're thinking of them when a family emergency happens, and it's also a kind gesture to remind them how much you care as time goes on. After all, this person might be dealing with the aftermath of the emergency for quite some time. Keep them in your thoughts as they heal! \"I'm thinking about you today and sending you all the good vibes.\" \"I just heard the news; I'm thinking of you and your family today.\" \"I'm keeping your family in my thoughts today. I hope everything is okay in the end.\""

Acknowledge that you don't know what to say while clarifying that you care about them nonetheless. Focus on being present with them rather than doing something; your support is far more important than flowery words! \"I'm at a loss for words. Is there anything I can do?\" \"I wish I could find the right words to say right now, but I'm here for you always.\" \"I wish I could put your mind at ease, but I know it's not that easy.

You can share a little bit about your own experiences if you've been through something similar, but that doesn't mean the other person feels the same way you did. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how they might be feeling before you say something to them. \"I can only imagine what you're going through. I'm so sorry for your loss.\" \"I remember how tough it was to navigate my grandpa's illness. I don't know how you're feeling right now, but I'm here to support you.\" \"Wow, that sounds like a lot.
