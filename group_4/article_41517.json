      "content": "Cool your baklava at room temperature before storing it. Remove your baklava from the oven and it into a wide, shallow, and uncovered container. Cooling is especially important when the weather is rainy or humid. During the summer, cool your baklava in the refrigerator immediately after baking it. This gives them time to cool before exposing it to room temperature conditions. Don't store your baklava at room temperature for more than 5 days. [1] X Research source"

Afterward, place another piece of parchment paper on top, and add another 2 pieces of baklava on top. Finally, top off the batch with another 2 baklava pieces, and place a final piece of parchment paper on top. Limit your batches to 4 to 6 baklava pieces so you don't have to defrost all of them at once. Always separate each layer with a piece of wax or parchment paper."

      "title": "Place your batch of baklava pieces into an airtight container.",
      "content": "Place your batch of baklava pieces into an airtight container. Take your baklava layers and place them gently in a container. If you're using a container like a cookie tin, wrap a layer of aluminum foil around your baklava pieces to prevent damage. Don't crowd the container. If the baklava doesn't fit, take out 1 or 2 pieces or try a different kind of container. [3] X Research source Mark the date onto the container or bag. Avoid ceramic containers—their porous nature lets air inside, which can accelerate aging."

Afterward, place the uncovered container into the refrigerator to cool. If you put your baklava right into the freezer, it will decrease the temperature of other foods items, which can ruin their taste and texture. Freezer-safe bags also work. Just be careful that your baklava doesn't get crushed by other foods in your fridge."
