      "title": "Be polite with your stims.",
      "content": "Be polite with your stims. Stimming should help you focus and feel good. It shouldn't prevent other people from focusing or feeling good. Avoid disruptive stimming when people need to focus, and don't touch people without their consent. Disability is not an excuse to cross other people's boundaries. Use subtle stims (e.g. chewing gum rather than loud echolalia) when people are concentrating, such as during a lecture or exam. Step outside to stim a little if you need to. Don't stim with other people's clothing or body parts (like hair) unless you're sure it's okay. Some people might not feel comfortable asking you to stop."

It is absolutely okay to stim in public for any reason—for fun, for concentration, for staving off meltdowns, or for whatever. Do what makes you comfortable. [4] X Research source"
