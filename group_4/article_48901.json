      "content": "Seek out special interest groups. Identify groups at your school who have a vested interest in one particular aspect of the school’s operations and solicit them for help. Sports teams and academic clubs are great groups to approach, since these groups utilize school resources for activities from which individual members benefit. [1] X Research source Approach the football team to see if they need new equipment, a better playing field, or more support from the student body. As a student representative, you may be able to help them achieve these goals. Get involved in special events and fundraisers for particular causes as well. If the chess team has a fundraiser to help them travel to a tournament, your presence at the event could be reason enough for the entire chess club to vote for you."

Figure out what these issues are and take a position on them to rally support for your campaign. Maybe the student body wants more vending machines or better food in the lunchroom. Vow to address these issues as a class representative and more people will vote for you. Be careful when taking a position on divisive issues, however, as you risk alienating certain segments of the student body on particularly charged issues."

      "content": "Be outgoing. Introverts are rarely selected for student government through general elections because people feel more comfortable voting for someone they know well. High school politics are often to referred to as popularity contests for a reason. As such, you need to get out there and become acquainted with your peers and classmates. Regardless of your class size, try to convince each individual to vote for you. Be friendly to everyone, including your fellow contenders.

Make sure you are aware of these rules and follow them closely. You don’t want to be disqualified from your campaign. Don't hang flyers or posters for your campaign in areas of the school where they are not supposed to be. Don't pass out trinkets or gifts to potential voters if this is not allowed in your school."

[3] X Research source Make sure to use bright colors and place these posters in highly trafficked areas of the school, as this will help make sure your signs get seen. If there is a particular hallway or room where students congregate often, place your campaign signs in that area. Use neon green, yellow, orange or pink poster boards to make your signs. These colors have been proven effective in catching people's attention."

If your school doesn't allow you to hand out candy, then try handing out bracelets, pencils, and stickers.

If you're new at the school, try volunteering for a position that's not elected your first year, such as yearbook or newspaper. It will be a good way to get to know classmates and the school and gain experience before you run. You may also wish to start your own club or organization. Spearheading an initiative like this will allow you to stand out from the crowd as someone who is willing to invest his own time to improve the student experience."

If you make reasonable pledges that are appealing to the majority of people, many of those same people will vote for you (for example, say you'll create a short break between classes during each day). However, don't pledge to do something you know you can't do, like getting rid of homework; most people won't believe you and those who do will be disappointed if you can't make it happen.

      "content": "Follow through. If you get elected president, make all of your possible promises come true, and try to make a good one, so you can get elected once more. Make a note of the things you promised to do while campaigning. Tackle those issues one by one, checking off your initiatives as you go. Be prepared to fight for something you promised the student body. Perhaps you said you would try to increase the amount of time between classes, but the school's administration says it can't be done. Don't just give up. Ask questions of the administration and challenge any inconsistencies in their explanation. Your classmates voted for you so that you could represent them. Even if you can't get them what they want, you can at least say you tried your best."
