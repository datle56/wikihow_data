      "content": "Your relationship is physically abusive. In any type of relationship, your physical health and wellbeing always come first. You have every right to cut ties and leave the relationship if the person ever threatens you, hurts you, or does anything that makes you feel unsafe. It doesn’t matter how minor the instances of abuse seem—abuse is abuse, no matter how severe or frequent it is.

Go to source Here are a few examples of what physical abuse can look like : Your partner physically hurts you, but then lets up on the attack once you acquiesce to their requests. A parent threatens to hurt you and has hurt you a couple of times in the past. A sibling willfully damages or breaks your belongings. Warning: Unfortunately, acts of physical abuse in an intimate relationship are rarely isolated. If the person has hurt you once, there’s a good chance that they’ll do it again."

Maybe the person in your life doesn’t let you have any personal space, or they feel incredibly jealous when you spend time with people other than them. Their love often seems conditional and unpredictable, and you often feel like their emotional punching bag. Other common signs of emotional abuse include: A refusal to take responsibility. If anything, they’ll find a way to pin the blame on you. Guilt-tripping and manipulation. They use extreme tactics to get their way, like threatening to hurt themselves or take their own life.

Maybe your partner or loved one doesn’t think mental health treatment like therapy will work, or they just aren’t interested in taking steps to improve their mental health. While they’re entitled to their beliefs on therapy and other treatment options, you don’t (and shouldn’t) have to stick around waiting for them to take care of themselves. [4] X Research source While it’s really noble and compassionate to stick by this person’s side, it also isn’t worth sacrificing your own mental health. Your life and livelihood are just as important as theirs—you shouldn’t feel like you’re giving up your own happiness to spend time around them."

[5] X Trustworthy Source National Domestic Violence Hotline Organization providing lifesaving tools, support, and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse Go to source Even if your intentions are good, staying with someone out of pity is disrespectful to both you and the other person. Take a moment to ask yourself what you get out of your relationship with this person. Does it feel fulfilling, or do you feel a sense of obligation to stick around? If it’s the latter, it might be time to leave. [6] X Research source When you stay with someone out of pity, you’re only diminishing their sense of self-worth. Giving them the space to live and exist without you in the picture is far more considerate."
