Your brain might transform those feelings of insecurity into a cheating dream. Everyone on the planet has dealt with feelings of jealousy at one point or another, but it's important not to let it get out of control by overly comparing yourself with others. [2] X Research source If you had a dream your partner was cheating on you, the person they were cheating with might have qualities or something you wish you had, like a great mindset or a successful career. Think of this as a chance to better understand yourself and what you want. Now you're empowered to go get those qualities yourself! [3] X Research source If you really do feel like your partner is spending too much time with another person, you may want to consider whether they’re having an emotional affair. These types of scenarios can be just as painful as if your partner was physically cheating.

      "content": "You and your partner might not share the same goals for the future. A successful relationship usually consists of a set of shared goals for the future that you both agree on and are excited about. [4] X Research source You might have dreamt your partner cheated on you because there's a misalignment of goals for the future, like them not wanting to have children when you do, or them wanting to move in with you when you're not ready for that. It's important to talk openly about your non-negotiables in a relationship. If you can't agree on fundamentals like wanting to get married in the future, it might be time to leave the relationship."

Funny enough, dreaming that your partner cheated on you with someone important to you might just be your brain's silly way of processing the hope that they'll get along. If you're worried that your partner isn't getting along with someone close to you, like your best friend, help them get to know each other better by inviting them to a shared dinner with you. Though it's not ideal, your friends and family don't have to like your partner. If you feel as though you're in a healthy, fulfilling relationship, it's your happiness that matters most.

Silly, simple things like eating the last cookie or watching your favorite show without your partner might get turned into a cheating dream by your brain at night. When you feel guilty, your brain might try to find a way to punish you for breaking your partner's trust. That's why it's forcing you to sit through a painful dream.
