If you’re still having trouble, try using more creative mnemonic solutions, such as associating i.e. with “I explain” or e.g. with “egg sample” (which sounds like \"example\").

I went to my least favorite place (i.e., the dentist). Note that what follows \"i.e.\" is often a further explanation. This can also be a metaphor .

I like power metal (e.g., Firewind, Iced Earth, Sonata Arctica). Observe how using \"i.e.\" wouldn't make sense in these examples. \"Carrots\" is not another way to describe vegetables in general, it is just one of the many foods that are considered to be vegetables. If you wanted to use \"i.e.\" you would write \"Buy some vegetables, i.e., the edible part of any plant.\" Likewise, the bands given are examples of power metal, but not a description. If you were using \"i.e.\" you would write something like \"I like power metal, i.e., fast metal with symphonic elements and epic themes.\""

However, if the clarification or explanation is part of the main sentence, spell out the phrase that is appropriate to your meaning instead. For example, if you’re writing a paper and want to provide some examples of sources that argue a particular point, use e.g.: “Some studies (e.g., Smith, 2015; Yao, 1999) support this assertion, while others -- for example, Abdullah’s (2013) research on pizza and topping choice -- disagree.” Use i.e. to provide short clarifications and a phrase to provide longer or more detailed clarifications: “In our research we altered the order of image display (i.e., first, second, or third) as well as their color scheme, that is, whether we had applied a blue or green filter.”"
