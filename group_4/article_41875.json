  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Know exactly what is being covered on the test.",
      "content": "Know exactly what is being covered on the test. Make sure you understand what you’re being tested on. This may include date ranges, specific scientific theories, or mathematic equations. If you are unsure, ask your teacher or a classmate to clarify. This way, you won’t waste time studying information that won’t be on the exam. [1] X Research source Review the syllabus or any handouts given to you by your teacher. Then, create a list of all the material you need to review."
    },
    {
      "title": "Establish the major concepts of your study material.",
      "content": "Establish the major concepts of your study material. Create a list of the major theoretical or categorical concepts, and make sure you understand them. Because you’re studying at the last minute, it is important that you understand the largest concepts first. While you may be tested on small details, you must grasp the large theories first to understand the context of smaller facts. [2] X Research source Organize terms and facts according to these large groupings. This technique is called “chunking.” It’s easier to memorize individual concepts when they’re related to a greater whole. Warwick says that “the first step when you’re starting to attack the material is to develop and understand how you think about the question and the way you think about learning the material. Once you have that foundation, it’s a lot easier to build on extra information.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Review your syllabus.",
      "content": "Review your syllabus. At the beginning of the year or semester, your teacher will usually hand out a syllabus that details all the material that will be covered in the course. Refer back to the syllabus to ensure you have not missed any areas of study. [3] X Research source Use the syllabus to guide your study. Your professor likely organized the material in a specific way to guide your learning. Use the syllabus to look at the course material from a larger perspective and figure out how to best organize this mass of information."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a study schedule.",
      "content": "Make a study schedule. Create a schedule by dividing up the hours in the day and deciding what you will focus on when. Plan to spend more time on topics you’re unsure about and less time on topics you already know pretty well. Include time for breaks and meals, and give yourself plenty of time to get a good night’s sleep. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Review and highlight your notes.",
      "content": "Review and highlight your notes. Rereading your notes can help jog your memory on certain subjects. Go through them and highlight keywords and concepts, or use Post-it notes to signify important information. Try writing summaries of your notes for each chapter or major concept using simple terms on a separate sheet of paper. [5] X Research source Study your notes out of order. This helps ensure you know each piece of information on its own rather than as a part of a series. If you don’t have your own notes, get a copy from someone you trust."
    },
    {
      "title": "Say the information out loud.",
      "content": "Say the information out loud. Reciting the information you study out loud will make it easier to remember, as your brain is hearing and pronouncing the information rather than simply reading it. Try teaching a chapter or concept to an imaginary student. This will force you to fully articulate the subject so you can see how much you actually understand. You can also do this with a study group or partner. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use memorization tricks.",
      "content": "Use memorization tricks. When you study at the last minute, you’ll mostly rely on short-term memorization. To memorize information, try rewriting it over and over to help it stick in your brain. Or, try a mnemonic device by creating rhymes, acronyms, or songs associated with the material. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make flash cards.",
      "content": "Make flash cards. Making flash cards is a great way to test yourself throughout the day. Write terms on one side of the card and their full definitions on the other. These are also useful on the day of the test, as you can review them on the bus, in line for lunch, or right before the exam. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your textbook effectively.",
      "content": "Use your textbook effectively. Simply rereading your textbook will not help you retain information, especially when you only have one day to study. Instead, look for chapter summaries and bolded keywords as you review. Pay attention to chapter introductions and conclusions, as they usually summarize essential information. [9] X Research source Look for review questions at the ends of chapters or in the back of the textbook. These are great practice questions, especially if your test is multiple-choice. Answering these questions can help gauge what you understand and what you still need to work on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a study guide.",
      "content": "Create a study guide. Creating a study guide is an effective way to force yourself to review all your material. Type out a list of all the material you need to cover, including key terms, dates, and concepts. Fill in each area using your notes, typed or handwritten. Putting these ideas into your own words and writing them out can help cement them in your mind. Plus, a study guide can be a good refresher on the day of the exam. [10] X Research source While you may be tempted to borrow a study guide from a classmate, making your own will help you memorize the information better."

    {
      "title": "Base your study method on the type of test you’re taking.",
      "content": "Base your study method on the type of test you’re taking. In order to properly prepare for a test, you must know which format it will take, like multiple-choice, short answer, or essay. Each type of exam tests different skills, so each requires a different study method. For example, it may be better to memorize facts for a multiple-choice test, while it might be better to understand larger concepts for a short answer test. [11] X Research source Multiple-choice tests are usually geared toward small details, like facts, vocabulary, and definitions. Questions about the similarities and differences between certain things are also common. Try to focus on specific areas rather than attempting to conquer the entire subject. [12] X Research source Essay and short answer tests usually require you to have a good understanding of wide themes and ideas. Try preparing a few sample questions based on the textbook and syllabus. Give yourself 15 minutes to write a detailed outline for each question, as if you were going to turn it into a full essay. Memorize some key terms and examples to use for supporting details."

    {
      "title": "Take lots of breaks.",
      "content": "Take lots of breaks. To avoid getting stressed or burnt out, allow yourself to take frequent breaks. Work for a certain amount of time and then rest for a few minutes before moving on to the next study session. For example, consider working for 45 minutes and then taking a 15-minute break. During your break, feel free to check your email, use your phone, or get up and walk around. Just make sure you get back to work when time is up. [13] X Research source Another option is to try the 50/10 method. Study diligently for 50 minutes without distractions. If you stop or get distracted, restart the 50 minutes. Once your 50 minutes are up, take a 10-minute break. This will force you to be more productive when studying."

    {
      "title": "Find a quiet place to study.",
      "content": "Find a quiet place to study. Study somewhere away from distractions like your bed or your friends. Go to a new, quiet place that will allow you to focus solely on the task at hand. Choose somewhere you won’t have to move for a while. A quiet room, library, coffee shop, or your study desk are ideal options. [14] X Research source Warwick recommends “finding a space that’s quiet and that is away from things that are going to distract you, even if it means traveling to an inconvenient place. Get a space where you aren’t going to be distracted by your phone going off, notifications on your laptop, TV, or people talking in the other room.”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring all necessary belongings.",
      "content": "Bring all necessary belongings. Make a list of your essentials before you leave so you don’t forget anything. This may include your textbook, notes, computer, highlighters, and anything else you may need. Remember to bring plenty of water and snacks, as well, as being hungry or thirsty may cause you to lose focus. [15] X Research source Don’t bring anything that will distract you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off your phone.",
      "content": "Turn off your phone. Unless you need it to study, turn off your phone so you won’t get distracted. If you’re tempted to use it, put it in your bag or pocket. Another option is to leave it at home or in another room.

      "title": "Decide who to study with.",
      "content": "Decide who to study with. With such a limited amount of time, it is probably best to study alone. However, it is sometimes helpful to work with a small group so you can compare notes and talk through concepts together. If you think a study group will help you, make sure to choose classmates who are focused and won’t distract you by goofing off. [17] X Research source It is easy to get distracted if you are only studying with good friends. It may be better to work with students you only know from class so you can all focus more easily. Warwick says it usually isn’t a good idea to study with friends: “Most of the time, when you’re studying with a friend, you’re either in a position where you are needing a lot of help from the other person or giving a lot of help to the other person. You’re not getting the maximum benefit out of your own study time. So, the only situation where that works well is when you have very similar skill levels.”"

    {
      "title": "Get a good night’s sleep.",
      "content": "Get a good night’s sleep. When you get a good night’s sleep , your brain stores more of the information you learned that day, meaning you’ll remember things more easily for your test. While you may be tempted to stay up late or pull an all-nighter to study, this will likely negatively affect your test performance. Aim to get 7-9 hours of quality sleep so you wake up feeling refreshed and prepared to take your exam. [18] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat a healthy meal.",
      "content": "Eat a healthy meal. Eat a well-balanced breakfast the morning of your exam, and if your test is in the afternoon, make sure to eat a healthy lunch as well. Eating provides your brain with the energy necessary to concentrate on an exam. If you don’t eat, you may be too distracted by your hunger to do well. [19] X Research source Try to avoid sugary snacks. These may provide a quick burst of energy but will likely cause you to crash later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit your caffeine intake.",
      "content": "Limit your caffeine intake. Resist the urge to chug a lot of coffee or energy drinks when preparing for your exam. Caffeine may give you an energy boost at first, but too much can lead to overstimulation, which will make it difficult for you to focus on your exam. You’ll also crash when the caffeine wears off. [20] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Review your notes before class.",
      "content": "Review your notes before class. While you shouldn’t try to learn new information on the day of your exam, review what you studied the night before. Look over your notes at breakfast, on your way to school, and in class before your test starts. Focus on the topics you struggled with the night before so they’re fresh in your mind. Stay calm, and know you’ve done everything you could to prepare for the test."
    },
    {
      "title": "Should you cram for a test in one day?",
      "content": "Should you cram for a test in one day? While cramming may be better than not studying at all, it isn’t recommended. Studying for a test in one day doesn’t give you time to fully learn the information, so you likely won’t remember what you studied in the long run. Cramming also often increases stress and anxiety. [21] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Should you pull an all-nighter to study?",
      "content": "Should you pull an all-nighter to study? It isn’t a good idea to pull an all-nighter before an exam. Getting adequate sleep improves your memory and cognitive function. If you don’t sleep the night before an exam, you’re less likely to remember what you studied and you may be too fatigued to do well. You could even fall asleep during the test! Aim to get about 8 hours of sleep before your exam, even if it means you don’t get as much study time. [22] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "What is the most effective study technique for short-term preparation?",
      "content": "What is the most effective study technique for short-term preparation? The most effective study techniques vary from person to person, but in general, the Pomodoro Technique works well. With the Pomodoro technique, you work in 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks in between. After four study sessions, take a longer 15 to 30-minute break. This helps you stay focused so you can study effectively. [23] X Research source Other effective study techniques include active recall, summarizing key points, and teaching the material to someone else."
    },
    {
      "title": "When should I start studying for an exam?",
      "content": "When should I start studying for an exam? Ideally, start preparing for an exam as soon as you learn about it. Give yourself at least a few days to thoroughly review the material and understand key concepts. Spend an hour or two each day studying so you don’t have to cram at the last minute. [24] X Research source When creating a study routine, Warwick says that “what matters more than anything is consistency and making sure that you’re getting the repetitions at practicing the material. Take the amount of time you think you can devote to studying, cut it in half, and make that the goal for your first week of studying. If you start to develop a good habit, it’s a lot easier to slowly increase [the amount of time you’re studying].”"
    },
    {
      "title": "What should I do if I feel overwhelmed?",
      "content": "What should I do if I feel overwhelmed? If you start to feel overwhelmed, take a break. Go for a walk or do some breathing exercises to calm your nerves. When you come back, prioritize your tasks. Understand that you can’t study everything, and break down your study sessions into small, achievable goals, like studying a certain amount of vocab words or reading a certain number of chapters. [25] X Research source If you find that you are constantly overwhelmed when studying, even if you give yourself more than a day, talk to friends, family, or a school counselor for support. They may be able to help you manage your stress more effectively."
