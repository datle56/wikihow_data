      "content": "Recognize the effects of hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) contact with skin can cause severe chemical burns. Direct contact with HF can cause major damage to your skin tissue, as HF is a corrosive substance that burns. It can also penetrate the skin and cause even further damage under the skin. [1] X Research source This can be even worse, depending on the concentration of the acid and the length of exposure. No matter the concentration, however, the burns may cause a deeper penetration of the underlying skin tissue after a longer time of detection. Any increased time can allow for a burn to become more severe. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Distinguish the categories of burn.",
      "content": "Distinguish the categories of burn. There are 3 categories of HF burns. A burn that is grade 1 appears with white burn mark and has surrounding painful redness along the skin. A burn that is grade 2 appears with a white burn mark and surrounding painful redness, but also demonstrates blistering and edema, which is leakage of intra-cellular fluids outside of damaged cellular tissue. A burn that is grade 3 appears in the same way as grade 2, with the addition of blistering, and necrosis, which is cell tissue death. Cell tissue death is seen as discolored blue or black tissue around the burn. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove all contaminated clothing immediately. If there is any part of your clothing that has been saturated with HF, remove it immediately from your body or any portion of your skin. This will prevent more acid from touching the skin, as well as stop continued exposure that may cause more serious burning. Make sure that the clothing comes into contact with as little skin as possible as it is removed. Do not touch clothing directly with bare skin if you believe it has also been contaminated with HF. Use gloves, masks, and gowns, if possible."

      "title": "Flush the burned area.",
      "content": "Flush the burned area. If you come into contact with HF, flush the burned area under a safety shower or suitable hose. Orient the burned area so that water runs down and off your skin. Make sure that the water coming into contact with the affected area does not come into contact with any other part of your body. This constant flow of cool water should not overly cold but cool enough to soothe the burn. Continue flushing the area for fifteen or more minutes."

      "content": "Have another person call for medical assistance. HF burns are very serious and can lead to many systemic issues and even death. You need to get help as soon as possible because HF burns require expert medical attention regardless of how you feel or what you believe is necessary. Have someone else call for you while you deal with preventing continued exposure to the acid. Seek medical attention as soon as possible from the time of exposure to reduce the time the acid can continue to linger and cause damage. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Treat the wound after flushing it.",
      "content": "Treat the wound after flushing it. You can do a few things after flushing your burn. Massage a generous amount of calcium gluconate gel into and around the burn. Keep applying gel for at least twenty minutes. This should be the first line of care if available after extensive rinsing with water. You can also use hexafluorine, which is a chemical compound that has also been used extensively for HF burns. However, some studies have not found it to be any more effective in reducing electrolyte disturbances than proper rinsing with water. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids can also be used with some benefit if calcium gluconate is not available. Look for common antacid brands such as Mylanta. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Get treated. Seeking medical care from professionals will help assess long-term side effects of the burn. The goal of treatment is reduce the effects of HF burns while simultaneously controlling the pain from exposure. Prior to discharge, your doctor will assess your electrolyte balances with a blood test, test for any heart palpitations and arrhythmias, and review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to make sure it is normal. Your doctor may continue with similar tests during follow-up to make sure that long-term symptoms do not develop after you have been discharged. If exposure to HF is only on the fingers, you will likely be discharged with calcium gluconate gel and instructed to wear a latex glove after applying the gel. This will help to maximize the efficacy of the gel by increasing absorption. [7] X Research source Your doctor should follow-up with you at least once after 24 hours from the time you are discharged. This follow-up may be in person or over the telephone, depending on the severity of your exposure and the doctor's judgment."

      "content": "Recognize the symptoms. If your eyes are exposed to HF, they will experience rapid symptoms. If your eyes only have mild exposure, expect rapid irritation and possibly pain. This may be followed by a clouding of the cornea of the eye, which may be reversible. If severe exposure occurs, expect a rapid onset of pain and damage to the cornea. The cornea may degrade and the eye may swell. Clouding of the eye may become permanent as well as any other visual defects in the eye.

This will flush out the acid and help prevent continued damage to the eyes. If only one eye has been contaminated, be sure to not wash acid into the other eye. Keep your eyelids apart and away from the eyeballs while washing. Tilt your head to the side so that water runs off your eye from the side closest to your nose towards your temples. This will prevent the contaminated water from rinsing back into your eye, nose, mouth, or other vital areas on the face.

The symptoms for mild exposure may be include irritation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat, coughing, burns on the passageways, and narrowing of airways, which will cause difficulty breathing. Symptoms for severe exposure include all of the above as well as an immediate narrowing of the airways, along with pulmonary edema, which is a build-up of fluid in the lungs.

However, if you come upon someone who has or might have inhaled HF, check the affected person's vital signs. Check for a pulse and respiratory breathing on him and make sure his airway is open so that he can breathe. Continue to monitor the individual for any observable symptoms and do your best to alleviate those symptoms as professional medical attention is obtained. If the person looks as though they are having a hard time breathing, administer oxygen if available. Artificial respiration such as CPR is necessary and should be administered by trained professionals if breathing has stopped.

Inhalation of HF can cause serious damage and treatment should be done in a medical setting because there is little to no effective treatment outside of a clinical setting. While there is a lot of literature and research available about HF exposure to the skin, inhalation exposure has had relatively little research completed. The process of treating HF inhalation injury is highly complex, and more experimental research is still needed to learn proper care techniques.

Spirometry aims to determine your ability to utilize your expected lung capacity and will involve blowing into a tube to measure your effective lung capacity. You will be tested on your ability to inhale, exhale, and the rate at which you can achieve these actions. Just as with other HF exposure, your doctor will take a blood test to check your electrolyte balances, look for any arrhythmias or heart palpitations, and will review your Echocardiogram (ECG) to check for any abnormalities.

Exposure through ingestion can lead to nausea, vomiting, burns to the mouth and airways, and abdominal pain. You may also experience necrosis of areas of the stomach and digestive tract, which can cause severe pain due to localized tissue death. You may also suffer gastric bleeding, which is accompanied by an inflammation of the stomach.

      "content": "Neutralize the acid. After drinking milk or water and calling for help, it is necessary to attempt to bind certain substances in HF with a neutralizing substance. Take some Tums, which are chewable calcium tablets that can help during HF ingestion. The calcium can help bind the HF in your system. If you don't have Tums, try milk of magnesia, Maalox, or other liquid antacid. Drink 4 to 8 ounces of these liquids to help. Don't overdo it with the liquids by trying multiple methods. You don't want to induce vomiting. Vomiting can cause the acid to further damage unexposed areas that are undamaged."

This can lead to cardiac problems, including cardiac arrest. A urinalysis will also be done in order to assess your fluid levels. This will help to guide fluid management and help with replenishing of any depleted electrolytes. Your doctor will run the same test as with other forms of exposure, which check for electrolyte balance, heart complications, and other lasting issues. [19] X Research source"
