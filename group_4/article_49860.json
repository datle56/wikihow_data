      "content": "Decide what format you will be using. There are three popular formats to use: block, modified block, and semi-block. Block format means that all elements of the letter are aligned to the left of the page, modified block allows for some elements to be shifted to the right, and semi-block is aligned left but each paragraph is indented. [1] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Block format is the most formal and widely used format. If you are unsure of what type of format to use, this is the best choice. Keep in mind that different organizations utilize different formatting techniques, so be flexible in your formatting if needed."

[2] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source For example, if you are writing to a conservative organization you should choose the standard Times New Roman. Alternatively, if your organization is more liberal, you have more leeway to choose different fonts."

It includes organization name (first line), street address (second line), and city and state (third line). [5] X Research source The heading should be placed two inches from the top of the page. It is also acceptable to include additional contact information (phone, email, fax) after the third line of the address. Try not to use abbreviations (for example, spell street instead of st.). If abbreviating the state, make sure you use the standard postal service abbreviations and capitalize both letters. You do not have to include a heading if your company has a standard letterhead which includes all of the organization's identifying information."
