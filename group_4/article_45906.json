      "title": "Buy high-quality black seed oil from a reputable brand.",
      "content": "Buy high-quality black seed oil from a reputable brand. Unfortunately, black seed oil isn't regulated the way drugs are, so you have to do your own research. Start with an internet search to identify popular brands. Then, read reviews and background information to evaluate their reputation. Look for seals from consumer groups and independent organizations as well. They evaluate quality, so a brand with a seal is likely going to provide a better product than a brand without one."

      "content": "Mix liquid black seed oil with honey or lemon juice. Black seed oil has a pretty strong flavor that you might consider an \"acquired taste.\" If the taste makes you gag, try stirring it in with an equal amount of honey or lemon juice—that usually helps. This is particularly important if you're just taking the oil on its own. If you're mixing it into something else, like juice or a smoothie, you might not need to do this."

      "content": "Drizzle black seed oil on your salad. Black seed oil, preferably, is added to raw food, and salad is one of your best options. It has the same consistency as olive oil, which makes it a natural option as a salad dressing. Vegetables in your salad might also help mask the taste. If you'd rather not just take black seed oil like a medication, this is something to try—especially if you eat salads on a daily basis. If you dislike the flavor of black seed oil, you might try adding it to a salad dressing you already use. You can also add it to sauces or yogurts.

[14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source One option might be to stop using black seed oil for 3 months, then start using it again. Always keep an eye out for side effects, though, particularly digestive symptoms. If you start to have side effects, it's a good idea to stop taking the oil for a while. This limit doesn't apply to topical use. Studies have shown no adverse reactions to topical use after 6 months and even longer."
