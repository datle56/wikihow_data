      "title": "Choose a liquid bleach with polymers to avoid yellow marks.",
      "content": "Choose a liquid bleach with polymers to avoid yellow marks. Check the ingredients list on the bottle of bleach to check for polymers. Alternatively, look for a bleach that is labelled as “whitening” or “no yellow marks.” This is particularly important if you are bleaching white items. Avoid using a spray-on bleach, as this won't disperse itself effectively through your entire wash. Either chlorine or oxygen bleach can be used in the washing machine. However, chlorine bleaches are generally only appropriate for natural fibres and whites."

      "title": "Set your washing machine to the hottest setting.",
      "content": "Set your washing machine to the hottest setting. Hot water helps to activate the bleach. Press the hot wash button to change the temperature of the machine or use the heat dial to turn up the temperature. Use a warm wash if the label on your item specifies that it shouldn't be hot-washed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add your clothes and washing powder to the machine.",
      "content": "Add your clothes and washing powder to the machine. Add washing powder to the washing machine to remove stains and dirt from the laundry items, as bleach won't do this. Place 1 capful of washing powder into the machine, or follow the instructions on the packet. If you prefer, use a liquid detergent instead of washing powder. Always check the care label of each item before washing it."

    {
      "title": "Place the bleach in the bleach dispenser if your machine has one.",
      "content": "Place the bleach in the bleach dispenser if your machine has one. Open the bleach dispenser slot and pour in 1 capful of bleach. The bleach dispenser releases the bleach slowly once the machine fills up with water. This helps to stop the bleach from damaging the fabrics. If you don't have a bleach dispenser, skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Add 1 capful of bleach into the machine once it is filled with water.",
      "content": "Add 1 capful of bleach into the machine once it is filled with water. If you don't have a bleach dispenser, add the bleach to the machine yourself. Wait until the machine has filled up with water and then sprinkle the bleach into the machine. This allows the bleach to be dispersed evenly in the water. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill a bucket or sink with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a bucket or sink with 1 gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. Turn the tap on and wait for the water to heat up. Then, fill the container up with hot water. The hot water helps to activate the bleach and makes it more effective."

    {
      "title": "Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of oxygen or chlorine bleach into the water.",
      "content": "Mix 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of oxygen or chlorine bleach into the water. Measure out your chosen bleach and add it to the water. Oxygen bleach can be used on both coloured and white fabric, whereas chlorine bleach is best for whites only. Chlorine bleach is stronger and usually more effective on heavy stains. [2] X Research source Never mix oxygen and chlorine bleach, as this can cause unwanted chemical reactions to occur in the cleaning solution. Use 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of bleach if your clothes are extremely stained."

      "title": "Add your usual washing detergent to treat stained items.",
      "content": "Add your usual washing detergent to treat stained items. If your laundry items are soiled or stained, place a capful of laundry powder or detergent into the water. This helps to agitate the dirt out of the fibres in the fabric. [3] X Research source If you are simply wanting to lighten or brighten your clothes, skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Soak your laundry for up to 1 hour.",
      "content": "Soak your laundry for up to 1 hour. This gives time for the bleach to sink into the fabric. Keep the bucket away from children and pets, as the bleach solution can be dangerous if it is consumed. [4] X Research source If you are in a rush, simply soak the laundry for 30 minutes. Avoid leaving the items to soak for more than 1 hour, as this can damage the fibres."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the items under cold water.",
      "content": "Rinse the items under cold water. Hold each item under a cold running tap for 20 seconds. The pressure of the water pushes the bleach solution out of the clothes. Alternatively, place the items in the washing machine and set it to a rinse cycle. [5] X Research source Dry the clothes as usual; either on the washing line or in the dryer."
