      "content": "Attach a lobe patch to the back of your ear to balance the earring’s weight. Find these at big box stores or online by searching “ear lobe support patches.” Put the sticky patch on the back of your ear, covering the pierced hole. Then, put in your earring, pushing it through the patch and securing the earring-back in place. [1] X Research source This product keeps the weight of the earring from pulling on your earlobe. You’ll be more comfortable throughout the day, and your lobes will be less likely to get stretched out. You can also use these patches if your earlobes are stretched out already."

      "content": "Use a piece of surgical tape to hold the back of your earring in place. Cut off a 1 in (2.5 cm) piece of surgical tape and roll it so that the sticky side is on the outside. Place the tape behind your ear, making sure the pierced hole is completely covered. Put your earring in, piercing the surgical tape with its back. Secure the earring-back in place. [2] X Research source Surgical tape is safe to use on skin and will hold your earring up so it doesn’t pull on your lobe. This look works best if you’ll be wearing your hair down. Otherwise, the tape might be visible from behind."

      "content": "Turn earrings into clip-ons to keep them from stretching your piercings. The weight of the earring will still be there, but it won’t pull on the actual piercing itself. Heavy earrings will be much more comfortable to wear, as long as you don’t mind a slight pinch on your lobe. [3] X Research source You can buy clip-on earring converters online, at some big box stores, or at craft stores. Generally, you’ll use a small pair of pliers to remove your earring from its current post. Then, attach the earring to a small hook on the clip-on piece. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a bobby pin and thread to hook the weight of the earring to your hair. Cut off a 4–5 in (10–13 cm) piece of thread and loop it through a bobby pin, so the ends are at even lengths. Knot the string 2 inches (5.1 cm) down from the bobby pin and trim off the excess thread below the knot. Put your earring in and hook the string around the back of the earring. Place the bobby pin in your hair high enough that the weight of the earring is no longer pulling on your earlobe, then secure the earring-back in place. [5] X Research source For the most unobtrusive arrangement, use thread that matches your hair color. You may have to readjust the bobby pins several times to get the earring to look like it’s hanging naturally. This is a great DIY option that allows you to wear heavy earrings without buying a new product."

      "content": "Add an earring support chain to help alleviate the weight on your earlobe. An earring support chain is a decorative device you connect to your earring and then clip into your hair to redistribute a heavy earring’s weight.

      "content": "Wear heavy earrings for short periods of time to prevent too much pain. The longer you wear your earrings, the more they’ll pull on your earlobes. How much time is too much is going to be up to you and your personal preferences. Just keep in mind as you’re planning your outfit for the day that you might want to only wear heavy earrings for a few hours at a time. [7] X Research source Consider keeping heavy earring just for special events rather than every-day wear."

Or, exercising while wearing big earrings is likely to cause them to pull harder on your earlobes. Young children might try to pull on big earrings. Just be mindful of your situation and take out your earrings if you’re doing something that might jostle them around. [8] X Research source If you’re on the go, consider keeping a small pouch or baggie with you to remove your earrings and keep them safe whenever you need to."
