      "content": "Buy watercolor brush pens. You can find watercolor brush pens at a local craft store or online. When purchasing a set, look for an exciting color palette and make sure it comes with a refillable clear water pen. Clear water pens usually come empty. To use, simply unscrew their top and fill with water. [1] X Research source Watercolor brush pens have moist tips that resemble a paintbrush. They offer you the effect of watercolor painting with the ease and control that you'd typically find in a marker or pen. Get a feel for what it's like to hold them and move them across a page. In the beginning, tracing paper can offer a nice smooth surface for learning how to use them, despite its lightweight."

      "title": "Choose heavy-weight and smooth paper.",
      "content": "Choose heavy-weight and smooth paper. Because watercolor brush pens are a very wet medium, you'll need to think about the kind of paper you want to use. Choose a paper that is both heavy-weight and has a smooth surface. The weight of the paper will prevent your pen from leaking through, while the smooth surface will ensure a nice even look. Depending on the look you want, paper with a rougher surface may work for you, but it can also wear out the brushes on your pens more quickly. A sturdy cardstock is a great choice when working with these pens. You can also use these in coloring books. Just look for a book that has high-quality, thick pages. You can paint with anything on anything, really, but it makes a huge difference to paint on watercolor paper, since it's specifically made to be absorbent and painted over."
