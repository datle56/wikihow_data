If you’ve just showered, you should be good to go as long as you haven’t applied any products to your skin. If not, go ahead and use a washcloth with warm water and soap to quickly clean your chest and prepare it for the sticky bra’s adhesive. [2] X Research source Make sure to dry off completely before applying the bra—the adhesive won’t work if your skin is wet."

      "content": "Separate the cups for accurate placing if the bra has clasps in the front. Many sticky bras have a clasp or ties in the front, though there are also options that are made of one continuous piece of material. If yours has a clasp in the middle, go ahead and undo it so that you have two separate cups to work with—this way, you can take your time getting each one into exactly the right position. [3] X Research source Always check the instructions before putting on your backless bra. Each brand may have a slightly different method for making it stick the best. Work in front of a mirror so you can easily see what you’re doing. If you’re new to wearing a backless bra, it can feel a little weird at first when you try to put the cups on."

      "content": "Remove the plastic backing to expose the adhesive. Locate the edge of the clear plastic film that is protecting the bra’s adhesive from getting stuck on other things. Peel away the adhesive, but don’t throw those strips away! Put them to the side to reapply later and keep your sticky bra in good condition. [4] X Research source If you need to set the cups down, make sure to put them adhesive-side up."

      "title": "Flip the cups inside out to apply the bra without air bubbles forming.",
      "content": "Flip the cups inside out to apply the bra without air bubbles forming. Simply pop the cups so that the adhesive is sticking out and the front side is concave. When you go to apply the cups, it’ll be much easier to get it to lay flat and adhere completely to your skin. [5] X Research source If you have a two-piece bra, focus on doing on cup at a time. Before you move on to attaching the bra, consider placing tissue paper or pasties over your nipples if they tend to be sensitive. When you remove the bra, the sticky adhesive could be painful as it pulls on your nipples. Tissue paper or pasties will keep the adhesive from attaching and alleviate some of that sensitivity.

      "title": "Place the bra over your breast and smooth it upward and outward.",
      "content": "Place the bra over your breast and smooth it upward and outward. Place the cup so that the middle is centered over your nipple. Attach the cup to your breast at the bottom-most point, and then slowly smooth the rest of the cup upwards over your breast, using your hand to push the material flat against your skin. Avoid putting the bottom of the bra under your breast—you may be tempted to replicate the look and feel of a traditional bra, but most sticky bras need to be set up differently to provide adequate protection. [7] X Research source If your bra has sticky side panels that extend underneath your arms, get the cup into place first and then smooth down the side panel so it’s flush against your skin. If your bra has detached cups, keep in mind that the further away the cups are from one another, the greater cleavage you’ll have once the clasps are connected. If you’re having trouble with the placement, just take a deep breath, peel off the cup, and try again! It won’t hurt anything to reapply the cup several times until you get it where you want it."

      "title": "Connect the front clasp or ties if your bra has that function.",
      "content": "Connect the front clasp or ties if your bra has that function. Gently pull the clasps toward each other and secure them into place. Many brands have clasps that simply hook into each other to provide the most security. If there are ties or a corset-type situation, you’ll need to pull the ties as tight as you want them and secure the ends with a knot. [8] X Research source Some backless bras come with ties so you can make adjustments to the size of your cleavage. A looser tie means less cleavage, and a tighter tie means more cleavage.

      "title": "Undo the front clasp of the bra if yours can be separated.",
      "content": "Undo the front clasp of the bra if yours can be separated. Instead of peeling the bra off in one fell swoop, go ahead and undo the clasp or ties in the front. This will give you a little more flexibility to remove each cup slowly and intentionally, which will be more comfortable and cause less skin irritation. [10] X Research source As tempting as it might be to just take the bra off quickly, taking your time and doing it properly will help keep your bra in good shape for longer."

      "title": "Grasp the topmost edge of the bra and peel it down off your breast.",
      "content": "Grasp the topmost edge of the bra and peel it down off your breast. As you peel off the cup, pull the bra straight down rather than outwards away from your skin. Keeping the adhesive and the cup as close to your skin as possible will minimize the amount of discomfort you might feel. [11] X Research source If your bra has sticky side panels, start peeling the bra off from that point. Once the panel is up and you’ve reached the cup, go ahead and return to the topmost edge to peel it off your breast. If your bra is in two pieces, peel away each cup, one at a time, starting from the top outer edge. If you were to pull outwards, your skin would also stretch outwards as it detaches from the cup, which could cause unnecessary irritation."

      "title": "Take your time when removing the bra so you don’t irritate your skin.",
      "content": "Take your time when removing the bra so you don’t irritate your skin. Move slowly and avoid pulling the cups off quickly. Quick movements could hurt your breasts or even rip the cup, depending on how thin the material is. [12] X Research source Even if you take your time, it still isn’t going to take long at all to get your sticky bra off. One to two minutes should be all you need."

      "title": "Wash your sticky bra by hand with mild soap and water.",
      "content": "Wash your sticky bra by hand with mild soap and water. Try to wash your bra after each use, as this will help keep the adhesive sticky and in great shape. Simply wet the cups in the sink, add a few drops of gentle soap, and massage the adhesive to clear away any skin cells and oils that got left behind. Once you’re done, rinse away all the soap. [13] X Research source If you have long nails, make sure to use the pads of your fingers to clean the cups. Your nails could potentially scratch and ruin the adhesive."

      "title": "Let your bra air dry completely before putting it away.",
      "content": "Let your bra air dry completely before putting it away. Don’t use towels or a blow dryer on your backless bra, and never put it into the dryer. The fibers from a towel would stick to the adhesive and ruin it, and heat would warp it. Simply set it on your counter overnight, adhesive-side up. [14] X Research source It’s okay to set the cups on a towel, just as long as the towel isn’t going to come into contact with the adhesive."

    {
      "title": "Replace the adhesive sticky sheet and put the bra away.",
      "content": "Replace the adhesive sticky sheet and put the bra away. Once the cups have completely dried, go ahead and reapply the clear plastic you removed when getting ready to put the bra on. If you have the original box that the cups came in, slip the bra back inside of it to keep it from getting misshapen. If you no longer have the box, put the bra somewhere it won’t get smashed underneath other pieces of clothing, or use a small box to create a safe spot for your delicate backless bra. [15] X Research source If you threw away the plastic pieces, never fear! Use cling wrap or something similar to cover the adhesive. As long as it’s protected by something that can easily peel away, it should be fine."
