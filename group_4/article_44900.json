      "content": "Turn the car off and pull over to a safe place. If at all possible, avoid driving the car any farther until you know what the problem is—driving any further could further damage your car, if the problem is serious. [1] X Research source In the meantime, pull over to the nearest safe shoulder and turn off your engine. If you’re on a busy road, turn on your hazard lights so that other drivers know you’re handling an issue and can drive safely around you."

      "content": "Bring the car to a mechanic as soon as possible. Generally, the best way to solve this issue is to visit a mechanic, who can use specialized tools to diagnose the issue, including an onboard diagnostics (OBD-II) scanner which will allow them to read the fault codes and figure out what's going on. Manufacturers include this warning light for when the issue is a bit too specific or complex for the average driver to diagnose and repair themselves. [2] X Research source Call for a tow, if possible. If not, drive very slowly along the shoulder with your hazard lights on and head to the nearest mechanic."

      "title": "This symbol is a general warning that indicates a mechanical problem.",
      "content": "This symbol is a general warning that indicates a mechanical problem. Unfortunately, the symbol doesn’t indicate any specific problem—rather, it’s a catch-all warning that just tells you something is wrong with your car. You’ll likely have to visit a mechanic to find out exactly what. That said, it may be accompanied by other warning lights that give more information. [3] X Research source A yellow triangle often means the vehicle is due for service. A red triangle often means the vehicle needs urgent service. The problems indicated by this light vary by make and model of your car, and in truth the problem could be anything, but some users report that the light commonly signals things like low fluids (of any sort), engine malfunctions, battery failure, or faulty safety systems. This symbol is sometimes called a “master warning light” or “check control” light."

      "content": "Check your owner’s manual for more information. This symbol mostly just means that there’s a problem with your car that can’t be communicated by other lights or warnings, but which problems it indicates can vary by make and model. Take out your owner’s manual and look for “Warning lights,” “Master warning light,” or “Dashboard warnings,” and read the relevant section to learn more. [4] X Research source Your owner’s manual may specify certain problems indicated by your car’s specific master warning light."

      "title": "Look for other warning lights for clues.",
      "content": "Look for other warning lights for clues. Sometimes, this symbol may show up alongside other warning lights, which can give you a hint as to what the problem is. For example, if the “Check Engine” light is also on, you may have a mechanical issue with the engine, and the master warning light is telling you it’s especially serious. [5] X Research source Other times, this light may come on when other lights don’t give enough information. For example, if the master warning light is on, but the engine oil warning light isn't, the problem may not be your engine’s oil, but something else."

You might also drive forward slowly to monitor the engine as it accelerates. Anything out of the ordinary may be a valuable clue you can pass on to your mechanic. [6] X Research source Here are some common noises and what they may mean: Whining : This often means there’s an issue with your power steering, like low fluid, if it whines while turning. It may also indicate a damaged transmission if it whines while accelerating, or an oil issue if it whines while idling. [7] X Research source Rattling : This may indicate damaged suspension, broken belts or engine pistons, or a bad alternator or catalytic convertor. Ticking: This often indicates damaged lifters, which help raise and lower engine pistons, or a damaged accessory component. [8] X Research source Knocking: This often indicates damaged engine pistons."

      "content": "Check engine This light resembles a car engine (vaguely rectangular, but with lots of added curves and corners), and indicates that something is wrong with the car’s engine. It’s only a little more specific than the master warning light, but does indicate a fairly serious problem with the engine that should be addressed sooner rather than later. [9] X Research source If you see this light, avoid driving your car unless it’s to the mechanic. Avoid driving at all if the car is making noises like whining, banging, or ticking, or is handling unusually, like if the steering wheel is hard to turn, or turns loosely."

It means that your car is running only on battery power (if the engine is off), or that your battery is faulty or not connected properly (while your engine is on). In either case, you’re draining your battery, and you won’t be able to start your car with a dead battery.

It’s sometimes caused by low transmission fluid levels, heavy wear on the transmission, or improper towing. In any case, it’s best to see a mechanic. [12] X Research source Check your transmission fluid and if needed, change it or add more . If the problem persists, consult a mechanic."

It’s usually only found on newer cars, and means one of your tires has low pressure. It’s not super urgent, but it’s best to fill your tires with air or get them checked out or replaced sooner rather than later, or your gas mileage could suffer. [14] X Research source Stop by a gas station and add air to your tires . If the problem persists, consider getting new tires, or having your wheels examined by a mechanic."

Brakes are of utmost importance, so have this issue checked by a mechanic ASAP. [15] X Research source The circle may also have the letters “ABS” inside, meaning the fault is with the ABS system, specifically."

It means that your car is experiencing poor traction or handling, probably due to inclement weather like wet or icy roads. It’s not a mechanical problem, per se, but it does mean you should drive slowly and with caution. [16] X Research source That said, if the symbol is lit up even on dry, paved roads, the detection system itself may be faulty. See a mechanic immediately."
