      "content": "Begin the actual letter with a polite greeting followed by the proper name of the recipient. For example, you may say, \"Dear Mr. Williams,\" or \"To Ms. Mayer.\" If you are not sure who the letter should be officially addressed to, use the standard, \"To Whom It May Concern.\" It's important to keep your greetings businesslike and official.

For example, you may start this portion of the income letter by saying, \"I am self-employed as a freelance photographer. I have been in this line of work for the past 12 years, and self-employed for the past 6 years. Do not embellish your income or give incorrect information in this section.

      "content": "Finish this section by summarizing your total income and suggesting how it will be sustained or increase in the future. The suggestions for how it will change should be based in fact, for instance trends over time in changes to your income. Do not simply state your hopes for future income. Here is an example of what this could look like: \"My current employment income is approximately $45,000 annually, and my pension payment is $600 per month. As my business income has increased by an average of 5 percent each year, I can expect to be able to maintain this growth in the foreseeable future. As well, my pension payments are scheduled to continue for the next 15 years.\""
