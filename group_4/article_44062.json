      "title": "The more “things you do” the more the algorithm likes you.",
      "content": "The more “things you do” the more the algorithm likes you. Tinder uses an Elo rating system, (the same method used to determine skill in chess), and the higher your Elo score, the more often you’ll pop up in other people’s feeds. While some of your score is outside of your control, you can increase it by remaining active on the app and actively engaging with others in the right way. [1] X Research source This includes: Changing your profile bio regularly to show you’re active. Messaging people daily to confirm you actually engage with your matches . Opening the app every day to swipe a few times. Using your free daily “super” like (or 5 if you pay for Tinder Gold )."

      "title": "Mindlessly swiping right actually ruins your odds of success.",
      "content": "Mindlessly swiping right actually ruins your odds of success. Tinder penalizes your profile when other people don’t swipe right on you. You’re not going to be everyone’s cup of tea (no one is!), so as you inevitably rack up some left swipes, it’ll start to hurt your standings in the algorithm’s eyes. On top of that, Tinder will lower the quality of your matches if you always swipe right, since it knows you’ll take anyone. This is also just not a winning strategy for finding love. You’re better off looking at each profile thoughtfully so that you aren’t influenced by their initial message. [2] X Research source If you wouldn’t be willing to get coffee with someone just based on their profile, swipe left and move on. You gain nothing by wasting someone’s time and it hurts your Elo score to always swipe right."

      "title": "Cut back on age and location filters to maximize your number of matches.",
      "content": "Cut back on age and location filters to maximize your number of matches . Turn your age and location filters off. Even if you don’t want to date someone older than you or someone who is super far away, they might want to date you. In fact, they may want to date you more than people closer to you in age and location, and the more swipes you get, the more actual matches you’ll get. [3] X Research source If you don’t feel comfortable opening up the filters, that’s totally reasonable. You should feel safe and comfortable when you open the app and look at your matches. If you happen to be pan or bisexual, turn your gender preferences off, too. Yes, we know you’ll get nearly 3x more men, but it helps your Elo score. Remember, even if you don’t want to date people who swipe right on you, the fact that they’re swiping right tells Tinder that your Elo score needs to be higher."

      "content": "You just appear more authentic and human when you link accounts. Put your Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and/or Spotify accounts in your profile. There’s no question that Tinder has a catfishing and bot problem, so providing evidence you’re a real person is a big green flag. On top of that, it’ll make it easier for matches to get a hold of you if they’re interested. [4] X Research source This won’t influence how Tinder treats your profile, but it will be a big sign that you’re legit for potential matches."

      "content": "The photos you choose are the big part of how successful you are. Tinder photography is an art, but there are a few really strong suggestions that work for most people. First, shoot vertically, since most people use Tinder on their phone. Second, include photos of you smiling to give people a warm impression. [5] X Research source Here are some other key tips when it comes to choosing photos (and remember, use a variety for best results!). Avoid hats or sunglasses. If you’re a guy, skip the photo of you holding a fish (it’s a bit of a meme online). Use at least one full-body photo just to show what you look like. Include one (but only one!) group photo of you having fun with your friends. This will show you’re a blast to hang out with. Throw in one “conversation piece” photo. It could be you dressed in a costume or visiting a unique location. This will give people something to comment on."

Show the photos you choose to your closest friends and ask them what they think (ask friends of the opposite sex if you’re heterosexual). They’ll give you feedback and let you know which photos need some replacing or editing. [6] X Research source You might also: Share your photos on Photofeeler . This is a free service where people anonymously rank and comment on Tinder photos to give fellow singles some advice. Post your profile to r/Tinder on Reddit and ask for help. The folks over on the Tinder subreddit will give you pointers."

Instead, make it a key feature. Not only does this shout confidence, but it gives people something to lead with when they message you. The more messages you get, the better your Elo score! [9] X Research source For example: Are you a chef? Take a selfie in your chef’s hat and say something like, “I can make dinner for two, but I’m tired of eating both.” Are you on the older side and starting to gray? You might say something like, “To men under 30: I’m hot and have my driver’s license. To men over 30: I’m a doctor with a 401k.” If your name is Marco, make a joke about how you’ve been scarred by pool games as a child. If your name is Melody, crack wise about being haunted by the fact that you can’t sing."

Make the opener a breeze for your matches by giving them something concrete to work with. [10] X Research source For example, you could say: “If you’re into hiking, give me a review of the last trail you hiked.” “Tell me your favorite book and I’ll talk your ear off!” “If your favorite mob movie isn’t Goodfellas, tell me why and we can fight about it 😁” “Share your favorite childhood story with me and you’ll win me over in an instant.”"

Would definitely bring to a midnight screening of a new Marvel movie.” – Robert Downey Junior “I would marry them myself if I weren’t already in an entanglement.” – Jada Pinkett Smith “He’s a very sweet boy, but I don’t understand why you’re asking me to review you.” – My math teacher “Please date them.

If you just aren’t seeing any results, try mixing it up and taking your profile in a fresh direction to throw people off their feet. [12] X Research source You might: Make your first photo a screenshot of a note explaining that only shallow people judge based on looks exclusively. This will force people to look closely at your bio! You could make each of your photos a jokey PowerPoint presentation about why you’re super dateable. Go super ironic. Take photos of you draped in costume jewelry and write up a hilarious satirical bio about how you’re a wealthy Nigerian prince. Take a bunch of photos of you with your cat or dog and then pretend in the bio that you’re actually the animal in all of the photos."
