Similarly, it’s best not to try treating a new lump or an area of swelling until you’ve had it checked by a doctor.

Before taking a biopsy, your doctor will numb the area around the lipoma. Then, they’ll use a thin needle to take a small sample from the lump. Finally, they’ll examine the sample under a microscope to make sure it’s a lipoma. X-ray, MRI, and CT scans are all imaging tests. In most cases, your doctor will just do one of them. An X-ray can show a shadow where the lipoma is located, while an MRI and CT scan can show the lipoma in more detail. [14] X Research source"
