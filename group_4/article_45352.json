      "title": "Boxers fit quite loosely and are usually made of breathable cotton.",
      "content": "Boxers fit quite loosely and are usually made of breathable cotton. They’re called “boxers” because they’re short and loose around the thigh, similar to the shorts a boxer would wear. The elastic waistband sits on the hips or slightly above the waistline and the shorts extend to the upper thigh. Most boxers have a button fly in front. [1] X Research source Best for: Loose trousers (like suit pants or high waisted pants), guys with thin legs and narrow hips Pros: Comfortable, breathable, plenty of room for your package, can be worn in front of others modestly Cons: No testicular support, can bunch up under tight clothes, considered somewhat old-fashioned Shop boxers on Amazon ."

      "title": "Briefs are legless, comfortable, support your pouch, and cover your rear.",
      "content": "Briefs are legless, comfortable, support your pouch, and cover your rear. Briefs are usually made of stretch cotton or modal to provide a snug, comfortable fit and definition. The leg holes curve upward to show off your entire upper thigh (a plus if you’ve been hitting leg day at the gym!) while a Y-front pouch supports your genitals and provides easy access (modern styles may not have an opening at all, though). There’s plenty of fabric to cover your rear in the behind, although if you’re extra gifted in the glute department, you may not get full coverage. [2] X Research source Best for: Tight pants, guys with big thighs, guys who workout or move frequently Pros: Practical, comfortable, classic look, supportive, no bunching or riding up Cons: Too restrictive for some guys, risk of chafing (no leg coverage) Shop briefs on Amazon ."

      "title": "Boxer briefs combine elements of boxers and briefs and are popular with most guys.",
      "content": "Boxer briefs combine elements of boxers and briefs and are popular with most guys. Like boxers, the waistband of boxer briefs sits on the hips or just above and the legs extend to the mid-top of the thighs. However, the fabric is usually a stretchy mix of cotton and elastane (like briefs) and more fitted to the thighs and behind than boxers to offer more definition. Like briefs, they offer a supportive pouch in front and full coverage in the rear. [3] X Research source Best for: Tall or large men with large rears, most pant styles and cuts Pros: Supportive front pouch, leg coverage reduces chafing, breathable, versatile style Cons: Not as breathable as briefs, may ride up over the thigh if too tight Shop boxer briefs on Amazon ."

      "title": "Trunks are like a slightly more revealing version of boxer briefs.",
      "content": "Trunks are like a slightly more revealing version of boxer briefs. They’re made from stretch fabric or modal and resemble boxer briefs, but with a more snug fit, a shorter leg, and a waistband that sits a bit lower on the hips. The smaller trunks still provide full coverage in the rear and also come with a supportive pouch for your front. [4] X Research source Best for: Tall and slim guys, skinny or tight trousers Pros: Supportive, fits under tight pants, freedom of movement Cons: May ride up if too tight, risk of chafing from short legs, restrictive on big thighs Shop trunks on Amazon ."

      "content": "Thongs have support in front and minimal fabric in the rear for a semi-commando feel. Thongs are popular partly for their support and practicality, and partly for their racy appearance (picture a G-string). A stretchy, supportive pouch in front holds everything in place and is connected to a thin waist band that sits low on the hips. In the rear, only a thin strip of fabric offers coverage over the top-center of your behind. Little is left to the imagination here, but that’s sometimes the point). [5] X Research source Best for: Tight pants, guys who want to show off their body, aesthetic preferences Pros: Supportive, no visible underwear lines, no bunching or riding up Cons: Chafing, the string in the rear may be uncomfortable at first Shop thongs on Amazon ."

      "content": "Jockstraps provide maximum support for high-impact athletics and activities. The jockstrap appeared in the 1800s to help men remain comfortable and protected while they rode on newly invented bicycle seats. [6] X Research source A slightly stretchy, supportive pouch in front is connected to a low-sitting waistband by just 2 strings that run through your legs and up your bum, meaning only your front is covered. However, the support is unmatched and ensures your private bits stay in place no matter what you’re doing. [7] X Research source Best for: Intense sports or activities, guys who like to show skin, aesthetic preferences Pros: Very supportive, breathable, no riding up or bunching Cons: Revealing, not acceptable to wear in front of others, not comfortable long-term Shop jockstraps on Amazon ."

      "title": "Several non-traditional styles of men’s underwear exist for special circumstances.",
      "content": "Several non-traditional styles of men’s underwear exist for special circumstances. While you definitely won’t need to wear these kinds of underwear everyday, knowing about them can come in handy for cold weather, certain athletic activities, or just choosing something crazy to wear on the beach: Thermal underwear (long underwear or long Johns): These underwear look like leggings and are made of a thin, warm material to add extra insulation for cold weather. They’re worn as a base layer underneath snow pants, ski pants, or other loose pants. [8] X Research source Tights : Certain athletes (like dancers, skaters, and some runners or football players) wear athletic tights for compression and freedom of movement. Some types can be worn as underwear, while others can be layered over other underwear. Dance belt : A dance belt is like a specialized jockstrap that holds your anatomy up and against the lower abdomen without restricting your movement. They’re most often worn by male dancers. [9] X Research source Padded underwear or shapewear: Some underwear comes with extra padding or pouches in the front and/or back to enhance the size and shape of your rear and…other anatomy. These may look like boxer briefs with extra padding in the butt and/or crotch. C-string : This risqué underwear features a front pouch framed by wire that’s connected to a long, curved wire that bends between your legs and up your crack, conforming to the shape of your body (and making a “C” shape). It shows zero visible lines and is very revealing. [10] X Research source Mankini : If you’ve seen the movie Borat , you’ve seen a mankini. It features a V-shaped bikini bottom with long straps that go over the shoulders to hold everything in place. They’re usually only worn for a joke, but you do you! [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose underwear that matches your lifestyle and activity level. Consider your daily routine when choosing what underwear to buy —are you seated most of the day, or are you up on your foot and moving? Do you work out frequently? Are you someone who prefers loose-fitting pants, or are tighter styles more your speed? [12] X Research source If you’re typically up on your feet all day, for example, you may want something supportive that prevents chafing, like boxer briefs. Or, if you frequently work from home in sweatpants, a comfortable pair of boxers might be all you need."

      "title": "Consider your body shape and size.",
      "content": "Consider your body shape and size. Everyone’s built differently, so think about what works for your build. If you have built thighs, you may like briefs to show them off and prevent the fabric from riding up over your quads. Or, if you have lots to cover and support, you may need boxer briefs or trunks to fully cover your rear and provide a pouch for the front. Ultimately, it comes down to what feels comfortable and looks good to you. [13] X Research source"

      "title": "Pick a style that lets your front bits breathe.",
      "content": "Pick a style that lets your front bits breathe. Most underwear brands are designed to be breathable and supportive these days, but their effectiveness depends on the exact fabric, fit, and needs of the wearer. For example, if you always tend to sweat and overheat down there no matter what, a loose and breezy pair of boxers may do the trick. Or, if odor and sweating aren’t typically issues for you, a slightly less breathable cut like boxer briefs or trunks could be just fine. Look for underwear in breathable natural materials like cotton, linen, or silk, or synthetics like modal, cupro, or tencel. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t be afraid to experiment and try on different styles.",
      "content": "Don’t be afraid to experiment and try on different styles. There could be several different styles of underwear you enjoy, but you won’t know until you try! Take a chance on a new pair and pay attention to how comfortable they feel throughout the day, if they bunch or ride up in certain places, or if you like how they look on you or not. It may take a little trial and error to find the perfect pair, but it’s well worth it."

      "title": "Why are there different types of men’s underwear?",
      "content": "Why are there different types of men’s underwear? Every guy has different preferences when it comes to support, comfort, or aesthetics, and different underwear styles address those needs. For example, someone who doesn’t need support and hates the feeling of tight clothes may prefer boxers, whereas someone who needs the lift and likes a more snug fit might prefer boxer briefs. The time of year may be a factor too. For example, loose boxers may keep you cool and prevent chafing in the summer, while trunks or briefs may feel more comfortable with your more fitted winter pants."

      "title": "Which underwear looks the most masculine?",
      "content": "Which underwear looks the most masculine? Masculinity is pretty subjective, but generally, underwear in the “classic” men’s cuts (boxers, boxer briefs, briefs) in dark or neutral colors are considered masculine. Thongs and trendier cuts like trunks skew more playful, especially in brighter colors or patterns."

      "title": "What’s the best color for men’s underwear?",
      "content": "What’s the best color for men’s underwear? Neutral, classic colors like white, black, gray, and most shades of blue (including navy) are flattering and look good on most underwear types and skin colors. Although white is clean and classic, it has a tendency to gray over time and may look old-fashioned compared to other popular colors. Bright colors, like neon green or red, and bold patterns make more of a statement about your personal style. They’re only going to be seen by you and the people you take your pants off for, though—choose whatever you like! If you’re wearing thin or light-colored pants with underwear that contrasts a lot with your skintone, the underwear may show through a bit. Choose a gray or neutral color similar to your skin tone to prevent this. [15] X Research source"

      "title": "What underwear is best for testicle health?",
      "content": "What underwear is best for testicle health? In terms of sperm count, men who self-reported that they wear boxers most frequently had a higher sperm concentration and overall count compared to men who regularly wore other underwear styles. Boxer wearers also had lower levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which can affect sperm count in high levels. [16] X Research source However, studies on how underwear affects sperm count or general testicular health are few and somewhat inconsistent. It’s also worth mentioning that wearing non-boxers is unlikely to have a large impact (if any at all) on most healthy guys."

      "title": "What makes underwear high quality?",
      "content": "What makes underwear high quality? If you’re not sure whether the underwear you’re thinking about buying is a good deal, consider these features when comparing pairs: [17] X Research source The waistband: Is it comfortable, appropriately firm or tight, and thick enough to meet your support needs? The pouch: Does the size and shape feel comfortable? Are there seams or flys that you like or dislike? The leg openings: Do you prefer the legs snug or loose? Is chafing a concern for you? The seams: Are the seams smooth and flat so they won’t rub or irritate you? The fly: Do you want a fly on your underwear? If so, do you prefer vertical or horizontal? The fabric: Is the material durable, breathable, and moisture-wicking?"

      "content": "What is the best type of underwear for guys? Ultimately, the best underwear depends on the individual guy and what feels and looks good to them. As long as your underwear feels comfortable, is made of a breathable material, supports you the right way, and fits your style preferences, then there’s no right or wrong answer!
