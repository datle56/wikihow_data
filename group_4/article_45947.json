      "title": "Put citrus peels in your garbage disposal.",
      "content": "Put citrus peels in your garbage disposal. You put all kinds of food in your garbage disposal, so it is bound to stink on occasion. Take your scrap peels from lemons and oranges and grind them up in the garbage disposal. Their scent will release, which reduces the foul odor and freshens up the air. The acid of the peels also cleans the blades. Remember that most garbage disposals work best if you run water while the disposal is running. To increase the effect, save the peels from five or more pieces of citrus so you have plenty to put down the disposal at one time, or perform this on a weekly basis."

      "content": "Make air fresheners with peels and spices. Take a square of fabric about six inches by six inches (or about 15 cm on each side) and set some dried lemon or orange peels in the middle. Add cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, or cardamom to the pile. Then gather up the corners and tie the square shut with a ribbon. Set the bundle in drawers or around the house for a potpourri style air freshener. [5] X Research source Use a thin, breathable fabric that will release the scent. Cotton is best. You could cut a square from an old shirt or other scraps of fabric."

      "content": "Keep cats off furniture or countertops with orange peels. Many cats do not like the scent of fresh oranges, so placing them around spots where you don't want your cats is a safe deterrent. Put them in the cracks of the sofa, around the edges of the kitchen table, or next to other food on the countertop. [6] X Research source Be sure to replace them every couple of days as their potency decreases."

      "title": "Place citrus peels by doors and windows to keep insects out.",
      "content": "Place citrus peels by doors and windows to keep insects out. The oils in citrus peels are toxic to the fungus that ants feed on, so ants won't go near citrus peels. Place them by doorways, on window seals, or around cracks in the floor. You'll want to replace the peels every day or two. This trick also works to keep spiders, roaches, and fleas out. [7] X Research source If you already have a lot of bugs in your house, you may need to take more drastic measures, such as placing traps, using a bug bomb, or calling an exterminator."
