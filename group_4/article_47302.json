Gently rub the area with a soft baby brush or terry cloth towel and use water to rinse away the oil. [9] X Research source You can use these natural treatments on your newborn. Just avoid using the baby shampoo until they're one month old. Don't worry if the cradle cap doesn't clear up right away. Cradle cap will go away on its own within several months. If it spreads to other areas or gets worse, ask your baby's doctor about medicated shampoos."

      "content": "Comb and detangle the baby's hair. If your newborn has a lot of hair, you'll need to comb it to prevent tangles and knots. Take a wide-tooth comb or soft baby brush and start by combing the ends of the baby's hair. Work your way up towards the roots of the hair so you're not pulling on it. [10] X Research source Begin combing your newborn's hair as soon as they need it. Some babies have so little hair that it takes months before there's enough to even brush."

      "content": "Moisturize your baby's hair once a week. Rub 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of a mild oil between your fingertips. Run your fingertips through the baby's clean hair and massage their scalp. Leave the oil in your baby's hair to keep it soft and prevent frizzing. This is especially important if your baby's hair type is dry or curly. [11] X Research source You can moisturize your newborn's hair before they're a month old as long as you're using natural oils instead of commercial baby hair moisturizers. Use a mild oil like jojoba, avocado, coconut, or almond oil. Since they can vary greatly in cost and fragrance, choose one according to your preferences."
