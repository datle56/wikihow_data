      "content": "Nose rings can represent sex-positivity. Nose rings are often worn by those who are independent, rebellious, and empowered. Because of this, some people interpret the piercings as a sign of sexual openness and positivity. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Because getting a nose piercing can increase someone’s confidence in their appearance, it can also make them more confident in their sexual expression. While nose rings are not inherently sexual, someone could choose to wear one to make them more comfortable with their sexuality. Septum piercings, or bull nose rings, are sometimes viewed as more sexually provocative because of their association with BDSM, but this isn't super common."

      "content": "Some LGBTQ+ people use nose rings to signal their sexuality. It’s important to note that having a nose ring is not directly linked to your sexuality, but some people choose to embrace the stereotype to show other LGBTQ+ people that they’re also a member of the community. [2] X Research source For example, according to many good-natured jokes on social media, bisexuals often have septum piercings. Some bisexuals therefore choose to wear their nose ring to let others in the LGBTQ+ community know their sexuality, but having a septum piercing does not mean someone is bisexual. In the past, it was often believed if a man got the left side of his nose pierced, he was gay, and if he got the right side pierced, he was straight. There's no authoritative source behind this belief, and anyone of any sexuality can get whatever piercing they choose. Remember, never make assumptions about someone’s identity based on their appearance. The way someone dresses is a way of expressing themselves and does not have an inherent meaning."
