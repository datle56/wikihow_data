If you’ve just graduated from high school and have no experience yet, think about how you can present the kinds of activities you’ve done in school as potential parallels to your proposed work in a jewelry store. If you sold concessions at school events, that’s retail experience. If you were the treasurer for a club or activity group, you successfully budgeted and kept track of the group’s money -- great experience for working in a store. If you were part of a team or on the staff of a student publication, you might have helped order supplies. This could translate into experience ordering for the store."
