Sales revenue includes all revenue earned from the sale of goods and services, regardless of whether or not the cash has been collected. List sales revenue for the period you selected. For example, say that you sold 10,000 units of inventory for $5 USD a piece. You would record sales revenue of $50,000 USD, even if your customers haven't all paid you yet. List all the revenue you generated during the period you're reporting on. This could include sales revenue, rental income, interest income, or any other sources of revenue your business generates. Make sure to Write Revenue and then on the next line indent and list out your revenues in order. Write your numbers directly to the right parallel to the revenues written out.

If you're a reseller, the cost of goods sold is typically the price that you paid to purchase the inventory. If your business sells physical products, you'll need to calculate the cost of goods sold. This includes the cost of materials, labor, and any other costs directly related to producing and delivering your products. For a basic income statement, the main things you will write out would be revenue, and expenses, and subtracting the total two to get your net income.
