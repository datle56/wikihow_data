      "content": "Select a style that fits with your needs. If you’re mainly going to wear the duster to work, you’ll want a more professional-looking duster jacket. Opt for a more fun, colorful shawl duster if you’re looking for something to wear at the beach. Decide the purpose of your duster so that you can narrow down your choices. If you want to wear your duster around the house or while you’re doing errands, a sweater duster is a great choice. A sleeveless duster is a good option for warmer days."

      "content": "Choose a material appropriate for the season. You’re going to want a thicker, warmer fabric for colder weather than you would during warm spring or summer months. Select dusters made of wool or other warm materials if you’re looking for a warm jacket. For warmer seasons, silk and light knits are great fabric options. Polyester and fur are other good warm options, while linen and cotton are great for warmer weather."

      "content": "Make sure the duster isn’t too long when you try it on. If the duster is trailing on the ground when you’re wearing it, it’s too long and you either need to get it hemmed or look for a shorter one. Ideally, the duster should reach just below your knee, but it can be longer as long as it isn’t touching the ground. Wearing heels will help longer dusters seem shorter."

      "content": "Look for dusters that are slightly fitted around the waistline. This will help accentuate your figure and show off curves.

If you’re not sure whether a duster is fitted or not, try it on to see if it emphasizes your body’s outline."
