      "content": "Use water shoes. If you have balance issues, using water shoes can help. You can find them at most large shoe stores or sporting good stores. Look for ones that have good traction, and make sure they fit comfortably. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Water shoes, as their name implies, are shoes designed to be worn in the water. They let water in and dry out more readily when you get out. In addition, they have soles with traction, which means you'll have a better grip on the floor of the pool."

      "content": "Walk across the pool. Start in the shallow end. It doesn't matter how shallow the shallow end is. Just start on that end and work your way to slightly deeper water, going to about mid-chest. Water walking is just as it sounds. You spend time walking back and forth across the pool, just as you do on land. [3] X Research source Walking is really good for back pain, but unfortunately, you can sometimes get fatigued or uncomfortable quickly. Water walking can allow you to comfortably exercise for longer periods. [4] X Expert Source Karen Litzy, PT, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 27 August 2020.

      "title": "Keep your back straight.",
      "content": "Keep your back straight. You want to have straight posture as you do this movement. In addition, keep your core muscles tight so you don't lean to one side or forward. One reason this exercise works well for back pain is it lets you stay upright while still building strength in your back. However, bending forward or to the side can increase back pain if you're not careful."

      "title": "Add weights or other equipment.",
      "content": "Add weights or other equipment. If you find the workout too easy, you can add equipment to make it a bit harder. For instance, you can use webs on your hands to add resistance as you move through the water. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You can also add a weighted belt. Another option is ankle weights. If you're walking in deeper water, try holding onto a pool noodle or board, or wear a life jacket. [8] X Expert Source Karen Litzy, PT, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 27 August 2020. If you have trouble staying upright, you can use a flotation belt instead, which will keep you where you need to be."

[9] X Research source You can also move to the deep end. If you can't swim, put on a life vest or other flotation device. To walk in deep water, you simply move your arms and legs as if you were walking to propel you forward. You can also use a water noodle to help you stay afloat. Simply straddle it as you would a horse, pulling it slightly higher in the back. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

Chest-deep works well for this exercise. Have your right leg nearest the wall. Put your weight on that leg alone, bending at the knee. Lift your left leg up, bending at the knee. Bring it up as high as it will go. Your ultimate goal is to bring it to your chest. Repeat five times for each leg."

Your left leg should stay stable on the floor. [11] X Research source Don't turn your ankle. Just lift your leg as high as it will go without turning. Lift that leg eight to 10 times or until you get tired, then move to the other leg. Try to exhale as you bring your leg up and inhale as you bring it down."

      "content": "Bicycle your way to stronger abs. Bicycling in the pool can strengthen your abs, which in turn can help lower back pain. Start with your elbows on the side of the pool, facing outward. You need to be deep enough that you can move your feet without hitting the floor. With your legs slightly out in front of you, rotate them in the water as if you're riding a bike. In other words, bring one knee up, and rotate the foot forward in a circular motion that moves to the back. At the same time, your other foot should be on the other side of the circle you're making, rotating front and back as well. You can also use this motion to move through the water. Simply use your arms as well, and let your feet move you. You can use a noodle to help keep you afloat."

You'll need at least 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) in front of you to work. Take a large step forward on your right leg. Bend your left knee down, almost touching the floor of the pool. Your right thigh should be parallel to the floor, and your knee should be at a 90-degree angle. Keep moving forward, alternating legs."
