      "title": "Go cold turkey.",
      "content": "Go cold turkey . This is the most common, and seemingly the easiest, method for quitting smoking because it requires no outside aid. You simply stop smoking and commit yourself to being smoke-free. While those who quit abruptly are more successful than those who quit gradually, quitting without the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is rarely successful — only three to five percent of people who quit cold turkey stick with it. [1] X Research source If you choose to go without NRT, the success of going cold turkey will depend entirely on your willpower. Those who are able to quit cold turkey may have a genetic advantage — 20 percent of people may have a genetic mutation that reduces the pleasurable effects of nicotine. [2] X Research source To increase your chances of success when quitting cold turkey, try to take up new activities to replace smoking (particularly something that will occupy your hands or mouth, like knitting or chewing sugarless gum); avoid situations and people that you associate with smoking; call a friend or a quitting hotline (such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW); set goals and reward yourself. [3] X Research source Consider having a backup strategy in case you are unable to go cold turkey. This is the easiest strategy to implement, but the most difficult to carry out successfully."

      "title": "Try nicotine replacement therapy.",
      "content": "Try nicotine replacement therapy. NRT is one of the most successful tools for treating smoking addiction, with a 20% success rate. By chewing gums, eating lozenges, or wearing patches, you get the nicotine their bodies crave while gradually lowering the dosage, eventually weaning them off nicotine. In the process, you will move away from addictive behavior and towards healthy activities. [4] X Research source You will be more likely to quit if you stop smoking at once and then begin using NRTs as opposed to gradually smoking fewer cigarettes and using NRTs. In one study, 22% of abrupt smokers remained abstinent after six months and only 15.5% of smokers who gradually cut back over two weeks remained abstinent after six months. Nicotine gum, patches, lozenges are often available over-the-counter and can be found at your local drug store. This strategy requires some financial investment for the purchasing of gum, patches, or lozenges. Nicotine replacement therapy is less successful for people whose metabolisms quickly process nicotine. Chat with your physician about your metabolism and the nicotine replacement therapy.
