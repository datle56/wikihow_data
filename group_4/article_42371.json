But, there are still steps you need to take to make sure you're offering the litter box as the best place to use the bathroom. Place the box in a quiet spot where the cat won’t be bothered by people, dogs, or loud noises. To keep the litter box clean, make sure you scoop the litter daily, and clean the box weekly. You should also replace or refresh the litter at least once a week. [3] X Research source Litter Box Preference in Domestic cats: Covered Versus Uncovered. E.K. Grigg, et al. Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery April 2013 vol. 15 no. 4 280-284 Provide enough litter boxes for more than one cat. A good rule of thumb is to have one box for each cat, plus one more. For example, if you have two cats, you need three litter boxes in different areas of the home. One cat might try to intimidate a less dominant cat away from using a single box."

Switching from a clay litter to a clumping litter or vice versa might upset the cat and cause them to avoid using the litter box. Don’t use heavily scented litters for the same reason."

Your cat will need one or two scratching posts to keep them from scratching up furniture, woodwork, and so on. By providing a post, you allow the cat to indulge in normal, healthy behavior.

With time and patience, you can teach your cat to stay away from your protected areas. You can also use a rattle can (an empty soda can filled with a few pebbles and the opening taped over).

      "content": "Decide what type of food to feed your cat. Cat food comes in a vast array of types: dry food, semi-moist, and canned are the common types. Dry food is easily and efficiently stored, but cats go wild for the taste of semi-moist and canned foods. The latter types can add more fluid to the cat’s diet than dry foods. In general, food type comes down to owner preference. Occasionally, a cat with a medical condition might need one type over another. Consult your veterinarian for recommendations."

Veronique Legrand-Defretin (1994). Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 53, pp 15-24. doi:10.1079/PNS19940004. Ask your vet for suggestions about a good quality food. Cheaper products may not provide enough nutrition to keep your cat happy and healthy. Look for cat foods that list large amounts of animal meat like beef, chicken, turkey, or fish. [10] X Research source Also look for important amino acids like taurine and arginine and fatty acids like arachidonic and linoleic acid. [11] X Research source Avoid feeding your cat human foods unless you have cleared the food with your veterinarian. Some human foods can make a cat severely sick or are even toxic to cats (e.g., chocolate)."

      "content": "Brush your cat depending on their coat needs. You may think that because cats seem to groom themselves, you don't need to brush them. But you do need to brush long-hair cats several times a week and short-hair cats weekly. This will help reduce shedding in your home and also help the cat avoid the dreaded hairballs. For cats that tend to shed (long-haired ones especially), use a comb that has fine strands of metal. This gets deep into the undercoat and eliminates shedding."

Just like any member of the family, a cat needs regular medical visits. Unlike human children, cats can't let us know when they're not feeling well. They rely on their humans to take them to a veterinarian for regular medical examinations to keep them healthy. It is important that a cat sees a vet at least once a year, for a physical check-up: teeth, ears, eyes, heart, booster vaccinations, and deflea/deworm treatments. All cat owners should consider getting their pet vaccinated against the following: feline infectious enteritis (FIE), cat ‘flu and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). All can kill cats if they become infected and so it is important to protect your pet. You may also find that a cattery will not accept your pet, should you need their services, without proof of these and potentially other vaccinations. Your vet can advise exactly what vaccinations are required for your pet. If you are at all concerned about your cat’s health or behaviour you should see your vet as soon as possible. Older cats might need to see a veterinarian twice yearly for optimal health."

      "title": "Visit the vet more frequently for kittens.",
      "content": "Visit the vet more frequently for kittens. Just like human babies, kittens need to see the vet more often than adult cats. Starting at around 8 weeks of age, they'll need 2-3 visits to have their vaccination series and worm treatments. At minimum, this includes the feline distemper vaccine and a rabies vaccine. Your vet will discuss the benefits of optional vaccinations as well. Ask about the risks of diseases like feline leukemia and make an informed decision about which vaccinations you want. The vet will also check the kitten for fleas and ear mites, and treat them if needed. Make sure the kitten gets worm treatment. Most kittens have roundworms that can stunt growth and potentially be transmitted to humans."

      "content": "Get your cat spayed or neutered (or \"fixed\"). Spaying a female cat or neutering a male cat has many positive benefits. It will cut down on unwanted behaviors like roaming and the tendency to spray urine. Physically, it protects against unwanted pregnancies and diseases like pyometra, and it reduces the risk of testicular, uterine, and ovarian cancer. The most important thing, though, is that it cuts down on the number of unwanted kittens in the world! Ask your vet for a recommendation on when to get kittens spayed or neutered. In general, vets recommend a range from 2-6 months."

      "title": "Get the cat used to tooth brushing.",
      "content": "Get the cat used to tooth brushing. Cats can and do suffer from dental disease. To brush your cat's teeth, you need a soft-bristled toothbrush and veterinary toothpaste. Never use human toothpaste — too much fluoride can upset your cat's stomach, and with the high fluoride concentration in human toothpaste, too much could be toxic. Start by offering them a taste of the veterinary toothpaste. The next time, let them taste the toothpaste, and then run your finger along the gums of the upper teeth. Repeat the process with the toothbrush. Get the bristles of the brush along the gum line of the upper back teeth and angle slightly up, so the bristles get under the gum line. Work from back to front, making small circles along the gum lines. It should take you less than 30 seconds to brush your pet's teeth. Do not try to brush the entire mouth at first. If they only let you brush the outside of their upper teeth, it's better than nothing. You're still addressing the most important area of dental disease prevention."

      "title": "Schedule professional tooth cleaning if needed.",
      "content": "Schedule professional tooth cleaning if needed. Even with the best tooth brushing, some cats may still need an occasional professional cleaning. While brushing reduces the plaque and buildup on the visible surfaces of the teeth it cannot get to the buildup just under the gum line. A professional cleaning also gives the vet a chance to fully examine your cat's mouth under sedation. Some signs of dental disease include: Bad breath Loose teeth Discolored teeth or teeth covered in tartar Sensitivity or pain in the mouth Bleeding Drooling a lot or dropping food while trying to eat Loss of appetite or weight loss"

Use cat toys, talking, and grooming as chances to spend time together. Laser pointers, balls, play mice, and feather toys are also good ways to engage your cat in play. Here's a game you can play with your cat: Try hiding a treat somewhere and using a laser pointer to guide you cat to the treat. Make the laser pointer move in a way that a real mice would move, try pointing it in small places and under hiding spots. Bring the laser pointer to the treat. This will make the cat feel like its hunting and it will be rewarded in the end!"

[16] X Research source Kittens are adorably tempting, but be honest with yourself about whether you'll be able to match that energy level, and handle that level of responsibility. Shelters are full of loving adult cats who have a much harder time getting adopted. An adult cat will be calmer and quieter than a kitten, but may also have behavioral issues from its early life. Adult cats may also have medical conditions you'll have to address sooner than you would with a kitten. Also, kittens often scratch very painfully; Decide if you want that."

      "content": "Consider medical concerns that may come with a specific cat. If you have your eye on one cat, in particular, ask about its medical history to see if it requires any long-term care. Would you be able to afford this cat's medical needs? Even if the cat is healthy, consider their breed. Purebred cats of different breeds can have their own genetic problems to overcome. For example, flat-faced cats like Persians and Scottish folds often develop breathing issues, and Manx cats are prone to back problems.
