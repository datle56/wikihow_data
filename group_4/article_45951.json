[1] X Research source Pull everything above the comb up into a bun. Check the horizontal part that you made in the mirror to ensure that it is even. Any strands of hair interrupting it may snag on the comb and feel uncomfortable. Ideally, the part should be level with the bottom of your ears. It would be a good idea to brush the loose hair below the comb once again to ensure it is smooth."

      "content": "Insert a 3-clip weft into your hair, just below the part. Find a weft that has 3 clips sewn into it. Snap open the comb-like clips on your weft. Position the weft right over the horizontal part and slide the combs into your hair as close to the roots as possible, and snap them shut. Start with the middle clip first, then do the sides.

Gather everything above the part into a bun, just like before. Insert a 4-clip weft into the roots just below the part. Again, insert the middle clips first, then do the sides. [4] X Research source Some packs will have a short 4-clip weft and a long 4-clip weft. Use the shorter 4-clip weft here."

Insert the longest weft into the roots just below the part, starting with the middle clips and finishing with the outer. [5] X Research source Use a 5-clip weft or a longer 4-clip weft for this. If you don't have either of these clips, skip this step."

Create a horizontal part with your rat-tail comb and bun the rest of your hair, just like before. Insert the final 3-clip weft into the roots, then let down your hair. [6] X Research source If you have whorls, deep splits, or other cowlicks in your crown area, check this weft after inserting it to ensure it isn't visible due to a cowlick."

Once you feel the wefts, slide your fingers into your hair and snap open all the combs on that weft. Gently pull the weft out, then move on to the next. Work your way from top-to-bottom. You will have to feel your way around for this step. Never go to bed while wearing clip-in extensions; otherwise, you may pull out your hair."

Whether you curl the extensions before or after you add them to your hair is up to you. Go with whatever is most comfortable for you. If your extensions are synthetic, check the package to see whether or not they are heat-resistant. If they are not heat-resistant, don't curl them. If they are heat-friendly, curl them using a heat that is appropriate for the product you’re using. This is usually noted on the packaging. [15] X Research source"

Each weft will have 2, 3, 4, or 5 clips sewn into it. Separate your wefts into groups based on how many clips are sewn in. Some groups may only have a single weft, while others may have up to 4 wefts. Knowing how many clips are on each weft is important. Where you place the weft depends on how many clips are sewn into it."

If the extensions are made from real hair, apply a heat protectant product, then use a curling iron or a hair straightener on them, just like you would on your own hair. If they are made from synthetic fibers, read the package to ensure they are heat-resistant, or you risk melting them. Alternatively, you can straighten or curl your hair to match the extensions instead. Just make sure your hair is clean and healthy before installing the extensions to protect against damage and breakage.
