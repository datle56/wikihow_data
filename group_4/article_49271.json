While there are some general standards when it comes to formatting your screenplay, there is also a little wiggle room for creativity as well. Check with the studio you’re writing for to find out how to customize your specific document. Adjust the margins. Click on the Layout tab, then click Margins . Change the page margins to 1\" on the top, bottom, and right, and 1.5\" on the left. [1] X Research source Add page numbers in the top-right corner. Click on the Insert tab, then click Page Number > Top of Page > Plain Number 3 . Click the check box for Different first page , as the first page of the screenplay should not have a number.

      "content": "Consider using style and formatting patterns to format a screenplay. If you’re unhappy with the template layout provided by Word, you can modify the style and formatting of your document to create new formatting patterns. These patterns can be used again if you save them, or you can create a new template based on a document that uses these style and formatting rules. You could think of formatting as creating your template. According to Sargent, you want as much white space on the page as possible—avoid writing lengthy paragraphs and stick to dialogue and descriptions of the scene."

Finally, you could highlight text by bringing up a blinking cursor within the text you’ve written and holding down the shift key and an arrow key to highlight the text you want to format. To highlight text to the left of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the left directional button. To highlight text to the right of the place your cursor is, hold the shift key and the right directional arrow.

Word is powerful software, but it can be more complicated to write a screenplay in Word than screenwriting software like Final Draft. According to Sargent, a lot of people in the film industry use Final Draft to write screenplays. \"I like Final Draft because it's always up to date, and they have great customer service. If something isn't working, you can call them for help, and they will talk you through it on the phone."
