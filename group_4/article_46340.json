      "content": "Click Sign Up on the social network’s home page. Visit the social network’s website that you want to join, and click the button near the top of the site that says Sign Up or Login.

      "content": "Create a unique username if the site requires it. Social networks, like Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram, make you choose a unique username. Try using your full name as your username if you want other people to find you easily and look the most professional. Otherwise, you can make up any creative username you want! [2] X Research source Use the same username across multiple sites if they’re available so people can find you easily on different platforms. If you have a common name like John Smith, there’s a chance that the username JohnSmith is already taken. If that’s the case, try adding numbers or symbols to your username, such as John_Smith12. Websites like LinkedIn and Facebook always use your real name when you create an account, though they do give you the option to add a nickname."

      "content": "Make a strong and secure password . Choose a password that’s 10 characters or longer to make it the most secure. Use uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols in your password so it’s harder for other people to figure out. Avoid using any common words or any personal information since those passwords are easier to break. Use different passwords for each site you’re on to prevent getting all of your accounts hacked. Try using a password-generating app to make long, unique passwords that are difficult to hack. Never share your password with other people."
