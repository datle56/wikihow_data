      "content": "Learn the basics of a hedge fund. Hedge funds are pools of investor money that use a large range of different strategies to both generate returns for investors and manage risk. Hedge funds are typically only available to sophisticated investors with large amounts of assets to invest (often over $1 million). [2] X Research source The term hedge fund comes from the practice of \"hedging\", which is the practice of reducing risk in an asset by taking a position in a related security to offset any downward price movements. These related securities often take the form of derivatives like futures, options, and forward contracts. Essentially, this strategy is intended to protect capital in the event of a negative event that causes an asset to lose value. [3] X Research source Hedge funds often use a wide range of complex strategies to maximize returns like using leverage (or borrowed money), using derivatives to profit from global economic trends, trading currencies, and investing in stock and bonds in markets all around the globe."

      "title": "Distinguish between hedge funds and mutual funds.",
      "content": "Distinguish between hedge funds and mutual funds. Mutual funds and hedge funds are similar in that they are both pools of money managed by a fund manager. Other than this, however, there are several key differences. These differences are important to consider when starting one. [4] X Research source Firstly, hedge funds are not as regulated as mutual funds, and so they can invest in a more diverse and risky range of securities, as well as use strategies that mutual funds cannot use. Hedge funds can use large amounts of leverage (or borrowed money), short sell, and perform riskier trades on behalf of their investors, whereas mutual funds cannot. Note that the strategies available to the hedge fund manager must be identified in the private placement memorandum that must be available to the investor before purchase. Secondly, hedge funds and mutual funds have different levels of availability. Mutual funds are publicly-registered securities with SEC-approved prospectuses and are available to all investors. Hedge funds are funded through private placements to accredited investors, who must have a net worth of over $1 million (not including the value of your home) or an annual income of over $200,000 (now and going forward). Thirdly, hedge fund investors are typically \"locked-in\" for a period. Whereas a mutual fund investor can sell their shares whenever they want, a hedge fund shareholder may be restricted for a certain period of time. Finally, hedge fund managers are compensated differently from mutual fund managers. Mutual fund managers receive a set percentage of total assets managed each year, whereas hedge fund managers typically receive a set percentage of total assets (usually about 2%), plus a percentage of profits that are earned. This percentage is usually about 20%. Manager compensation is defined in the hedge fund's prospectus and is agreed to by the investor."

      "title": "Select a hedge fund strategy.",
      "content": "Select a hedge fund strategy. Hedge funds managers usually get their start by achieving a successful investing track record throughout years of industry experience. This is how they attract their first clients and build out their funds. But even with the requisite experience, you'll also need an overall vision for your fund, including an idea of how it will generate returns for investors. Hedge funds can follow a number of different strategies, including: [5] X Research source Market Neutral Strategy: This is a popular strategy that involves purchasing a group of investments that are expected to go up, and then offsetting these investments dollar-for-dollar by short-selling the overall market (one of the S&P 500 Index ETFs, for example). If the portion that is expected to go up does better than the short-sold portion, the fund would make money. This can be a useful strategy to market to investors who are concerned about market crashes. Hedged equity strategy: This strategy is similar to the market neutral strategy, except instead of shorting the entire portion of the portfolio that you expect to rise on a dollar-for-dollar basis, only a portion would be shorted. For example, if you had a $1 million portfolio, $300,000 may be shorted. This means if the market were to collapse there would be some protection, but generally speaking your fund would be structured to make money from markets rising. Global Macro strategy: This type of strategy seeks to make money from large economic trends. If you have extensive knowledge of economics, global economic trends, global economies, and how these pieces fit together, this may be a good strategy to pursue. Global Macro strategies make money by forming an idea of what will happen to a particular country's (or multiple countries), stock index, interest rate, currency, or inflation/deflation levels. Hedge fund managers typically pursue a strategy to reduce the volatility of a portfolio while maximizing the upside profit potential. In times of expected market declines, this may mean buying low velocity stocks while shorting high velocity security. In this way, the decline in the former would be offset by greater gains in the latter."

      "content": "Decide what kind of entity you want to create. The fund entity type that you are able or required to create will depend on your state's regulatory laws. Limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and trusts are the typical entities used to create a hedge fund, but you'll need to research local laws regarding the formation of business entities to learn more. Contact the commerce department in your state. A limited partnership has two parts. It will have a general partner, who will serve as the manager and is personally liable for all the business's debts and obligations. Corporations can serve as general partners. It will then have limited partners, who are not liable for the debts of the company. For the most part, hedge funds are typically formed as limited partnerships, in which an incorporated group of investors acts as the limited partners, and an investment advisor acts as the general partner"

A good team is essential to success. [6] X Research source It's hard to sell yourself to investors without first establishing a successful track record. Choosing workers with great employment histories and successful track records buying and selling securities will help in the long run, seeding your company with human capital and enabling you to hit the ground running. When establishing a team, your goal should be to first finding people who you have a strong personal chemistry with, and who share your vision. Your next criteria should be experience. For example, if you are starting a market neutral fund, choose analysts who have experience doing the kind of high-level analytical work that is associated with creating a fund like that. Look for people who are great at listening and asking questions since these traits are really important when it comes to making finance and investment decisions.

An investment advisor has two basic choices in structuring a fund: you can either run your hedge fund as a sole proprietor, or you can create a corporation to partner with you and limit your own liability. It's a common practice to seek protection from liability by creating a corporation to act as the general partner of your fund entity. This partner will be your investment advisory company. [8] X Research source Remember that with a limited partnership, the general partner is completely responsible for all the firms debts and obligations. So, if you incorporate your general partner, your personal assets are protected in the case of a lawsuit or in the case of debts. This is because a corporation is a separate legal entity.
