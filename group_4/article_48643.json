      "content": "WHU is an expression of confusion over text and online meaning, \"What?\" In fact, “WHU” isn’t even an acronym—there’s no longer phrase associated with it. Rather, WHU imitates the sound of someone saying, “What?” without fully pronouncing the “t” (which often sounds like they’re saying, “Whu?” instead). That’s why WHU is synonymous with “What?” and is most often used to convey confusion on social media. [1] X Research source You: “Did you hear about the new Marvel show??” Them: “Whu? No!! 🫨” Usually, it’s easy to tell when someone uses WHU to convey confusion. The expression is usually accompanied by a question mark since it’s just like saying, “What?”"

      "content": "Tell someone that you’re feeling confused or lost with WHU. Everyone gets thoroughly confused now and again! If the person messaging knows something you don’t or isn't clear about what they mean, press pause on the conversation and show them that you’re not really following what they’re saying with a quick \"whu?\" Them: “Hey! Here’s the answer to that homework question and what I did to solve it.” You: “Whu? Omg, this is so confusing! 😩”"

      "content": "Get clarification or more information by sending someone WHU. Sometimes, the person texting you might know more about a situation than you do. So, if you’re feeling out of the loop, ask them to explain the situation to you and get you up to speed. Use WHU to let them know that you don’t really know what they’re talking about and need more details as soon as possible. Them: “So apparently, Lou and Jen are breaking up!” You: “Whu? I didn’t know anything about that! 🤯” Them: “It was crazy! Hang on, I’ll tell you everything…”"

      "content": "Ask where someone is using WHU. If you’re unsure where your friend is (or they tell you where they are but you can’t see them), use WHU to ask for their location. Although WHU primarily means “What?” it can also be used to say, “Where are you?” (particularly if you’re feeling confused about where the other person actually is). Them: “Hey! They wouldn’t let me wait outside the bar, so I had to move.” You: “Whu? I’m trying to find you, where are you now? 🤨”"

      "content": "Ask someone how you can help clear up their confusion. When someone texts you “WHU” because they’re totally lost, try asking them what’s tripping them up so much. Once you know what the problem is, you'll be able to explain your point more clearly—and hopefully clear up the confusion once and for all. You: “Ready to play some Animal Crossing together? Come to my island!!” Them: “Whu?” You: “Everything okay? What's confusing you?” Them: “I don’t think I know how to do that yet!” You: “Oh, no problem! Just go to the airport…”"

For example, you might know something that they don’t or understand a situation better than they do. You’re the expert for the moment, so answer whatever questions they might have. Them: “Whu? Can you walk me through this recipe again?\" You: “Sure thing! Start by mixing brown sugar and flour…”"

If they express their confusion and ask to know where you currently are with “Whu?” then tell them your current location as clearly as possible. Them: “Whu? I can’t find you anywhere! 😟” You: “Oops, sorry! I wandered off to grab a coffee. I’m at the front of the store near the cafe! ☕️”"

I checked the WHU site all the time!” “Still kind of wish I could go on WHU for royal family news.”"
