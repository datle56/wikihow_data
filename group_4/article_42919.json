      "content": "Contrast the examples with simple past tense. Use your same examples to give your students an introduction to the past tense. Write down the different versions of your examples on the board to really solidify it in their minds. [2] X Research source Change your examples to, “I walked home,” “She worked,” “We made cookies.”"

      "title": "Explain the difference between regular and irregular verbs.",
      "content": "Explain the difference between regular and irregular verbs. When speaking in the past tense, most regular verbs end in -ed. However, irregular verbs end in varying ways, and may have to be studied. If your students are ESL or this is their first time learning past tense, give them a list of common irregular verbs to help them remember. [4] X Research source Common irregular past tense verbs include: spoke, went, saw, drank, ate, had, and came."

      "title": "Introduce continuous past tense.",
      "content": "Introduce continuous past tense. Continuous past tense describes an action that was done in the past, but the speaker is saying it like it is continuously happening. Tell your students that the continuous past tense most often combines the past tense of “to be” with a word ending in -ing. [5] X Research source An example of continuous past tense is, “I was walking.” Continuous past tense is also called past progressive tense."

    {
      "title": "Explain perfect past tense.",
      "content": "Explain perfect past tense. Perfect past tense explains an action that was already completed before something else happened. Tell your students that it’s often used with the past tense of “to have” plus the past participle of the verb. [6] X Research source An example of perfect past tense is “I had walked.” Continuous and perfect past tense are concepts you should save for older students, like high school level or above."

      "content": "Ask your students to recall past events in the past tense. Go around the room and ask your students what they ate for dinner yesterday or what they did over the weekend. Write their examples on the board and underline the verb to emphasize why the sentence is in the past tense. [7] X Research source Your students might say, “I ate spaghetti,” “We went to the park,” “I had a grilled cheese sandwich,” “We visited my grandma.” This will help your students work the past tense into conversation."

      "content": "Have your students create sentences out of verb cards. Split your students into groups of 4 and pass out a set of expression cards and a set of verb cards. Have each player try to make a sentence using their verb cards to make sentences with the expression cards. If the sentence is believable, they get to discard their verb. If it isn’t, they have to hang onto their card and make a new sentence in their next turn. [8] X Research source The aim of the game is to be the first to get rid of your verb cards. Write expression cards like, “an hour ago,” “this morning,” “yesterday,” “last week,” “last year,” and “in 2013.” Print out verbs like, “be,” “have,” “go,” “take,” “start.”"
