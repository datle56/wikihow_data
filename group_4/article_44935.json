Instead, give your hair frequent trims once every 2-3 months, which helps keep your hair in great condition. [2] X Research source If your split ends are too severe, they can do a lot of damage further up the hair shaft. Curly hair tends to split more often than other kinds of hair. Men only need to get a haircut about 1-3 times each year. [3] X Research source"

Don’t worry about making any major adjustments—simply trim a small margin off the ends of your hair to get rid of any fraying ends. [5] X Research source If you don’t have a lot of experience cutting hair, don’t worry about trimming the back—instead, focus on the sections of hair you can see in the mirror. [6] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Since your hair is on the shorter side, you only need to trim your hair every 10-12 weeks. It won’t look like you’re making much of a difference, but you’re saving your hair from damage! If you’re growing out layered hair, trim the bottom of your hair so it stays short. Then, wait for the upper layers of hair to grow. [7] X Research source If your hair is really short and you want to grow it out, try trimming it around your ears and at the back of your neck each time you get a haircut. That way, you can grow out the top into a bob, and it won't look so awkward. [8] X Expert Source Bianca Cox Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 9 May 2020"

Once the top of your hair is at least 4 in (10 cm) long, let the sides and back of your hair start to grow out as well. This helps save you from any unwanted mullets or otherwise awkward hairdos! [11] X Research source As your hair grows out, don’t tie it up in a top knot, which is pretty tough on your hair. Instead, keep it out of the way in a low bun or ponytail. Headbands are another easy and helpful way to keep your hair out of your face. [12] X Research source"

Keep trimming your bangs until they’re slightly below your eyebrows. [13] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source This vertical cutting style is known as “point cutting.” It’s a great strategy if you don’t have a lot of hair-cutting experience since it gives you a bigger margin of error."
