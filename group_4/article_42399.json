Potty training can take up to several months, so be patient with your puppy as he learns the proper place to relieve himself. It is best to train your puppy to go outside, and to let him choose his own spot to go. [8] X Research source To get your puppy on a consistent routine of going outside to relieve himself, take him outside after certain activities, such as 20 minutes after eating and 20 minutes before bedtime. [9] X Research source Although it may be tempting to do indoor housetraining on pee pads or newspaper, it can be challenging, since your Pom may not like being forced to use a pee pad in a spot he didn't choose himself. [10] X Research source If you and your family members are gone for long periods of time (more than eight hours), it may be more practical for you to leave an indoor area for your Pom that contains a pee pad and a few other creature comforts (bed, food and water bowls, toys). [11] X Research source Remember, though, that your Pom may relieve himself in a place other than the pee pad. A good rule of thumb to remember is that a puppy can hold off from going to the bathroom for one hour per pound of body weight. For example, if your puppy is two pounds, he can hold it for about two hours. [12] X Research source"

It can take some time for a dog to adjust to the sleep pattern of his owner, [16] X Research source so be patient with your Pom as you train him to sleep at night. Create a comfortable area for your Pom puppy to sleep. Make this area easily accessible to your Pom so he can rest there at any time of day. He may feel isolated and stay awake at night if he associates the rest area only with the dark. [17] X Research source In the evenings, dim the lights and turn down the noise on the TV so your Pom knows that it's time to go sleep. [18] X Research source Do not rush to your Pom if he whines and barks during the night. If you do this, he will associate his noise with getting attention from you, which will certainly affect your sleep quality. Let him soothe himself back to sleep.

[21] X Research source It is important for you to train your Pom not to bark. Training your Pom dog not to bark begins with teaching him how to bark on command. When you have your Pom's attention, give a short verbal command ('speak,' 'bark') and let him bark a few times. Hold a treat in front of his nose and let him have the treat when he stops barking. When your Pom responds to the command to bark, give him a command to stop barking ('quiet').
