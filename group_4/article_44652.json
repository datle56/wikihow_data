      "title": "Recognize the symptoms.",
      "content": "Recognize the symptoms. Bald patches are the first and most obvious signs of ringworm. The fungus weakens the hair follicle, which then causes their fur to fall out. Bald patches will develop a crusty appearance with time and will eventually be accompanied by red patches around the eyes, ears, and nose. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Find a vet who can treat guinea pigs.",
      "content": "Find a vet who can treat guinea pigs. Not all vets treat guinea pigs, as they are sometimes considered exotic animals. If you don't already have a vet, look online or in the local yellow pages to find a vet with experience treating guinea pigs. If you know any other guinea pig owners, try asking them for a recommendation."

    {
      "title": "Let your vet diagnose the condition.",
      "content": "Let your vet diagnose the condition. Ringworm is typically diagnosed by a physical examination followed up by taking a skin sample for analysis. While lab results may take a few days, if your vet is confident that the bald patches are cased by ringworm, you can usually begin treatment right away. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Talk over a treatment plan with your vet.",
      "content": "Talk over a treatment plan with your vet. Ringworm is treated with antifungal medication. It's administered over five to six weeks. Make sure you go over the recommended dosages carefully with your vet. If your guinea pig has a lot of bald patches, your vet may also prescribe creams to be applied topically. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss payment.",
      "content": "Discuss payment. Vet bills can sometimes be pricey, so make sure you know how much treatment will cost. Ask whether you need to pay upfront or if you can pay with an installment plan. Some vets are happy to let owners make payments over time."

    {
      "title": "Medicate your guinea pig.",
      "content": "Medicate your guinea pig. Give your guinea pig any antifungal medication prescribed by your vet at the correct dosages and times. Usually, medication is administered orally. [4] X Research source Liquid medications are typically given via a syringe. You gently hold up the guinea pig's head, insert the tip of the syringe just behind its front teeth, and then squeeze out the medication. For pills, it's easiest to crush up the medication and mix it into a portion of food you know your guinea pig will eat. Just make sure your guinea pig eats all the food that contains its pills."

      "title": "Increase your guinea pig's vitamin C intake.",
      "content": "Increase your guinea pig's vitamin C intake. Vitamin C can help strengthen your guinea pig's immune system and help it fight off ringworm. The best way to give your guinea pig vitamin C is to add a supplement to its water or to feed it vegetables high in vitamin C, like kale, mustard greens, and spinach. While you can give your guinea pig pellets enriched with Vitamin C, these may lose their effectiveness quickly after the bag is opened."

      "title": "Treat bald patches.",
      "content": "Treat bald patches. Bald patches may cause guinea pigs a lot of skin irritation. Your vet may prescribe an antifungal ointment to rub into your guinea pig's skin. [5] X Research source Talk to your vet about how much of the ointments to use, as well as for instructions for proper application. Never use an antifungal cream unless it's prescribed by your vet."

Ringworm is highly contagious and you do not want the infection to spread. [6] X Research source Clean the cage after separating your guinea pig from your other pigs. Make sure to keep your guinea pig's current cage clean to help stop the infection. Clean up any spills and urine promptly, as a wet environment breeds ringworm."
