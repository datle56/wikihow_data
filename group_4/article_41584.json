      "title": "Dry the jerky at room temperature.",
      "content": "Dry the jerky at room temperature. If you've made your own jerky, let it cool for several hours so it's completely dry. If you see grease on the jerky, blot it with paper towels. Removing the moisture and fat helps the jerky last longer when you store it. [1] X Research source If you're storing store-bought jerky, you can skip directly to storing the jerky at room temperature or chilling it."

      "title": "Place the jerky in an airtight storage container.",
      "content": "Place the jerky in an airtight storage container. Put the jerky into an airtight storage bag or a glass container. Try to choose a container that's not much bigger than the amount of jerky you're storing. Too much oxygen will cause the jerky to spoil faster. Glass storage containers are also great at keeping unwanted odors from flavoring your jerky."

      "title": "Add oxygen absorbers to your bag or jar to extend the jerky’s shelf life.",
      "content": "Add oxygen absorbers to your bag or jar to extend the jerky’s shelf life. You can purchase food-grade oxygen absorbers from some grocery stores or online. Place 1 or 2 of them in each bag or container of jerky to extend the shelf life of the jerky. Then, press the air out of the bag and seal it or put the lid on your storage container. [2] X Research source The oxygen absorber will absorb the oxygen, which prevents bacteria from growing on the jerky."

    {
      "title": "Vacuum seal the package for the most long-lasting jerky.",
      "content": "Vacuum seal the package for the most long-lasting jerky. Oxygen absorbers can remove a lot of oxygen from the bag, but a vacuum sealing machine removes almost all of it. Put the jerky into the bags that came with your machine and lock them into the machine. Turn it on so the machine sucks out all of the oxygen and shrinks the bag around the jerky. [3] X Research source Consider vacuum-sealing bags with different amounts of jerky so you can grab some bags for snacks and keep others for long-term storage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Label your container or bag of jerky.",
      "content": "Label your container or bag of jerky. Write down what type of jerky is inside the container and write the date you packaged the jerky. Then, refer to the date on the package when you go to use the jerky. If you make jerky throughout the year, remember to rotate the containers and use the oldest jerky before opening the newer jerky."
    },
    {
      "title": "Leave the jerky at room temperature for up to 2 months.",
      "content": "Leave the jerky at room temperature for up to 2 months. If you removed all of the moisture from the jerky when you made it, you should be able to safely store it in your pantry or cupboard for up to 2 months. If you see moisture in the bag after a few days, you'll need to dehydrate the jerky again so you can store it longer. If you're storing storebought jerky at room temperature, it should last up to 1 year if you don't open the package."
    },
    {
      "title": "Store the jerky in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Store the jerky in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Place your bag or container of jerky into the refrigerator if you're concerned that your pantry is hot and the jerky would spoil. Keep in mind that once you open the bag or container of jerky, you should eat it within 1 week since you've introduced oxygen into the bag or container.

      "title": "Keep the jerky in the freezer for up to 6 months.",
      "content": "Keep the jerky in the freezer for up to 6 months. For longer-term storage, put your bag or container of jerky into the freezer. Although this extends your storage time, it can change the flavor of the jerky. Consider freezing a small amount to see if you notice any changes before freezing a large batch of jerky. [5] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source To thaw the jerky, take it out of the freezer and place it in the fridge the night before you want to eat it. Place a paper towel in the bag to absorb moisture as the jerky thaws."
