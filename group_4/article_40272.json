Find one where you are likely to have things in common with the people there. [1] X Research source For example, there are some events for young professionals and others for older retired singles. Choose the event that is appropriate for you. You will likely need to register ahead of time. You can register on the website for the event or over the phone.

Practice what you want to say and how you want to say it. You will need to prepare an introduction and basic biographical information that you wish to share so that your dates can get to know you. [2] X Research source For your introduction, consider how you want to first present yourself to other speed daters. You could say something like, “Hi! My name is Mary. I'm a 31 year old single mom. I work in microbiology and in my free time I love to hike.” For your biographical information, you should have an idea of what you most want to say about yourself. Create a short biography that sums up what you feel are the qualities you want to communicate. You could make a list of important things to share, such as your hobbies (“I love to ski”), interests (“I enjoy foreign films”), personality traits (“I'm very outgoing and love to socialize”), values (“I'm a vegan who is an advocate for all animals”), and what you're looking for (“I'm looking to settle down and start a family”). Make sure to practice speaking clearly and to smile often. You could practice in a mirror to see how you appear. Keep it light and positive. Don't discuss your negative feelings about your job or your strained relationship with your ex."

Have a list of questions in your mind that you can ask your matches. Think about what you are most interested in finding out when assessing a potential partner and then formulate a set of questions that are tailored to getting that information. You may opt to have a sense of humor or to be deep and probing, but the important part is that you stay true to yourself. [4] X Research source You could ask all different kinds of questions, from the basics like “What do you do for a living?” and “What do you like to do for fun?” to more probing questions like “Where do you see yourself in five years?” and “What are you most passionate about?” You could even ask goofy questions like “Do you have a favorite joke?” Just keep in mind that you have a very short amount of time to converse with this person, so choose the questions that matter most to you."

Remember that you may be nervous for your first speed dating event, so it will help to have an idea of what you are looking for before you get into the process. You should also list traits that are deal-breakers. Take some time to seriously consider what you want in a romantic interest so that you can accurately qualify and disqualify potential matches, even when your nerves might be clouding your thinking. For example, maybe you are looking for someone who is passionate about their job, is adventurous, and wants to have kids some day. For deal-breakers, perhaps you are unwilling to date a smoker or will only date someone of a specific religion."

For example, if your date told you that he has a son, you could ask “How old is your son?” Of if your date told you that she is an actor, you could ask, “What's a typical day in the life of an actor?” Don't ask too many questions. If it starts to feel like an interview, there probably isn't good chemistry between you. The goal is to have a natural, albeit hurried, conversation.

      "title": "Give honest answers.",
      "content": "Give honest answers. The purpose of a speed date is to form an opinion based on not much more than a first impression. The only way to attract people who are genuinely interested in the real you is to present your real self to your dates. Otherwise, you are just wasting your own and your matches' time. Therefore, it is important to avoid saying things simply to impress the other person if it isn't true, like saying “I love mountain climbing too!” when you are terrified of heights. Disagree when necessary. It's ok if it doesn't work out with this person. The point of speed dating is simply to find a couple of people who might be potential matches for you. For example, if the other person says, “I love dogs and having pets is very important to me,” it is perfectly acceptable to admit that you're not a pet person."

For example, you could say, “I'm sorry to hear that,” if the person has recently lost their job. You can even interrupt the other person to give positive feedback as a way of showing that you understand what they are saying, for example, “I know! That restaurant is the best in town!” This shows that you are excited about the conversation. But don't interrupt to change the direction of the conversation."

The event is low pressure because whether you are a match will be determined at the end based on whether you both said you liked each other on your match card."
