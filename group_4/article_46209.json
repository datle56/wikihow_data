The only difference is how much water and coffee grounds you put in the machine. [1] X Research source Before using your coffee maker, remove the carafe, brew basket, and reusable filter (if included), wash in mild, soapy water, rinse, dry, and place back in the machine. Mr. Coffee also recommends you run a hot water cycle through the machine before brewing your first pot of coffee. Place a carafe-full of hot water in the reservoir, place the carafe under the spout, and turn the machine on. Dump out the hot water and rinse the carafe, then continue brewing your first pot of coffee."

Depending on your Mr. Coffee model, the minimum number of cups to brew varies. For a 12-cup coffee maker, Mr. Coffee recommends brewing at least 4 cups. For a 5-cup coffee maker, Mr. Coffee recommends brewing at least 2 cups. The carafe has measurement markings on the side. Mr. Coffee measures 1 cup as 5 oz. of water. So, for a 12-cup coffee maker, the minimum amount of water to use is 20 oz. For a 5-cup coffee maker, the minimum amount of water to use is 10 oz. Brewing a single cup of coffee in a bigger Mr. Coffee maker is not recommended. Mr. Coffee does have a single-cup brewer, and we've included instructions on how to use that machine below ."

If the bottom of the carafe is wet, note that you may hear some hissing or fizzing when the warming plate turns on. This is just the water evaporating, and it won't damage the machine.

You can fill the basket while it's nested inside the machine or remove it if you prefer. Some Mr. Coffee machines come with reusable filters . They are made of plastic and a fine metal mesh. If your machine didn't come with a reusable filter or you don't like the taste of coffee brewed with a reusable filter, you can use a paper filter instead.

If you grind your own coffee or get your coffee ground at a coffee shop, grind the coffee to a medium to medium-fine size.

Never rinse a hot carafe with cold water, as this could cause a glass carafe to crack. Dump out the coffee grounds and used paper filter. Rinse the brew basket to get rid of any lingering coffee grounds. If you have a reusable filter, rinse it alongside the brew basket. Do this once the brew basket and/or filter are completely cooled. If the filter, brew basket, or carafe are dirty or stained, wash by hand with mild dish soap and water. You can also wash your filter, brew basket, and carafe in the top rack of the dishwasher. Dry the brew basket, filter, and carafe before placing them back in the machine. If you put a wet brew basket and/or filter in the machine and close the lid, this could lead to mold or mildew growth. Wipe the outside of your coffee machine down with a damp cloth if you notice stains or debris. Never submerge the main coffee maker unit in water."
