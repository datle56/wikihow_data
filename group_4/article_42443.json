      "title": "Prevent accidents before they happen.",
      "content": "Prevent accidents before they happen. Protecting your laptop's hardware is usually a matter of caution. You can avoid the majority of common pitfalls by doing the following: Keep food and drink away from the laptop. When drinking water or other beverages while working on your laptop, keep your glass or bottle at least one foot away from the laptop. A useful rule of thumb is that even if you toppled over your drink, it should be far enough away from your laptop that the laptop won't experience the spill. If you need to eat near the laptop, close the laptop lid. If you do want to watch videos on the laptop while eating (and accept the greater risk to your laptop), keep the laptop as far away as possible and cover the keyboard with a silicone keyboard cover to minimize the risk of spills. Use your laptop in safe conditions (e.g., away from water, extreme temperatures, and so on). For instance, try not to use your laptop where it faces direct sunlight, near heating vents, or outdoors where there is risk of rainwater, dust, or other particles getting into it. During days of high temperatures, it's even more important to keep your laptop on a hard surface and make sure the vents are unobstructed, and keep workloads on the laptop low. Keep the laptop at least a few inches away from the edge of the table you've placed it on, so that there's some room for it to be pulled without toppling off the table. Make sure that power cords are placed in a way that you are unlikely to accidentally trip over or pull them. The same applies to accessories such as plugged-in headphones, though the risk there is less."

      "content": "Buy a computer case. Especially if you're particularly accident-prone, having a hard-shell case for your laptop will prevent damage from minor falls or spills when your laptop is shut. You might also want to invest in a specific laptop bag (or a backpack with a dedicated laptop compartment) if you travel often."

      "title": "Know how to treat the battery.",
      "content": "Know how to treat the battery. Unfortunately, factory laptop batteries tend to have reduced lifespans, so your laptop's battery life will usually not match the factory estimates. Battery life reduces each time you have to charge it, so consider keeping your laptop plugged into a power cable until you absolutely have to use the battery. If the laptop is constantly plugged in, there is some risk of overcharging. However, modern laptops have built-in protections against overcharging -- if they detect that you tend to keep the laptop plugged in most of the time, they will occasionally discharge the battery a little bit to maximize its lifespan. Make sure that you have enabled this functionality if available on your laptop. For Macs and Windows, this is available in \"System Settings (Mac)/Settings (Windows) > Battery > Battery as \"Optimized battery charging\". It's usually better to just leave the laptop plugged in and let the machine do the occasional discharge, rather than unplug the power cord yourself every few days. However, older laptops may not have this overcharge protection functionality, so if you're using an older laptop and never need to unplug it in your regular use, you may want to unplug for an hour or two every week, according to Baron."

      "title": "Let your laptop breathe.",
      "content": "Let your laptop breathe. If you look around your laptop, you should notice sets of exhaust fans, either on the bottom, back, or sides. These are meant to expel heat so your laptop doesn't sustain internal heat damage. Here are more tips to ensure your laptop can breathe easily: Use your laptop on a flat, hard surface. Soft surfaces like pillows or blankets block the fans and make it harder for your laptop to get rid of the excess heat. Doing this enough will ensure that internal parts overheat and possibly melt or sustain damage. If you prefer to use your laptop in bed or on the couch, invest in a lapdesk , which allows for you to stay comfy while keeping your laptop on a hard surface. Make sure your laptop is sleeping, hibernating, or turned off while you transport it in a bag since most of these carriers cover or obstruct the vents."

      "content": "Clean your laptop. Taking a few minutes to clean your computer of dust, grime, residue, and so on will make a huge difference in your laptop's lifespan. However, you don't need to take it apart and clean it all the time. According to Oppido, how often you need to clean your laptop depends on your environment; you'd clean a laptop more that's in a dusty environment than one that's in a clean one. Focus on the following: Keyboard - Turn it off, and tilt it upside down to get rid of any loose debris like cookie or chip crumbs. Then use a can of compressed air to remove dust. Use a damp microfiber cloth to wipe down the keys. You can also use wipes specifically designed for electronics. Oppido warns against ammonia since that eats away at plastic. You don't need to remove keys when you're doing general maintenance cleaning. Vents - Use a can of compressed air to dislodge any debris, but make sure you're not blowing it back into your laptop by holding the can at an angle to your laptop. Blowing debris into your laptop can damage internal components. Spray air in short bursts rather than a sustained flow. You can also use a microfiber cloth to remove dust around the vents. Never use a vacuum since it can create harmful static electricity. Screen - Use a damp microfiber cloth and gently wipe the screen. Never spray water directly on the screen or use regular household cleaners like window cleaner, all-purpose cleaner, or dish soap. Instead, use cleaner specified for laptop screens ."

Peripherals are items you plug into your laptop; these can include USB flash drives or accessories, headphone or speaker cables, adapters, and even the power cable. Many of these items have specific ports or locations into which they fit, so pay attention to the shape and size of an item's connector before plugging it into its respective port."

      "content": "Shut down your laptop once every few days. You may notice that your laptop begins to run sluggishly after a few days of being constantly on. You can remedy this problem by turning off your laptop all the way and leaving it alone for 15 minutes; this will allow your computer's hardware to rest and reset. To turn off your computer all the way, do the following: Windows — Click the Start icon, click the Power icon, and click Shut down . Mac — Click the Apple menu , click Shut Down... , and click Shut Down when prompted."

      "title": "Properly transport and handle your laptop.",
      "content": "Properly transport and handle your laptop. If you lift your laptop by the screen alone, you could damage the display or the hinges attaching the display to the base. The display is also easily scratched or damaged by direct pressure, so take care not to place pressure on it If you drop the laptop while transporting it, it's much more likely to get damaged if the lid is open than if it is closed. So it's better to close the lid when transporting the laptop, even over relatively short distances (e.g., from your bed to your table). Closing the laptop lid also reduces the pressure imposed on the hinges. Use more than one finger to open the laptop's lid. If you try opening or closing the lid without holding the base steady, this puts pressure on the hinges, which weakens them; it also increases the risk of toppling or pushing the laptop."

      "title": "Protect the screen.",
      "content": "Protect the screen. One of the reasons your computer's screen will always end up smudged regardless of how careful you are is because the laptop's screen touches the keyboard keys, which have oil, grit, and dust on them, whenever you close the lid. You can cut down on this problem by placing a thin piece of foam or plastic on your keyboard before closing the lid."
