      "content": "You expect your boyfriend to know how you’re feeling without telling him. Your boyfriend isn’t able to read your mind, so he won’t know what you need or how you feel unless you tell him. He might not catch on to subtle signs and cues you’re giving him, so he may not act or respond how you want him to. [1] X Research source A glance in his direction or a slight change in expression might not be enough for him to catch on. He may not recognize how you’re feeling if you say something like, “I’m fine.”"

[3] X Research source Asking for help every now and then is fine, but expecting your boyfriend to do things like always cleaning up after you or buying every gift you want can be too much."

      "content": "You think your boyfriend should spend most of his time with you. Having time together is important for a healthy couple, but your boyfriend should maintain his relationships with his friends and family. If you’re the only one that he spends time with, it could make you both feel like you’ve lost your individual identity. [4] X Research source It would be unfair to ask your boyfriend to give up plans that he’s already made with other people just to be with you."

      "title": "You base your expectations on the past rather than the present.",
      "content": "You base your expectations on the past rather than the present. You get relationship expectations from what you’ve experienced in the past, which could be from your family growing up or from your exes. Your boyfriend is a different person than the other people in your life, so expecting him to act like the people from your past relationships is asking too much of him.

      "content": "You think your boyfriend should change completely. While you can help your boyfriend make small changes in his life, you shouldn’t try to control who he is at his core. Your boyfriend is a unique person with his own values and interests, so you can’t make him change his entire personality. [8] X Research source If you like to go out with friends to have fun but your boyfriend is introverted and prefers a night in, it’s not fair to expect him to come with you all the time."
