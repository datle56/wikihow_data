      "content": "Use full-fat mayonnaise. Regular, full-fat mayonnaise has the ingredients that nourish your hair and make it soft and silky. Low-fat or fat-free mayonnaise is full of fillers that probably do your hair more harm than good. Choose regular mayonnaise for best results. [1] X Research source Avoid mayonnaise that contains extra flavoring, such as herbs or spices. Besides smelling funny, these extra components may not be good for your hair. If you're concerned about using the best possible product for your hair, go for an all-natural, organic mayonnaise. This type of mayonnaise usually contains olive oil and other nutritious ingredients that are great for your hair."

      "content": "Measure out the mayonnaise you need. Use approximately 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, more or less depending on the length of your hair. You want to use enough mayonnaise to entirely coat your hair from the roots to the tips. Don't use more than you need, though, since it can be tricky to wash it all out."

      "content": "Massage the mayonnaise into your hair and scalp. Take care to coat each strand well, and concentrate on working mayonnaise into the tips.

Apply a little warm water to loosen the mayonnaise if it clumps in your hair."

      "title": "Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap for one hour.",
      "content": "Cover your hair with a plastic shower cap for one hour. You can also use plastic wrap or a plastic bag. This will trap your body heat against your head and help the mayonnaise get to work deep conditioning your hair. [2] X Research source Leave the mayonnaise in your hair for at least a 1/2 hour and up to 1 hour, depending on the level of conditioning your hair needs. If you don't have time to do the full conditioning treatment, you can use mayonnaise as a pre-conditioner in the shower. Wet your hair, apply the mayonnaise, and let it sit for five minutes while you go about your shower routine. At the end of your shower, shampoo it out. For maximum conditioning benefits, you can leave the mayonnaise in overnight and wash it out in the morning."

Keep whisking until the mixture takes on the texture of mayonnaise. Apply it to your hair, cover your hair with a shower cap, and let it sit for an hour before shampooing."
