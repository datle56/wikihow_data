      "content": "It’s tough to know what other people are looking for. When you go out on a date with someone, you probably know exactly what you want: maybe you’re looking for marriage material, or perhaps you’re just looking for a summer fling. Dating can get tricky when you meet someone who’s either unsure about what they want or isn’t upfront about their intentions. It can be very disappointing to catch feelings for someone only to find out your intentions are mismatched. [1] X Research source Have you ever gone on a couple of dates with someone and imagined your future together, only to find out they weren’t looking for anything serious? This disappointment can really taint your dating experience. Reader Poll: We asked 659 wikiHow readers about what they wanted from their romantic life, and only 8% of people said they enjoyed periods of casual dating without building any lasting connections. [Take Poll] So if you’re frustrated with the dating scene, you’re not alone!"

      "content": "You may be putting pressure on yourself to find “the one.” A lot of people show up to a first date expecting to find the love of their life that they’re going to settle down with. But if it ends up being a so-so date (or a really bad one), that expectation can lead to a lot of disappointment. [2] X Research source There are no statistics on how many dates it takes to find your forever partner. However, common sense can tell us that the first person you go on a date with probably won’t be it."

      "content": "There are a lot of choices when it comes to potential dates. While having so many date options might seem like a good thing, the choices can be paralyzing. With dating apps, social media, and your social circle, you probably have endless potential suitors to choose from. The idea of picking one person out of all of those people is very daunting, and it can make the idea of dating seem even more frustrating.

      "content": "Dating apps make the process impersonal. Ah, dating apps: some days you love them, some days you hate them. While apps certainly give you the ability to connect with other people, the impersonal nature of online dating can make finding a real connection difficult. Swiping right doesn’t exactly feel like you’re searching for your soulmate, does it? [5] X Research source Plus, dating apps can make us more shallow. Since we’re finding matches based on first impressions, we often say yes or no based on physical appearance rather than someone’s personality."

      "content": "Some people ghost dates instead of saying goodbye. Ghosting, or the art of not responding to someone’s messages and never reaching out again, has become unfortunately normalized in today’s world. Instead of sending a final message thanking you for your time but declining another date, someone might just not respond at all. This behavior can leave you feeling confused and hurt, especially if you thought you had a real connection with this person. [10] X Research source It’s important to remember that when someone ghosts you, it says much more about them than it does about you."

We live in a heteronormative society that expects young adults to find a partner, buy a house, and have children. This can put a lot of pressure on you if you’re single or if you’re going down a different path.

Some dating apps, like Hinge or Tinder, even have options on their profiles where you can put what you’re looking for in a relationship. [12] X Research source For instance, you might put “Looking for someone fun to hang out with” if you’re just seeking something casual. If you’re looking for a long-term relationship, you might tell a date, “I’m only looking to spend time with people who I can see a real future with.”"

Instead of saying yes to anyone who hits you up online or in person, ask yourself if you can truly see a happy future with them. This can help you narrow down your choices and not get stumped by the sheer number of single people that are out there to choose from. [14] X Research source For example, if you’ve had a fun text conversation with them and already know you have hobbies in common, it’s probably a good idea to ask them out. But if you don’t know them much at all or you know there are incompatibilities there (what do you mean he hates dogs??!), then it’s probably not worth your time. Take your potential date’s values into account, too. If your values are much different than theirs, it’s not likely you’ll have much long-term success together."

If you’re exhausted from finding potential dates on your phone, give yourself a time limit to hit every day (or every week). That way, you won’t spend all your waking hours obsessing over your new potential romance. [15] X Research source You might give yourself 15 minutes of swipe time per day, or 1 hour per week. If you’re using multiple dating apps, consider picking just one. Using multiple dating apps at a time can feel much more overwhelming."
