      "content": "A thumb ring represents strength, willpower, and individuality. Thumb rings have meant many things to different cultures throughout history, but in modern times, they’re mostly worn as a fashion statement. Wearing a thumb ring is a fairly unique and unconventional jewelry choice that makes you stand out from the crowd, so it makes sense that they’re associated with meanings like individuality, self-assertion, and confidence. [1] X Research source Less commonly, thumb rings symbolize friendship, possibly because of the “thumbs up” gesture (which is a positive/friendly interaction). In astrology, the thumb is connected to Mars, which is the planet that governs action, drive, and passion. [2] X Research source Thumb rings are gender-neutral and some cultures associate them with being LGBTQ+ or queer (particularly queer women and lesbians). [3] X Research source Does gender influence the meaning at all? The meanings are essentially the same whether the wearer is male, female, or non-binary.

Thumb rings became more ornamental rather than practical, and people wore them as status symbols to indicate their elevated place in society. Practical thumb rings were fairly plain, while ornamental thumb rings were made of the finest materials and often featured precious stones.
