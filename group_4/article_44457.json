      "content": "Wear loose-fitting underwear and pants to let the infection air out. Sweat buildup from tight clothing is a common cause of folliculitis outbreaks. Wearing tight underwear and pants with an active infection can make the irritation worse. Opt for loose-fitting clothes while you're treating the infection. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Any kind of tights, leggings, or yoga pants can trap sweat in the area. Breathable, cotton materials are best for undergarments. If possible, sleep without underwear on to let the infection air out overnight."

      "title": "Wash the area twice a day with warm water and soap.",
      "content": "Wash the area twice a day with warm water and soap. This removes bacteria from the area and prevents the infection from spreading. If you shower or bathe, scrub your buttocks with gentle soap. If you’re not in the shower, put the soap on a wet washcloth and rub the area gently. Rinse your buttocks thoroughly to remove any soap residue. [3] X Research source Don’t scrub the area hard. This could cause irritation and rupture some of the cysts. Don’t use harsh antiseptics like rubbing alcohol on the area. This can make the inflammation worse."

      "title": "Place a warm compress over the affected area 4 times per day.",
      "content": "Place a warm compress over the affected area 4 times per day. Warm compresses help soothe the area and drain the cysts. Wet a washcloth with warm water and hold it against the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time. Re-wet the washcloth if it cools off. Repeat this treatment up to 4 times per day until the infection clears up. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Always clean the washcloth in between uses. Bacteria can live on the washcloth and re-infect the area. Make sure the water is only warm, not hot. Hot water could burn you or inflame the area. If you can’t remove your pants to apply the compress, then try sitting on a heating pad to get a similar, soothing effect."
