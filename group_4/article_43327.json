      "content": "One of the earliest signs that your dog is pregnant is if she “pinks up.” A pregnant dog’s nipples will be rosier in color (more so than usual) and grow in size, so they’re more prominent.

      "content": "If your dog’s put on a bit of weight, it may be because she’s pregnant. Pregnant dogs tend to gain weight around their stomach and waist during the 2nd or 3rd week of pregnancy. This is completely normal—your dog is making more room for her puppies!

      "title": "A rounder and firmer stomach could be a sign of pregnancy.",
      "content": "A rounder and firmer stomach could be a sign of pregnancy. Believe it or not, most dogs don’t “show” their pregnancy until the third half of pregnancy, which is 6 to 9 weeks since conception. If your dog’s stomach is more pronounced than usual, she’s most likely pregnant (especially if her nipples and mammary glands are swollen and plump). [3] X Research source Try gently placing your hand on your dog’s belly. As the dog’s pregnancy progresses, there’s a greater chance you’ll be able to feel the puppies inside. The mammary glands produce the milk the puppies will drink, which causes a pregnant dog’s nipples to swell."

      "content": "If your dog is pregnant, she’ll most likely eat more than usual. As her tummy grows, expect her to want to eat bigger meals and snack more throughout the day. After all, she has more mouths to feed! [4] X Research source Talk to your veterinarian about how to care for your pregnant dog and when to increase her food rations, as additional calories could benefit her and the growing pups. Know that your dog will likely have a reduced appetite 12 to 24 hours before whelping or giving birth. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "A sudden change in a dog’s energy levels could signify pregnancy. A pregnant dog may be drowsier or more lethargic than normal, especially as her belly grows. This is most noticeable if your dog is naturally full of energy. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Take note if your dog would rather take an abnormal nap than play fetch like usual. This isn’t necessarily a sure sign of pregnancy, as many other underlying illnesses and conditions could cause changes in behavior. Always bring your dog to the vet, just to be sure."

      "content": "Your dog’s behavior could change subtly or drastically if she’s pregnant. How a dog emotionally reacts to her pregnancy all depends on her personality. Some dogs become more affectionate and attention-seeking, while others shy away from pets and cuddles. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source So, notice if your dog suddenly wants to be pet all the time or hides in a room away from people and other animals. This change doesn’t automatically mean your dog is pregnant, but it could be a good indicator if she’s showing other pregnancy symptoms."

Your dog may gather blankets, shred paper, or bunch together bedding or clothing to make a warm nest for her puppies. This behavior isn’t always observed, but if your dog does this out of the blue, she’s most likely about to whelp (give birth).

      "title": "A veterinarian will most likely do a palpation test to check for pregnancy.",
      "content": "A veterinarian will most likely do a palpation test to check for pregnancy. This physical examination is painless, and only requires the veterinarian to feel the outside of your dog’s belly with their forefingers. This helps them examine the womb and feel the outline of the potential puppies. [10] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. Palpation works best when the dog is between 3 and 4 weeks pregnant, as the embryonic vesicles can be easily felt. [11] X Research source If the veterinarian feels anything, they’ll move on to an ultrasound or X-ray test to ensure they’re feeling fetuses rather than feces."

      "content": "A veterinarian can take your dog’s blood to run a pregnancy hormone test. [12] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. With this test, they’re looking for the hormone relaxin , which is generally present during the 4th week of pregnancy. If relaxin is present, your dog is definitely pregnant. A relaxin hormone test is often used to decipher pseudo pregnancies from real pregnancies, as a dog won't produce the hormone unless she’s actually pregnant."

      "content": "If pregnancy is suspected, a veterinarian will perform an ultrasound. With this, they can listen for heartbeats and count how many puppies there are (just like a human ultrasound). This is a sure way to confirm pregnancy in your dog, as long as she’s 2 or more weeks pregnant. [13] X Research source Heartbeats are usually heard within 3 weeks of pregnancy. Counting the number of puppies or fetuses can sometimes be difficult, as they often like to hide behind their siblings. The vet may need to shave your dog’s belly fur if she’s extra fluffy. Some dogs may need to be sedated for an ultrasound, especially those that get anxious at the vet’s."

      "content": "An X-ray of your dog’s stomach can help veterinarians count the number of puppies. [14] X Expert Source Jamie Freyer, DVM Licensed Veterinarian Expert Interview. 8 October 2021. With ultrasounds being the main test for dog pregnancies these days, an X-ray is only used in cases where the exact number of puppies needs to be known or there are suspected complications. If you have a smaller dog, the veterinarian may take an X-ray to calculate the size of the puppies to determine whether a natural birth or c-section is the safest option."
