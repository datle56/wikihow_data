      "title": "Attach the lid.",
      "content": "Attach the lid. Most automatic stirring popcorn makers have a ceramic or metal \"E\" and a large, domed lid that doubles as a serving bowl. To begin, turn the bowl upside down and attach it to the base. Most popcorn makers will have some sort of locking mechanism to keep the bowl in place — you may, for instance, need to screw the bowl in or use fasteners to hold it down. Make sure your bowl is firmly attached to the base before you begin. Popping your corn without fastening your base down is a surefire recipe for a spill."

      "title": "Add kernels and oil.",
      "content": "Add kernels and oil. Next, add your main ingredients — the popcorn kernels and the oil you'll cook them in. See the chart above for serving size suggestions. Most stirring popcorn makers will have a removable portion in the center of the lid for adding the ingredients — simply open this hatch and drop your ingredients in to get started. [1] X Research source Most neutral cooking oils will work well for stirring popcorn makers. For example, vegetable oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil are all great choices. Don't use margarine or an oil with a low smoke point — these can burn and give your popcorn an unappealing smoky taste."
    },
    {
      "title": "Optionally, add butter.",
      "content": "Optionally, add butter. Most standard stirring popcorn makers have a small slot at the top for adding butter. As the popcorn cooks, the butter in this slot will melt, giving the popcorn an even coating. Add your butter in a few skinny slices — the thinner the slices are, the quicker it will melt. See the chart below, in the Tips section, for serving suggestions. Softening the butter for a few seconds in the microwave before adding it can help ensure the popcorn melts completely."

    {
      "title": "Plug in the popcorn maker and turn it on.",
      "content": "Plug in the popcorn maker and turn it on. When you've added all your ingredients, close the lid and plug your device in. Some popcorn makers will start heating up right away, while others will have an \"on\" switch you'll need to hit. The stirring arms should begin turning, stirring the popcorn as it cooks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen to your popcorn as it pops.",
      "content": "Listen to your popcorn as it pops. Depending on how much popcorn you're making, the type of kernels you're using, and their freshness, the cooking time of your popcorn will vary. A few minutes after you turn your popcorn maker on, you should hear your kernels begin to pop. The pace of the popping should quickly increase, then die down. When you start hearing only one pop every few seconds, turn your machine off. Sometimes, kernels may get caught under the stirring arm during cooking. If this happens, you may begin to hear a slight scraping sound. This isn't harmful."

      "title": "Season and serve.",
      "content": "Season and serve. You're all done! Carefully turn your popcorn maker over and remove the lid to use it as a bowl.Most people like their popcorn with a little salt, but there are dozens of possibilities. Below are listed just a few seasoning ideas to get you started, but there are many more — any flavor you like can make a great seasoning. Black pepper Cajun seasoning Garlic salt Hot sauce Chocolate candy (M&Ms, etc.)"

      "title": "Clean after use.",
      "content": "Clean after use. For most popcorn makers (including the home \"stirrer\" type), maintenance is minimal. After making your popcorn, simply use a paper towel or rag to wipe away excess oil from the base and bowl. This prevents the buildup of grease over time, which can give the popcorn an unappealing taste or texture. If you wish, you may also want to use a non-toxic cleaning solution to cut the grease. Don't allow the cleaner to dry on the popcorn maker or it may spoil your next batch of popcorn — instead, remove it with a damp rag when you're done cleaning."

      "title": "Add the popcorn and oil to the cooking chamber.",
      "content": "Add the popcorn and oil to the cooking chamber. The way a movie theater-style popcorn maker works is remarkably similar to the way a home \"stirrer\"-style popcorn maker works. In fact, if you open up the cooking chamber, you'll usually see a pair of stirring arms just as you would in a home popcorn maker! To start, add your main ingredients — kernels and oil — just as you would normally. [2] X Research source For most theater-style popcorn makers, the cooking chamber is a metal \"bucket\" with a handle attached to it suspended in the middle of a clear glass case. Usually, all you need to do is lift one of the metal flaps on top to open it so you can add ingredients. For some movie-style popcorn, the kernels are packaged together with the oil in a single packet, while for other popcorn, the two are kept separate. In the latter case, see the table blow in the Tips section for serving suggestions."

      "title": "Turn the cooker on.",
      "content": "Turn the cooker on. Next, simply flip the \"on\" switch to start the cooking process. Depending on the exact model of popcorn maker you're using, this may be on the front, on the back, or even on the cooking chamber. If you look into the cooking chamber while the popcorn is cooking, you should notice the stirring arms evenly distributing the melting oil over the kernels. [3] X Research source As with a home \"stirrer\" popcorn maker, you'll want to turn the machine off when pops slow to about one, every few seconds. As the popcorn cooks, you should notice popped kernels rising out of the cooking chamber, spilling over the sides, and gathering at the bottom of the glass case below."

      "title": "Serve by scooping into bags.",
      "content": "Serve by scooping into bags. When the popcorn finishes cooking, you should have a good amount of popcorn gathered at the bottom of the case. Use a large spoon or scoop (most popcorn makers should have one included) to serve the popcorn. Traditionally, theater popcorn is served in paper bags, but if you don't have any, you can use ordinary bowls. Most popcorn machines have a number of holes in the bottom of the case for allowing unpopped kernels and very small \"crumbs\" to fall into a crumb drawer located below the bottom. Before serving the popcorn, it is advisable to carefully rake the scoop back and forth so that those \"old maids\" will fall into the drawer."

      "title": "Add butter and seasonings after serving if desired.",
      "content": "Add butter and seasonings after serving if desired. Your popcorn is ready to eat! Add salt, butter, and/or other seasonings as you wish and enjoy! See the section above for a short list of seasoning suggestions. As you might know, if you've ever ordered buttered popcorn at the theater, \"butter\" is usually added to theater-style popcorn after it's been served (usually with a pump). If you're at home and you don't have butter for your popcorn, try melting about a tablespoon of butter in the microwave and drizzling it over the top of your popcorn with a spoon for an authentic movie theater taste. Movie-theater \"butter\" is almost always not real dairy butter. Instead, it is typically a blend of coconut oil and/or (often, partially hydrogenated) soybean or canola oil with artificial butter flavor, TBHO, with citric acid added to improve stability, beta carotene added for color, and methyl-silicone added as an anti-foaming agent."

      "content": "Add sugar for kettle corn . Whether you're using a home popcorn maker or a theater-style machine, putting flavorful spins on the classic popcorn recipe is a piece of cake! For instance, if you want to make mouth-watering kettle corn, try adding about 1/4-1/3 cups of sugar to the popcorn maker after you add your kernels and oil. [4] X Research source As the popcorn cooks, the sugar should melt, giving it a delicious sweet crunch! After your popcorn finishes and starts to cool, the melted sugar may start to stick to itself, forming clumps. This is normal — just stir to break them up."

For instance, for a sweet, spicy, curry-flavored popcorn, start by mixing 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne powder in a bowl while you wait for your popcorn to finish cooking."

Pour the liquid sauce over your popcorn and stir to give it an even coating, then gradually add your spices while shaking to combine. The end result should be sweet, savory, and spicy — a new spin on regular old popcorn!"
