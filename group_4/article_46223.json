If you hold your phone close to an object with an NFC tag on it, a notification should pop up suggesting an action associated with the tag. Tap the notification to perform the action. [1] X Research source For example, tapping on the notification might open an app, take you to a website in your browser, or allow you to make a contactless payment. For security reasons, the NFC reader is only active when your phone is in use (that is, the screen is lit up). It’s also deactivated when you’re using certain apps, like your camera or your Apple Pay Wallet. You don’t need to touch the tag with your phone to read it. Just move it close to the tagged object and wait for the notification to appear. [2] X Research source"
