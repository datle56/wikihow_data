      "content": "Egg prices in the United States are exploding because of the bird flu. In February 2022, the USDA reported a bird flu outbreak in a poultry facility. Since then, the CDC says the disease has spread across poultry farms and facilities throughout the country (and even infected some humans ). [1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source The bird flu has significantly reduced the number of egg-laying flocks in the US. Fewer flocks mean fewer eggs, and farmers and grocery stores must charge more money year after year to make a profit. [2] X Research source The Economic Research Service division of the USDA is predicting that egg prices will increase by 20.3% in 2025. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says a dozen grade A large eggs in the US cost an average of $4.15 in December 2024. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source Average prices also vary significantly from state to state. For example, in California, the cost has stayed $8+ for all of December 2024 and January 2025, per the USDA. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Inflation In 2021, inflation in the United States rose dramatically and has been going up and down ever since. Experts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics believe several different things contributed to the increase, including a growing number of Americans becoming unemployed; issues in the supply chain stemming from the COVID-19 global pandemic; and skyrocketing energy prices. [5] X Trustworthy Source US Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. government agency that collects and reports labor-related information Go to source As a result of inflation, grocery stores charge customers higher prices to cover the increasing production and supply costs."

      "title": "Panic buying",
      "content": "Panic buying During extreme events like weather emergencies, natural disasters, and pandemics, people tend to stock up on or \"panic buy\" groceries that are normally easy to get. This means they purchase several of the same goods (like eggs) for fear they'll run out of them before they can make it back to the store. [6] X Research source In response, a grocery store might raise egg prices just to keep more eggs in stock longer."

      "title": "Supply chain issues",
      "content": "Supply chain issues When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the US, suppliers found it much harder to transport and sell their goods, which was just one of many reasons egg prices went up beginning in 2020. [7] X Research source Any future pandemics, whether they're global or isolated in one area of the US, could cause similar problems. Supply chain issues can also happen because of labor strikes or shortages, cyberattacks on the supplier, and many other reasons."

      "title": "Egg prices won't go back down until the bird flu epidemic stops.",
      "content": "Egg prices won't go back down until the bird flu epidemic stops. However, it's difficult for economists to predict when that might happen because bird flu outbreaks are impossible to forecast – and they keep cropping up faster than farmers can handle. [8] X Research source Even if the bird flu were to stop immediately, however, prices wouldn't go down immediately because it would take a lot of time and money for farmers to rebuild their poultry flocks. But some economists are more optimistic. They say after the bird flu finally peters out, it's only a matter of time before prices go down."

      "title": "Go to the grocery store the morning after they restock their eggs.",
      "content": "Go to the grocery store the morning after they restock their eggs. Sometimes getting eggs in a shortage is simply a matter of timing. Large grocery store chains (like Kroger's and Whole Foods Market) in major cities (like New York City or Los Angeles) tend to restock items every day, whereas small chains and independently owned stores typically restock every Tuesday and Friday. [9] X Research source You can also ask the manager of the grocery stores nearest to you when they get new shipments of eggs. All grocery stores tend to restock items the night they receive them, so arrive at the store close to opening time the next morning to get the best chance of snagging your eggs!"

      "content": "Connect with local egg farmers and farmer's markets to get fresh eggs. If you live in a city or a region with surrounding farmland, there may be some egg farmers near you who are happy to sell their eggs! The best way to connect with them is at your local farmer's market (if you have one) or through Facebook groups. You may also be able to find their ads in the newspaper. Check if any local egg farmers have a website where you can order eggs for pickup or delivery (delivery is usually only available if you live in the same area they do, however). Keep in mind that you may have to pay more for fresh eggs than you do at the store. Local egg farmers don't have nearly the amount of stock that industrial egg suppliers do, but the production cost is still high. [10] X Research source If you can't afford to pay for fresh farm eggs, ask the farmer if they'd be willing to barter other goods for it. Offer to make homemade baked goods, beef tallow, candles, or other DIY items and exchange them for a dozen eggs once a week."

      "content": "Buy chickens to lay eggs for your household. If you live in a rural area or a city that allows you to keep chickens, you may want to do what Americans in the Great Depression did: raise chickens for eggs! With your own hens, you may be able to build your personal egg supply and sell the surplus to friends, family members, and neighbors. The best part is, if you're successful, you'll no longer have to rely on your local grocery store to keep their eggs in stock! Be aware that there's a lot of work and money that goes into raising chickens. Not only do you have to build them a coop, but you also have to buy them special chicken feed, make sure they stay hydrated, and check them for signs of the bird flu . Do a lot of research beforehand to make sure chickens are a profitable venture for you and your family."

      "title": "Use egg substitutes in baking when real eggs are scarce or too pricey.",
      "content": "Use egg substitutes in baking when real eggs are scarce or too pricey. Eggs are essential ingredients in most baked goods. They not only act as a leavening agent that helps the food rise, but they also help emulsify (mix) oil and water (which don't normally combine very well). If eggs are in short supply near you or if the price is just too high for your budget, try these budget-friendly substitutes. [11] X Research source Mashed bananas or applesauce : Use 1 ripe mashed banana or 1/4 c (64 g) applesauce per egg to make muffins and sweet bread (i.e., pumpkin and zucchini) moist and flavorful. Chia seeds : Substitute 1 egg by stirring 1 US tbsp (15 ml) chia seeds into 3 tsp (15 ml) water and letting the mixture sit until it turns into a gel. Then add it to your cookie dough recipe. Flaxseed meal : For savory breads, substitute each egg with 1 US tbsp (15 ml) flaxseed meal mixed with 3 US tbsp (44 ml) water. Let the mixture sit until it becomes thick and gelatinous, then add it to your dough when you would normally add in an egg. Silken tofu : Use a 1/4 c (64 g) silken tofu to replace 1 egg in brownie and fudge bar recipes. Aquafaba (chickpea liquid) : Use 2 US tbsp (30 ml) of the liquid in a can of chickpeas – also known as aquafaba – for each egg in a recipe that calls for egg whites, like angel food cake."

      "content": "There's a very low risk of humans getting bird flu from store eggs. The US Food and Drug Administration says there's a very low chance that eggs infected with the bird flu will ever arrive on grocery store shelves because of how often they test poultry for disease. Regular, frequent testing and other safeguards help ensure that bird flu cases are detected early and that the infected birds' eggs don't make it to the store. [12] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Even if you were to get an egg laid by a hen infected with the bird flu, the US Food and Drug Administration reassures us that the disease is highly unlikely to transfer from the egg to a human – as long as the egg has been properly cooked. The minimum safe internal temperature for cooked eggs is 160 °F (71 °C). [13] X Research source"
