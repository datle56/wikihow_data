This can be some place public like a shop or the living room of your home with your family or your roommates. [1] X Research source This will make it harder for you to give in to the urge to cut. It also might make you feel better, especially if you are around people who love and support you."

This can be a family member, a trusted friend, or a hotline. It might be helpful to create a phone list of people you can call. You can also program needed numbers into your phone. There are many hotlines you can call or text for help. One is 988 , a 24-hour crisis lifeline for those who are about to self-harm or are in an emergency situation. You can also call 1-800-334-HELP , the Self Injury Foundation’s 24-hour national crisis line. Also try 1-800-DONT-CUT , which provides information about self-harm. If you hurt yourself or want to see a doctor, call 1-800-366-8288 , which is S.A.F.E. Alternatives’ information line for immediate support and referrals to a local physician. If you are in the UK, you can call the Samaritans at 116 123 , which is an agency that runs 24/7 and is dedicated to moments when you want to self-harm. You can also call Childline, a hotline for children and teens at 0800 1111 . Both numbers are free from mobiles and landlines and neither will appear on your phone bill."

      "title": "Distract yourself.",
      "content": "Distract yourself. One great way to avoid self-harm is to distract yourself. Not every distraction technique works for everyone, so you may need to try a few before you find which one works for you. Sometimes the trigger or urge can be different depending on your feelings or the situation, which means your response to prevent or stop self-harm will also be different. Try the butterfly method. When you have the urge to cut, draw a butterfly where you want to harm yourself and name it after a loved one or someone that wants you to get better. If you cut, the butterfly dies. You have to wash it off. If it wears off and you didn't cut, it is released into the wild to be free. Another idea is the pen method. Grab a pen and draw lines, squiggles, peace signs, or any symbol all over where you would've cut. When you're done, count the lines. That's how many scars you won't have. If these don’t work, try to brush or style your hair, make a cup of tea, count up to 500 or 1000, work on a puzzle or mind game, go people watching, play a musical instrument, watch TV or a movie, paint your nails, organize something like books or your closet, make origami to occupy your hands, be active, play a sport, take a walk, make up a dance routine, or do an art project or color in a picture. The possibilities are endless. It just has to be something that will adequately distract you."

      "content": "Delay cutting. Whenever the urge to cut arises, delay the cutting. Start with a small amount of time such as 10 minutes and increase the time you wait each time. While you wait, think about the scars you don’t want and about how you don’t have to hurt yourself even though you're thinking about it or maybe want to do it. Repeat affirmations to yourself, such as “I don’t deserve to be hurt,” even if you don’t believe it at first. Remember that you always have the choice not to cut. The decision is truly up to you."

They help address the urges and often release the same feel good chemicals, called endorphins, in your brain that are released during self-harming. [2] X Research source One common self-soothing technique is called the five senses technique, which provides a way to a helpful state of mind to address the painful or extreme feelings leading to self-harm. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source Start in a comfortable position, either sitting on the floor with your legs crossed or in a chair with your feet planted flat on the ground. Start focusing on your breathing. Next, start to bring awareness to each of your senses. Spend about one minute on each sense, focusing on only one at a time. Hearing: Focus on external sounds. Are they cars going by, people talking? Next, focus on internal sounds. Can you hear your breathing or digestion? As you focus on hearing, did you notice anything you did not before? Smelling: What do you smell? Is there food near you? Or maybe flowers outside? You might notice smells you did not before. Try closing your eyes to sharpen your other senses. Seeing: What do you see? Can you see out a window? Take notice of details such as colors, patterns, shapes, and textures. Tasting: What do you taste? Notice anything you can taste in your mouth, maybe from a morning coffee or your lunch. Move your tongue around to engage your taste buds, checking for any additional tastes you encounter. Touching: Feel the sensation of your skin being touched. This can be from the carpet under your feet or legs, the clothes on your skin, or the air moving across your face. Feel the chair you are sitting in. [4] X Research source"

Meditation or prayer might seem like a silly practice, but scientific studies have been done that shows meditation improves positive emotions, satisfaction, health, and happiness. It also decreases anxiety, stress, and depression. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are many different types of mediation, but the goal of all mediation is about calming the mind. Start in a comfortable seated position. Have a single point to focus on. This can be visual, such a fixed point in the room, auditory, such as a repeated single word or prayer, or physical, such as counting beads on a rosary. While you are focusing on the repeated task or stationary object, your mind will wander. When you notice your thoughts wandering, let the thought go and bring your concentration back to your focus point. This might sound easy, but focusing the mind is challenging. Do not be disappointed if you can only focus for a few minutes at first. Keep trying until you can spend hours releasing your thoughts and clearing your mind."

Next, focus on one group of muscles that you can tense and then relax. Tense these muscles for five seconds, squeezing just the muscle group you are working on at that moment. After five seconds, relax all of the muscles in that area and stay relaxed for 15 seconds. Then move on to the next muscle group. Repeat this multiple times a day if needed. Isolation of particular muscle groups can be difficult, but it gets easier with practice. Common areas include your face, hands and arms, stomach or middle section, and legs and feet. Wear loose fitting clothing so you are comfortable. [9] X Research source"

Any activity that will help you release the emotions you typically express through cutting will help you avoid cutting in the future. Finding the right outlet can take time.

Use post-it notes or taped pieces of paper to leave positive phrases about yourself around your living areas. You can also write messages on your mirror, on a window, or on dry erase boards. This way, you will see the reminders every day and it will help improve you mood. It will also help you see positive messages when you are thinking about cutting. Good examples of positive phrases include: I am lovable. I am special. I am confident. I can achieve my goals. I am beautiful/handsome. My feelings are just feelings. My emotions will not last forever. Emotions are not facts. Harming myself does not solve my problems. Harming myself might provide quick relief, but not long term relief. I can overcome my anger/sadness/anxiety without harming. I can trust someone with my feelings right now. I can seek support. I’m going to make it."

Learn to acknowledge your thoughts because they are often a habit. Some people find it helpful to create a journal to help record the daily thought processes. Writing them down allows you to critically think about your feelings and thoughts as well as process how to handle things differently. The goal is not to change your thoughts but to become aware of the thoughts. This will help you acknowledge them, which will help you not passively act on these negative thoughts that lead to self-harming behaviors.

Look at your thought record and assess any similar situation you ended up in. Did you learn anything from these situations and what were the long term consequences? Did you handle any situations differently than other days? Did you act on negative thoughts? A good way to assess negative thoughts is to look for statements with words like should, ought, or must. These types of statements lead to messages of all or nothing. These negative, often harsh thoughts about yourself can lead to self-harm. Looking at your thoughts journal, what were some alternative thoughts you could have had? Write down the alternative and positive statements that undermine the negative thoughts you had. Ask a friend or trusted family member if you are unsure if thoughts are true."

Get rid of any objects you have used before to self-harm. If you have to spend time searching for something to harm yourself with, you may be able to crush the impulse. The time to think about your actions or the added effort can act as deterrents. Don't keep sharp objects on your table and don't put razors in drawers or cupboards that you can easily access. [16] X Research source If you do not yet feel able to throw out your tools, try to delay getting to them by keeping them wrapped up tightly and high up on hard-to-reach shelves. If possible, give them to someone else. This is a guaranteed way that they won't be find-able.

[17] X Research source Some people are more likely to cut at certain times of the day. If you know that you're more prone to cutting in the morning, take extra caution just after you roll out of bed. Know yourself and what to do to handle the next urge. If you've just had an argument with somebody close to you, for example, and are having the urge to self-harm, stop and ask yourself what's making you feel this way: \"I feel like harming myself because I've just had an argument with somebody I love, and it's making me feel really bad.\" Determine what in particular makes this situation trigger negative emotions, such as a certain feeling or maybe an action.

Consider going to group therapy, where you'll be able to see that there are other people struggling with the same issue. If you're a minor, tell your parent or guardian that you need to see a mental health professional as soon as possible. Emphasize that this is an emergency. If you're an adult and have health insurance, call your primary care physician as soon as possible and ask for a referral to a therapist or psychologist who specializes in self-harm.

Someone who self-harms, however, is often the exact opposite because the person intentionally harms themselves to feel alive or cope with life. [20] X Research source Research does show people who self-harm are more likely to commit suicide later. This is often correlated with other factors such as depression, feeling as if there are fewer reason to live, or feeling hopeless. Make sure you take any suicidal thoughts seriously and seek help. Look for distinct signs of suicide, such as talking about wanting to die or to kill themselves, looking for a way to kill themselves, making statements about being hopeless, or talking about having no reason to live.
