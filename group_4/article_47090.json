      "content": "Beware of apps that claim they can get around Instagram privacy settings. While there are many websites that claim you can view private Instagram accounts by installing certain apps, none of these apps work. There's no conceivable way for any app or website to show you private Instagram posts. Since 2018, the Instagram API (Application Programming Interface) only allows third parties to display content from an Instagram user's own account. [2] X Research source If you sign in to an \"Instagram viewer\" with your account, you'll only see the content that's available to your Instagram account. Some \"private Instagram viewer\" apps and websites are advertising scams that make money when you complete \"verification\" steps, even though these steps don't ever result in making private accounts visible. Not entirely malicious, but not at all trustworthy! Other \"private Instagram viewer\" sites and apps are flat out malware . To keep your information safe, never provide your credit card information or Instagram login credentials to an app that claims it will show you private Instagram posts or stories."

If you're looking for a private Instagram user's Reels or Stories, don't forget to check their TikTok account—a lot of TikTok users cross-post their videos to their Instagram Reels and Stories, so you're likely to find a lot of their private Instagram videos publicly available on TikTok. Of course, this won't be helpful if their TikTok is also private. [3] X Research source"
