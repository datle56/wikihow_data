      "content": "Cut a strip of paper twice as wide as the stuffed toy. Lay out your wrapping paper and put the stuffed toy on top of it. Roll the toy inwards towards the center of the wrapping paper to see how wide you need to cut, then use scissors to cut a strip of paper off the roll. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fold the edges of the paper to meet in the middle.",
      "content": "Fold the edges of the paper to meet in the middle. Smooth out your strip of wrapping paper and fold the outer edges in toward each other vertically. Make sure they are just barely touching in the middle without overlapping. [2] X Research source Double check that the toy will fit inside of the wrapping paper and that it can fold closed on top of the toy."

    {
      "title": "Tape the edges of the paper together in the middle.",
      "content": "Tape the edges of the paper together in the middle. Add 2 to 3 pieces of clear tape to the middle of the wrapping paper to hold the edges together. Leave room at the top and bottom of the wrapping paper so you can still open it up. [3] X Research source Clear tape won’t disrupt the pattern on the wrapping paper."

      "title": "Make a 2 in (5.1 cm) fold at the bottom of the paper.",
      "content": "Make a 2 in (5.1 cm) fold at the bottom of the paper. Situate the wrapping paper so that it faces you vertically. Grab the bottom of the wrapping paper rectangle and fold it upwards, but don’t tape it down. [4] X Research source You don’t need to use a ruler to make the fold. Just estimate a couple of inches."

    {
      "title": "Press the outer edges of the fold inward.",
      "content": "Press the outer edges of the fold inward. Let go of the fold in your wrapping paper so it stands up on its own. Press down on each vertical edge of the fold so that it creates a diamond shape, then crease the paper so the diamond stays in place. [5] X Research source Make sure you create sharp creases in the paper to make a strong base for your pouch."

      "title": "Fold the bottom and top of the diamond inward and tape them down.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom and top of the diamond inward and tape them down. Grab the top point of the diamond and fold it down about 1 in (2.5 cm), then use clear tape to secure it in place. Do the same thing to the bottom point of the diamond. [6] X Research source This will be the bottom part of the pouch, so your folds don’t have to look perfect."

      "content": "Roll the top of the pouch downwards and tape it closed. Grab the top part of the pouch and make a 1 in (2.5 cm) crease. Keep making small creases downwards until you reach the top of the toy inside the pouch, then tape it up. [8] X Research source Add a cute bow or ribbon to your pouch for added flair, and don’t forget to write who it’s for on the outside!"

      "content": "Put the stuffed toy in a box, then wrap the box. Tape up the sides and top of the box so that they don’t open up. Use wrapping paper to cover the outside of the box and add a bow or ribbon on top to make it look cute. This is a super easy way to wrap a large stuffed toy. You can even trick someone by placing multiple boxes inside of one box and having them unwrap each one."

      "content": "Wrap a large toy in a plastic tablecloth for a pop of color. Spread out a colored table cloth on a flat surface and place the toy in the very center. Gather up all of the edges of the table cloth and pile them on top of the toy. Wrap up the excess table cloth with a ribbon and tie it in a bow for a securely wrapped toy. You can reuse the tablecloth afterwards for parties or get-togethers."

      "content": "Tie up small toys in tissue paper to look like candy. Tie the legs and arms of the stuffed toy down until the entire thing is one long, slender line. Find 2 to 3 pieces of tissue paper that are 2 to 3 times the length of the toy, then roll the toy up in them. Tie up the excess ends of the paper with a ribbon on each side to make the stuffed toy look like a delicious piece of candy. Be gentle as you roll the toy in the tissue paper so that it doesn’t rip. Choose dark colored tissue paper so it isn’t see-through."

[9] X Research source You can find large balloons at most party supply stores. Keep the balloon away from your child until you're ready for him/her to pop it."
