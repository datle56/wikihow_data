      "title": "Scrunch aluminium foil into 2 inches (5.1 cm) balls.",
      "content": "Scrunch aluminium foil into 2 inches (5.1 cm) balls. Rip off pieces of foil and scrunch them into a ball. Continue to add foil to the ball until it is about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide and high. Screw the aluminium foil up nice and tight so that the balls don’t come unravelled while the tamales are steaming. [1] X Research source Try to make the 3 balls a similar size and shape so that the plate can easily balance on the balls."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place the balls into the pot and arrange them into a triangle shape.",
      "content": "Place the balls into the pot and arrange them into a triangle shape. Choose a pot that is large enough to fit a plate inside it. Put the aluminium balls around the edges of the pot to form a triangle shape. This will give the plate an even stand to rest on. [2] X Research source Make sure that the pot has a lid as this is essential for the steaming process."
    },
    {
      "title": "Balance a heat-proof plate on top of the aluminium balls.",
      "content": "Balance a heat-proof plate on top of the aluminium balls. Pick a plate that fits in the pot with at least a 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap from the edge of the pot. This will give you room to pour water into the bottom of the pot. Adjust the position of the plate until it sits evenly over the 3 aluminium balls. [3] X Research source Choose a plate that is heat-proof so that it doesn’t crack or melt when the water starts to boil. Look at the bottom of the plate for a heat-proof sign to indicate that it is safe to use. If the plate is ceramic or made from thick glass, it's safe to use."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pour water under the plate.",
      "content": "Pour water under the plate. Use a jug to pour cold tap water under the plate. Continue to fill the pot until the water is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the plate. [4] X Research source Avoid pouring water up to the line of the plate as this can cause the tamales to get wet when the water begins to boil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread the tamales across the plate.",
      "content": "Spread the tamales across the plate. Place the tamales onto the plate with the open side facing up. Spread the tamales out across the plate so that they steam evenly. If you are cooking a lot of tamales, layer them on top of each other. [5] X Research source Make sure that the plate is nice and balanced before placing the tamales onto it. This avoids the tamales accidentally tipping into the water. If necessary, rearrange the placement of the aluminium balls to make the plate more stable. This method can be used for fresh and frozen tamales."

    {
      "title": "Bring the water to a boil.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil. Place the pot onto the stove top, turn the heat up to medium, and wait for the water to boil. Put a lid on the pot to help speed up the boiling process. [6] X Research source Be careful when moving the pot not to shake the tamales into the water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn down the heat and leave the tamales to steam for 1 hour.",
      "content": "Turn down the heat and leave the tamales to steam for 1 hour. Turn the heat down to low and put the lid on the pot if it isn’t on already. The lid traps the moisture and heat inside the pot which helps to steam the tamales. [7] X Research source Set a timer for 1 hour to help remind you to check the tamales. Check the pot occasionally to make sure that there is still water under the plate. If required, add more water to the bottom of the pot."

    {
      "title": "Remove the tamales from the pot and leave them to cool for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Remove the tamales from the pot and leave them to cool for 5 minutes. Use a pair of metal tongs to transfer the tamales from the pot to a plate. The tamales will be piping hot so it best to leave them to cool for 5 minutes before eating them. Enjoy the tamales warm with your favourite side salad. [8] X Research source Leave the plate inside the pot for an hour to cool. This makes it much safer and easier to remove for cleaning."

      "content": "Line the steamer with a single layer of banana leaves. Place the banana leaves into the steamer to provide a barrier between the boiling water and the tamales. Make sure that the entire base of the steamer is covered with the leaves. If you don’t have any banana leaves, use strips of corn husks instead. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the tamales into the steamer.",
      "content": "Place the tamales into the steamer. Spread the tamales across the base of the steamer with the open side facing up. If you have lots of tamales, stack a second layer over the bottom layer. Spread the tamales evenly across the steamer so that they cook at a similar speed. [10] X Research source Don’t steam more than 2 layers of tamales at a time as this makes it difficult for the steam to reach the middle layers."

      "title": "Leave the tamales to steam for 1 hour and 20 minutes.",
      "content": "Leave the tamales to steam for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Place the steamer rack into the steamer and place the lid on. Set a timer to help remind you to check the tamales. If the water in the steamer stops boiling, simply turn the heat up. [11] X Research source Check the steamer occasionally to ensure that there is still plenty of water boiling. If necessary, add more water."

      "title": "Leave the tamales to rest for 30 minutes in the covered steamer.",
      "content": "Leave the tamales to rest for 30 minutes in the covered steamer. Turn the heat off but leave the tamales in the steamer with the lid on. This helps the tamales to soften further and brings out the flavours. Set a timer to signal when 30 minutes is up. [12] X Research source"

Corn chips, guacamole, beans, and salsa are delicious Mexican side options. [13] X Research source The tamales will be really hot. If you prefer the tamales warm, wait five minutes for them to cool slightly."
