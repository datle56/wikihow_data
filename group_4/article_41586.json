      "content": "Place an opened bag of white rice into a plastic zipper bag. If you’ve already opened the bag of rice and plan to use the rice often, simply put it into a larger zipper bag for easy access. Seal it up most of the way and then push out as much air as you can before sealing it completely. Toss it in the pantry for up to 2 years or in the refrigerator for up to 10 years. Even though rice lasts a long time, it’s best to use it sooner rather than later. This will work for brown rice as well, but it will only stay fresh or 6 months in the pantry and 1 year in the refrigerator or freezer. If you often wash and reuse plastic storage bags, make sure the bag is completely dry before putting the rice in—any moisture can cause mold to grow on the granules."

      "content": "Pour uncooked rice into airtight plastic bins for easy access. Choose sturdy plastic bins with well-fitting lids to ensure the rice is exposed to the least amount of air as possible. Make sure the bins are washed and dried beforehand and don’t have any holes or cracks that pests can sneak into. This is a great option if you cook rice often since you can scoop out what you need and reseal the container with ease. [1] X Research source You can buy food-grade storage bins online or from any superstore with a cookware section. Stored this way, brown rice will last 6 months and while rice will last up to 10 years. However, you should always check it for signs of spoilage (discoloration, odd smell, weevils) before cooking it. Pests can be the biggest menace when storing large amounts of dried goods like rice, so take the time to thoroughly examine the container for holes or cracks before pouring your rice into it."

      "content": "Vacuum-seal white rice in food-grade bags for long-term storage. Pour the rice into food-safe vacuum bags and use a vacuum sealer to suck all the air out of the bag and seal it up. If you plan to use small portions of the rice sooner rather than later, you may want to put the bulk of it into a large food-grade vacuum bag and dole out single or double portions into smaller bags. The rice will stay fresh for 10 years or longer if you store it in a cool, dry place. [2] X Research source This is a great option if you’re looking to save space in your pantry—you can pile multiple vacuum-packed bags into a large basket or bin to keep them organized. Toss the vacuum-packed bag of rice into the freezer to make it last 30 years or more. This isn’t a good option to store brown rice because the natural oils will cause it to spoil."

Transfer the rice from its original packaging into mylar bags, toss in 1 to 3 oxygen absorbers (depending on the size of the bag) and then seal them shut using a hot iron. Store the individual mylar bags in a large food-grade bin with a lid. [3] X Research source For smaller bags that only hold 3 to 5 cups of rice, use 1 (100cc) oxygen absorber. Larger bags require 3 to 5 oxygen absorbers (300cc to 500cc) to work properly over a long period of time. This is a good option if you’re planning to store rice for 30 years or more. Don’t put brown rice into mylar bags—the oils will seep out of the granules and cause the rice to spoil."

Place the airtight bags or containers of rice in a pantry or cupboard—anywhere away from heat or light is a good spot. Make sure the room is air-conditioned or at least has a fan to ensure good air flow. Stale or stagnant air could increase the humidity in the room and can cause the rice to go bad faster. Use a dehumidifier if you live in a hot, humid area—especially if you’re storing the rice in a garage or separate storage facility outside of your home.

Put the rice toward the back of a shelf for long-term storage so you don’t have to move it to get to things you might use more frequently. The center or bottom shelves of the freezer or refrigerator are usually the best spots because they’re colder. The door of your refrigerator or freezer is the warmest spot and experiences more temperature shifts, so don’t put the rice there.

[12] X Research source It may help to have a friend hold the mylar bag or to set it upright inside of a bucket while you pour the rice in. If you plan to use some of the rice in the near future, use smaller mylar bags to hold single or double servings of rice. Mylar bags come in sizes ranging from 4 in (10 cm) by 6 in (15 cm) to 20 in (51 cm) by 30 in (76 cm). You can easily store 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of rice in 3 large 1-gal (3.7-litre) mylar bags."
