      "content": "These two will fall for each other, but they’ll probably meet by chance. A Taurus man doesn’t stray from his routine often, and a Sagittarius woman is constantly on the go, not wanting to visit the same place twice.

      "content": "A Taurus man-Sagittarius woman’s sex life will be explosive…at first. Taurus men are more sensual than sexual and enjoy the physical pleasure of sex.

In return, he’ll have to try new things and be more spontaneous. A Taurus man’s sensual and luxurious approach to sex isn’t so surprising—he’s governed by Venus, the planet of love, beauty, and money, after all!"

      "content": "Taurus men need stability, but Sagittarius women can’t settle down.

      "content": "Taurus and Sagittarius may drift apart due to a lack of communication. These two will rarely argue—instead, they’re more likely to let issues simmer until the relationship reaches a breaking point. If they do fight, it may get ugly.

      "content": "Taurus men and Sagittarius women have deep, interesting chats. A Taurus man likes to dig deep into the topics he’s interested in—current events, entertainment, science, or anything. A well-traveled Sagittarius woman can share real-life stories and experiences about what he loves and draw him into conversation (it helps that she’s ruled by Jupiter, the planet of learning, wisdom, and expansion). They both enjoy a variety of topics, so chances are they’ll never run out of things to talk about. [6] X Research source Their conversations can range from very serious to lighthearted. They may be deep in debate one minute and cackling together the next! Both partners have strong, compatible senses of humor."

      "title": "A Sagittarius woman needs space while a Taurus man needs stability.",
      "content": "A Sagittarius woman needs space while a Taurus man needs stability. She needs adventure and excitement and loves traveling, moving, and action. On the other hand, a Taurus man needs stability—someone who shares his views, wants to plan their life out, and won’t pull the rug out from under him. This is a Taurus-Sagittarius pair’s biggest difference, and it can lead to their separation if there’s no compromise. A Sagittarius woman lives a fast-paced life. A Taurus man may not want to keep up with her, and she’s too busy to wait around for him to catch up. Taurus men value money and work hard for a comfortable lifestyle. A Sagittarius woman is unpredictable with work and money, which may irritate him."

      "title": "Sagittarius’s flirtatious nature could alienate Taurus.",
      "content": "Sagittarius’s flirtatious nature could alienate Taurus. A Sagittarius woman is a natural charmer with plenty of male friends. This won’t always sit well with Taurus, who tends to be possessive over his partners. He can accept her friends, but he'll be very upset if he thinks she’s flirting with them. This can lead to arguments about his controlling nature and her flightiness. A Sagittarius woman is more likely to cheat than a Taurus man. There won't be secrecy, though—she’s so honest that she’ll come forward if anything happens."

      "title": "Focus on open and honest communication.",
      "content": "Focus on open and honest communication. To make a relationship last, these two will have to set some ground rules about their communication. The Taurus man needs to speak his mind more often instead of falling into stubborn silence, and the fiery Sagittarius needs to resist cutting him off and actually listen to his needs. [7] X Research source An angry Sagittarius has a tendency to talk over a somewhat sensitive Taurus man, which can bruise his ego and deepen the conflict. If these two can’t keep their communication respectful, there’s a good chance the relationship will end in a bad breakup."

      "content": "Work on understanding and respecting each other’s differences. At a deep level, a Taurus man and Sagittarius woman want different things in life—he wants a traditional, cozy home and she wants to travel the world commitment-free. If they have a true love connection, they’ll need to accept these things about each other to make it long-term. The Taurus man may have to adjust to being home alone sometimes and not judging Sagittarius for her eccentric lifestyle. The Sagittarius woman may have to find ways to fulfill herself at home and attend to the needs of another person from time to time."

      "content": "A Taurus man and Sagittarius woman need compromise and love. In some ways, it’s the perfect pair—a Taurus man can ground a Sagittarius woman and show her the value of a stable life, and she can show him the passion he needs to get unstuck from his ways. If both partners love each other enough to compromise , then this can be a strong, long-term match. [8] X Research source The Taurus man will have to learn to let go of control and get comfortable with the Sagittarius woman going out on her own from time to time.
