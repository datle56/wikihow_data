      "content": "Consider if you’re willing to risk your friendship to reveal your feelings. This is perhaps the most important thing to consider before you tell a female friend that you like her. Revealing your feelings may cause the relationship to become awkward or even end if she doesn’t feel the same way. [1] X Research source It’s also possible that she will return your feelings and the two of you might have a rewarding romantic relationship."

      "title": "Look for signs that she’s interested",
      "content": "Look for signs that she’s interested in you romantically. Think about how she interacts with you and whether she has said or done anything to indicate that she might have feelings for you, too. Some things to watch for as evidence that a girl might like you include: [2] X Research source Body language cues, such as smiling, leaning in towards you, watching your mouth, touching you lightly, etc. Messaging you often, either just to chat with you or to make plans with you. Asking you lots of questions about yourself and showing genuine interest in you. Mirroring your body movements, such as placing an elbow on the table in front of them when you do."

      "title": "Imagine how you would feel if you never got a chance to tell her.",
      "content": "Imagine how you would feel if you never got a chance to tell her. If you’re on the fence about whether or not to tell her how you feel, taking the opposite perspective may help you to decide if you should say something. Try to imagine how you might feel if she moved away and you never told her how you felt. Would it feel like a missed opportunity? Would you be sad about not having told her? If so, then you may want to tell her as soon as possible. [3] X Research source If the idea of not telling her makes you feel relieved, then it might be better to say nothing for now."

      "title": "Talk with a trustworthy friend about your feelings for the girl.",
      "content": "Talk with a trustworthy friend about your feelings for the girl. Mulling over your feelings on your own is unlikely to help you decide if you should tell her. Instead, grab a trustworthy friend and tell them what you’re thinking. They can offer their perspective on the situation, which might help you to decide if you should say something. [4] X Research source For example, your friend might tell you whether or not they see you and this person together, or if your friend has ever said anything about liking you or given any signs that they might, such as by flirting with you."

      "content": "Drop hints and flirt with her to see what happens. If you’re not quite ready to tell your friend how you feel, flirting with her might help you to decide.

      "content": "Choose a good time and place to talk with your friend. Telling someone you like them is a delicate conversation, so make sure you will have time and privacy to do it properly. Ask your friend when might be a good time for her and arrange to meet up with her at a designated place. [7] X Research source Avoid talking with her in front of other people. Make sure that you will be alone for the conversation and in a place you both are comfortable with. Try meeting up at a café and getting a corner table if you want to meet somewhere in public, or arrange to meet up at your house or hers for more privacy."

Breathe in through your nose to the count of 5, then hold the breath for 5 seconds, and exhale through your mouth to the count of 5. This should help you to feel calm, which will make it easier to talk without getting overly emotional.

[11] X Research source Try saying something like, “Amanda, you’re one of my closest friends, and I also think I have developed some romantic feelings for you. It’s totally fine if you don’t feel the same way, but I wanted to tell you because I think I might regret it if I don’t.” Or for an even simpler option, you could simply say, “Janice, I like you as more than a friend.

Keep the text short and simple. Try to let her know how you feel in 2-3 sentences, and let her know it’s okay if she doesn’t feel the same way. Try to end the text so it does not require a response if she’s uncomfortable responding. Plan to send the text in the afternoon or evening, not late at night or early in the morning since she may be annoyed by a text at an odd hour. [12] X Research source Try texting her something like, “Hi Melanie. I love spending time with you and I think I might have feelings for you, too. I don’t know if that's something that you're interested in exploring, but I just needed to tell you how I feel.” Or, you could text her, “Christina, I’m going out on a limb here, but I think I am falling for you. I understand if you don’t feel the same way, but let me know if you do.”"

However she responds, listen attentively and don’t interrupt her. [14] X Research source Try nodding and keeping a neutral expression while she talks to show her that you’re listening to her."
