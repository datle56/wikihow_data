      "content": "Wash the surface with alcohol, bleach, and hot water. Wet a cloth with rubbing alcohol and set it on the crack to soften any leftover caulk. Then, wet a rag with warm water and diluted bleach to disinfect the surface. Then, rinse the area with a different rag soaked in hot water. [4] X Research source Dry the surface with a towel when you’re finished since new caulk won’t adhere when it’s wet. [5] X Research source Caulking traps anything inside the crack so make sure all dirt is completely removed. If you see any caulk or grime left over, use a plastic scraper to lift it up. If you're removing silicone caulk from tiles, heat it up with a hair dryer or apply a commercial solvent."

      "content": "Protect the surrounding surface with painter's tape . Stick one long strip above the crack and one right below it. This tape keeps the caulk off of anything nearby so it doesn’t stick or harden where you don’t want it. It also acts as insurance in case you make a mistake later on. [6] X Research source Using painter's tape also makes the edges of your caulk line clean and smooth."

      "content": "Cut the nozzle on a tube of caulk to a 45-degree angle. Use a pair of s cissors to cut the nozzle so it’s about the size of the crack. If the crack is large, consider cutting the nozzle close to the tube so more caulk comes out. If the crack is small, cut the nozzle near the end to be more precise. [8] X Research source This choice is permanent, so think carefully about the thickness before you make the cut. It's better to start closer to the end of the nozzle and make the opening bigger if you need to. [9] X Expert Source Barry Zakar Handyman Expert Interview. 20 August 2020."

Stick the metal piece into the end of the caulk’s nozzle until you feel it poke through the tube. If your caulk gun doesn’t have a small metal rod, then use a sharp nail to puncture the tube .

      "content": "Pull the trigger and move the gun over a piece of paper to practice. Hold the gun at a 45-degree angle with the nozzle facing downwards. Then, over a piece of paper, press the trigger at the back of the gun while moving the caulking gun steadily in one direction. The caulk will come out in a smooth, steady stream when you do it correctly. [12] X Research source If you move the caulking gun too fast, the caulk will look too thin and uneven. If you move the caulking gun too slowly, the caulk will be clumpy and unworkable. Take your time to find a good balance between the two.
