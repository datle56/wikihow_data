[1] X Research source If you don’t have a Tripoley board, mark off areas of the table or use small containers for each section of the board. The 8 board sections are: Ten of Hearts Jack of Hearts Queen of Hearts King of Hearts Ace of Hearts King and Queen of Hearts 8-9-10 Straight Kitty"

      "content": "Split the chips evenly between the players. Count out the chips in the game and divide them amongst the players. Give everyone the same number of chips. If there are any leftover, then put them back in the box. You can play Tripoley with 2-9 players, but it works best when you have 4-7 people. If you’re playing without the official game, use your own poker chips . Give each person about 20-30 chips so there’s enough to play a few rounds."

      "title": "Shuffle and deal the cards to the players.",
      "content": "Shuffle and deal the cards to the players. Use a standard deck of cards with the jokers removed. Choose one person to be the dealer and have them shuffle the cards . Deal one card at a time to all the players until the deck runs out. Each time before the dealer gives themselves a card, they add a card to a “dead” hand that’s not used in the round. It’s okay if some players have more cards than others. Keep your hand secret from other players."

      "title": "Take chips from a board section if you have matching Heart cards.",
      "content": "Take chips from a board section if you have matching Heart cards. Each player checks their hand for the cards listed on the different board sections. Whoever is holding the card (or cards) takes all the chips from the section and adds them to their supply right away. [3] X Research source You only get the “King and Queen of Hearts” section if you have both the King and Queen in your hand. If multiple people have an 8-9-10 straight of the same suit in their hands, then they split the chips from that section evenly. If no one has the King and Queen in the same hand or an 8-9-10 straight, leave the chips on the board for the next round."

Set aside any cards that aren’t used in the poker hand for now, but keep them close by.

To bet, place any number of chips from your personal supply into the Pot. The next player to the left can match the bet, add more chips to raise, or fold to quit the round. Keep taking turns until the only remaining players have placed matching bets. [5] X Research source You can only “pass” if no one else has placed a bet. You can set limits on the maximum chips you can bet during the poker section of the game."

Compare your hand strength, and take all the chips in the Pot if your hand is the strongest. [6] X Research source If players have the same poker hand, whoever has the highest-valued cards wins the Pot. Example: A player with a Four of a Kind of Aces beats a player with a Four of a Kind of Jacks. No suit is considered stronger than the other. If the players have the same hand strength and highest-valued cards, they split the pot evenly."

Whoever has the next highest card of the same suit plays it from their hand. If no one has the next card in sequence, then the count stops and the last person to play a card chooses the lowest card of a different suit to start the new count. [7] X Research source Example: If you play a 3 of spades, whoever has the 4 of spades plays it next. If the 4 of spades is played earlier or in the dead hand, you could start the next count with a 5 of diamonds."

Try to save as many chips as you can so you don’t lose them in a bet. Remember who revealed their Heart cards earlier in the round to know what other players have in their hands. Be conservative with your chips. If someone is being aggressive and raising the bet a lot, it’s probably better to fold. Try bluffing that you have a better poker hand to make other players fold. Keep a straight face, don’t react to your cards, and raise the bet to intimidate the other players."

However, you get to make a strategic decision if you get the chance to play a card from your hand. Play Aces if they’re the only card you have in a suit to take another turn and play another card immediately. Choose a suit that’s already been played so fewer players get to play their cards."

[13] X Research source There’s a chance some chips may get left on the board if players don’t all get a chance to play their cards.
