      "content": "Talk to your partner about what you want. Whenever you try new things with your partner, get warmed up by talking about it first. Not only is this a good way to make sure you’re both on the same page, but it can also get you both hot and bothered and ready to have some fun! [1] X Research source Be clear about what you want so that your partner knows what to expect and can let you know if they’re into it, too. For example, you might say, “You’re so gorgeous, I’d love to watch you play with yourself. Would that be okay with you?” or “Can we try touching each other until we both come? I think that would be so hot.”"

      "content": "Get vulnerable by touching yourselves in front of each other. Mutual masturbation can mean either touching each other, or touching yourselves—together! There are few things as exciting and intimate as pleasuring yourself in front of your lover or watching them pleasure themselves. If you’re not quite ready to lend them a hand, try doing a solo act in front of them or watching them while they masturbate. [2] X Research source One awesome thing about going solo together is that it’s a great way for you to learn what feels good to your partner, and vice versa. Ask them to pay close attention to what you’re doing so they’ll know what to do next time they get handsy with you. Don’t forget to return the favor and keep a close eye on their technique as well! [3] X Research source To ramp up the excitement, turn it into a game. For example, you might challenge yourselves to see if you can both come at the same time. If you’re too shy to jump right into putting on a show for each other, ease into it slowly. You could start by doing it with the lights off or under the covers until you’re both comfortable enough to be totally exposed. [4] X Research source"

[5] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Take it slow and be gentle with your partner, especially while you’re still figuring each other out. Remember, you’re dealing with some very sensitive areas! Even if you’re touching each other instead of yourselves, you can still take this as a mutual teaching and learning opportunity. For example, if your partner is giving you a hand job, you can put your own hand over theirs and guide their movements."

      "title": "Mix it up with some different positions.",
      "content": "Mix it up with some different positions. When you’re fooling around together, you don’t always have to do it the same way. Try different things to see what gets you going. For example, you could: [6] X Research source Lie down side by side, facing one another or on your backs. This is a good starting position, since it gives you the option to just gaze into each other’s eyes if you’re not ready to peek at what’s going on downstairs. You can either take care of yourselves or reach across to touch each other. Straddle your partner while they lie on their back, and lower yourself down onto their belly or chest. Have fun riding them while you both get busy with yourselves. Or, switch places and try it with your partner on top. Have your partner sit or lie down with their legs spread, then climb into their lap, facing away from them (or vice versa). Whoever is on top may need to shift their butt to one side so the person on the bottom can easily reach between their legs. If you both like to watch (and show off), sit facing each other with your legs spread on a bed or couch. Then, the two of you can get off in full view of one another."
