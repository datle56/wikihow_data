      "title": "Turn off the circuit in the area where you’re working.",
      "content": "Turn off the circuit in the area where you’re working. Look for the circuit box in your home, which is usually found in a basement, kitchen, or hallway. Even though you’ll use a new circuit for the garbage disposal, locate the breaker switch that controls the other outlets in your kitchen. Flip the breaker to the Off position so you don’t risk getting shocked if you accidentally cut into a wire. [1] X Research source Never cut into your walls or start working while there’s still power to the circuit, or else you could get electrocuted. If you aren’t sure what breakers control which room, contact an electrician to help you label them."

      "title": "Check for studs in the walls above and below your sink using a stud finder.",
      "content": "Check for studs in the walls above and below your sink using a stud finder. Hold the finder flat against the wall and turn it on. Slowly move the stud finder horizontally until it beeps, which means there’s a stud behind the drywall. Mark its location with a pencil using the line at the top of the finder as a guide. Then put the stud finder against the wall underneath your sink and mark the location of the stud you find. [2] X Research source Typically, you would place outlets for garbage disposals underneath the sink or in a cabinet."

      "title": "Buy electrical boxes for your switch and disposal outlet.",
      "content": "Buy electrical boxes for your switch and disposal outlet. Look for standard electrical boxes that are about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) deep for both the switch and the disposal so you have room for all of the wiring. Choose plastic electrical boxes that have winged hinges on the top and bottom since they’re easier to install and don’t require a stud as an anchor. [3] X Research source You can get electrical boxes from your local hardware store. The electrical boxes will hold the wires so they don’t get tangled or caught inside your walls. If you have an outlet for a dishwasher underneath your sink, you can also use it for your garbage disposal and don’t need to buy a new box."

      "title": "Trace the switch’s electrical box on the wall above your sink.",
      "content": "Trace the switch’s electrical box on the wall above your sink. Hold the front of the switch’s box against the wall over your countertop. Try to position the box directly above the sink so it’s easier to run the wires down to the outlet below it. Make sure that the top of the box is level before tracing around it with a pencil. [4] X Research source If you can’t position the switch box right above the sink, try to keep it between the studs on either side of the sink since you’ll still be able to run wires down easily."

      "title": "Position the outlet’s electrical box under your sink and trace its outline.",
      "content": "Position the outlet’s electrical box under your sink and trace its outline. Access the wall underneath your sink basin and find a spot that lines up vertically with the switch box. Hold the front of the outlet’s electrical box against the wall and ensure the top stays level. Use a pencil to draw an outline around the box so you know where to cut through the wall. [5] X Research source Keep the outlet and the switch between the same studs so you can run wires straight down. Otherwise, you may have to drill holes horizontally through the studs when you start wiring."

      "title": "Cut around the outlines for the boxes with a drywall saw.",
      "content": "Cut around the outlines for the boxes with a drywall saw. Hold the tip of the saw against the corner of your outline and slowly push it through your drywall. Use a back and forth sawing motion to cut a straight line until you reach the corner on the opposite side. Pull the saw out from the drywall and push the blade through the next line. Remove the cut-out section of drywall when you’re finished, and repeat the process on the hole for the outlet. [6] X Research source If you’re unable to cut through your wall with a drywall saw, you may need to contact a professional or use a reciprocating saw ."

      "content": "Have an electrician run a 12/2 wire from the circuit box to the switch hole. Contact an electrician and let them know you’re installing a new switch and outlet for a garbage disposal. Allow them to install a dedicated circuit in your home’s main electrical box and let them run wires to the hole you made for the switch. The electrician will leave enough excess wiring for you to add you to connect the switch. [7] X Research source A 12/2 cord contains 1 black hot wire, 1 white neutral wire, and 1 green or bare ground wire. If you have a dishwasher, the electrician may connect the garbage disposal wiring to the same circuit."

Slide the fish tape into the switch hole above your counter and push it down. When you see the fish tape from the outlet hole under your sink, pull about 1 foot (30 cm) out from the wall. Cut the 12/3 wire with a pair of wire cutters so there’s 1 foot (30 cm) of excess hanging out of the switch hole. [9] X Research source You can buy 12/3 cord and wire fish tape from your local hardware store. A 12/3 cord has 1 black hot wire, 1 red hot wire, 1 white neutral wire, and 1 green or bare ground wire."
