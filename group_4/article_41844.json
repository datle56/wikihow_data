      "title": "Break the material down into small pieces.",
      "content": "Break the material down into small pieces. It’s easier to process and remember information if you break it up into bite-sized chunks. Instead of trying to memorize an entire chapter of your textbook, focus on one short section or key piece of information at a time. [1] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to remember vocabulary for a language class, don’t try to memorize more than 7-8 words at a time. If you’re studying from a textbook, it can be helpful to work with the structure of the book. Textbook chapters are usually divided into shorter sections that each provide a manageable amount of information. Focus on understanding and remembering one section before moving on to the next."

      "title": "Switch between different topics.",
      "content": "Switch between different topics. It can be helpful to alternate between studying different subjects, so that your brain compartmentalizes the information more effectively. Switching between topics that are very different from each other can help keep your brain from getting bogged down with trying to remember too much about one subject (or 2 very similar subjects) at once. Additionally, switching between topics will help you avoid getting burned out on any one topic. [2] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, memorize a poem , then move on to studying some algebra rules. Try spending about 50 minutes on each topic, then take a break for about 15 minutes before going on to the next one. Taking breaks will boost your productivity and help you concentrate.

      "title": "Take notes",
      "content": "Take notes . As you’re listening in class or reading your text, write down important pieces of information. Don’t write down every word you hear or read. Instead, summarize key concepts. This will force your brain to process the information and condense it to its most important elements. [4] X Research source If you can, take notes with a pen and paper. Writing notes by hand engages your brain in a different way than typing on a keyboard, and makes you take a little more time to think about what you are writing down. If you like to doodle while you take notes, that’s great! Doodling can help you pay attention and retain information.

      "title": "Test yourself.",
      "content": "Test yourself. As you study each section of the material, take breaks to quiz yourself. [6] X Research source You might do this by making flash cards, writing study questions for yourself, or doing the exercises or knowledge checks that are built into your textbook. If you’re studying with a friend, you can quiz each other. Quizlet can be a great help for quizzing yourself, either alone or with a friend. You can create your own digital flashcards based on your course material, or you can use flashcards prepared by other members. One way to test yourself is to ask yourself basic questions about the material as you go. For example, “What is the main point of this section of the text?” [7] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Self-quizzing not only helps you get a better idea of how well you understand the material, but it also forces your brain to work a little bit harder to remember."

      "title": "Space out your review sessions.",
      "content": "Space out your review sessions. When you’re trying to remember something, repeated exposure is important. This method works best if you give yourself enough time between reviews that you start to forget what you studied. Reviewing after a little time has gone by flexes your memory muscles and helps you learn the material at a deeper level. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source When you’re spacing out your review sessions, keep the intervals short at first, then gradually increase them. For example, if you studied something one day, sleep on it and do a little review the next day. Test yourself a couple days later, and then again a week after that. Try a study timer app like SuperMemo or Ultimate Study Timer to help you schedule your study intervals."

      "title": "Create memory cues, called mnemonic devices.",
      "content": "Create memory cues, called mnemonic devices. One of the easiest ways to access memories is to create associations that trigger those memories. That might mean using an acronym to remember information (for example, ROY G. BIV for the colors of the rainbow), using a pun or word play, or creating a distinctive mental image. [9] X Research source The most common mnemonic devices are creating acronyms that represent the words you're trying to remember, making an acrostic sentence where the first letter of each word represents what you're trying to remember, and using rhymes to remember. However, you can also use image association, especially if you're a visual person. Music is also a powerful memory trigger, so putting the information to a melody can be very helpful. There’s a reason countless generations of kids have been taught the alphabet in song form! Your memory cue doesn’t have to make sense to anyone but you. In fact, the weirder and more specific it is, the better. For example, if you’re trying to remember the ancient Greek word hepomai (“to follow”), you might picture a cool cartoon cat singing “I’m hep! Oh my! Everybody follow me!”"

      "title": "Explain the material to someone else.",
      "content": "Explain the material to someone else. Teaching is one of the best ways to learn. To be able to explain something, you must be able to understand it yourself. You have to summarize and express the material in a way that is clear and understandable to another person, and doing so can help you absorb and understand the material better.

      "title": "Give yourself plenty of time.",
      "content": "Give yourself plenty of time. If you really want to build enduring memories, you need plenty of time to understand, process, and review the information. Give yourself at least a couple weeks to study before a test . Last-minute cramming is ineffective at helping you retain what you’ve learned, and will leave you feeling tired, stressed, and overloaded with information. [11] X Research source Reader Poll: We asked 504 wikiHow readers how they like to prepare for a multiple choice exam, and 50% of them said studying in advance and following a study schedule. [Take Poll] This also works well for other types of quizzes and exams!"

      "content": "Sleep on it. Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep every night to be at their best. Getting enough sleep not only gives you energy and helps you concentrate, but it can also help you learn and remember. Your brain processes new information while you sleep, so you may find that you understand those difficult concepts better after a quick nap or a good night’s rest. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Get the most out of your sleep by practicing good “sleep hygiene”: [13] X Research source Don’t nap for more than 20-30 minutes during the day. Avoid using stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine, 6-8 hours before bedtime. [14] X Research source Having more than 1-2 alcoholic drinks in the evening can also disrupt your sleep. [15] X Research source Exercise at least 10 minutes a day to improve the quality of your sleep. Avoid eating evening meals that might cause heartburn or indigestion, such as spicy, acidic, or fatty foods. Develop a regular, relaxing bedtime routine . Put away your computer or smartphone, do some meditation or light stretching, and take a warm shower or bath. You might also try reading to help you fall asleep. Set aside about 30 minutes before bedtime each night to unwind. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source"

Eat lots of lean proteins (fish, lean meat, and leafy greens), whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and foods with healthy fats (like vegetable oils, fish, and nuts). [17] X Research source Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Some healthy fats, like DHA, may actually improve your memory.

      "content": "Take breaks. If you try to force yourself to study for too long in one sitting, you’ll soon start to nod off, or find your mind wandering. To make your studying more manageable and effective, try studying for an hour at a time. Take 5-15 minute breaks between study sessions to snack, stretch your legs, or put your head down for a quick catnap. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a comfortable study space. If you’re not comfortable, you’ll have a hard time concentrating on what you are studying. Find a space that is tidy, private, and comfortable, and that gives you plenty of room to spread out. If your preferred space doesn’t have a comfortable chair, consider bringing your own cushion with you. [20] X Research source Good study spaces could include a desk in your room, a study carrel or cubicle in your school library, or a table in a quiet coffee shop."

Find a place to study where you won’t be distracted by people talking, construction sounds, or other people’s music. If you can, put on a little quiet, non-distracting background music to help drown out bothersome noise. [21] X Research source If you have to study around other people, such as family or roommates, let them know in advance that you need to be left alone for a certain period of time while you study."
