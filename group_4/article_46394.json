      "content": "Understand that while toothpaste is great for cleaning silver jewelry, it can damage silver as well. [1] X Research source Toothpaste contains abrasive particles that can polish off tarnish. These same particles can scratch silver up as well. In particular, you should avoid using toothpaste on sterling silver, highly-polished silver, or anything that is silver-plated. These items are very soft and can be easily damaged by the toothpaste. The best way to clean these delicate items is to buff them with a silver polishing cloth. [2] X Research source Toothpaste is considered safe for satin or matte silver. Make sure that the patina is not intentional. Some jewelers intentionally \"age\" their pieces to make them look more rustic. Consider taking fragile or antique pieces to a professional cleaner."

[3] X Research source At the same time, however, you'll want to avoid using gel toothpaste because it isn't abrasive enough to remove tarnish."

      "content": "Dampen the silver with some water. This will help soften the toothpaste and make it easier to spread. You can dampen jewelry by squirting it with some water in a spray bottle, or by dipping it into a bowl filled with water. Avoid working over a sink; if you drop the jewelry, you may lose it down the drain."

      "content": "Apply a small amount of toothpaste to the jewelry. Start with a pea-sized amountâ€”smaller if you are cleaning something tiny, such as a post earring. You can use your finger, a sponge, a paper towel, or even a cotton swab to apply the toothpaste."

      "content": "Rub the jewelry gently with a damp tissue, paper towel, or cotton swab. Use a light touch so that you don't accidentally scratch the silver. Use tissues and paper towels for larger items, such as bracelets, and cotton swabs for small items, such as earring hooks. If you are cleaning a necklace chain, run the chain through a folded paper towel. Use caution around gemstones, especially around amber, emeralds, lapis, and turquoise. These tend to be very soft, and can easily be scratched up by toothpaste. The paper towel, tissue, or cotton swab may turn dark. This is a good thing; it is the tarnish coming off the jewelry."

[4] X Research source Some pieces, such as rings and brooches, have nooks and crannies that are hard to reach, even with a cotton swab. For these pieces, you can gently scrub them using a toothbrush. Baby toothbrushes and toothbrushes for sensitive gums tend to have the softest bristles. Don't use this toothbrush for anything else other than jewelry cleaning."

      "content": "Gently pat the jewelry dry with a soft cloth, then let it air-dry before putting it away. Use a soft cloth, such as microfiber, to dry the jewelry. Once you have gotten most of the water off, place it onto a clean, soft towel. Wait until it dries completely before storing it. This is especially important for pieces with lots of nooks and crannies, such as chains and ornate brooches."

[6] X Research source Here are some tips for storing silver jewelry: [7] X Research source Store chains and earrings in anti-tarnish or tarnish-proof bags. You can buy them in jewelry stores. [8] X Research source Wrap larger pieces, such as brooches and bracelets, in anti-tarnish cloths. [9] X Research source Get a jewelry box that is lined with tarnish-free material to limit the rate of tarnishing. Consider adding an anti-tarnish strip to your jewelry bags. You will need to change these strips every 2 to 3 months. Try adding a silica gel pack to your jewelry boxes. They will absorb the moisture."
