You should see a \"Silent Mode Off/On\" notification at the top of your screen that confirms your choice in the AssistiveTouch menu. Since the AssistiveTouch menu option overrides the physical button, your phone can get confused if you use both. If you're in doubt, restart your phone. If you're using at least iOS 14, you can set AssistiveTouch so you can tap the back of your phone to turn off Silent mode. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch > Back Tap to do so. Older iPhones (those not running iOS 14) can instead enable a tap, a double-tap, or a long press on the AssistiveTouch icon to enable and disable Silent mode. To set this up, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch and select either \"Single-tap\", \"Double-tap\", or \"Long Press.\" Finally, select Mute to indicate that the shortcut should silence your phone."
