      "content": "Cusps are the dividing lines between signs or houses on a natal chart. Zodiac cusp signs occur if you’re born during the transition period when the sun moves from one sign to another. This transition period usually takes place over 2 days—the sun’s last day in one sign or the sun’s first day in the next sign. However, because the sun changes signs on different dates each year, you may see longer time windows listed for cusp dates. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "People born on a cusp might feel like they have traits from 2 zodiac signs. In fact, the sun’s shifting energy can often highlight the best qualities of both traits while leaving out the less positive elements of each. The overall nature of change and forward momentum makes cusps a time of fortune and possibility. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Most professional astrologers think cusp signs are a myth. Since the sun can only be in one place at a time, astrologers stick by the logic that only the sun’s position at the exact moment of your birth can determine your zodiac sign. When elements of your personality don’t align with your given sign, it’s likely due to planet placements rather than cusps. [3] X Research source For instance, if you’re a Libra but have four planets in Scorpio, your Libran social butterfly tendencies might be overpowered by Scorpio’s air of mystery and need for intensity. You can also look to your ascendant (or “rising”) sign. The ascendant sign represents the way we present ourselves to others, so your ascendant’s influence could be the underlying reason you feel like you're a mix of signs. [4] X Research source"

You’ll do well in situations where you get to network with other people and move between social groups. You’re focused on the future, and you’ve got a plan to help you achieve your goals. When it comes to art, you might prefer practical media like architecture and documentaries over opera and painting."

[5] X Research source You might resonate with the term “empath” and deeply feel other people’s pain. You’re open-minded and willing to listen to everybody’s point of view.
