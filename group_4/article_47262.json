      "content": "Pick SLS-free shampoo. SLS stands for sodium lauryl sulfate which is too harsh for curly hair and can cause frizz. It is the key ingredient in most shampoos and detergents. Choose shampoos that use natural oils as alternatives. If you do not use the right conditioner with an SLS shampoo, it may lift your hair from its cuticle. Natural oils can help strengthen your hair and keep it shiny. Shampoo without SLS may not produce a rich lather but may add both bounce and gloss to your curls as well as help maintain your hair color. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Read the labels to ensure you limit the use of alcohol. Products with high Alcohol content tend to create crunchy curls as they suck the moisture out of your hair and can even lead to breakage. Use water-soluble gels as an alternative. They should not feel sticky to the touch. You may also use aerated mousses or foams. Aerated foams and mousses will resemble beaten white foam once dispensed. Any product that provides lift and hold usually contain alcohol. While gels and mousses tend to contain a significant amount of alcohol, hairspray usually contains the most."

      "content": "Make your own deep conditioner. Create your own natural conditioner using a cup of homemade mayonnaise at room temperature. Stir ingredients together and apply through your hair, applying liberally through the tips. There should be enough for 2 treatments depending on your hair length. Apply the treatment immediately after making it to allow the fats and oil to penetrate down through the hair follicles. Wash it out with cold water to more easily remove it. [3] X Research source You may make your own mayonnaise using Â½ cup olive oil + 3 egg yolks. Do not refrigerate as the formula works best at room temperature. However, do not let the conditioner sit for more than a few hours."

[14] X Research source Apply a liberal amount of deep conditioner to wet hair after it has been washed and cleaned. Focus on the ends of your hair as they can be dry and fragile.

Towel drying can easily cause frizz but these techniques can eliminate that as well as reduce tangles and prevent your hair from breaking. [18] X Research source Plopping requires you to place an old t-shirt on a flat surface positioning the end with the sleeves facing you. Bend over and lay your head at the center of the t-shirt making sure that there's material in front of and behind your hair. Try to position yourself so that your hair scrunches hair straight down. Cover the back of your neck with the bottom of your t-shirt. Then, gather the front material of your t-shirt and keep it tight against the sides of your head as you take the sleeves and wrap them from the front to the back of your head. You may twist the sleeves and side material to help keep it tight against your head. Tie the sleeves at the front of your forehead to keep the plop tight. Tuck in any loose material and leave to dry. [19] X Research source Once the conditioner has been rinsed off, turn your head upside down and scrunch your curls with microfiber towels. You may be able to purchase actual microfiber towel gloves online or your local beauty supply store. Scrunching your hair removes excess water while still adding volume.
