      "content": "Charge your wand. You can charge your wand by transmitting energy from yourself into the wand. Usually do this through the hands by holding the wand in both hands. Other methods include: Pyramid chargers. Placing the wand in a specially built pyramid charger can give it a strong charge. Pyramids can transmit energy to other items as well, and can send energy over long distances. Natural light sources. Sunlight or moonlight, particularly strong moonlight from a full moon, are also powerful sources of wand energy. Use desirable energy sources. This is often yourself, but be aware that wands are sensitive to other energy sources as well. Since, you don’t want to charge your wand with unwanted energy, protect your wand with a covering. This could be a cloth or a pouch, for example. Black, blue, or purple pouch coloration and celestial designs are often popular. Be careful of depleting yourself of energy when self-charging the wand. If you feel this happening, be sure to draw energy toward the center of your body: upward from the feet and downward from your head."
