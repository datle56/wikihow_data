Start out by experimenting singing different genres of music. This will help you figure out what kind of singing style comes naturally to you. Take note of things you learn about yourself as a singer, for example: your vocal range, singing styles that are easier and more difficult to pull off, and what wears out your voice. You also need to figure out what kind of performing works best for you; do you work better singing solo, as a lead singer, or as a backup singer? Do you prefer performing in front of small, intimate crowds, or louder, more rambunctious crowds? Figuring out the answers to these questions can further develop your act, image, and set of skills as a singer. Some other questions you might want to address about yourself are: How good is your ear for music? This means: are you able to sing in tune? Can you recognize and feel rhythm in songs? Can you hear a melody once and sing it back correctly? [1] X Research source"
