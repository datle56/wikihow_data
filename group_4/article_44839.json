      "content": "Neck pain can be serious. If you suspect you’ve sprained your neck, go to the doctor so they can check it out and give you a diagnosis. Lots of other conditions can cause neck pain and some of them may be life-threatening, so it’s wise to err on the side of safety and get it checked out as soon as you can. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Neck pain along with a fever and headache can be a sign of bacterial meningitis. If you feel pain and tingling going down one arm and into your hand, your doctor may find that you have a herniated cervical disk. If you can extend your neck much farther than usual after an injury, your doctor may need to do some x-rays to check for a fracture or torn ligaments."

      "content": "This is most effective within the first 24 to 48 hours. Use an icepack, bag of frozen vegetables, or cold-therapy neck pillow to ice your neck for 20 minutes at a time. Wait at least 40 minutes until you ice it again. Cold treatment helps reduce inflammation by decreasing blood flow to the area, so it’s important to ice your neck within 24 hours of straining it.

Wait at least 40 minutes between heat applications. You can also take a hot bath or shower after icing your neck if you don’t have a compress.

      "content": "OTC meds can help you manage mild or moderate discomfort. If the pain from your sprained neck is mild to moderate, consider taking acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), naproxen (Aleve), or aspirin to get some relief. If your pain is so extreme that over-the-counter drugs aren’t helping, ask your doctor about getting a prescription. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Don’t take more tablets or capsules than the label recommends. Don’t take ibuprofen if you have stomach ulcers, liver cirrhosis, or kidney disease. Naproxen may decrease the effectiveness of antacids or blood pressure medications so avoid taking them together. Don’t mix different types of over-the-counter pain relievers together; take one particular kind and stick to it (i.e., take either ibuprofen or acetaminophen, not both)."

      "content": "Keeping your neck stabilized may help ease your pain. With the approval of your doctor, wear a neck collar to immobilize your neck take some of the weight of your head off of your neck muscles. You can do this while you’re sitting down to work, eat, or just relax. Avoid wearing a neck collar for more than 3 to 4 hours at a time because doing so could weaken the muscles in your neck. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Always discuss wearing a neck collar with your doctor first because, depending on your particular condition and severity of the strain, they may find it unnecessary or advise against it. If you're not wearing a neck collar, do your best to keep your neck as still as possible. Additionally, avoid sudden movements, as they might trigger your pain."

      "content": "Feather pillows and pillows that conform to your head are good options. Use a feather or memory foam pillow that will adapt to the natural alignment of your neck and head. If possible, get a cervical pillow especially made for neck support. If you’re a side-sleeper, make sure your pillow is higher under your neck than your skull to keep your spine and neck aligned as much as possible. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try tucking a small neck roll into the lower side of the pillow case to support your neck if you sleep on your side. Avoid using a pillow that’s too high or too stiff because it can cause your neck to stay flexed overnight, exacerbating soreness and stiffness. Avoid sleeping on your stomach because doing so is hard on your spine and forces your neck into a flexed position."

      "content": "Take it easy for a few days until you feel better. Don’t do anything that requires overusing your neck muscles. When it comes to sprains and soreness, sometimes your muscles and tendons just need time to heal on their own. [8] X Research source For instance, if you like to dance, take a few days off and be careful not to turn your neck too much when you return from your rest days. Running and jogging requires using your neck muscles to support your head, so skip your routine for a few days to avoid adding extra pressure on your neck."

Do 3 or 4 reps up to 5 times a day for a good all-around stretch. [10] X Research source If you’re experiencing stiffness, performing a gentle neck stretch a few times a day can help loosen up your muscles and lessen your recovery time. If you experience extreme pain from moving your neck at all, stop trying to stretch your neck muscles and see a doctor as soon as you can."
