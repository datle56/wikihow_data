All of the following can be solved using the format given below, however, sometimes people should (or may want to) memorize these facts so they don't need to run these problem again. 0 2 = 0 × 0 = 0 {\\displaystyle 0^{2}=0\\times 0=0} 1 2 = 1 × 1 = 1 {\\displaystyle 1^{2}=1\\times 1=1} 2 2 = 2 × 2 = 4 {\\displaystyle 2^{2}=2\\times 2=4} 3 2 = 3 × 3 = 9 {\\displaystyle 3^{2}=3\\times 3=9} 4 2 = 4 × 4 = 16 {\\displaystyle 4^{2}=4\\times 4=16} 5 2 = 5 × 5 = 25 {\\displaystyle 5^{2}=5\\times 5=25} 6 2 = 6 × 6 = 36 {\\displaystyle 6^{2}=6\\times 6=36} 7 2 = 7 × 7 = 49 {\\displaystyle 7^{2}=7\\times 7=49} 8 2 = 8 × 8 = 64 {\\displaystyle 8^{2}=8\\times 8=64} 9 2 = 9 × 9 = 81 {\\displaystyle 9^{2}=9\\times 9=81} 10 2 = 10 × 10 = 100 {\\displaystyle 10^{2}=10\\times 10=100} 11 2 = 11 × 11 = 121 {\\displaystyle 11^{2}=11\\times 11=121} 12 2 = 12 × 12 = 144 {\\displaystyle 12^{2}=12\\times 12=144}"

The difference of two perfect squares states that when two squares are subtracted by one another the product of that number and another number when added (then subtracted) will equal your answer. This can be shown as x 2 − p 2 = ( x + p ) ( x − p ) {\\displaystyle x^{2}-p^{2}=(x+p)(x-p)} . [3] X Research source"

Let x equal the number you'd like to find. Insert the number anywhere x is shown. Think about a number you could later insert for the p value.
