Then, separate the strings into 2 equal groups, make a braid out of each group, and knot the ends. Cut off any excess string that’s coming out of the knot. [2] X Research source"

Grab this smaller, thicker loop you’ve formed and feed both braids through. Hold the bracelet close to the looped end and pull it so that it tightens around the braid. [4] X Research source If you want to remove your bracelet, slide the sliding knot down towards the bottom of the braided ends until it’s loose enough to slip off."

Do this with the other braid but pull it towards your elbow. Feed the braid that’s in your palm through the loop and pull it towards your elbow. Feed the other braid through the loop and pull it towards your palm. Repeat this 3 times on each side and then tie the braids together. [5] X Research source To take off your bracelet, untie the knot . Then, look for the last loop you made in the braid and pull it back through the bracelet’s looped end.

Stop, gather all of the loose strings making up the 2 braids, and continue braiding the 2 braids into 1 bigger one. This will create a small hole at the top of the braid.

Then, create a circle with the bracelet (in the way that you use when you wrap it around your wrist) and overlap the 2 braided ends so that the bracelet is a desirable size. Then, use two pieces of string, each 2 in (5.1 cm) long, to tie each knotted end of your bracelet to the braid that it’s overlapping. Use another string to tie macramé knots around these overlapping ends between the 2 tied pieces of string, and remove the 2-inch pieces of string when you’re done."

Hold 1 braid with 1 hand and the other braid with the other hand and tie them together into a knot. [6] X Research source"
