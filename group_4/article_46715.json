      "content": "Visit an approved ATM. Use your prepaid credit card at an ATM operated by the bank that issued it. You can also visit any ATM that displays one of the network brands displayed on the back of your card. Enter your PIN, and complete your transaction. Look at your card and the ATM to determine if the network brand matches. For example, if you have a Visa prepaid card, you would look for ATMs that accept Visa or have the same Visa logo that is on your prepaid card. Many cards have a limit on the amount of money you can withdraw each day. Check your Cardholder Agreement to see what the limit is. [1] X Research source Visiting ATMs associated with your card will also cut down on the amount of withdrawal fees."

      "content": "Be aware of additional fees. Avoid using the ATM to check your card's balance. Use online banking or your card issuer’s app to check the balance on your card. Some cards will charge a balance inquiry fee if you check your card balance at the ATM. In addition to the withdrawal fee you pay to your card issuer, the ATM owner may also charge a fee for using the ATM. If your prepaid card has in-network ATMs, you will not have to pay the additional ATM owner fee if you use one of them. If you use an out-of-network ATM, you will have to pay the fee.

      "content": "Apply for a card. Once you find a card that fits your needs, go to the card issuer’s website and fill out an application. You should be instantly approved. The card issuer will then mail you your card. If your card does not arrive when you expect it, contact the company to be sure that the card was sent and did not go to the wrong person. Activate your new prepaid credit card when it comes in the mail. You will not be able to use it until it is activated. Follow the instructions to activate your card. Typically, you will just call the number found on the sticker on the front of the card to activate it."

      "content": "Choose a 4-digit PIN. When you activate your card, you need to choose a PIN. The PIN will allow you to use your card at the ATM. A PIN will also provide extra security if you ever lose your card. No one will be able to use your card at an ATM if they do not know the PIN. [6] X Research source For some cards, you may not enter a PIN until you make your first transaction. Whatever PIN you enter will be used for future transactions as well. Make sure your PIN is a 4-digit number you can easily remember but cannot be easily guessed by others. Sequential PINs such as 1234 or 1111 can make you an easy target for identity theft if someone obtains access to your card."
