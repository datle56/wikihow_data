      "content": "Very sensitive to others’ emotions Compared to other types of empaths , super empaths possess the highest level of empathy. They not only absorb the emotions of people around them, good or bad, but they physically feel their pain–a phenomenon known as mirror-touch synesthesia. [8] X Research source While this allows them to connect deeply with others, they also feel mentally exhausted if they’re around negative people for extended periods. Has anyone ever told you that you’re “too emotional” or “too sensitive?” Do you feel drained after speaking to people because it feels like you’re experiencing their situation? Do you feel an emotional response to someone days after talking to them?"

      "title": "Easily overwhelmed",
      "content": "Easily overwhelmed Super empaths are hyper-aware of their surroundings, so public places are a nightmare. Crowded rooms, busy streets, and even large gatherings with friends can be overstimulating, making it hard to focus and be present. [11] X Research source Do sights, sounds, and smells overwhelm you? Do you feel trapped or panicked if you can’t escape a crowded area? Do you avoid going to the mall or grocery store?

      "content": "Introverted Since super empaths are sensitive to their environment, they enjoy being alone to protect themselves from negative energy. Solitude allows them to fully rest and recharge, but it doesn’t mean they’re lonely or socially-awkward. Super empaths still maintain great relationships with people, but they’re not afraid to dedicate time alone during the week to avoid emotional overload. [12] X Research source Do you find yourself more energized by yourself than with a group? Are you more excited by ideas than activities? Do you prefer a few close relationships to many casual ones?

      "content": "May struggle setting boundaries Sometimes, super empaths struggle to set boundaries with people because they can’t separate other’s emotions from their own. They want to help and protect their loved ones, so they find it difficult to say no, even if it means sacrificing their personal happiness to ensure everyone else is okay. [14] X Research source Have you ever been called a “people pleaser?” Do you feel like you’re letting someone down if you tell them no? Are you afraid someone will like you less if you don’t agree with them?"

      "content": "Performative Some super empaths feel like they’re putting on an act to please others. They might act like “the funny one” in one friend group, but then be “the mom” in another–whichever role fits better with the group dynamic. They don’t necessarily change their personality, but they’re highly aware of how they’re perceived. Super empaths want to uplift and humor everyone around them, so at times, they might feel a bit \"fake,\" even to themselves.

[18] X Research source It’s perfectly normal for boundaries to change overtime, and every person has the right to express their feelings.

Even if someone else is more informed about a topic, narcissists often override the conversation to feed their ego.
