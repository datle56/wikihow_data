      "title": "Wear a nude tank top underneath.",
      "content": "Wear a nude tank top underneath. It can be daunting to pick out a crochet top simply because they can appear very exposing. Popping a nude camisole on underneath your crochet top is the perfect solution. By choosing a nude color, it will not blend in or distract from the crochet pattern, which is the star of your outfit. You're also fully covered, so there is no need to worry about exposing too much or looking inappropriate. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on a bralette or bandeau underneath.",
      "content": "Put on a bralette or bandeau underneath. If you're bold, you may not want to cover up completely under your crochet top. Instead, try layering it over a bralette or a bandeau. Bralettes are similar to bras, except they have no underwire and look less like an undergarment than a traditional bra. [2] X Research source Bandeaus are a strip of cloth that cover your chest like a tube top. By wearing either of these under crochet tops, you can keep your stomach exposed in your crochet top, while still covering up your chest. You can find bralettes with all kinds of pretty detailing, and both bralettes and bandeaus come in a variety of colors. You can choose a beautiful piece that will add interest to your outfit from underneath your crochet top."

      "content": "Don something colorful underneath. You certainly don't have to stick to neutral tanks and undergarments. In fact, adding a pink bra, a royal blue tank top, or a bright red bandeau under a crochet top can add a pop of color to your outfit. Keep the rest of your outfit neutral and let the colorful undergarment highlight the pattern of the top. For example, try pairing simple black shorts with a black crochet top, but slip a red camisole underneath for a bright pop of color. Jeans and a white crochet top can become more interesting by adding a neon color bandeau underneath."

      "content": "Pair your crochet top with denim. Keep your entire look casual by pairing your crochet top with a pair of denim pants or shorts. Opt for a distressed pair for a more casual, flower child vibe. To dress up your outfit a bit more, choose sleek, darker denim. Jeans are an effortless choice, because they will go with any style or color of crochet top. [3] X Research source Wear a loose, bohemian crochet top with distressed jeans with holes and tears. This is an easy, breezy look for the summer. For a less casual option, wear a more structured crochet top with some dark wash, tailored jeans."

      "content": "Embrace the boho look with a maxi skirt. When it comes to creating a great outfit, it's all about balance. If you're styling a small, sexy crochet top, try pairing it with floor-length maxi skirt to balance out your outfit. A great flowy maxi skirt is the ultimate boho piece. By pairing it with a more form-fitting and revealing crochet top, you create a fantastic silhouette and strike the perfect balance between modest and risqué. [5] X Research source A tiny crochet crop top paired with a miniskirt might expose more skin than you prefer, while a billowy skirt with a loose, flowing crochet top will not create the most flattering silhouette. Wear a cropped crochet top with a high-waisted maxi. You will create a sleek silhouette and expose a bit of skin without overdoing it."

      "content": "Dress it up with formal bottoms. You can wear crochet without looking like you're headed to the beach or a music festival. If you want to wear your crochet top in a more professional setting, you certainly can. Again, it is all about balance. Pair your more casual crochet top with a more polished pencil skirt or pair of pants. Create a contrast by putting an unstructured crochet top with tailored bottoms. [6] X Research source If you are wearing your crochet top in a work setting, it's best to pair it with a full coverage tank top. To really make your crochet top look more professional, wear a fitted blazer over it."

      "content": "Wear your crochet top over a monochrome outfit. Nothing spices up an outfit like a bit of crochet. To spice up a monochrome outfit, try popping a crochet top over it. If you have a favorite black dress, see what it looks like with a crochet layer. Try white jeans and a white tank top with a colorful crochet top over it. You have limitless options. A crochet top can be the perfect statement piece for a monochrome outfit."

      "title": "Add some colorful earrings.",
      "content": "Add some colorful earrings. With a crochet top, there is typically plenty going on in the pattern itself. Adding chunky necklaces will distract from the crochet, and dainty necklaces will simply get lost. When it comes to pairing it with jewelry, earrings are one of your best options. Pair chunky crochet tops with a more basic earring, and pair dainty, intricate crochet with more delicate earrings. The earrings should complement the pattern of the crochet, rather distract or contrast with it. For example, wear a simple, cream crochet top with bold feather earrings. If your outfit is monochrome or more neutral, consider wearing some eye-catching, bright colored earrings."

      "content": "Pop on a loose cardigan. On cooler days, a crochet top might not be warm enough. Luckily, these tops pair beautifully with loose cardigans! Crochet tops, particularly the tighter or skimpier ones, work extremely well with loose-fitting, effortless sweaters. Try to find a cardigan with a similar weight and texture as your top, and let it hang loosely off your shoulders. [7] X Research source Pair a flowing crochet top with a lightweight, loose cardigan. Thin yet oversized cardigans work particularly well with crochet tops."

      "content": "Slide on some bangles. When it comes to bracelets, nothing works better with a crochet top than a great bangle, or set of bangles. Because the pattern of a crochet top is more organic and free-flowing, a solid, geometric bangle stands out beautifully against it. Opt for the more basic designs – you don't need to add much with these tops."

      "title": "Add a purse or bag to complement your crochet top.",
      "content": "Add a purse or bag to complement your crochet top. Skip the super structured, heavy handbags and instead grab a more lightweight, unstructured option. Bags with fringe or florals will complement the bohemian look. Lightweight cross-body bags will hold all of your things while looking casual and effortless."
