The most popular brand is ACE, but you can use other brands as well. You also need something to hold the bandage in place. Most bandages come with velcro or metal clips, but if your bandage doesn't, you can use tape. [1] X Research source You can also buy rolling wraps or adhesive bandages, which have adhesive on their surface to stay snug. Choose whichever one you think is best for your situation. [2] X Research source You can buy a 4-inch or 6-inch ACE wrap, depending on how much coverage you need. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Position yourself. When wrapping your knee, you need to make sure you are in the correct position. First, take a seat in an open area where you have plenty of room to move around. Next, extend your leg out in front of you. There should be plenty of extension in your leg, but your knee should be slightly bent for better application of the wrap. [4] X Research source Make sure there is enough room to move your arms around your leg. This will ensure that you have room to work on your knee."

      "title": "Start wrapping your knee.",
      "content": "Start wrapping your knee. Hold the bandage in your hand, and make sure it is rolled up so it is easier to wrap around your knee. Position your hand (with the wrap in it) about two inches below your knee joint. Take the loose end of the bandage and place it just under the joint. Then, hold it there with one hand while your other hand moves the bandage around the back of your knee. [5] X Research source Wrap it all the way around once until the wrap comes around to meet the loose end. Apply about 50% tension to secure it. [6] X Research source “When you start wrapping, start below the knee, and then start wrapping up towards the heart up, towards the thigh,” says Frank. [7] X Expert Source Jonathan Frank, MD Sports Orthopedic Surgeon & Joint Preservation Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. According to Frank, you should wrap upwards because otherwise, you're “squeezing the fluid down and not helping the fluid get back to the heart.” [8] X Expert Source Jonathan Frank, MD Sports Orthopedic Surgeon & Joint Preservation Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. Make sure to overlap the wrap layers by about 50% as you move upward for even compression and support. [9] X Research source Hold the roll so that the flat side without the roll bundle is against your leg. It will be annoying to wrap it the other way. If you're not sure which way is correct, unroll the bandage on a table. If it unravels, that's the right way. If not, turn it over. The wrap should be level as you start to go around your knee."

      "content": "Finish wrapping your knee. As you move the wrap around your knee, keep it snug and work your way up your leg from below the joint. Wrap around the joint, leaving about one finger breadth of space between the bandage and your kneecap. Continue until you have completely wrapped your knee joint. Then, secure the end with whatever fastener the bandage has or use pins or tape. [10] X Research source If you want to cover your patella (kneecap) with the bandage, loosen the tightness of the bandage around the patella to avoid excessive pressure on the joint. [11] X Research source The strength of the wrap should be snug above and below the kneecap. The wrap should extend from approximately two inches below the joint and two inches above the joint. The joint itself is about one and a half inches, so the total area of your leg that should be wrapped is approximately five to six inches. If you don't have any sort of fasteners, you can tuck the last few inches of the bandages inside. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Make sure the wrap isn't too snug.",
      "content": "Make sure the wrap isn't too snug. You need to be careful with the amount of pressure you wrap your knee with. The bandage should be snug but not too snug. To check how snug it is, press on your toe for five seconds until it goes pale. If the color doesn’t come back after 2 seconds, then the bandage is too tight and you need to reapply it more loosely. [13] X Research source The bandage should feel supportive because it provides additional stability, not as if it might cut off your circulation. “If you wrap your knee too tight, you turn it into a tourniquet, which will prevent good blood flow to the area and impede your healing,” says Frank. [14] X Expert Source Jonathan Frank, MD Sports Orthopedic Surgeon & Joint Preservation Specialist Expert Interview. 31 July 2020. Other signs of circulation loss include numbness, tingling, and increased pain. Rewrap the bandage using less tension if you experience tingling or throbbing anywhere in your limb. [15] X Research source Repeat the procedure on the opposite leg if needed, following the same method."

Many people who exercise will wrap their knees to give their knees a bit of additional support while they exercise. Some people do it if they have had a partial tear in a ligament and are seeking some external support. Weight lifters may also wrap their knees prior to doing squats to give the joint some additional stability. [16] X Research source If you have or think you have sustained an injury, make sure to rest and call your doctor or nurse advice line. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Use a wrap as a preventative measure. Knee wraps are not generally used to treat a severe injury or condition. Knee wraps are typically used for the prevention of injury or knee issues. They provide a bit more stability and external support to the joint of your knee when it is put under extreme stress. [18] X Research source Wrapping the knee may also reduce or prevent swelling. [19] X Research source The only kind of treatments a knee wrap is used for are slightly stretched knee ligaments and minor knee sprains. This can only be diagnosed by a healthcare provider. If you sustain any injury, see your primary healthcare provider. You may need a splint, brace, or surgery to recover."

      "content": "Avoid using knee wraps on serious injuries. There are many instances where a wrap is not needed. If you have an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear or any other ligament tear, do not treat it with a knee wrap unless explicitly instructed by your orthopedic surgeon. It would also not be appropriate to simply wrap your knee with a medial or lateral meniscus tear. Depending on the tear grade and any other damage inside your knee, you might need surgery. [20] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If a knee wrap helps an injury and your surgeon sees no problem with using this method while you wait for an upcoming surgical repair, then you can use it. Never use this as a means to stabilize a grossly unstable joint for purposes for recreation."
