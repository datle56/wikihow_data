      "content": "Consider leaving the oil on for a longer period of time. If you have an incredibly dry scalp, this might be a good decision. Some suggest leaving it in your hair for a couple of hours or even overnight. Take a plastic bag and cover your hair so you don't get any oil on your clothes, furniture, or bed. You can use a normal grocery bag or purchase a plastic wrap meant for hair treatments. You can purchase these from any beauty shop. If you decide to leave the oil in your hair for longer period of time, know that it could make your scalp and hair too oily. This could cause your follicles to clog up rather than grow new hair."
