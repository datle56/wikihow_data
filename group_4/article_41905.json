      "content": "Blow dry and brush your hair for a simple style. Hold a blow dryer 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) away from your hair and move it from the tips to the roots until your hair dries. Work in 1–3 in (2.5–7.6 cm) sections. Brush your hair and part it, tucking the sides behind your ears or holding them in place with a bobby pin. [1] X Research source For a grunge-inspired look, try parting your hair in the center. [2] X Research source This should be done right after washing your hair."

      "title": "Do a pompadour",
      "content": "Do a pompadour for a sleeker look. Part the top of your hair to one side. Apply a coin-sized amount of hair gel to your fingers and distribute it evenly throughout the hair on the top of your head. Then, brush the hair back with your fingers or a comb while pushing it upward to give it some lift. [3] X Research source Use a blow dryer while brushing the top back to give your hair more volume. Pompadours look best on men with longer hair on top (at least 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) long) and shorter sides."

      "content": "Tousle your hair for a simple, yet wild hairdo. Then apply a coin-sized amount of hair gel onto your fingers and run it through the length of your hair. Rub your fingers back and forth while ruffling the top, parting your hair with your fingers to the side, in the center, or wherever your natural part is. Wash your hair before tousling it for a clean look and feel. Tousling hair works best for those with natural curls or waves."

      "title": "Try a comb-over if you have short sides.",
      "content": "Try a comb-over if you have short sides. If your hair is long on top, work wax or hair gel into your hair and distribute it evenly. Then, part your hair to one side and comb it down. Spritz it with a light misting of hairspray to set the style. [4] X Research source This style looks best if you shave the sides and keep the top several inches or centimeters long. Comb-overs do not look as stylish on balding men, as it tends to emphasize their receding hairline. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Do a small man bun for a popular men's updo. Smooth your hair backward away from your forehead. Holding your hair in one hand and the hair tie in the other, pull your hair halfway through the hair tie until it forms a bun, wrapping the rubber band around the bun twice to put it in place. [6] X Research source Wash your hair before doing a man bun or other updos. For a creative bun, have a friend part your hair in the middle and French braid the left and right sides. Use elastic bands to tie the two braids together to make a ponytail and wrap it to form a bun. Add a small amount of pomade or gel to your hair before you put it in a bun to give it a sleek finish."

      "content": "Try a ponytail as a simple alternative to a bun. Gather as much hair as you can from the top and sides of your head and hold it at the crown of your head. Then, twist a rubber band several times around the center. Pull the hair all the way through the rubber band, tightening your hair at the center to hold it in place. [7] X Research source If some of your hair is too short to pull through the rubber band, hold it back with bobby pins unless you want a messier look."

      "content": "Try a half ponytail for shorter hair lengths. Sweep a small amount of hair from the top section toward the back of your head. Pull it through the opening of a rubber band and twist the rubber band around the center several times. Brush your half ponytail to blend it with the rest of your hair and give your style a polished look."

Cross the right section over the middle and pull on all 3 sections to tighten the cross in place. Then, cross the left section over the middle section and tighten it up. Continue alternating between crossing the right and left sections over the middle until you reach the ends, then secure the braid in place with a rubber band.

Split your hair into 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) sections, and work on each section one at a time. Wrap each section around the curling iron or run the flat iron down the length of each section, spritzing each section with hairspray to hold its shape. [11] X Research source Small curling or flat irons work best for medium length hair. Distribute a heat-protectant product throughout your hair first to protect it from heat damage."
