      "content": "Use 3-10 drops of oil depending on how long you’ve been growing your beard. It's important to use the appropriate amount of oil for your beard—too much can make it oily, while too little isn't enough to prevent dryness. Just remember that if your routine isn't working for you, adjust the amount of beard oil drops as necessary. Every beard is different, but some general guidelines you can follow are: [1] X Research source One month of beard growth: 3-4 drops One to three months of beard growth: 4-6 drops Three to twelve months of beard growth: 6-10 drops If your beard is 1 year or older, you may need to use 10 drops or more."

      "title": "Apply beard oil every 2 days if your beard is short.",
      "content": "Apply beard oil every 2 days if your beard is short. Shorter beards don't require as much oil as longer beards, so application every 2 days is usually enough. [2] X Research source You should also only apply beard oil every 2 days if you live in a humid climate. In a humid climate, your beard is less likely to dry out, so you don't need as much oil. If you find that every 2 days isn't cutting it, try applying your oil every day and see if that makes a difference."

      "title": "Use beard oil daily if you live in an area with a dry climate.",
      "content": "Use beard oil daily if you live in an area with a dry climate. Drier climates are more likely to dry out your beard, which means a more frequent application is necessary. However, if you find that daily application is making your beard too oily, try cutting down to once every other day. [3] X Research source Remember that everyone's beard is different—don't be afraid to change your application frequency if this doesn't work for you. You can apply beard oil whenever your beard is feeling dry. [4] X Expert Source Timmy Yanchun Professional Barber Expert Interview. 22 January 2020."

      "title": "Shower and dry your beard before applying beard oil.",
      "content": "Shower and dry your beard before applying beard oil. Always apply beard oil after a shower—this is when your hairs are the softest and cleanest, which opens up your pores and increases oil absorption. But if your beard is wet, the water will prevent the oil from being absorbed into your skin and hairs. To avoid this, gently dry your beard with a towel following your shower. [5] X Research source Avoid using a hair dryer—it can damage your hair follicles."

Now, hold the dropper over your palm and gently squeeze the rubber top until you've applied the necessary amount of drops. [6] X Research source Don't use more than the minimum amount you need—you can always add more oil later if necessary."

      "content": "Spread the oil evenly across your palms and fingers. Close your hands together and rub them up and down to cover both palms in oil. As you rub your hands together, bring your fingers low enough that they rub across the opposing hand's palm. [7] X Research source Continue rubbing your hands until the beard oil covers the entire surface of your palms and fingers."

      "content": "Brush the palms of your hands along the sides of your beard. After applying the oil to your hands, drag each palm along the opposing cheek—your left palm across your right cheek and your right palm across your left cheek. Always start with your fingers at the end of your beard—touching the bottom of your ear—and drag each hand in a straight motion down your jawline. [8] X Research source Apply the oil about 2 to 3 times on each side of your beard. Work the beard oil from the roots to the tips of your beard hairs.

Close your fingers together and place each hand over your mouth—your fingers should run parallel to it and your index finger should touch your nose. Now, drag your fingers downward across the front of your beard. Repeat this process with each hand. [10] X Research source Continue this process 2 to 3 times with each hand."

      "content": "Purchase a wooden beard comb for the best results. Visit a local cosmetics and skin care store to purchase a beard comb. Wooden combs almost never have rough edges, which means you don't have to worry about pulling on your beard and causing breakage. The next best material for a beard comb is cellulose acetate, which is easy to clean and doesn't cause beard static or hair damage. Avoid using plastic and metal combs at all costs, as their rough edges can damage your hair follicles. Check online suppliers if you want to purchase your beard comb online."

      "content": "Comb your beard starting from the bottom to the top. Begin by holding your beard comb with the teeth pointing upward. Start on the left or right side of your neck and comb upward to your chin and continue across your cheeks. This will help distribute the beard oil and give your beard a fuller look. Repeat this process for the opposite side of your face. [13] X Research source If you hit a snag in your beard, don't force it—take the comb out and keep trying until you can break through the knot without damaging your hair. Use a comb with wide teeth when brushing upward. If your beard is too short to comb, don't worry—wait until it's long enough to start grooming it."

      "title": "Drag your comb downward through your beard.",
      "content": "Drag your comb downward through your beard. After combing upward to separate your beard hairs, you can comb it downward into whichever style you prefer. Start from the top of your beard near your cheekbones and hold the comb parallel to your beard line. From this position, drag the comb downward. Use a comb with narrow teeth when brushing downward and putting the finishing touches on your beard style."

      "title": "Avoid combing more than 3 times a day.",
      "content": "Avoid combing more than 3 times a day. After combing your beard to distribute your beard oil, don't comb it more than 1 to 2 more times. Too much combing can dry your skin out and damage your beard hair. If you notice any split ends or beard hair damage, it's a sign you're combing your beard too often."
