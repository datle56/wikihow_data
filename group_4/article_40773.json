      "content": "Determine the legal structure of your business. This will have implications for how you file taxes and how much you will need to pay. Most small businesses are sole proprietorships that are the easiest to set up and require the least paperwork. If you are considering another legal structure, you may wish to consult a lawyer who specializes in new business start-ups and who can help you pick the structure best for you. [3] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Sole proprietorship – A sole proprietorship is owned and run by one person, and there is no legal separation between the individual and the business. As a result, all profits, losses, debts and deeds of the business are your responsibility. This option can be attractive for a small business due to its ease of formation, and due to the complete control it provides. [4] X Trustworthy Source U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. government agency focused on supporting small businesses Go to source Partnership – A partnership simply refers to the sharing of ownership between two or more people. Partnerships are formed through the negotiation of an agreement between the partners (assisted by a lawyer usually), and each individual partner is liable for his or her share of profits, losses, or liabilities. This can be attractive if you are choosing to run the business with another person to take advantage of combined skills. Keep in mind that each partner is generally liable for the full debts of the partnership. Partners may have to seek payment from the other partners separately if they do not pay their share of a debt. The amount of liability depends upon the terms of any loans the business takes out. Limited liability company (LLC) – To start an LLC, you must, at a minimum, choose a name and file articles of organization with your state, often for a fee. LLC owners pay taxes on their proportion of profits through their individual income tax returns and have to pay self employment tax, but are protected from personal liability for the decisions and actions of the company. Corporation – An independent legal entity owned by shareholders. To register your corporation you must choose a company name and file articles of incorporation with your state. You will also need to register with the IRS and get a tax ID. Corporations file taxes separately from their owners. This may prove advantageous, allowing owners to take advantage of the corporate tax rate, but it may also lead to double taxation (which refers to your corporation's income being taxed, followed by your income from the corporation being taxed when the company pays a dividend or makes a distribution). You should speak with your lawyer or accountant to see if this form of business will benefit you. This structure is generally not appropriate for smaller businesses."

      "content": "Register your business name with your state government, if necessary. A DBA (Doing Business As) is needed whenever you are doing business under a name other than your own. Registering a DBA name is typically done through your state government or county clerk's office. You can search the specific requirements of your state online. This process typically only takes a few minutes to complete. This is typically useful for sole proprietorship, since not using a DBA name means that your business name will automatically default to your personal name. Note that a DBA name is also required if you are starting a corporation."
