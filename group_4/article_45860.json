When you drink it, it may have a mild laxative effect, so you might get some relief from your constipation. Just make sure you choose a drink that's labeled as aloin-free, which means it's been filtered to remove the compound that can irritate your stomach. [5] X Research source There's no set amount of aloe juice to drink for constipation or any time-table for how often you should take it. If you do drink aloe juice, start with a small serving, then wait several hours to ensure you don't experience any negative side effects."
