      "content": "Place your dollar on a flat surface. The ironing board is the most logical place to iron your bill. If you don’t have an ironing board, you can use a nearby table, but make sure to place a shirt or other linen on the ironing area so that you don’t burn the table."

      "title": "Moisten the bill with water.",
      "content": "Moisten the bill with water. Spray a little water onto the dollar bill. You can do this with the spray function featured on the iron itself. Moisture helps remove those particularly pesky wrinkles during ironing. [1] X Research source If you don’t have an iron with a spray function, use a spray bottle or run the bill under a sink that is set to low pressure."

      "content": "Turn your iron down to the lowest heat. The goal is to dry the moisture out of the bill with the lowest heat necessary. Higher heat settings run the risk of damaging the dollar bill. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Iron",
      "content": "Iron the dollar slowly. Use straight movements from one direction to the other. Repeat this a few times until the bill no longer appears to further flatten. Take care to avoid ironing folds into the bill. If you are having trouble getting the bill to lay flat, place it flat inside of a shirt. This will keep the bill weighed down flat while still allowing you to iron the bill. Start ironing the bill as your iron is still heating up. This is particularly helpful if your iron's lowest setting is still particularly hot."

      "title": "Let the bill cool for 60 seconds.",
      "content": "Let the bill cool for 60 seconds. The bill will be very hot to the touch immediately after ironing, so be careful! After the bill has cooled, you may flip the bill and repeat the ironing process on the new side of the bill. You may reapply some moisture to the other side of the bill if it still has a large amount of folds or wrinkles."

      "title": "Run the dollar bill against a cornered surface.",
      "content": "Run the dollar bill against a cornered surface. Make sure the entire surface of the bill is firmly dragged across the edge of where two planes meet. The goal is to force the wrinkles and folds out of the bill. The corner of a vending machine is a convenient place to try this method, given that the vending machine likely wouldn’t accept your bill in the first place. However, any edged surface will do, including wall, desk or table corners. If the corner you are using doesn’t seem to be straightening out the bill, try using a corner with a more inclined or sharper edge."

    {
      "title": "Flip the dollar in your hands and corner the other side.",
      "content": "Flip the dollar in your hands and corner the other side. If you only run one side of the bill against a corner, you run the risk of creating new folds or bends in the direction you were applying force to the bill. Flip the bill and run the opposite face across the corner same as you did to the first in order to create as much parity as possible."

    {
      "title": "Check the corners of your dollar bill.",
      "content": "Check the corners of your dollar bill. It’s difficult to straighten the corners of the bill out using the edge of a wall. When you are done straightening the body of the bill, check the corners for “dog ears,” or small bends at the corners of the bill. If a dog ear is present, fold and crease the ear in the opposite direction to try to level out the bend (similar to removing creases from rugs or cloth)."

      "title": "Moisten the dollar bill.",
      "content": "Moisten the dollar bill. Spray the dollar bill with water. Use a water bottle to mist evenly. Unlike when ironing a dollar bill, you want the bill to be noticeably moist or humid. However, it is not advised to completely soak the bill in water through submersion."

      "title": "Press the bill between two heavy, flat objects.",
      "content": "Press the bill between two heavy, flat objects. Ideal objects to use for pressing include heavy books such as dictionaries or phone directories. These objects press the bill flat and hold it in place while it dries. Place an absorbent material between the heavy object and the bill to prevent water damage to the pressing object and to facilitate drying. Try cheesecloth, hemp or other common absorbent fabrics to help absorb moisture from the bill. [3] X Research source If you don’t particularly care about the book in question, the bill along with the absorbent material can be placed within the book itself. Lay the book flat to ensure the bill dries without bends or folds. The dollar bill can also be “framed” between two panes of glass as it dries. Framing the bill will help ensure a tight, flat seal and can take less space than stacking a few books."

      "title": "Check in on the dollar bill as it dries.",
      "content": "Check in on the dollar bill as it dries. Allow to dry overnight, checking in occasionally to gauge dryness. Change the absorbent material as necessary to keep the drying process moving at a steady pace. The bill shouldn’t take longer than a few days to dry. If it takes longer than a few days, change the absorbent material more frequently. You may have also moistened the bill more than necessary. Store the press in an area that is not also dark or damp to avoid encouraging the growth of mold."

      "title": "Repeat the process if needed.",
      "content": "Repeat the process if needed. Once the bill is dry, it should lay flat without folds or creases. However, if the bill still curls, you may repeat the process, provided the bill is not too flimsy or weak to withstand another treatment.

      "content": "Place the dollar bill into a water basin that is full of water. It doesn't have to be super full, but must be able to fully coat the entire bill from one end to the other. The basin though, has to have a flat bottom for this fix to hold. It doesn't matter what side the bill is placed in the basin with, for the side facing you, however, for simplicity, start with the front side facing you first. Be careful of the temperature of the water. Although the water should be warm, it should never be scalding hot, as this could cause the bill to loose color."

Don't apply too much pressure that the bill's ink begins to come off, otherwise it will have no legal tender on it. Apply enough pressure, like you were brushing your hair- steady pressure running up and down the bill. Rub the bill in circles with the bristle brush. Never rub straight across otherwise the bill's ink will smear and that's not good!"
