      "content": "Make sure you're in the calm and private setting. If you tickle someone in front of a bunch of people, it can be embarrassing—both for her and those around you. It’s best to tickle her somewhere private where you both feel comfortable. Try and remember if she has ever told you that she hates to be tickled. If she has, take her at her word and know that tickling is not a welcome touch for her. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait until she's in a good mood. If she's feeling angry, sad, or is trying to focus on something important, it's probably not a good time to tickle her. It might make you seem insensitive and upset her further. Remember that tickling is not always appropriate. If she's sad, give her a hug instead. You can always try to tickle her a little around the ribs if she starts feeling better."

      "content": "Find out which areas of her body are off-limits. Your girlfriend might not be comfortable being touched in all of her ticklish spots. After all, our most ticklish areas are also the most vulnerable. [2] X Research source You may want to do a couple of quick tests before trying to tickle her. If she makes any indication that she's uncomfortable, know that spot is off-limits for tickling. While lying down, try running your toes lightly along the bottoms of her feet and see how she reacts. [3] X Research source When her arms are raised or you’re hugging her, place your hand near her armpit. Some girls might be worried about sweat and won't want you to touch them there. Place your hand on her hip or stomach. Notice if she removes your hand or seems to welcome your touch."

      "content": "Sneak up behind her and surprise her by tickling her sides. Gently poke or wiggle your fingers as if you’re typing really fast up and down her sides. She’ll likely respond by giggling, especially if you catch her off-guard. [4] X Research source Do this for no more than 10 seconds at a time. When you stop tickling her, you can pull her against you for a sweet hug and kiss."

Make sure you aren't tickling her too hard. Tickling can be pleasurable, but only when you use a light touch. When you apply too much pressure, it can become painful. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Stop if she gets upset, has trouble breathing, or tells you to quit.",
      "content": "Stop if she gets upset, has trouble breathing, or tells you to quit. Tickling can be tricky because she will be laughing when she asks you to stop, and you may think she doesn't really mean it. But the laughter is involuntary, and she might be in pain, getting mad, feeling very uncomfortable, or just want you to stop. Only tickling her for a few seconds at a time is a good way to avoid an awkward situation. If she really doesn't like it, you will have only tickled her briefly. If she tells you she really didn't like being tickled, then you know not to do it again."
