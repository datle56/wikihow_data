      "content": "In China, the pinky finger isn't the same thing as the middle finger. Contrary to popular belief, holding up a pinky finger in China isn’t equivalent to flipping someone off in Western culture. The pinky finger isn’t considered offensive in Chinese culture but can have a negative connotation. In some instances, showing someone your pinky finger means you think they’re weak or a loser, while most of the time, it means nothing at all. Let’s say you’re in a tense disagreement with someone. They might show you their pinky finger to say sarcastically, “Yeah, right.” As a general rule, pointing at people with a single finger in China is a big no-no, especially pointing with the pinky finger, as it’s a sign of disrespect.
