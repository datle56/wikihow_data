      "content": "Try caffeine. A cup of coffee in the morning or mid-afternoon is a go-to for many for a reasons. Caffeine is a powerful stimulant that can wake you up and help you stay alert throughout the day. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source [3] X Expert Source Marc Kayem, MD Otolaryngologist Expert Interview. 24 October 2019. People have a substance called adenosine in their brains that binds to nerve receptors, which slows down nerve cells and causes drowsiness. The brain mistakes caffeine for adenosine and receptors bind to it instead. Instead of slowing down nerve cells, caffeine speeds up nerve cells resulting in your feeling energized. Timing is important when it comes to caffeine consumption. It takes about 20 or 30 minutes for caffeine to start working, so aim to have a cup of coffee right before your afternoon meeting. Doctors recommend you only consume 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, and an eight ounce cup of coffee has about 100. Keep this in mind as you consume caffeine so you don't go overboard."

If you wake up after only a small amount of sleep, it might be tempting to hit the snooze bar and enjoy an additional seven or nine minutes of rest. However, this will actually result in you feeling more tired in the morning. The sleep you have during those few minutes are of minimal quality. You end up going straight back into REM sleep if you're pulled from sleep too quickly, and the shock of waking from REM sleep repetitively leaves you more tired than you would have been if you had simply woken up. It's better to set the alarm as late as you can possibly sleep and get up and get going on the first buzz. Even if it's hard, you'll end up feeling more energized throughout the morning."

Do not use electronics half an hour before bed, as the light generated by laptops, TV screens, and smart phones interfere with sleep. Instead, try a low-key activity like reading or doing a crossword puzzle. If your exercise regularly, make sure to time your workouts effectively.
