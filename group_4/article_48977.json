      "title": "Hold the ball in one hand.",
      "content": "Hold the ball in one hand. You’ll have much more power throwing the ball with one arm than trying to toss it with two. Spread out your fingers to grip the ball tightly. Hold the dodgeball much like you’d hold a tennis ball. If your hands are too small to grip the dodgeball this way, you can curl your hand and wrist around the ball, cradling it. You’ll still be able to throw the ball effectively."
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim low.",
      "content": "Aim low. It’s much more difficult for your opponents to catch the ball if you throw it at their shins. Even if they dodge your throw, at least you won’t be out. Be careful not to let the ball bounce before it reaches your target. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Throw from as close to the line as you can.",
      "content": "Throw from as close to the line as you can. Even if your throws are powerful, limit the distance between yourself and your target. That way, all the power you put into your throw is translated to speed, making dodging more difficult for your opponents. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep your hands behind your back.",
      "content": "Keep your hands behind your back. Whether you have a ball in your hands or not, keep your hands hidden. This gives less information to the opposing team and prevents them from making educated decisions. This is a simple way to get an edge over the other team. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Take out the best players first.",
      "content": "Take out the best players first. Dealing with the opposing team’s best throwers will keep your team alive longer. Limiting your adversary’s ability to eliminate your side gives you the edge as the game stretches on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stand as close to the back wall as possible.",
      "content": "Stand as close to the back wall as possible. Put as much distance between yourself and your opponents as possible when you’re on the defensive. This gives you more time to see the balls coming and more time to react. This makes it easier to catch or dodge incoming throws. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your body to catch incoming throws.",
      "content": "Use your body to catch incoming throws. When you’re making a catch, use as much of your body as possible. Use your hands to make first contact with the ball, then scoop it towards you until it hits your chest. This makes you less likely to drop the ball and be eliminated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Deflect incoming balls.",
      "content": "Deflect incoming balls. If you’ve already got a ball, you can hit incoming balls rather than dodging them. This is especially useful for balls that are thrown low. Hold the ball firmly in your hands and push out quickly towards the incoming ball to bounce it away. Be careful not to drop your ball when blocking incoming shots, or you’ll be eliminated."
    },
    {
      "title": "Jump over low balls.",
      "content": "Jump over low balls. Since it’s a good strategy to throw balls low, you might not be able to catch or deflect everything that’s thrown at you. If a ball’s coming right down the middle, split your legs as you jump, and aim to get just enough height to narrowly miss the ball. If you put too much spring in your jump, it’ll take you longer to readjust to face the next throw. When the ball comes at just one of your legs, just lift that leg as you jump."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give a number to each opponent.",
      "content": "Give a number to each opponent. Before play starts, have everyone on the team agree on a number given to each member of the other team. This will help you coordinate both attack and defense, since you’ll all be on the same page when referring to other players. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Call your targets and throw together.",
      "content": "Call your targets and throw together. Dodging or catching a single ball is simple. When two or more are coming at your opponents, you’re making things more complicated for them. Use the numbers you’ve already assigned to coordinate attacks against specific targets. Call that number out just before your throw. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread out.",
      "content": "Spread out. If your team stays close together, you’ll essentially present one large target to your adversaries. Instead, spread out along the back wall for defense. Move forward when you need to throw, but try not to get in the way of your teammate’s line of sight. This will make their throws more difficult."
    },
    {
      "title": "Force players out of bounds.",
      "content": "Force players out of bounds. Hitting enemy players with a ball isn’t the only way to eliminate them. It takes some coordination between team members, but it’s possible to force an opponent to step out of bounds by making them dodge in that direction. Say you want to make an opponent dodge left until they’re out of bounds, keep throwing at their right side. After a few throws, they’ll start moving left and eliminate themselves."
