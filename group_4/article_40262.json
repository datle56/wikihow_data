We are: Hum hain You (pl) are: Aap hain They/those are: Vo hain Like English, the plurals all take the same conjugation."

      "content": "Understand that all infinitives end with \"na\" - e.g. \"Hona\" - \"To Be\" - and \"Dekhna\" - \"To See\". Of the verbs that are regular, such as Dekhna (but not Hona), there is a simple rule for conjugating them in the present tense. This is to remove the \"na\" and add on the following instead. Note that in the first three cases, the underlined syllables are used only if the subject of the sentence is masculine (e.g. \"John\"). If the subject is feminine (e.g. \"Jane\") then those syllables are replaced by \"i\". [5] X Research source I ( Mein ): t a You ( Tum ): t e S/he/it ( Vo ): t a We ( Hum ): tain You (pl) ( Aap ): tain Them ( Vo ): tain Thus, as an example, the verb Dekhna (to see) would conjugate for me (I'm male) as \"Dekhta\" or for you (if you're female) as \"Dekhti\"."

      "content": "Understand that The verb \"To Be\" (\"Hona\") is the most important because it is used to create the present tense. Thus whereas in English we say \"I see\", in Urdu the translated equivalent would be \"I am see\" - or with the correct order, \"I see am\". Thus in Urdu, saying \"I see\" is like saying \"I am, and see.\" Without the qualification that you are while you see, the verb of seeing would not be in the present tense. Thus: \"I [female] see\": \" Mein dekhti hoon \" \"It sees\": \" Vo dekhta hai \" You will recall that \"mein\" is \"I\", \"hoon\" is \"am\" (conjugated for \"I\") and \"dekhti\" is the verb \"To See\" (\"Dekhna\") when conjugated for a female \"I\"."
