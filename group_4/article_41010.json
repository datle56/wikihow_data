When you're moody, your brain selects and attends to anything that matches your current mood, meaning that you want to get rid of any negative thoughts and expressions that it can feed off of. [1] X Research source So, if you are smiling despite your bad mood, you will respond to yourself (and others will join in) with congruence. If you smile, others will smile back. Further, your mind will mistake your faking it with the body's real smile, summoning happier thoughts and ideas than if you were frowning. For example, if your mood makes you feel too homely to leave the house, put on your favorite shirt and leave as if you have all the confidence in the world. The goal is to engage in behaviors that are inconsistent with your feelings so that you have the momentum for a real change in mood."

If you can go to a different place entirely, think about what you are looking for. Relaxed and well-ordered environments tend to be help. If you are unable to leave where you are, see if there's anything you can re-arrange to make the environment more pleasant, like trash that can be thrown out, or another room you can move to that you find more peaceful. Going from inside to outside has an especially strong impact on mood. If it's possible to take a break from what you're doing and spend some time outside, take it! Natural environments have automatically uplifting qualities."
