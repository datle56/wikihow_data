      "content": "Pick a pair of Jordans with some color variation for a textured look. There are tons of Jordans on the market that have elegant color variation that make the shoes stand out. Jordans with a vibrant color scheme will pop even more than they normally do when you’re wearing shorts since there won’t be any pant legs to draw the eye away from the shoes. [1] X Research source Unlike Converse or Adidas, most Jordans incorporate more than 2 colors in their designs. Don’t worry about matching with the tertiary colors and minor accents, since they provide some texture for the shoe but don’t create a big impression on their own. Being too matchy matchy might actually take away from the outfit. Jordans that are mainly white and have two accent colors are popular and versatile choices. Jordan 3s are a classic choice that will work with a variety of short styles. Jordan 9s come in a variety of colors and can make any outfit pop."

      "content": "Stick with all-white Jordans for a cleaner vibe. If you’re going for a classier or cleaner look, pick a pair of all-white Jordans.

      "content": "Select Jordans with thinner tongues and collars for a streamlined look. Jordans with really thick tongues and collars are great for pants because you can tuck the bottom of your pants behind the collar and tongue to show off the shoe. Thicker tongues and collars will stick out to the sides if you’re wearing shorts though, and they’ll look kind of clunky and big on your feet. [4] X Research source The collar refers to the section in the back of the shoe where it meets the top of your ankle. The tongue refers to the middle length of fabric on top of your shoe that goes under the laces. Jordan Retro 11s and Space Jams are great options for a sleeker shoe with a thinner collar and tongue."

      "content": "Go with Jordan runners if you’re going to be working out or running. If you’re playing some outdoor basketball or running around all day performing errands, standard Jordans will look a little too stylish for the occasion. Pick some Jordan runners to fit the athletic vibe that you’re going for and to keep your feet comfortable while you’re moving. [5] X Research source Runners are typically black, gray, and white (or some combination of the 3). There are more colorful options on the market though if you prefer! Jordan Reacts and Trunners are trendy running shoes with tons of color variation. They’re a highly stylish choice that will keep your outfit looking trendy. Jordan 89 Racers are a running shoe that have a typical Jordan vibe if you’re a traditionalist looking for a more standard-looking sneaker. Most Jordan runners are low-top shoes. Keep that mind if you’re picking them up and need a little more ankle support."

      "content": "Stick with ankle socks for a more comfortable and laid back vibe. While they don’t tend to be as stylish, ankle socks will protect your ankle and heel from rubbing against your shoe while de-emphasizing your sock choice. Ankle socks are a great choice if you’re going to be doing anything athletic as well, since they won’t make your legs hot while you’re running around. [14] X Research source Ankle socks are less popular than they used to be, but you still won’t be making much of a statement if you choose to wear them with your Jordans. This is a good thing if you’re trying to play your shoes down, but you may want to go with some flashier socks if you’re trying to stand out!"

[15] X Research source Get some mid-calf socks with stripes near the top for the truly old school look!
