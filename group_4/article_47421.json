Do you have a modern (post-2014) smart TV that connects to the internet and allows you to select apps like Netflix and Hulu using your TV remote control? Or do you have a modern gaming console (Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or 5, Xbox One, Xbox 360) connected to your TV and hooked up to the internet? If either of these things is true, you can easily watch YouTube using the official app for your device. [1] X Research source If you're using a TV that’s not connected to the internet, you'll need an external device to watch YouTube. See Using Chromecast , Using Amazon Fire TV , Using Apple TV , or Using Roku instead. Most modern Samsung, LG, and Sony smart TVs come with YouTube preinstalled. If your TV is an Android TV (check the packaging or look up your exact model to find out), you definitely have the YouTube app. [2] X Research source If your TV model is considered a Roku TV or Amazon Fire TV model, see the Roku or Amazon Fire TV method for more specific information about your TV."
