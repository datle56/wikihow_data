Leave the compress in place for 10-15 minutes, reapplying it 3-4 times each day. [1] X Research source Use a fresh compress each time to prevent any contamination. Always use warm water instead of hot—you don’t want to burn yourself! The warm compress boosts circulation around the boil, which directs more white blood cells to the area. This helps the boil to come to a head , rupture, and drain more quickly. [2] X Research source This remedy works for all types of boils, including ones on your groin and buttocks.
