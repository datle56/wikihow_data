      "content": "Gather small-sized sponge, plastic, or hot rollers. You may want to practice using them before it's time to style your hair. Looking into a mirror, try winding your hair around a curler and securing it with a hairpin. Some types of rollers slip out of short hair, so you'll want to experiment with securing them. When you have short hair, you'll need more rollers, especially for tight curls. This is because only small sections of hair will fit on each roller."

      "title": "Wash or wet your hair before rolling it.",
      "content": "Wash or wet your hair before rolling it. Apply a styling product such as mousse, styling spray, or curling cream. Particularly if you're not using heat, hair must begin wet in order to set it with rollers. If you're using hot rollers, you may still want to wet your hair and apply mousse or another styling product before drying it."

      "content": "Roll sections of hair. [1] X Research source Begin at the front of your hair and work backward, rolling small sections at a time. Roll sections measuring about 1 inch each, just enough hair to wind around the middle of the curler. Some hair may be too short to roll. In that case, you can still add a curl to the tip of your hair by wrapping just the end around part of the roller. If you have wavy or curly hair, you can twist your hair instead of using rollers. Use your fingers to twist small sections. Once those twists dry, they can be unwound, resulting in gorgeous spiral curls."

      "title": "Allow the rollers to dry.",
      "content": "Allow the rollers to dry. You can either blow dry your rolled hair or allow it to air dry. Make sure the hair is completely dry before you remove the rollers. It's best to sit under a heated dryer if you can, as it will evenly disperse the air. If you are curling your hair with hot rollers, make sure the rollers are completely cold before removing them."

The heavier the serum, the straighter it will keep your hair. [3] X Research source If your hair is only slightly curly, you may be able to straighten it with a mousse and a straightening comb alone. Skip the hairdryer, and instead allow your hair to air dry with the serum distributed through it."

Clamp the flat iron around each section at your scalp, then slowly drag it down to the ends of your hair. Repeat for each section of hair."

Because curly hair tends to frizz after heat is applied, you should complete your straight style by applying a pea-sized amount of pomade wax to your locks. The pomade not only adds weight to your hair but also seals out moisture that could frizz your straight style."

[4] X Research source With bobby pins, you can twist your locks or set them up or back. Since the bobby pins may show in your short hair, choose a color that matches your hair color. Get a good supply of bobby pins in different lengths. They can fall out easily and you'll need different lengths depending on how much hair you're pulling back. Spray dry shampoo or texture spray on your bobby pins so they are less likely to slip out of your hair. Remember that bobby pins should be used with the wavy side facing your scalp since the ridges are there to grip your hair and lock everything in place. [5] X Research source"

Just tease the section of hair from temple to temple, and then push it against where you normally part your hair to increase lift.

Simply grab 1- to 2-inch sections of hair, twist them, and secure them in random places with bobby pins. Insert the pins into your hair and rotate them the opposite direction of your hair twist in order to hide the pin. [7] X Research source To achieve a tighter style and hide your pins, just point the open end of the pin against the direction that your hair is pulled. Then rotate the pin so the open end is now facing the same direction as the hair, and push it in toward your head to secure it. The pins will not only pull your hair tighter but also be unnoticeable beneath your tresses."
