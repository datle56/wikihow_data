      "title": "Keep a whole aloe leaf in the fridge for 4-5 days.",
      "content": "Keep a whole aloe leaf in the fridge for 4-5 days. Wrap the leaf in plastic wrap, taking care to cover the cut end where it used to be connected to the rest of the plant. Once you’re ready to use the leaf, simply unwrap it from the plastic wrap and begin the process to extract the gel. Use a permanent marker to write the date on the plastic wrap so you remember how long you have before you need to use it."

      "title": "Freeze aloe leaves for long-term storage.",
      "content": "Freeze aloe leaves for long-term storage. Simply take your aloe leaf, place it into a plastic freezer bag, and set it in the freezer. Your aloe leaf will have the best consistency and taste (if you’re going to eat it) if you use it within 6-8 months, though technically it will stay good for much longer than that. [1] X Research source For an extra measure of protection, you could even wrap the leaf in plastic wrap before putting it into the plastic bag."

      "title": "Defrost frozen aloe leaves by leaving them on the counter.",
      "content": "Defrost frozen aloe leaves by leaving them on the counter. Let them come to room temperature, which may take anywhere from 2-3 hours, depending on the size of the leaf. [2] X Research source Never defrost a frozen aloe leaf in the microwave—this’ll change the consistency and will drastically decrease its health benefits!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse the aloe leaf under cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the aloe leaf under cool water. Use a leaf you either purchased at the store or one that you trimmed from a plant you have at home. Rinse off any visible dirt or sticky residue that you notice on the leaf. Let the leaves air dry. [3] X Research source If you are using a leaf you just got from a plant at home, set it upright in a glass or jar for about 15 minutes before moving on. This will allow the aloin (a red/yellow liquid) to drain out of the leaf. Aloin can cause diarrhea and other stomach problems if it’s consumed."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trim off the top and bottom parts of the leaf.",
      "content": "Trim off the top and bottom parts of the leaf. Use a clean cutting board and a sharp knife to trim off the top quarter of the aloe, as well as the bottom quarter (where the leaf attached to the rest of the plant). These sections generally don’t contain much usable aloe gel. [4] X Research source Be cautious when handling the aloe leaf that you don’t cut your hand on the spikes that run along each side."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut off both spiked sides from the aloe leaf.",
      "content": "Cut off both spiked sides from the aloe leaf. Place the aloe leaf so that it’s flat against the cutting board. Then, cut away the spiked sides by running your knife along the length of the leaf. Try to cut away as little of the actual meat of the leaf as possible. Using a smaller, sharp knife gives you more control than if you were to use a larger chef’s knife."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel the top and bottom exterior of the leaf using a vegetable peeler.",
      "content": "Peel the top and bottom exterior of the leaf using a vegetable peeler. Keep the leaf flat against the cutting board. Take your vegetable peeler and start peeling from the top of the leaf. Work your way down to the bottom of the leaf, removing the exterior skin in sections until it’s gone. Flip the aloe over and repeat the peeling process on the other side. [5] X Research source When you’re done, the green exterior of the aloe should be gone, leaving you with the opaque gel from the center. If there are small streaks of green you can’t remove with your peeler, use your knife to carefully slice them away. The aloe will be sticky and a little slimy. Try to keep your hand that holds the peeler/knife as dry as possible to keep the utensil from slipping."

      "title": "Dice the raw aloe gel into small cubes.",
      "content": "Dice the raw aloe gel into small cubes. Take your knife and slice the aloe into small, equally-sized cubes, taking care to not cut your hands in the process. At this stage, you could really leave the aloe in whatever size you prefer—small cubes are a good size for using in smoothies or drinks later. [6] X Research source You can leave the diced aloe on the cutting board as you work your way down the leaf, or you can place it into a small, clean bowl set off to the side."

Place the gel in a clean, airtight container and leave it in the fridge while you use it in beauty products, drinks and smoothies, and for sunburn care. [7] X Research source Label the container so you’ll remember how long it’s good for. If the gel is getting close to the 7-day mark, you can freeze what remains so that none of it goes to waste!"

      "title": "Place the gel into small resealable bags if you want to freeze it.",
      "content": "Place the gel into small resealable bags if you want to freeze it. Depending on how you are planning to use your aloe (as additions to a smoothie or beverage, in beauty products, or for burn relief), place various-sized handfuls of the diced aloe into small, resealable bags. [8] X Research source Sometimes aloe gel can get discolored when it’s frozen. Adding vitamin E to the gel can help prevent this. You could also gently blend the diced aloe for 30 seconds and then pour it into ice cube molds. Make sure to label the baggie with the item description and the date upon which you placed it into the freezer."

      "title": "Store the aloe in the freezer for up to 8 months.",
      "content": "Store the aloe in the freezer for up to 8 months. When you first place the baggies into the freezer, take caution to not stack anything else on top of them to prevent them from getting squished and freezing in strange shapes. If you are freezing multiple baggies, try to not squeeze too many bags together in a small place. When they freeze, they could mold to one another, making it difficult for you to extract a bag when you want to use one in the future."

      "content": "Defrost frozen aloe on the counter or use it in its still-frozen form. You can add a few cubes of aloe to a smoothie . You can defrost it and mix it with honey or coconut oil to make hair and face masks. You can rub it over sunburn to help it heal faster. There are plenty of ways to use aloe gel!

      "content": "Blend your harvested aloe in a blender for 30 seconds. Use peeled, cubed aloe harvested from a leaf you bought at the store or trimmed from a plant you have at home. Pulse it in the blender until it has a smooth consistency. You don’t have to blend the aloe, but it does make it easier to mix in with the honey and gives the mixture a smoother texture."

      "content": "Measure out how much aloe you have. Use a food scale or a measuring cup to divvy out the quantity of aloe you are using. Then place the measured aloe into a clean bowl. If you are using a food scale, you could just place the clean bowl on the scale and measure the aloe directly into that so you don’t dirty more dishes."

If you have a recipe that calls for honey, simply substitute this mixture in its place."
