If it does become infected, however, you should closely follow your doctor’s advice on how to care for and clean the wound. This may or may not include washing or soaking the wound with water. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If your wound is infected and open, your doctor may ask you to soak it in warm salt water for 20 minutes, two to three times per day. You might also press a warm, wet cloth on the wound. Use warm salt water with 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of salt per quart of water. If you use a washcloth on an infected wound, be sure that it is sterilized before and after. Alternatively, you can use a sterile disposable cloth. Hydrotherapy is sometimes used in rehabilitation to treat wounds that are already healed, or a bit further along in healing. Your doctor might not advise using this treatment, though, as it’s controversial. It may also be risky due to pathogens in the water that could worsen any infection."

If you never had a primary tetanus immunization, your doctor will want to give you the first vaccine dose. You’ll need to return in 4 weeks and again in 6 months to finish the series.
