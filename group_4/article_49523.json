  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Develop the first paragraph.",
      "content": "Develop the first paragraph. Be direct and immediately state the purpose of the letter. List the name of the team, how long you have been on the team, and your anticipated last day. Here’s a sample first paragraph: “After over a year on the team, it is with great regret that I must announce my resignation from the Pleasantville Lemon Trees Junior Lacrosse Varsity Squad, effective immediately.” The first paragraph does not have to be long. A couple of sentences is fine, unless you have more to communicate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Develop the second and subsequent paragraphs.",
      "content": "Develop the second and subsequent paragraphs. State why you are leaving using non-accusatory language. This means that you do not want to be disrespectful, sarcastic, or mean-spirited, regardless of what has occurred during your time on the team. While it is fine to be truthful, you should always remain positive. Include your reasons for leaving the team, but be honest. For example: “I need to go to a team where I’ll be able to get more playing time.” Mention what you liked about being on the team and any life lessons you learned. For example: “I enjoyed working with you, and I learned a lot under your tutelage. In particular, your comments on both my stick- and footwork have helped me greatly.” Many teams include photos of team members on marketing materials, especially on social media. If you don't want your image to be included in these materials in the future, state so in your letter. Be aware that some prior agreements may allow the team to maintain your image in marketing materials, however. Keep your letter as emotionless and factual as possible."

    {
      "title": "Develop the final paragraph.",
      "content": "Develop the final paragraph. End your letter by communicating your appreciation for the coach. Remember to be truthful. You can always find something nice to say about a person. You never know when your paths may cross again in the future, and leaving things on good terms could be beneficial down the road. [1] X Research source Here is an example: \"Coach Allen, I want to thank you again for all your time and help in fostering my early junior lacrosse career.\" Include your willingness to help the team, if needed, before you depart. Only do this if it's something you're able to do. Don't make any commitments that you can't keep."

    {
      "title": "Select the platform for writing the letter.",
      "content": "Select the platform for writing the letter. You can either write the letter on your computer using the Microsoft Word software application or you can write the letter in an email. If you do not have a computer, you can hand write the letter, but this is not the best option and should only be used if you have absolutely no access to a computer. If you do not have a computer, you can always go to the library because many libraries have a computer center that is open to the public. Usually all you need is a free library card. While Microsoft Word is the most commonly used word processing software, some people also use Pages, which is a software application exclusive to Mac computers. If you hand write the letter, be sure to use good penmanship so that your letter is easy to read."

The right and left margins should be between 1 1 ⁄ 4 and 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.2 and 3.8 cm). You can use the default margin settings included in most word processors, which is 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches (3.2 cm) on all sides (right, left, top, and bottom). Use an easy to read font, such as Times New Roman, Arial, Verdana, or Cambria, with a font size of 10, 11, or 12. You can select a different easy-to-read font if you have a preference. Single space the letter and place an extra line between paragraphs. You should also place an extra line after the address and salutation, however, there are four extra lines after the date. Your letter should not be more than one page in length."

      "content": "Add the salutation. Type or write \"Dear Coach (last name).\" Using this standard salutation, also called the greeting, is good because you want to maintain professionalism. Although “Dear” is appropriate within the context of a letter, it is not necessarily the best salutation if you choose to send your letter in the body of an email. Email messages tend to be less formal and call for a less formal salutation, such as “Hi Coach (last name).”"

Your replacement activity should be of greater benefit to you in the short-term or long-term."
