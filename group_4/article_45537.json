      "content": "Open the System Restore tool. Performing a System Restore is the easiest way to uninstall a DirectX update, since there is no official way to uninstall DirectX. You will need to have a restore point from before DirectX is installed, which is typically created during the installation process. Using System Restore will uninstall and revert ANY changes that were made since the restore point was created, so it should be used very soon after installing the DirectX update. Windows 8 – Open the Start screen and type “recovery”. Select “Recovery” from the list of search results. This will open the Recovery window. From there, click the “Open System Restore” link. Windows 7 and Vista – Click Start and type “restore” into the Search box. Select “System Restore” from the top of the search results list. Windows XP – Click Start and then select All Programs → Accessories → System Tools. Click on System Restore."

If you’re having difficulties running programs and are receiving DirectX errors, you may have corrupt or missing DirectX files. The best way to try to fix this is by reinstalling the latest version of DirectX. The installer is available for free from Microsoft. If you are having issues, upgrading to the latest version may help much more than uninstalling."

      "content": "Update your video card’s driver. Many times, updating your video card drivers will help fix DirectX errors for games and other video-centric programs. To update your driver, you’ll need to determine which video card you have, and then download the appropriate file from the manufacturer. To find your video card information, open the Run dialog (Windows key + R) and enter “dxdiag”. Click the Display tab, and note the Chip Type and Manufacturer from the Device section. Visit that manufacturer’s website. This will typically be NVidia or AMD. Search for your Chip Type on the website and download the latest driver files. Run the driver installer. Your old video card files will be overwritten with the latest version. You may notice your screen flickering during the installation process."
