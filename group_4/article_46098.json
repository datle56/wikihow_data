      "content": "Select a background removal tool. CapCut offers three background removal options that are great for green screen videos. You may have to play around with each to see which will work best for your green screen video. Select Auto Removal to have CapCut automatically detect and delete the background. This seems to work best if the subject and/or camera aren't moving too much. Select Custom Removal to manually erase the background with a brush tool. If you pay for CapCut Pro, you can also use the Quick Brush to quickly select background objects to erase. Select Chroma key to remove background elements by color. This works best for backgrounds with fewer colors, such as if you recorded in front of an actual green screen or a solid color wall. [1] X Research source To use chroma key, select Color picker , tap the color you want to delete, select Intensity , then drag the slider until the selected color disappears. Tap Shadow to add a shadow behind your subject, which makes the green screen video look more realistic. If chroma key removes too much of the overlay video, the selected color is also visible in the overlay. It's best to use a different background deletion tool."
