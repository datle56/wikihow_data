      "content": "Don’t binge on sweets. It’s okay to eat a piece of cheesecake, but eating half of a cheesecake can cause you to feel sleepy in the minutes or hours that follow. Try reducing the amount of sugar you consume in a single setting. For example, if the serving size is ten gummy bears, try to stick to the serving size instead of going overboard.

      "content": "Try eating protein before or with sugar. Eating a little protein before or while you consume sugar can help cancel out the sleepy side effects of sweets. Go for desserts that include some protein, like cheesecake or sweets that include peanut butter. Or try eating nuts or meat before sweets.

      "content": "Eat fat along with your sweets. Sometimes the sugar from fruit can make you feel tired. It can also create a surge of energy, followed by a crash. You can help your body process the sugar more efficiently, and prevent blood sugar spikes and plunges by including fat and protein with your fruit. For example, if you usually consume a fruit smoothie and feel sleepy afterward, try eating a handful of almonds right before you enjoy the smoothie. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Swap out stand-alone sugary snacks for post-meal desserts. Try to avoid eating sugary snacks. Eating sugary foods on their own can cause the sleepiness that some people feel after they consume sweets. For example, if you snack on sugary foods in the middle of the afternoon, rather than after a meal, you are more likely to experience adverse symptoms, like lethargy or drowsiness. Instead, try eating sweets after a well-balanced meal to help your body better maintain appropriate blood sugar levels.

      "content": "Avoid drinks that contain both sugar and caffeine. While a sugary coffee drink may give you an initial jolt of energy, the combination of caffeine and sugar can cause your energy levels to crash. This can lead to feeling tired and even lethargic. Try to stay away from sugary coffee drinks, sodas, and energy drinks. Instead, try drinking flavored sparkling water, slightly sweetened tea, or black coffee if you need a caffeine fix.

      "content": "Reduce the amount of sugar you consume each day. If you fall asleep often after eating sweets, it could be a sign you need to cut back on how often you consume sugar. Try to keep your daily sugar intake within respected dietary guidelines. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that only 10% of a person’s total daily calories come from sugar. For example, a 2000 calorie diet should contain no more than 200 calories from sugar each day. Try replacing sugary drinks with water. You can also replace sweet snacks with low-sugar fruit, like berries."
