For example, you could calculate the wind speed in km/hour, mi/hour, ft/second, ft/minute, and knots. Press the unit button in order to scan through the different measurement options and select the one you would like to use. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Make an anemometer. Cup anemometers are relatively easy to make and are often used as an elementary school science project. This allows children to get an opportunity to learn about measuring wind speed by making their own device. To make an anemometer, you will need plastic cups, straws, a pencil, tape, and a push pin. [8] X Research source Position the straws in the shape of a cross and tape the middle. Then, staple the side of each cup to the end of one of the straws so they are parallel with the floor. Make sure all of the cups are facing in the same direction. Then, push a straight pin through the center of the straws and into an eraser on the end of a pencil. This will act as the axis. You should be able to blow on the cups so that they spin around in a circle."

      "title": "Mark one of the cups.",
      "content": "Mark one of the cups. Use a coloured pencil and mark one of the cups. For example, you could put a red “x” on one of the cups. This will be the cup that is counted in order to determine how fast the cups rotate around an axis point each minute. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Count the amount of spins per minute.",
      "content": "Count the amount of spins per minute. Have another person count the number of times the marked cup spins around the axis in one minute. You can use a stopwatch to accurately time a minute. Record the number of times the cup spins on a piece of paper. For example, it may rotate 13 times in 1 minute. [11] X Research source You will need to complete this step four times in order to get enough data to calculate the average number of rotations per minute. For example, the next recording might be 15 times, followed by 12 times, followed by 17 times."

      "title": "Calculate the average wind speed.",
      "content": "Calculate the average wind speed. Add up the numbers that you have recorded and then divide that number by four. This will give you the average number of rotations per minute. [12] X Research source For example, 13+15+12+17=57. Then divide that number by four (57/4=14.25) to get the average wind speed per minute. In this case, the speed is 14.25 rotations per minute."
