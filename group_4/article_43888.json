      "content": "Yes, dogs can be tickled. There are two types of ticklishness—knismesis, which is an involuntary reaction to a skin sensation (picture how you feel when a bug is on you) and gargalesis, which is an involuntary laughter to something touching your sensitive areas (imagine someone tickling your belly). Dogs definitely experience knismesis, and many enjoy the sensation! [1] X Research source It’s unclear whether dogs can experience gargalesis, although many dog owners seem to believe they do. It just hasn’t been studied and observed the same way as knismesis has. Knismesis is the source of a dog’s “scratch reflex.” This is the natural scratching and shaking a dog will do when they feel something foreign on their skin. To clarify, dogs will not find this kind of tickling funny, although they may find it very satisfying, kind of like that feeling you get when you scratch an itch."

      "content": "Most dogs find tickling to be enjoyable. Dogs are unique individuals and while some dogs won’t be the biggest fans of tickling, many pups will love it. [2] X Research source You can tell a dog likes being tickled if they: Thump their foot and smile. Lean into your hand or follow your hand around when you stop. Wag their tail, raise their ears, or shake their body. Look you in the eye. Some dogs may even laugh, where they let out a little smiling pant."

      "title": "Some dogs do not enjoy the sensation of being tickled.",
      "content": "Some dogs do not enjoy the sensation of being tickled. A lot of dogs just aren’t going to react positively to the feeling of their skin being tickled, so this isn’t for every dog. If your dog hops back or shows any signs of discomfort, stop tickling them and let them be. [3] X Research source A dog that doesn’t like being tickled may: Shy away from you or avoid your hand. Yip or growl in response to your tickle. Tuck their tail, pull their ears back, and show their teeth. Try to make themselves smaller by balling up."

      "content": "Lightly rub your dog with your fingernails or finger pads to tickle them. Instead of a deep, intense pat, try barely rubbing the surface of your dogs skin. Move your fingers back and forth to stimulate them. If they don’t like your nails, try using the pads of your fingers. Some dogs like it firmer while other dogs prefer a lighter touch. Give it 3-5 seconds and see how they react. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Your dog’s will thump their foot or wag their tail if you got the right spot. If you’re tickling your dog behind the ears and they’re just looking at you confused and emotionless, you probably need to keep exploring. Your dog will be visibly excited and animated if you’ve found the right spot. They’ll come back for more if they’re into it. [5] X Research source Take your dog’s previous behavior into account. If they normally love belly rubs, they’ll probably enjoy having their belly tickled."

      "title": "Behind the ears",
      "content": "Behind the ears This part of your pup is covered in nerve endings, so it’s a sensitive part of your dog’s body. It also happens to be a favorite scratching spot. If you need a solid spot to test your tickling, try the area behind their ears. [6] X Research source There’s a reason dogs love scratching behind their own ears!"

      "title": "Belly",
      "content": "Belly This is one of those coin-flip spots for dogs. Your pup either really loves belly rubs or hates them. Give it a shot and tickle them slowly on their belly to see if they like it. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Between their front legs",
      "content": "Between their front legs This is a favorite spot for a lot of dogs, probably because it’s a good middle ground between their sensitive tummy and their face (where dogs don’t typically like being touched). [8] X Research source This also tends to be a great bonding spot for you and your dog if you’ve just adopted them!"

    {
      "title": "The armpits",
      "content": "The armpits This is a part of the dog’s body that they can’t easily scratch on their own. As a result, some dogs really enjoy being tickled on their torso behind their front arms. However, some dogs find this area a no-go zone, so don’t force it if your pup backs away when you touch them near their armpits. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Under the chin",
      "content": "Under the chin If a dog trusts you, they’ll typically love a scratch under the jaw. Dogs use their mouth for all kinds of things, and their jaw muscles can get pretty sore. Tickling a dog under their chin can be extremely comforting and enjoyable for them. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Base of the tail",
      "content": "Base of the tail Some dogs really hate this one, but if your dog enjoys the occasional butt scratch, they may enjoy being tickled at the base of their tail (on top, not underneath). Give them a light tickle at the base of the tail and see how they react. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Unlike humans, dogs don’t typically like people tickling their feet.",
      "content": "Unlike humans, dogs don’t typically like people tickling their feet. Dogs tend to really dislike having their paws handled. The skin between your pup’s paw pads is extremely sensitive, and dogs rely entirely on their paws for mobility. As a result, dogs have evolved to be very guarded and protective of their feet, so don’t try tickling your dog’s paws. [12] X Research source This is also why your dog may give you such a hard time when you try to trim their nails ."

If you’re playing with your pup or you’re giving them pets and they roll over, they’re kindly requesting your assistance with a belly rub. Give them what they’re asking for! [13] X Research source If you’re playing a little rough with your dog or wrestling and they roll over, it’s probably a combat tactic. They need a break, so give them a second to catch their breath before you keep playing. [14] X Research source"

      "content": "If they roll over when you approach them, they’re being submissive. If your pup flops over onto their back when you walk towards them, they probably don’t want a belly rub—they’re just showing you they don’t want to fight. This is a natural maneuver dogs pull in front of people and animals they view as leaders. Get down slowly, greet your dog kindly, and slowly rub their belly to let them know you’re being friendly. [15] X Research source Some dogs will roll over when they’re scared. If your dog tucks their tail when they do this or they whimper, sit with them and give them treats to let them know you aren’t a threat. You two will build a bond, it just takes time!"
