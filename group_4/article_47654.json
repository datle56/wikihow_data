      "content": "Pick a dress with a simple cut. Sequins make a big statement. When you are wearing a sequined dress, you are going to be turning heads. You don’t need a daring neckline or a dramatic silhouette on top of the sequins. Instead, look for a dress that has a pretty ordinary (and higher) neckline, hem, and so on. Let the sequins do the talking, not a plunging V-neck or an asymmetrical hem. [1] X Research source There are plenty of styles with a \"simple\" design, so explore! You may opt for a strapless dress, a basic shift dress, a dress with a simple racer back, a t-shirt dress, a dress with spaghetti straps, and so on! When it comes to the cut, just remember that less really is more. Keep it basic!"

      "content": "Make sure your dress is long enough. “Long enough” probably means something different to everyone, but just make sure this isn’t the shortest dress you own. The downside of sequins is that they can look showy if not worn properly. It's okay to wear a mini dress, but try for one that you can sit in comfortably without worrying. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a sequined dress that fits your frame. You might be able to get away with a little black dress that bunches up a bit in the front or hangs a little off of your backside, but a sequined dress should fit like it was made for you. Because all eyes are going to be on you, you want to make sure your dress is doing you favors! Find a dress that hits you in all the right places and hangs just right. [3] X Research source If this is a dress with sleeves, make sure the shoulders fit. It may take a while to find the perfect dress, but it’ll be worth it."

      "title": "Choose an all-sequin dress in one color.",
      "content": "Choose an all-sequin dress in one color. If you want a dress that is covered entirely in sequins, stick to one color and one color only. A sequin dress will make you stand out, but a patterned or multi-color sequin dress just becomes an eyesore. Whether your dress is black, silver, gold, red, or pink... choose one and stick to it!"

      "title": "Consider a dress with sequin details.",
      "content": "Consider a dress with sequin details. A sequined dress doesn't necessarily mean it's covered in sparkle. Dresses with sequin accents are trendy and often more versatile and \"wearable\" than a full-sequined number. [4] X Expert Source Susan Kim Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 4 May 2021. For example, look for dresses with a sequin pocket, sequin elbow patches, sequin trim, and so on. A pop of sequins can go a long way! Dresses that incorporate sequins through a pattern are also an excellent option. For example, a black dress with gold flowers made from sequins is fun without being over-the-top."

      "content": "Pair your sequined dress with solid colors. If it’s a chillier day and you need to wear a jacket or tights with your dress, stick with black. Don’t get sparkle-crazy and throw a bedazzled jacket or shimmery tights on with your sequined dress. A sequined dress does all the talking, and the rest of your outfit should complement it. In other words, don’t match sparkle with sparkle! [5] X Research source"

When in doubt, throw on a simple black pair. Avoid a metallic pair that will be shine overload. [7] X Expert Source Veronica Tharmalingam Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. Ditch the shoes with an intricate design, because they’ll contrast with your sequined dress. There is a time and place for eye-catching footwear, but it’s not when you’re already rocking a flashy sequined dress. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Skip the jewelry. When you’re draped in sequins, you’ve got enough bling. Skip the earrings, necklaces, bracelets, or any other sort of jewelry. Any additional sparkle will be overpowering and make your outfit look busy. The great thing about wearing a great sequined dress is that you don’t need to spend any extra time picking out your jewelry! If you do want to wear jewelry, keep it simple, such as a silver chain.

      "content": "Layer your sequin dress with a sleek jacket or coat. If it's a bit colder outside or you simply want to add another layer to your outfit, don't hesitate to throw something on top of your sequin dress – just make sure it's the right thing! Opt for a more structured material, rather than a knitted material that will snag on your sequins. For example, a silk blazer or a trendy leather jacket pair perfectly with a sequined frock. [10] X Expert Source Susan Kim Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 4 May 2021. Keep your outerwear simple in terms of color or detailing so that it remains secondary to the sequined dress."

      "content": "Keep your palette neutral. With your bold sequined dress, you don’t want to use any bright or daring colors on your face. Instead, use a neutral palette to enhance your features without looking like a Vegas showgirl. For eyeshadow, stick to colors like tan, brown, gray, or black. For your lips, stick to a nude or soft pink. [11] X Research source"

Then, dust your favorite bronzer on your cheekbones and along the top of your forehead. This will give your complexion a sun-kissed glow, which will work well with your vibrant ensemble. [13] X Research source Don’t forget to brush bronzer onto your neck and chest so that all of your exposed skin matches!"
