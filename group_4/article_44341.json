This could be a private company or a governmental agency. Other areas, usually bigger cities, encourage competition. If this is the case, you’ll need to pick a plan. If your area has several providers, there will be a website to compare them. You could use a search engine to find the site specific to your area, or you could try here: https://myutilities.com/electricity"

You can make your choice easier by researching the providers online to see which one has great reviews. Additionally, use sites like the one above to compare their rates and service promises.

If the electric company is busy, they may not be able to fulfill a short-notice request.

You will need to provide your personal information, as well as your move-in information. If this is your first time turning on electricity, it’s a good idea to talk to a representative so that they can walk you through the process.

It’s best to schedule the transfer at least 2 weeks in advance, or as soon as possible. Even if the company already supplies electricity to the house or apartment you’re moving to, they will need to “switch on” the services by having an employee go out to check the equipment and get the initial reading on the meter.
