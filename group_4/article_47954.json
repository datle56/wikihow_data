Give her a few minutes and see if she sends the message again—if she does, it was probably just an error on her part. [2] X Research source Some people are also just sticklers for grammar. If she sent you a message and then realized her mistake, she might be too much of a perfectionist to leave it alone."

Unsending her message could be her way of letting you know that she’s upset. The best way to know for sure is just to ask!
