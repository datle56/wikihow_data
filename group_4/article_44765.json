If the bite barely broke the skin or the teeth dragged to form a shallow scratch, then you can treat the wound at home. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This differs from a wound where the tissue is deeply punctured, torn, or joints/bones have been crushed. Always seek medical attention for these wounds, which are covered more in Method Two."

[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This helps clean the wound of any germs around your wound or that came from the dog’s mouth. Any soap is fine, but an antibacterial soap is best if you have some in your home. The soap and water might sting the site of the bite, but it’s still a much better idea to wash the area thoroughly."

      "content": "Apply pressure if the wound is bleeding. Use a clean towel or gauze to apply pressure to the bite if it is still bleeding after washing it. [5] X Research source The bleeding should stop or slow enough to bandage the wound within several minutes. If the wound continues bleeding too much to bandage it after fifteen minutes of pressure, then you should seek medical attention. [6] X Research source"

Those bitten by dog’s often know the dog that bit them and can verify that the dog has previously received a rabies vaccination, in which case rabies is not a concern. [13] X Research source If the dog’s vaccine status is uncertain—such as if the dog was a stray—the dog should be observed for fifteen days (if possible) to see if it develops signs of rabies. You should also seek professional medical assistance if you can’t verify the vaccination status of the dog."
