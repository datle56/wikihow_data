Foster care is an incredibly rewarding experience, but you are essentially signing on to be a child’s guardian. While you do get stipends for being a foster parent, this money is actually a reimbursement for childcare costs, not a source of side income. [2] X Research source In Texas, foster parents get a monthly payment between $812 and $2,773 for every child they care for. [3] X Research source You do get a larger check by caring for multiple kids at once, but Texas law limits foster care households to 6 total children, including kids who are already living at your home. [4] X Research source Foster homes create a tight-knit, family-like setting for displaced kids, while group homes are designed to care for small groups of kids under 1 roof. [5] X Research source Keep in mind that the Federal Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 prioritizes traditional foster family placements over group homes."

[9] X Research source You can find a list of Texas foster care agencies here: https://www.childwelfare.gov/resources/states-territories-tribes/nfcad/ Foster care agencies can either be public or private, but both are equally qualified to help you along your journey as a foster parent. The main difference is that public agencies are managed on a county level, while private foster care agencies are—you guessed it!—privately managed. There isn’t a major difference between the two, though some private agencies may take their mission statement and values in a different direction."
