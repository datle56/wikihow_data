      "title": "Remove the cheese from its original plastic packaging.",
      "content": "Remove the cheese from its original plastic packaging. Leaving cheese that’s been vacuum-sealed in plastic wrap in its original wrapper is a bad idea. It suffocates the cheese and can give it a plastic flavor. Gently unwrap the piece of cheese and take it out of the packaging to store it. [1] X Research source Smell or taste your cheese. If there’s a chemical flavor, use a knife to scrape off a thin top layer around the whole piece of cheese. That will remove the area of the cheese that’s been affected by the plastic packaging. If you bought cheese from a deli or cheesemonger and it’s already wrapped in wax paper or cheese paper, skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Wrap it in cheese paper, wax paper, or parchment paper.",
      "content": "Wrap it in cheese paper, wax paper, or parchment paper. Tear off a sheet of paper and lay it flat on the counter. Place your unwrapped block of cheese in the center. Fold the paper up around the cheese, creasing the folds so that the paper lies flat against the cheese, like a present. Make sure the cheese is completely covered. [2] X Research source A good rule of thumb for measuring your piece of paper is to tear off a piece that’s 2 times as wide as the length of your cheese and 3 times as long. [3] X Research source Use tape to secure the paper in place for extra protection. Cheese paper is more expensive. If you’re on a budget, opt for wax paper or parchment paper for a similar effect that costs less. Since cheese is alive and breathing, never store it in a tightly wrapped package. This way, you will allow the cheese to breathe without drying it out."

    {
      "title": "Label the cheese with the type and date that you bought it.",
      "content": "Label the cheese with the type and date that you bought it. Use a permanent marker to write directly on the paper covering the cheese or stick a label on it. Include what kind of cheese is inside (Cheddar, Swiss, etc.) and when it was purchased. This is especially important if you have multiple cheeses in your fridge so you don’t have to unwrap them all to find the one you want. [4] X Research source If you use a sticker label, it doubles as tape to hold the paper in place around the cheese. Writing the date will help you know when the cheese is expired or needs to be thrown away."
    },
    {
      "title": "Loosely wrap the paper-covered cheese in plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Loosely wrap the paper-covered cheese in plastic wrap. Add a layer of plastic wrap as additional protection so your cheese doesn’t absorb the flavors of the fridge. Place your covered, labeled piece of cheese on a sheet of plastic wrap and roll it up. Don’t leave any parts of the paper underneath uncovered. [5] X Research source If you don’t have plastic wrap, a partially sealed plastic bag will work. Sit your covered cheese inside a resealable bag and close it halfway. [6] X Research source Never wrap cheese directly in plastic wrap. Not only can it breed more bacteria from being wrapped up too tightly, the cheese will also soak up flavor and chemicals from the plastic. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep the cheese in a drawer in the fridge for up to 1 month.",
      "content": "Keep the cheese in a drawer in the fridge for up to 1 month. It doesn’t matter which drawer you place the cheese in, as long as it’s in a drawer and not on a shelf. Drawers are warmer with higher humidity so the cheese won’t dry out. After about 8 days or if you notice an odor, throw it out. Harder cheeses will last longer than softer cheeses. [8] X Research source Some mold on cheese is okay. Just cut off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the mold with a knife and keep eating! The exception is if it smells bad or if the mold is a dark black-gray color. [9] X Research source Use a large plastic or glass container to store your wrapped cheeses if you don’t have free space in a drawer. Cover it tightly with a lid. Avoid putting cheese next to foods that have a strong odor like melon or onions. It will affect the cheese’s flavor."

      "title": "Transfer your soft cheese to a tightly sealed container if necessary.",
      "content": "Transfer your soft cheese to a tightly sealed container if necessary. You need a plastic or glass container that’s completely airtight to lock in moisture and prevent any brine from evaporating. If the original container is tight enough, leave the cheese in it. However, if it doesn’t reseal well after opening it, move the cheese to a container that can be closed completely. [10] X Research source If you move it to a new container, be sure to label the container with a permanent marker or sticker. Write down the type of cheese and the date that you bought it so you know how long to keep it. When transferring your cheese, keep any original liquid, too. Don’t drain the cheese."

      "title": "Keep the cheese in a fridge drawer for no more than 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Keep the cheese in a fridge drawer for no more than 2 weeks. The drawers in your refrigerator have the most consistent temperature and humidity so the cheese won’t get too cold or too dry. The best drawer is the one closest to the bottom of the fridge. Ideally, your refrigerator temperature should be set between 35 and 45 °F (2 and 7 °C) for cheese-keeping. [11] X Research source If you’re having trouble using up your cheese before it goes bad, consider buying cheese in smaller quantities. Throw away cheese if there is any mold or if it smells funky. Mold on soft cheese is a sign it’s not safe to eat."

      "title": "Replace the brine only if it gets contaminated with a dirty spoon or hand.",
      "content": "Replace the brine only if it gets contaminated with a dirty spoon or hand. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to replace the brine if you only use a clean utensil to reach in and remove cheese. But as soon as you dip a dirty utensil or your fingers into the brine, you’ll want to change it out. Drain the old brine with a cheesecloth or strainer over the sink. Then, fill the container with new brine and seal it tightly before placing back in the fridge. [12] X Research source Make your own brine by dissolving 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of salt in 3 cups (710 ml) of water. [13] X Research source Stronger brine will preserve the cheese for longer. But keep in mind that the more salt you put in the brine, the saltier the cheese will taste. Don’t swap fresh water for brine. Water will dilute the flavor of the cheese and cause it to spoil faster."
