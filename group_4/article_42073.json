Then you can start figuring out what you want to keep and what you can get rid of. Keep the following: Clean socks and underwear Shelf-stable food items Small tools, such as a pocket knife or can opener. Furneaux notes that \"multi-tools are great for urban environments, where you might need various tools like screwdrivers or saws.\" Bags, especially ziplock bags (handy for keeping things dry) Toiletries Electronic devices and chargers Water bottles"

      "content": "Sell anything you don't need. If you're going to be homeless, cash might be more valuable to you than anything else. If you've got stuff you can't sell but that also won't be useful to you, just get rid of it. If something seems useful but you don't know how to use it effectively, get rid of it—it'll only weigh you down. [1] X Research source Ultimately, it's best to start selling your stuff down as soon as possible so you can build up a little cash. If you don't have a lot of time to work with, just sell what you can for as much as you can. If you have a car, don't sell your car. Being homeless with a car can be much easier than being homeless without a car. At the very least, it gives you a place to keep your stuff. Securing your stuff is going to be a priority as long as you're homeless, so avoid carrying around anything that you can't secure and protect without going to a lot of effort. If you've got a little money and a lot of stuff you don't want to part with, consider renting a small storage unit. You can use it to store your stuff and it'll make it easier to rebuild your life again once you've found a permanent place to live."

What you'll need depends on your circumstances, but this includes documents such as your birth certificate, passport, and any other identification documents. [2] X Research source If you're worried about keeping papers unwrinkled, try rolling them in a thin magazine and wrapping a rubber band around the roll. They'll be curled but pretty easy to flatten out. If you don't have a photo ID, make arrangements to get one as soon as possible—it will help you access resources and apply for benefits. It'll be a lot harder to apply for these documents if you don't have a permanent street address."

If you don't have a phone, set up a phone number through Google (it's free!) so you'll have a phone number and voicemail box to use when applying for jobs. [4] X Research source With the Google phone number, you can access any voicemail messages and make calls whenever you have access to WiFi, such as on computers at the library."

You can also try knocking on the door of any church. If they're not prepared to offer shelter, they typically can offer suggestions on where you can go. Even if you have a car, you'll likely want to find air-conditioned shelter in the summer, when the car will be hotter than outside. [5] X Research source"

Just be careful not to overstay your welcome. Tell them how long you plan to stay and don't stay any longer. Have something else lined up before you leave. [6] X Research source Many homeless people live in hotels, but this can get expensive pretty quick, even if you have a regular source of income."

If you're in an unfamiliar area, search the map app on your phone (the U.S. government also has a Find Shelter Tool ) to locate nearby shelters. Getting a bed at a local shelter can also bring access to a lot of local resources. Many groups partner with local shelters so if you're there, it'll be a lot easier to coordinate things. At the same time, many shelters have limited beds and sometimes have strict guidelines about who they will admit. Be prepared to wait for a bed, especially if you're in a larger city. [7] X Research source Shelter staff are also familiar with resources and can help direct you to whatever you need. For example, you might have access to support groups or addiction treatment services while staying in the shelter. Shelters tend to have reputations among other homeless people. Pay close attention to those and avoid shelters that have a reputation for violence. If you're a woman with children, you'll likely have better luck at domestic violence shelters, even if you aren't an immediate victim of domestic violence."

If you can't find a bed, try to find a relatively sheltered spot where you can spend the night with permission of the property owner. [8] X Research source For example, you might sleep in the alley behind a business and clean the business's parking lot in exchange for permission to sleep there. If you have a car, you can sleep in your car, but make sure you're parked in a place where you have permission to park overnight. Some major cities have overnight parking lots that are run by nonprofit organizations and are specifically intended for homeless people to use."

While you can't expect to get a shower every day, you want to make sure you have access to a place where you can get cleaned up at least once or twice a week (more often if it's hot and you're sweating a lot). [9] X Research source Truck stops do have showers, but you'll have to pay to use them. Rest stops and public parks typically have public bathrooms, but they might not be open 24 hours a day. If you have the money, a membership to a 24-hour gym, such as Planet Fitness, will give you access to clean showers and toilets 24 hours a day."

There might not be a whole lot of benefits available depending on your circumstances, but every little bit helps. If you're in the US, apply for SNAP benefits to get some money for food and water. [10] X Research source Any benefits you can get mean that's one less thing you have to worry about. Often, local social services offices have a universal application you can fill out to be considered for all benefits and aid that are potentially available. Some states also have crisis management services that can help you find temporary shelter and other benefits. Just keep in mind that these services are often very limited, may only be available for a short time, and may also have long waiting lists.

If you're in a relatively urban area, water might not be as hard to find as it is in more rural areas. \"Food is the last priority,\" Furneaux advises, \"because you have more time before it becomes critical, even though it's the first thing people tend to worry about.\" Transitional shelter and homelessness expert Dan Bodner agrees about not prioritizing food. \"My experience is that [homeless people] don't actually need food. There's a lot of food around. People are resourceful about food. In my experience, food is not the limiting resource. Shelter and services are a limited resource.\" If you are out in the countryside, be careful about water. \"Many people think if water is clear and flowing, it's safe to drink, but 90% of the world's groundwater is actually polluted,\" Furneaux warns. \"Even clear, fast-moving streams can have contaminants like dead animals or farm runoff upstream.\" Furneaux advises that you use \"purification methods like boiling or using a proper filter\" before drinking water from any naturally occurring source."

Many urban areas have community gardens that allow you to gather free produce in exchange for working. [13] X Research source Food banks typically prioritize shelf-stable food that will be easier for you to keep and carry with you since you won't have any reliable means of cooking or refrigeration. Feeding America has a Food Bank Locator you can use to find free food banks near you. Generally speaking, don't expect it to be very hard to find food—especially if you're in a more urban area. The challenge is finding nutritious food that actually fills you up, especially when you have no means to cook anything. [14] X Research source"

There's always strength in numbers so when it comes to staying safe, it's always better to find a group of people you can stick with. At the same time, keep your wits about you and be careful who you trust. Keep in mind that camps where larger numbers of homeless people congregate are frequent targets of police sweeps and other violence. [17] X Research source Some cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, and Phoenix, have sanctioned camps where you can stay without the threat of arrest. These camps often have running water and waste disposal services and provide access to other services. Pay attention to warnings from other homeless people. They can help you learn which neighborhoods are safer and which you should steer clear of."

You can't let your guard down or completely trust that anyone is friendly, unless you want to get taken advantage of quickly. It's also best to assume that anything you do, including just existing on the sidewalk, could potentially get you arrested. [18] X Research source Adapt the strategy that works best for you. Some are more comfortable staying on the move and not sticking around in the same place for too long, while others prefer to hang out in the same neighborhood. Once you have a general idea where you can get food, a shower, and other necessities, you can plan your day and your movement around those things. Always remember that as a homeless person, police officers are not there to help you. You are safer to assume that they will view you as a threat and ask you to leave or forcibly remove you.

Even shelters can have a distinct lack of privacy and security. [20] X Research source Zip-ties can come in handy to attach things to your body so they can't easily be taken from you while you're sleeping. If you have no choice but to sleep out in the open, pick somewhere well lit with frequent traffic—maybe even a security camera or two. While you might be more likely to get kicked out of such places, you'll usually be safer while you're there. Keep something to use as a weapon by your side—something that you can grab quickly and that you know how to use, such as a club or a pipe. Pepper spray or a can of mace might also come in handy.

People often underestimate the mental side.\" This attitude is crucial, she explains, because \"even when things go wrong, the faster you can shift from being upset to being proactive, the more likely you are to survive.\" Having a positive outlook also enables you to be adaptable, which helps you better respond to changing circumstances. \"Survival isn't about being the strongest, but the most adaptable,\" Furneaux emphasizes. The best way to \"prepare for the mental challenges of survival,\" according to Furneaux, \"is to practice being uncomfortable… Getting comfortable with discomfort helps you stay mentally sharp in tough situations.\" Bodner points out that \"everybody needs a purpose in life.\" If you find that purpose for yourself, \"a lot of other things can sort of fall in place like a car towing a trailer.\""

Showers are hard to come by when you're homeless, as is a good shave, if you grow facial hair—and these are two things that can make all the difference when it comes to getting a job. [22] X Research source The easiest way to do this, if you can afford it and if there's one nearby, is with a membership to a 24-hour gym, such as Planet Fitness. You can use showers and freshen up in rest stops as well, although those tend to be off major highways and not really convenient if you're in a city. If you wear makeup, stick with products that have multiple uses. For example, you can also use lipstick as blush and eyeshadow and the tiny tube doesn't take up a lot of space.

[24] X Research source Be open to any and all opportunities that come your way. Even if it's something you've never done before, you might stumble on something that you find really fulfilling. Talk to other people you see too—they might be able to tell you about various day labor opportunities in your immediate area that you can take advantage of. At the same time, keep in mind that a day labor job typically isn't going to be enough to lift you out of homelessness—but it can give you enough to cover your basic needs so you don't have to rely on others as much."

[27] X Research source Bodner notes that \"the hardest part of this is… being reliable\" because everything you do is so complicated when you're homeless. But if you're honest and transparent and a place is willing to work with you, you can \"build self-esteem through this effort of coming to work and being acknowledged as a valuable contributor. It's a virtuous cycle.\" If a place turns you away or acts like they're no longer actually hiring, try not to get upset or take it personally. Just thank them for their time and move on to the next place."
