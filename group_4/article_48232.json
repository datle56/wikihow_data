      "content": "A medium is a person who communicates between earthly and spirit worlds. According to occultist beliefs, mediums are special individuals who can channel or interact with spirits in other dimensions. Imagine a séance —that figure in the middle? Probably a medium. Mediums may be able to feel or hear thoughts, voices, feelings, and more from those who have passed on. Some people are more naturally gifted at mediumship than others—however, they must still work to develop and improve upon their innate psychic abilities and mediumship skills over time. [1] X Research source While similar, “medium” is not synonymous with “psychic” (although many spiritual practitioners may describe themselves as “psychic mediums”). “Psychic” is often used as a generic term to describe anyone who works in supernatural or paranormal spheres. However, everyone is “psychic” to some degree—if you’ve ever had the feeling of experiencing a “sixth sense,” a strong intuition, or a gut feeling, then that may be your psychic abilities kicking in! However, while all mediums (and people!) are psychic, not everyone (or every psychic) is a medium—kind of like how a square is a rectangle but a rectangle isn’t a square. Mediums are psychics who have refined their perceptive abilities over time to communicate with spirits in other dimensions. They not only have strong intuition, but they’ve become receptive to the higher frequencies and energies that spirit people operate on."

      "title": "There are two main types of mediumship: mental and physical.",
      "content": "There are two main types of mediumship: mental and physical. Physical mediumship involves the medium’s actual physical body being used to gather information from and communicate with a spirit. Often, this involves channeling the spirit into their body or going into a trance state to relay messages from the other side. Mental mediums, on the other hand, communicate with spirits while remaining completely conscious—they only utilize their mind to interface with spirits, not their bodies. There are seven sub-types of mental mediumship, as you can see here: [2] X Research source Clairsentience: Feeling the spirit’s emotions. Clairvoyant : Seeing objects, colors, symbols, people, or scenes connected to the spirit. Clairaudient: Hearing sounds or words from a spiritual realm. Clairempathy: Sensing feelings within oneself that are transferred from another. Clairgustance: Tasting the essence of a substance through taste from spirit. Clairscent: Smelling a fragrance or odor coming from the spirit. Clairtangency or Psychometry: Touching an object and deriving information about its owner or history."

      "title": "Determine what kind of psychic medium you want to work with.",
      "content": "Determine what kind of psychic medium you want to work with. Like therapists and medical professionals, every psychic medium has a different specialty that they work on based on their specific skills. For instance, some psychic mediums may prefer work geared toward predicting the future, while others may offer guidance for present issues. Depending on the type of guidance you’re looking for in your spiritual reading, choose a type of psychic medium accordingly: [3] X Research source If you want to contact a deceased loved one , choose a medium that specializes in communicating with people in dimensions other than this one (or, in other words, “the dead”). If you want to meet your guardian angel or spirit guide , choose a medium that specializes in angels and spirit guides—not everyone has this specific gift. If you want to gain a better understanding of your present , choose a general psychic reading with someone who has a background in counseling. Tarot readings can also be a great asset for this goal. If you want to predict the future , choose a medium that is honest about the possibility of predictions not coming true—a psychic who guarantees you a certain outcome is not likely to be trustworthy. If you want to look into the past , choose a medium that’s specially trained in Akashic Record readings , past life hypnotic regression , or life between lives (LBL) regression. If you’re not sure what type of psychic medium you want or how to find one, reach out to one of the Psychic Advisors at Keen . Their network of Spiritual Advisors can help you narrow down your goals and find the best Medium for your needs."

      "title": "Research their experience, affiliations, and client reviews.",
      "content": "Research their experience, affiliations, and client reviews. When choosing your psychic medium, it’s crucial to pick someone reputable and trustworthy. The easiest way to find this information out is by looking into testimonials from their past clients or being recommended a medium through word-of-mouth. In addition to consulting their reviews, consider psychics who have years of documented work experience. Qualified practitioners will often also have membership with professional organizations or hold certifications demonstrating their expertise. [4] X Research source However, keep in mind that all mediums have to start somewhere, so it’s okay to choose someone without loads of experience or community connections as long as they seem trustworthy and reputable. To ensure you're getting a high-quality reading, consider connecting with a Psychic Medium through a reputable service like Keen . Their network of talented Psychic Advisors promise privacy and anonymity, and they even provide a 100% satisfaction guarantee if you’re not happy with your reading."

      "content": "Decide your preferred type of session: individual vs. group and online vs. in person. In addition to choosing the psychic medium themselves, you should also consider what type of psychic reading you want to experience. Some mediums offer “spirit circles” or group readings where they work with a large group of participants at once. In most cases, these mediums give readings at random—so you aren’t guaranteed a reading just because you’re in attendance. [5] X Research source While they’re less personalized and private than individual readings, these group psychic readings may be a good way to dip your toe into the world of spiritualism. You can also choose between visiting a local medium in person or booking an online psychic reading. Online and telephone readings can be just as legitimate as in-person ones—in fact, some people prefer them since they preclude false mediums from reading your physical cues! Online medium readings also allow you to work with mediums all over the globe, meaning that there’s a higher chance of finding the right individual for your goals and comfort level. Keen's network of Psychic Advisors is a great option if you decide that a virtual reading is the most comfortable route for you. Plus, new customers get a 5-minute reading for just $1."

      "content": "Look for a psychic who’s transparent about their practices. Once you’ve narrowed your choices down to a few reputable psychic mediums (either online or in your local area), reach out to each one and ask them about their psychic practices. A trustworthy medium should be able to clearly (and happily) explain their process to you, answer any questions you have, and provide guidance to help you find the right psychic reading experience for you. [6] X Research source Avoid any practitioners who are vague about their practices, seem disgruntled about your queries, or use fear-mongering to pressure you into a reading (i.e., “I can sense that something bad is about to happen to you, but I need to conduct a complete reading to tell you how to avoid it”)."

      "content": "Schedule a sample reading or consultation. If you’ve set your sights on someone who you believe will be a great match for you, ask to schedule a trial reading or consultation before booking a full reading. This sample psychic reading will give you a chance to assess their energy and abilities and determine whether or not their practice and approach resonate with you. If not, you can return to the drawing board and try a consultation with a different medium. Keen's 5-minute reading for $1 offer is a great opportunity to test the waters with a new Medium and see if you're a good match. During your 5-minute reading, you can ask questions about your love life, relationships, career, and more."

      "content": "Trust your instincts. Ultimately, the right medium for someone else may not be the right person for you. Use your own intuitive abilities to figure out whether a certain practitioner feels like the right fit. If you feel uncomfortable, something feels off, or you get a negative energy, it’s completely fine to look for a different practitioner. Your comfort during a psychic reading is the most important factor, as the personal connection between you and your chosen medium will make their readings that much deeper and more helpful to you.

      "title": "Make a list of your most pressing concerns about your life.",
      "content": "Make a list of your most pressing concerns about your life. Identify the areas of your life that you need the most guidance with—these areas could include relationships, work, spiritual development, family issues, and more. Then, order your concerns in a list from most to least important. Most psychic readings and medium sessions go by faster than you think—by preparing a list ahead of time and knowing exactly what you want out of your psychic experience, you’re more likely to get guidance on your most urgent concerns. [8] X Research source Avoid asking your medium about health-related topics—most practitioners don’t want to dole out medical advice unless they work specifically on medical issues."

    {
      "title": "Ask specific and open-ended questions.",
      "content": "Ask specific and open-ended questions. Along with your list of concerns, consider preparing some initial questions to ask your psychic medium . Avoid passive questions (“Will I…?”) or questions fueled by doubt or a need for reassurance (“Should I…?”). Instead, ask questions that are highly specific and open-ended, like “I’m having trouble communicating honestly with my partner; how can I resolve this?” [9] X Research source However, avoid giving away too much information during your reading, i.e., “I was just left a large sum of money and don’t know what I should spend it on.” Questions such as this may open you up to scam risk. As you ask your questions, consider keeping a pen and paper near you to note your psychic medium’s responses. This step is totally optional, but it may help you better internalize and implement your psychic’s insights after the session is over!"

      "content": "Have realistic expectations for your medium reading. Remember—psychics and mediums aren’t magic, and they can’t just look into a crystal ball and give you an exact vision of what your past and future look like. No reputable psychic medium will claim to be right 100% of the time. You have free will, so your new decisions and actions (even the ones based on your reading!) may affect the outcomes of your life and life events. Heed the guidance and insight of your psychic medium, but don’t take it as gospel."

      "title": "Let yourself relax and go with the flow of the reading.",
      "content": "Let yourself relax and go with the flow of the reading. During the reading itself, let yourself relax. Set aside any doubts or preconceptions about the experience (unless you feel uncomfortable or endangered, of course). Follow the lead set by your psychic medium and let yourself take in their words with an open mind. After the reading, you’re more than welcome to take their advice with a grain of salt, but stay open to their method during the session itself. [10] X Research source However, you should also keep in mind that no one knows you, your spiritual guide, or your deceased loved ones better than you. While a psychic medium can read the energies around you and interpret them according to their expertise, they aren’t perfect, and they don’t intimately know your life story. If something really doesn’t resonate with you or what you know of your identity and relationships, it’s okay to set it aside."

      "title": "Keep in mind the differences between psychic and medium readings.",
      "content": "Keep in mind the differences between psychic and medium readings. Just as psychics are distinct from psychic mediums, psychic readings are distinct from psychic medium readings. Both may serve your purposes equally well, but it’s still crucial to be informed of their differences before committing to one over the other. [11] X Research source Psychic readings sense or feel the past, present, and future of the object or person in front of them. Psychics rely on their basic intuition to gather information about the person they are trying to read. Psychic medium or medium readings are a bit more involved, as these practitioners tune into the spiritual energy around the person they are trying to read. Unlike pure psychics, psychic mediums rely on non-physical energy to provide them with information about the person in front of them. Additionally, psychic readings more often focus on predicting future events. Mediums are more likely to tune into past and present issues, although some practitioners may also make predictions about the future!"
