      "content": "Find a bra that has appropriate coverage to go with high-waisted briefs. Since you’re already wearing a dress that’s quite revealing, it’s a good idea to make sure your chest is fully supported.

If you’re not worried about revealing too much of your chest, you can opt for a regular bra or bralette. Choose a bra that fits you well and that you feel comfortable in—and that you feel comfortable with others seeing, even if it will be obscured."
