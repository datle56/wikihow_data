      "content": "Learn about autism . Autism is a very complex and misunderstood disability, so it takes a lot of research to understand it. Read lists of traits and essays by autistic people. Autistic people are often the best source, because they have firsthand experience with how their brains work, and some stereotypes are wildly inaccurate. Signs of autism include: Social struggles [1] X Expert Source Meredith Brinster, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 23 July 2021. (being perceived as rude, feeling like you're \"guessing\" what to say, trouble relating to peers, etc.) Difficulty understanding social relationships [2] X Expert Source Meredith Brinster, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 23 July 2021. Difficulty reading faces and interacting with others Learning to hide your true personality because people tend to judge you harshly if you speak your mind and be yourself (known as \"autistic masking\") May need more alone time Avoidance of eye contact, staring, or unusual eye contact May not want cuddling Uneven physical or verbal skills. For example, poor handwriting or bad coordination. Intense focus and large memory, especially when studying favorite things; may remember childhood well Difficulty with forming or understanding spoken words. May struggle with forming coherent sentences, and prefer written words, sign language, typing, or other forms of communication Intense, narrow interests that bring you joy [3] X Expert Source Meredith Brinster, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 23 July 2021. Preference of routines and sameness [4] X Expert Source Meredith Brinster, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 23 July 2021. Strong, overpowering emotions, potentially resulting in meltdowns Idiosyncratic speech: echoing words or phrases, [5] X Research source flat or singsong tone of voice, unusual pitch, and/or artistic and abstract language. Exaggerated response or little response to sensory input like sound, light, smell, taste, etc. Interest in how things work Stimming behaviors (e.g. hand flapping, rocking, tapping pencils, hugging oneself, clapping hands, jumping, spinning, etc.) Strong sense of justice and morality Remarkable honesty and loyalty"

      "content": "Research carefully before making too many assumptions. Reading one article on autism isn't enough to get a good sense. Read the diagnostic criteria, delve into the Autistic community online, and read how autistics describe autism. Reflect as you read. Does it fit you? Research related and co-occurring conditions. Is it possible that you have any of these in addition to autism, or instead of autism? Keep in mind that autism is not perfectly understood. There is still misinformation out there, and there are studies with contradictory and unclear conclusions. Some information is written by non-autistic people who never consulted any autistics, and thus may have gotten something wrong."

Did you hit your milestones in an unusual order? (This includes early childhood, and also later childhood, such as learning to ride a bike or swim.) Reflect on your childhood and see if autism explains any of your quirks, strengths, or struggles. Do you remember things like: Lining up toys (in straight lines, arrays, or other arrangements) Stimming like hand-flapping, finger-tapping, or rocking Repetitive rituals, e.g. pacing around an object and touching it repetitively Making up stories in your head instead of playing them out with toys Meltdowns or shutdowns after many of your peers had outgrown \"tantrums\" Struggling with motor tasks like learning to ride a bike, swimming, writing neatly, or taking outdoor clothes like coats/shoes off/on quickly Not knowing how to make friends Finding it easier to relate to adults than their peers Peers treating you like an outsider or a younger child Being frequently criticized/corrected for your body language or things you say, despite you doing your best"

Try a time like doing simple chores together, a long car ride, or cleaning up after dinner. If your parents are moving quickly, being louder than usual, or being short with you, that means they are probably stressed and not ready to listen. Avoid times of extra stress, like when someone is sick, a big transition (e.g. right before a vacation), or holidays with relatives over. Your parents may not be as focused, and have a hard time listening well."

I've put a lot of thought into this and it's helped me understand myself better.\" Describe the traits that are most noticeable in you, especially that others can notice.

Instead of saying you're sure you're autistic, say that you think it's possible. You may have done weeks or months of detailed research, and thus be used to the idea. However, your parents are likely hearing this for the first time. If you sound uncertain, they're less likely to give a knee-jerk \"no\" response, and they'll take the possibility more seriously."

Here are some examples of the benefits of a diagnosis: You could learn diagnosis-specific techniques for reducing stress in your life, making you more comfortable and calm. School accommodations could could improve your grades, enhance your understanding of the material, and/or reduce stress. You could get therapy focused on your specific challenges (e.g. sensory integration therapy). Your parents could understand you better, making it easier to respond to your needs and quirks.

Many autistic people are able to speak. Autism isn't always obvious from a young age. Some kids get labeled as \"quirky\" or \"odd\" instead. Autistic people do care about others, often quite deeply. Many autistics have empathy. However, not all of them know how to show this in ways that others understand. Autism is not a childhood disability. It is lifelong. There is no \"cure.\" Autism is not limited to white boys. People of all ethnicities, ages, and genders can be autistic. Autism is not an epidemic. It isn't contagious, the word \"epidemic\" is misleading, and autistic people have many unique gifts to offer the world. Each autistic person is different. Some need a lot of support, while others go for decades without knowing why they're different. The degree to which they have different symptoms may vary."

If your parents are dismissive or cruel to you, focus on how their life might be improved by you getting a diagnosis. For a parent who is annoyed by specific traits you have, such as meltdowns: \"A therapist could help me avoid meltdowns, so then I wouldn't be crying and making a scene so much.\" For a self-absorbed parent: \"Parents are really important in the diagnosis process. I bet they'd want to interview you. After all, you're the expert on what I was like in childhood.\" For a parent who is tired of you asking about autism: \"If we finally got answers, I wouldn't have to keep wondering why I'm different. I could stop asking questions.\""
