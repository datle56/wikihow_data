      "content": "Add 1 rounded teaspoon (6 g) to a glass for an adult dose. \"Rounded\" means you don't level the teaspoon across the top. For children between 6-12, cut the dose in half, adding 1/2 of a rounded teaspoon (about 3 grams) to the glass. [1] X Research source Use this dose for the original coarse powder. Consult with a doctor before giving children under 6 a dose of Metamucil. Don't try to take the powder dry, as it could make you choke. Plus, it will be pretty unpleasant to swallow! Always read the package before measuring out a dose, as the dosage can vary based on what kind you have. For the smooth powder, use 1 rounded tablespoon (about 18 grams) for digestive problems. If you're using the smooth powder as an appetite suppressant before meals, you can use 2 rounded tablespoons (about 36 grams)."

[7] X Research source Taking the capsules dry can be a choking hazard. The medication's job is to absorb liquid in the intestines, making it easier to have a bowel movement by collecting the food in your stomach together. However, if you don't have enough liquid in your stomach, it can cause constipation. [8] X Research source"
