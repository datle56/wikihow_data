      "content": "Wear protective equipment and work in a well-ventilated space. In it’s liquid state, epoxy resin can irritate your skin, eyes, and respiratory system. Before you start working with the resin, put on a pair of safety goggles and rubber gloves. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area so you don’t breath in the fumes. [1] X Research source Nitrile rubber gloves work best and can be found at hardware stores and online. You can find safety glasses at department stores, hardware stores, and online. Use a fan to help ventilate the area."

      "title": "Set up the materials you need before you start working.",
      "content": "Set up the materials you need before you start working. Once you mix the epoxy resin, you need to use it immediately so it doesn’t harden. Gather the epoxy, buckets, and mixing implements you plan to use. Keep the rollers or brushes you will use to apply the epoxy nearby. Use a spatula or a paint stirrer to mix the epoxy. Mix epoxy together in a bucket if you’re spreading it over a larger surface like a floor or countertop. The bottom of an aluminum soda can is great for mixing a small amount of epoxy resin."

      "title": "Clean the surface that you plan to seal with soap and water.",
      "content": "Clean the surface that you plan to seal with soap and water. Whether it’s a tabletop, a floor, or a small crack in a chair, you need to clean the surface to remove any dust or dirt that could get trapped in the resin. The dirt will affect the look, feel, and effectiveness of the resin. [2] X Research source Use dish soap, warm water, and a rag or mop to wipe the surface down. Make sure the surface is dry before you apply epoxy resin to it."

      "title": "Mix the epoxy resin according to the instructions on the packaging.",
      "content": "Mix the epoxy resin according to the instructions on the packaging. Depending on which brand and type of epoxy resin you’re using, you’ll need to combine the resin and hardener together before you use it. Use a bucket for a large amount of resin to be used on a bigger surface like a countertop or table. Use the bottom of an aluminum can to mix together a small amount of resin to fill or seal a small crack or break. [3] X Research source Make sure the resin is mixed together properly or it could peel or crack. Apply the resin as soon as you mix it together so it doesn’t start to harden. If any epoxy resin gets on your skin, wash it off with soap and warm water immediately."

      "content": "Use epoxy resin to add a high gloss seal to a surface. Epoxy resin has many applications. You can apply it to metal to keep it from rusting, or you can cover a floor or a countertop to add a durable protective coating. You can even add paint, mica powders, glitter, or metal foils to create different colors and styles. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Seal a concrete floor with epoxy resin. Add a glossy, non-stick surface to your concrete floor by applying a thin, even layer of epoxy resin with a foam roller. Use smooth, broad strokes to apply the resin to the floor. [5] X Research source The concrete will also last longer and is less likely to crack with a protective coating."

      "content": "Protect wooden doors or tables with an epoxy seal. Use a foam roller for larger doors and tables, or use a paint brush to apply a coating of epoxy resin. When the resin cures, it will help preserve the wood and will add a glossy shine to it. [6] X Research source The epoxy will also seal in the color of the stained wood so it lasts longer."

      "content": "Create a decorative pattern on epoxy flooring . Lay down colored stone or vinyl chips in a pattern and cover them with a layer of epoxy resin. The clear epoxy will allow the colored stone or chips to be seen through the protective and glossy coat. [8] X Research source The epoxy resin will also make the surface non-slip. Add colored quartz or stone aggregate to the top layer of epoxy to create a uniform color."

      "content": "Allow the resin to harden overnight. Different brands and blends of epoxy resin will have different drying times, but most require several hours to fully harden. Allow the resin to dry overnight or at least 8 hours so it hardens completely. [9] X Research source Check the packaging for specific drying times. Point a fan at the epoxy resin to dry it more quickly."

      "title": "Apply epoxy resin as an effective bonding agent.",
      "content": "Apply epoxy resin as an effective bonding agent. Epoxy resin is a versatile adhesive and bonding agent that can retain its strength, fill gaps, and still retain its strength. You can use it to connect parts and make repairs. [10] X Research source Epoxy resin uses 2 parts that are mixed together and cause a chemical reaction that causes it to harden, so it needs to be used right after you mix it according to the directions from the manufacturer. The time it takes epoxy to harden can vary based on the chemical hardener used by the manufacturer."

      "content": "Fix loose-fitting joints in furniture with epoxy resin. Epoxy works as an adhesive and also fills in gaps without losing any of its strength. Brush a layer of epoxy resin onto both of the parts you want to join together, assemble them back together, and allow the epoxy to cure. [11] X Research source For example, you can repair loose-fitting joints in a wooden chair by applying epoxy to the parts and reconnecting them. Use a flux brush to brush the epoxy onto the furniture. Make sure the epoxy you use is formulated or safe for wood."

Use a mold like an ice cube tray, place the items inside of the mold, then pour enough clear epoxy resin to fill the mold. When it cures, you can remove it and display it. [13] X Research source For example, put a beetle into the mold, then fill it with epoxy resin to create cool insect art. Use a few different flowers and place them in the mold with the resin to form a colorful scene. The resin won’t break down, so your creations will last indefinitely."
