It then curves to the northwest and the routes break away, sending this highway northwest past Andrus Park into Centuck, before traveling straight north-northeast with bounded lines bending to the northeast on either side of Grassy Sprain Reservoir, then crossing Sprain Ridge Park and a golf course. The highway will cross Ardsley Rd, Underhill Rd, and the Sunningdale Country Club. It passes East Rumbrook Park, Anthony F. Veteran Park, and Secor Woods Park, within a half mile of Ferncliff Cemetery and the site of Malcolm X's burial plot [3] X Research source , and continues past an exit for I-287 (on a very curvy route), into Elmsford past Blythedale Children's Hospital, where it begins traveling northwest (allowing you to view Westchester Medical Center/New York Medical College). Finally, it swings east to catch its endpoint at the Taconic State Parkway - serving the confusion at the Taconic State Parkway's exit 2 - where it ends. This parkway doesn't have official exit numbers, [4] X Research source so this article will reference mile markers for these exits instead. In Westchester County, expect exits for Yonkers, Ardsley, Greenburgh, Elmsford, Greenburgh, and Hawthorne. Travel within Yonkers. Expect exits at mile markers 0.00 miles (0 km) (for the Bronx River Parkway), 1.88 miles (3.03 km) (for NY-100/Central Ave) and at mile marker 1.33 miles (2.14 km) (for Tuckahoe Rd/Ridge Hill Blvd). Travel within Ardsley. Expect exits at mile marker 4.00 miles (6.44 km) (for Jackson Ave). Travel within Greenburgh. Expect an exit at NY-100B at 7.6 miles (12.2 km) (for the NY-100B). Travel within Elmsford. Expect an exit for I-287 at mile marker 8.91 miles (14.34 km) (for the I-287/Cross Westchester Expressway. Travel within Greenburgh. Expect an exit for NY-100C/Grasslands Rd at mile marker 10.39 miles (16.72 km). Travel within Hawthorne. Expect exits at mile markers 11.2 miles (18.0 km) (for NY-100/Hospital Rd and Westchester Medical Center)."
