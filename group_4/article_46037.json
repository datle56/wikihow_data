      "content": "Learn how FTP differs from HTTP. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, and is a connection method designed for transferring files from a remote server to local computer, and vice versa. FTP is often used in corporate and academic settings, and is the primary way of managing webpage servers. [1] X Research source While HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) allows for file transfers, it is not as robust as FTP transfers."

      "content": "Understand the parts of an FTP address. When you come across FTP addresses on a webpage, they are usually denoted in the same way as a usual webpage address—with a couple of exceptions: For example, you might see ftp.example.com:21 . This means that the address is ftp.example.com and the port used is 21 . You will need both of these when connecting to the FTP server. If the FTP requires a username, it may be written as username@ftp.example.com:21 where \"username\" is the required name. If no username is specified, then you will usually need to enter \"anonymous\" as the username when you connect. Note that you are not actually anonymous when you connect to a public FTP; the host can see your IP address."

      "title": "Determine how you prefer to connect.",
      "content": "Determine how you prefer to connect. There are three main ways to connect to FTP servers: via visual clients, via browser-based clients, or through the command line. Downloading and installing a visual client is the most widely used and easiest way to connect to an FTP, and also affords you the most power and control over the process. The majority of this guide will focus on using an FTP client. [2] X Research source A visual client is essentially just a program which allows you to enter the necessary FTP address and port; the program does all of the hard work from there. To connect to an FTP through a web browser, simply enter the FTP address into the address bar just like any other website. You may be asked for login credentials, and then you can browse the directories. Using a browser is usually much slower and less reliable than using a designated client. If you're interested in how to connect to an FTP using the command line, see the final section of this guide ."
