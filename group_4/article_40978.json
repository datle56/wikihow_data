However, more than 400 mg of caffeine makes you feel more stimulated and leads to stress. If you’re feeling on edge and have had more than 4 cups, then your symptoms are probably coffee-related. [2] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source If you already have an anxiety disorder, you may be more susceptible to caffeine. You may have a different caffeine tolerance than other people, so you could feel anxiety even if you have less coffee. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, limit yourself to 200 mg of caffeine, or 1–2 cups of coffee, each day. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Small amounts of coffee usually don’t cause problems, so it may be okay for some people but cause anxiety in others.

Limit how much coffee you have if you have pre-existing heart conditions since it may exacerbate your symptoms. You’re more likely to experience a temporary rise in blood pressure if you aren’t a regular coffee drinker.
