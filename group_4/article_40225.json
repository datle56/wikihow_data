      "content": "Familiarize yourself with Hindi nouns. In Hindi, all nouns, which are words for objects, places, and people, have a gender: masculine (M) or feminine (F). Make sure you remember the gender or every noun in Hindi as the gender of Hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication of the language. You can apply a general rule to determine the gender for a noun. Words that end with the vowel आ aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel ई ee are usually feminine. Keep in mind there are many exceptions to this rule. To be on the safe side, you should still learn the gender of all nouns by memorizing them and lots of practice using them in Hindi sentences and phrases. For example, the noun for boy is: लड़का ladkaa (M) and the noun for girl is: लड़की ladkee (F). The general rule of gender applies in the case of these nouns. Some feminine nouns in Hindi can also be created by adding 'ya'. Example, old lady translates to बूढ़ी budhi and also बूढ़ीया budhiya. But nouns like मेज़ mez - Desk (F) or घर ghar - House (M) are all exceptions to the general rule of gender."

      "title": "Learn Hindi pronouns.",
      "content": "Learn Hindi pronouns. To communicate effectively in Hindi, you will need to learn simple pronouns like “he, she, I, we, they”. The pronouns in Hindi are: First person singular: मैं main - I First person plural: हम hum - We Second person singular: तू too - You (Intimate) Second person plural: तुम tum - You (Informal), आप aap - You (Formal) Keep in mind each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. You should use the formal आप aap when you are meeting someone for the first time, talking to an elder or if you wish to show respect to the person whom you are speaking to. The informal तुम thum is used when you are talking with your friends or close relatives. The informal तू too can be used when you are having an informal or intimate conversation, such as a conversation with your partner or with your young children. Do not use the informal तू too when speaking to a stranger or someone you do not know well, as this is considered as very rude remark. Third person singular: यह yah - He / She/ It / This Third person plural: वह vah - He / She/ It / That In spoken Hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently: यह is pronounced yeh and वह is pronounced voh. You should use यह yeh when speaking about someone or something close to you. For example, if someone is standing next to you, you would use यह yeh. You should use वह voh when speaking about someone or something further away. For example, if someone is standing across the street, you would use वह voh. When in doubt, use वह voh. Third person plural: ये ye - These / They Third person plural: वे ve- Those / They You will often hear वे ve being pronounced as the singular “voh”. The third person plural pronouns follow the same rules: ये ye for people / things close to you (in the distance sense) and वे vo for people / things further away. Note that both यह yeh or वह voh could mean either “he” or “she”. In Hindi, the third person pronoun is not based on the gender of the person you are talking about. To determine if the person is talking to a “he” or “she”, you must consider the context of the sentence."

      "title": "Study Hindi verbs.",
      "content": "Study Hindi verbs. Start by learning Hindi verbs in the infinitive form (in English, “to ___”), as verbs are conjugated in Hindi by removing the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. Hindi infinitives end in ना naa. Examples of Hindi infinitives include: होना honaa - to be; पढ़ना padnaa - to read or to study; बोलना bolnaa - to speak; सीखना seekhnaa - to learn; जाना jaanaa - to go."

      "title": "Practice conjugating verbs.",
      "content": "Practice conjugating verbs. You must conjugate verbs in Hindi to reflect grammatical categories such as number, gender, tense, and mood. For example, the infinitive verb होना honaa- to be, conjugated for number becomes: मैं हूँ main hoon('n' is silent) - I am हम हैं ham hain('n' is silent) - We are तू है thoo hai - You are (intimate) तुम हो thum ho -- You are (informal) आप हैं aap hain - You are (formal) यह है yah hai - he/she/this is वह है voh hai - he/she/that is ये हैं ye hain - these/they are वे हैं ve hain - those/they are There are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense: For masculine singular subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ता taa. For masculine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ते te. For feminine singular or feminine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ती tee. Hindi verbs have many tenses so you will need to use reference materials such as textbooks and language guides to learn how to conjugate verbs beyond the present tense. You can also use a good reference dictionary to assist you in conjugating new verbs."
