You lack access to contraception, barriers, or sexual healthcare. You are underage, or feel that you are too young.

Most people do not live their entire lives as virgins, and it's good to set clear and reasonable goals for yourself. Think about how long you want to stay a virgin, and know that you can always modify the decision if it no longer works for you. [5] X Research source Deciding to be celibate for years is too much pressure for some people. Try making a time-limited contract with yourself (e.g. \"I will be celibate this month\"), and then reviewing and possibly renewing it at the end of each month. Some people prefer to wait until marriage. This is absolutely okay. Just remember not to rush into a marriage based on your hormones; marriage is a big decision and you want it to be with the right person!"

[7] X Research source Don't let your celibacy be driven by fear, but instead by a healthy and informed choice to avoid sex. Most people end up having sex at some point in their lives. If at some point you decide that you're ready, you shouldn't have to feel guilty about it."

What kind of intimate contact are you okay with, and what is too far for you? How do you define “virginity”? Is it a spiritual, mental, or physical state or some combination thereof? You’ll need to have these parameters in place for yourself so you’ll know what’s okay for you and be able to communicate it clearly to others.

Though it may be tempting to put off telling a person you like that you plan to maintain your virginity, don’t. They’ll find out eventually. It's better to make sure you're on the same page about you want in a relationship before you get too attached. If the person isn’t on the same page and can’t be in a relationship without sex, that’s okay—that’s their choice to make. But don’t feel pressured by their decisions; mutually respect one another’s decisions. If you aren’t on the same page, it’s okay to go your separate ways with no hard feelings.

If you're uncertain, just say so. A basic \"I'm not sure\" works, or you can be flirty and say \"I don't know.

You have the right to set the terms for your own body; if the other person doesn’t respect those terms, they don’t respect you. A simple “no” should be enough. But if it isn’t, be prepared for some of the pushback you may receive. Some people are not mature enough to hear things they don't like. Keep your response brief, honest and respectful (initially), and be prepared to repeat it if necessary. You can use the broken record technique, which means repeating the same thing in the face of pressure (e.g. \"No\" or \"I don't want to\"). For example, if someone says, “If you don’t let me do this, it means you don’t love me.” Respond by saying, “I love you and I don’t want you to touch me right now/in that way.” If someone says, “But you let me do this before.” Respond with “I have the right to change my mind.” [22] X Research source If someone says, “You’re just a prude (or frigid or repressed or whatever),” respond with “I’m comfortable with myself and my body and I’m asking you to respect that.” If someone doesn't respect your boundaries or makes you feel uneasy, this is a problem.

If you’re alone or nearly alone with the person, walk away and go somewhere where other people are around or where you can get help if you need it (walk towards an emergency call box, towards a cab, etc.).

In order to better resist peer pressure, it helps to be able to recognize it or what it is. When you recognize that someone’s using one of these tactics, you can better prepare yourself to resist. The major types of peer pressure are: Obvious peer pressure: This is the most overt form of pressure and it usually involves direct, unsubtle statements from others like, “I can’t believe you aren’t having sex. Everyone else is!” Underhanded peer pressure: This is the kind of pressure that’s a bit more subtle and is usually used to make you feel like there’s something weird or wrong with you for not conforming. It might sound something like, “Never mind, you’re a virgin, so you don’t understand” or referring to you as “the virgin” or “the prude,” etc. Controlling peer pressure: This kind of pressure is an overt attempt to coerce you to do something by threatening to exclude you or end the friendship if you don’t do what the other person wants. It might sound something like, “We can’t be friends if you’re a virgin” or “I don’t hang out with virgins.”"

      "content": "Define the implications of having sex for yourself. Often a large part of peer pressure has to do with making it seem as though having sex means specific things, like if you have sex you become an adult or are somehow more independent of your parents. Don’t accept other people’s assessment of what your sexual status means about you. This may be particularly important if you’re in high school, where peer pressure about sex can be hard to shrug off. Don’t let people try to tell you things like, “if you haven’t had sex it’s because you’re not attractive” or “because you’re too scared,” etc. Choosing not to have sex means none of those things. It means you’re doing what feels right for you physically and emotionally."

Find and hang out with friends who are accepting of your choice and respect your right to decide for yourself.
