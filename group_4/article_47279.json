    {
      "title": "Store your grapes unwashed.",
      "content": "Store your grapes unwashed. Wait to wash your grapes until you plan on using them. This can prevent extra moisture from speeding up the decay process. Keep the grapes in their original container. [2] X Research source Pull out servings of grapes as you need and then wash them."

    {
      "title": "Rinse off your grapes.",
      "content": "Rinse off your grapes. Pull out your desired serving of grapes. Hold them under cool, running water for thirty seconds. Rub them gently as you rinse.

    {
      "title": "Soak your grapes.",
      "content": "Soak your grapes. Put your grapes into a clean bowl and place it in the sink. Run cool, clean water over the grapes until the water just covers them. Allow your grapes to soak for 5-10 minutes. This can remove bacteria and pesticides. [4] X Research source Avoid soaking your grapes in the sink. This can introduce bacteria onto them and may cause illness. If you don't have a bowl, clean and rinse your sink before soaking your grapes."

    {
      "title": "Remove broken or decaying grapes.",
      "content": "Remove broken or decaying grapes. Check for any grapes that have broken skins or are decaying. Remove and throw them away. These may have bacteria, pesticide, or other residue you can't reach with cleaning."

      "title": "Dry your grapes.",
      "content": "Dry your grapes. Put your grapes on a clean towel or baking sheet covered with a clean towel. Let your grapes air dry for about ten minutes. Gently dry each grape with the towel before eating or using them to remove any lingering bacteria, pesticide, or waxy substance."

      "title": "Mix a water and vinegar solution.",
      "content": "Mix a water and vinegar solution. In a clean bowl, pour three parts clean water. Add one part vinegar to the water. This is the most effective concentration to remove bacteria and pesticides. [6] X Research source Use water that is close to the temperature of the grapes."

    {
      "title": "Soak the grapes in the solution.",
      "content": "Soak the grapes in the solution. Place your grapes in the water and vinegar solution. Allow them to sit in the solution for 5-10 minutes. This solution clears away pesticides and about 98% of bacteria on fruits. [7] X Research source Use a spray bottle to clean off grapes if you don't want to soak them."

    {
      "title": "Rinse with water.",
      "content": "Rinse with water. Empty the vinegar and water solution from the bowl. Then rinse your grapes in cold, running water for thirty seconds. This can wash off any lingering bacteria or residue. It also removes the residual flavor of vinegar. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Clear off grapes with baking soda and salt. Gently pull your grapes from the stem and rinse them under cool, running water in a clean bowl. Sprinkle 1-2 teaspoons each of salt and baking soda over the grapes. Shake the bowl vigorously from side to side for thirty seconds to a minute. Rinse again to remove the pesticides, bacteria, residue as well as the salt and baking soda. [10] X Research source Rub your hand lightly over the grapes as you rinse the second time to remove all traces of the baking soda and salt."

      "title": "Scrub with a produce brush.",
      "content": "Scrub with a produce brush. Get a brush specifically designed for washing produce. As you rinse with water or the water and vinegar solution, gently scrub each grape with the brush. This can clear away pesticides and other residue. [11] X Research source It may also remove up to 85% of the bacteria on grapes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use caution if scrubbing.",
      "content": "Use caution if scrubbing. Grapes have very delicate skin that can break easily. If you plan to scrub your grapes with a brush or baking soda and salt mixture, use gentle pressure. This can remove bacteria, pesticides and other residue. It also ensures you don't harm the skin of your grapes."
