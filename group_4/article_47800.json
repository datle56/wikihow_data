      "title": "“What are you into?” means “What do you like?” or \"What are you interested in?\"",
      "content": "“What are you into?” means “What do you like?” or \"What are you interested in?\" When someone asks you this, they’re wondering what you enjoy doing in your free time or what your preferences are for a particular subject. [1] X Research source For example, if someone asks, “What music are you into?” they're saying, \"What music do you like?\" And you might respond with, \"I like Bob Dylan.\" They might ask you: \"What food are you into?\" This means, \"What food do you like?\" You can also respond using \"into,\" in a similar way. So, \"I'm into salads and healthy foods.\" If someone asks “What are you into?” on its own, they’re asking what you like in general. So, you could say: \"I'm into sports.\" Or, \"I like TV and movies.\""

      "content": "List some of your hobbies. This could be art, music, sports, books, friends, food, anything at all. The more specific you can make your answer, the more you'll let your personality show. So instead of just saying, \"I'm into art,\" you could say, \"I'm into painting and drawing.\" Here are a few more examples: [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good in Action An initiative by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center promoting science-based practices for a meaningful life Go to source “I'm into fashion. I love clothes.\" “I’m into playing jazz music on my saxophone.” “I’m into collecting Star Wars action figures.” “I’m into racing motorcycles. I’m an adrenaline junkie.”"

      "title": "Talk about books, movies, songs, or shows you enjoy.",
      "content": "Talk about books, movies, songs, or shows you enjoy. If someone asks you what you're into, they might want to hear about things you like to watch or read. So in that case, think of you're favorite, and then, tell them. For example, you could say: [3] X Research source “I’ve been really into reading lately. Have you read Little Women ?” “I’m really into Marvel movies. What’s your favorite?” “I’m into rock music. Do you like rock?”"

      "title": "Talk about the people in your life.",
      "content": "Talk about the people in your life. You probably care a lot about your friends and family, so let the other person know that. But usually, people won't use the phrase \"into\" to talk about another person unless it's romantic. So instead of saying \"I'm into my friends,\" for example, you might respond with something like this: [4] X Research source “My family is really important to me.” “My daughter and I are very close.” “My best friend is amazing.” “My boyfriend and I like to surf together.”"

    {
      "title": "Ask the same question back to them.",
      "content": "Ask the same question back to them. Once you tell them what you like or what you're into, you can respond by asking them the same question: \"What are you into?\" This way, you keep the conversation going and show them that you're interested in them, too. “I'm really into coffee. What are you into?\" “I'm into science and math. What do you like?\""

      "content": "Make a joke if you're friends with the other person. If you want, you can take the opportunity to make the other person laugh instead. Say something sarcastic or silly, and you can show them how funny you are. For example, try out one of these jokes: “I really like my car. I might even try driving it someday.” “Seeing the future has been a hobby of mine since next Thursday.”"

      "content": "If someone asks you this during a job interview, discuss your interests. List off the things you like to demonstrate that you’re well-rounded. Employers want to know that you’re an energetic, passionate person. You could say something like: [5] X Research source “I like reading, I work out, and I’ll relax by playing my piano.” “I love to try new recipes with my wife. We just made a great pasta dish.” “Travel is my passion. I went on a surf trip to Bali and hiked Mount Agung.”"

      "title": "They want to get to know you.",
      "content": "They want to get to know you. “What are you into?” is a question that people ask to get to know you better. “What are you into?” usually creates interesting conversation. That's because people love talking about the things that they like most, like sports or travel. [6] X Research source Asking “What are you into?” is different from asking “What do you do?” \"What do you do?\" usually means that the other person wants to know what your job is."

      "content": "They’re trying to see what your values are. “What are you into?” isn’t a question just limited to things you like. Sometimes, your answers illuminate your philosophies on life. For example, if you responded with “I go to church every Sunday,” they’d be able to tell that you’re religious. If you talked about volunteering, they’d know what causes are important to you.

But a lot of times during interviews, this might be asked in a different way, too. For example, the person interviewing you might say: [8] X Research source \"What are your hobbies?\" or \"What do you like to do outside of work?\""

      "content": "In certain contexts, “What are you into?” is meant sexually. Sometimes, people may ask “What are you into?” to mean “What are your sexual interests?” or “What are your kinks?” If you’re seeing someone romantically, this question is a polite way to discuss things you two like in the bedroom and see if you’re sexually compatible. Context is key here, though. Unless you’re physically intimate with the person asking, “what are you into?” usually relates to non-sensual activities. [9] X Research source"
