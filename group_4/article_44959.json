      "content": "“Tripping” means you’re overreacting or acting irrationally. The slang term “tripping” is often used in response to something considered minor by onlookers. Use it when someone is reacting to something (serious and unserious) to let someone know that their reaction is overblown for the situation: Example: “You talked to that girl even though you know she has a boyfriend? You’re tripping, bro.” Example: “No way you threw that desk across the room for a TikTok. Dude, you’re tripping!”"

      "content": "“Tripping” also refers to having weird or delusional thoughts. When you start to have weird or intrusive thoughts that usually don’t pass through your mind, you’re tripping. For example, if you’re usually the laid back type and don’t let much phase you, suddenly getting upset and hoping that someone has a bad day because they didn’t say hi to you would be considered tripping. Example: “I just thought about throwing this egg at this car and they didn’t even do anything to me. I’m tripping, bro.” Example: “I started thinking about us getting married lol. Must be trippin'!”"

Use it to describe embarrassing moments, like if you tripped over your shoelace in class and knocked over someone who’s sitting in their chair. Example: “I took that math quiz and completely forgot that there was a back side. I was tripping, bro.” Example: “I went shopping the day before they had that 50% sale because I completely forgot about it! I was tripping.”"

      "content": "The slang term “tripping” first appeared among drug users in the 1960s. As drug slang, “tripping” was first used in the 1960s to refer to the effects people felt when high on hallucinogens. This meaning became more popular as hallucinogenic drugs did, particularly during the 70s. When you take hallucinogenic drugs, you often act erratically or seem detached from reality, which likely contributed to the other slang meanings used today. [2] X Research source"

This meaning likely originated from its initial use as drug slang along with the use of the phrase “set trippin’,” which was popular among California gangs at the time. [3] X Research source For example, Dr. Dre used “tripping” as a way to say he’s going crazy on the 1992 track, “Nothin’ but a G Thang”: “Never let me slip / ‘cause if I slip, then I’m slippin’ / But if I got my nina / then you know I’m straight trippin’.” “Set trippin’” is when one gang set starts a conflict with another gang set, which may involve acting crazy or irrationally."
