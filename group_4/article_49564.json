      "content": "Consider who the audience should be. In order to get people to read and respond to the memo, it’s important to tailor the tone, length, and level of formality of the memo to the audience who will be reading it. Doing this effectively requires that you have a good idea of who the memo is intended for. [7] X Research source Think about your audience’s priorities and concerns are. Try to anticipate any questions your readers might have. Brainstorm some content for the memo, such as examples, evidence, or other information that will persuade them. Considering the audience also allows you to be sensitive to including any information or sentiments that are inappropriate for your readers."

      "content": "Introduce the problem or issue in the first paragraph. Briefly give them the context behind the action you wish them to take. This is somewhat like a thesis statement, which introduces the topic and states why it matters. You might also consider the introduction as an abstract, or a summary of the entire memo. As a general guideline, the opening should take up about one paragraph."

      "title": "For example, you might write:",

Give evidence and logical reasons for the solutions you propose. Start with the most important information, then move to specific or supporting facts. State how the readers will benefit from taking the action you recommend, or be disadvantaged through lack of action. [9] X Research source Feel free to include graphics, lists, or charts, especially in longer memos. Just be sure they are truly relevant and persuasive. For longer memos, consider writing short headings that clarify the content of each category. For example, instead of stating \"Policies,\" write \"New policies regarding part-time employees.\" Be specific and brief in every heading so that the basic point of your memo is apparent to the reader right away."

A memo is a call for action on a particular issue, whether it is an announcement about a new company product, new policies regarding expense reports, or a statement about how the company is addressing a problem. Restate the action that the reader should take in the closing paragraph or sentence. For example, you might write, “All employees must use the new accounting system by June 1, 2015.” This can also include some evidence to back up your recommendations."

      "title": "Close the memo with a positive and warm summary.",

After you have pressed the download button, the template will automatically download into your computer or may take a few steps to start the download. It is downloaded as a zip file, so you need to unzip the file and then open it in Microsoft Word. It’s a good idea to use the latest version of Microsoft Word in order to ensure that you will not run into any unforeseen software problems and that the template will operate as it was designed to function. If you are operating on an older version of Microsoft Word, simply update your software before downloading any templates."

      "content": "Type your message. Write the introduction, context, discussion and summary parts of your memo in the body. If you want, you can use bullet points or lists to organize information. Maintain the template’s formatting. This will ensure that your paragraph alignment is proper and you have the correct margins and font size. If necessary, you can even customize the memo to use a table. This is sometimes a good idea, especially if using a bullet list or something similar makes the memo look too crowded or difficult to read. Make sure that you have deleted any words that were already in the template. Also, carefully proofread your memo before sending it."
