      "content": "Make note of which style of key you’re trying to remove. The technique differs slightly depending on the type of key. For example, basic letter keys come off a little differently from specialized keys like the spacebar or the up and down arrows. We’ll talk you through the right technique for removing each type. You can’t remove the power/Touch ID button from the top of your keyboard. No matter what type of key you’re removing, it helps to get down to eye level so you can see into the small space under the key while you work. Do not attempt to remove the scissor switch or any other components underneath the key. These parts are extremely delicate and are likely to break if you try to remove them. For older keyboards, most keys can be gently pried up and off with a flat tool wedged under the top or bottom edge of the key. However, the newer scissor switch keys are more complex and variable in their design, so don’t start prying until you’ve read the instructions for the type of key you want to take off!"
