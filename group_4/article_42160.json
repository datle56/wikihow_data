      "title": "Choose your starting location.",
      "content": "Choose your starting location. When you start a new game of The Long Dark in any difficulty other than Interloper, you will be given a choice of regions you can start in, which will greatly affect the initial difficulty of the survival experience. For new players, it's likely best to start in one of the four regions below. Mountain Town has plenty of buildings to loot, but more predators than some of the other regions. It also doesn't have any fishing, eliminating one potential food source. Mystery Lake has a moderate number of structures and low predator density, along with lots of hunting opportunities, and is a good choice for new players. Coastal Highway has milder weather than either Mountain Town or Mystery Lake and plentiful looting opportunities, but parts of the map, especially near the Quonset Garage, tend to have a high population of dangerous animals. Pleasant Valley is very large and can be difficult to navigate, but there's lots to find in the farmhouse, the plane crash, and Thomson's crossing. If you have played Episode 3 of Wintermute and know the region, it should be survivable."

      "title": "Assess your surroundings.",
      "content": "Assess your surroundings. Do you see a building around you? Head for that. It is highly likely that it will contain some items which will prove helpful. At this stage you will likely have very little gear, and anything you can find will prove important. If you see a cave, head for that. Caves often contain some loot, though less than buildings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take everything in the building.",
      "content": "Take everything in the building. Almost anything you find will have some use or other. Don't bother breaking down furniture yet as it takes a very long time. Make sure to search all the nooks, crannies, and containers. Sometimes useful items can be very well hidden in a dark corner. Clothes are not equipped by default. To put on clothes, you'll have to go into your \"clothing\" interface (usually by pressing F), and then selecting the appropriate article of clothing. In Interloper, vital resources (bedrolls, storm lanterns, hacksaws) will only spawn a set number of times in certain places. You will have an easier time finding them if you use a spreadsheet , and follow the instructions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Keep an eye on your needs.",
      "content": "Keep an eye on your needs. On the bottom left corner of the screen, you will find four dials. From left to right, these represent temperature, rest, drink, and food. Below this is a \"Condition\" bar, which represents your health. This bar will start to deplete if your character's needs meters run out. If your Condition ever reaches zero, your character will die and your saved game will be lost. Temperature will fall if your \"feels like\" temperature is below 0C. To stay warm, head indoors, get out of the wind, find better clothing, or build a campfire. Freezing will deplete 20% of your condition each hour, so staying warm is the most pressing need. Rest will be depleted by being awake, but walking and especially sprinting depletes it faster. To rest, you'll have to sleep, which will also restore lost Condition over time. Hydration can be restored by drinking various beverages. Hunger can be restored by eating foodstuffs. If you keep your food over zero for 72 consecutive hours, your carry weight will increase by 5 kg."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the time.",
      "content": "Check the time. Pressing TAB will bring up a sun/moon symbol at the top right of the screen and give you a rough idea of the time of day. For instance, if the sun is at the top, it's noon, while if the sun is near the bottom right and the moon is starting to show, it's early evening. The day is divided up into 13 in-game hours of daylight and 11 hours of darkness. When not doing a time accelerating activity (i.e. sleeping, fixing), one minute in real life is 12 minutes in-game. So if it's currently noon, expect to have roughly 30 minutes before it gets dark."

      "title": "Keep searching buildings and vehicles.",
      "content": "Keep searching buildings and vehicles. For the rest of the first day, you will want to find as much stuff as possible. Be sure to keep your bars up as you do so. Freezing for up to an hour on the first day is fine, as the lost condition will be easily restored by a night's sleep. If you started at night, stay where you're at until morning comes. If you are getting too cold, either enter a building or start a campfire to warm up. While you're waiting, consider fixing some of the clothes you're wearing (requires cloth or leather and a sewing kit)."

      "title": "Find a base to sleep in as night falls.",
      "content": "Find a base to sleep in as night falls. The Long Dark really is dark at night, and you don't want to be outside on your first night as it will be nearly impossible to see anything. If there are few moments of daylight left, use this time to fix damaged clothing, or tear up excess clothes into cloth. For this first night, almost any building will do, as long as your \"feels like\" temperature is above freezing when you're inside. Try to avoid sleeping in a vehicle, as it is likely going to be too cold unless you found excellent clothing earlier that day."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat and drink before going to sleep.",
      "content": "Eat and drink before going to sleep. While asleep, you'll continue burning calories, and will also become dehydrated. Falling asleep with near-empty needs can result in a nasty condition loss overnight. Potable water can be found in toilets, or obtained by melting snow and boiling the melted water using a fire. However, this requires a recycled can or cooking pot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Listen and watch carefully.",
      "content": "Listen and watch carefully. There are four dangerous animals in The Long Dark, namely wolves, bears, moose, and timberwolves. The first three can be found in any region, while timberwolves will only be found in Bleak Inlet. The simplest way to avoid encounters with hostile wildlife is to give them a wide berth. Wolves, bears, and timberwolves will hunt you down, and are drawn by scent. Pressing [TAB] will show a HUD with your scent. Stay downwind from them to avoid being sniffed out. Moose won't hunt you out, but will attack if you get too close. Avoid sleeping/resting in caves that contain skeletons, as these are often inhabited by bears. A bear cave also won't contain any loot. Be particularly careful when nearing the crest of a hill. There could be a dangerous animal on the other side that you can't see and could attack on sight."

    {
      "title": "Don't sprint too much.",
      "content": "Don't sprint too much. Sprinting makes you tired very quickly and consumes a lot of stamina, which takes some time to regenerate. Only sprint if your life is in danger, i.e. to escape a predator, weak ice, or a bad snowstorm. If you exhaust yourself by needless sprinting, you may be unable to sprint when you seriously need to in a dangerous situation."

    {
      "title": "Find a suitable longer-term base.",
      "content": "Find a suitable longer-term base. The base you used on your first night was likely adequate for surviving one night, but some locations in the game are better than others for long-term survival. Camp Office and Trapper's Homestead are popular choices in Mystery Lake. Both have a workbench and stove. Camp Office is located more centrally, however there is a slight chance of encountering a wolf when entering/exiting. In Mountain Town, the Milton House, Orca Gas Station, and Pleasant Valley Farmstead make good bases. The farm has an outdoor workbench nearby, but can be frequented by wolves. The Milton House is centrally located and a good starting point for looting the entire town, whereas the Orca Gas Station offers good hunting opportunities, but frequent wolf encounters. The Quonset Garage is a very well-stocked location for long-term survival in Coastal Highway, but is frequented by wolves, and occasionally a bear or moose. Jackrabbit Island doesn't have an interior fireplace, but has plentiful rabbit trapping and very few predators. Other popular locations in other regions include: the Desolation Point Lighthouse, the Farmstead and Thompson's Crossing Community Centre in Pleasant Valley, the Hunting Lodge in Broken Railroad, and the Ice Caves in the Hushed River Valley."

      "title": "Be extremely careful exploring outside during the Aurora.",
      "content": "Be extremely careful exploring outside during the Aurora. The Aurora provides plenty of light to see by, but predators become much more aggressive, with a longer aggression range than normal. Additionally, walking on live electrical wires can cause life-threatening burns. A flashlight can scare wolves if used on high beam. They also will not enter brightly lit areas under street lights."
    },
    {
      "title": "Do not carry too much.",
      "content": "Do not carry too much. If you exceed your weight carry limit, you will become encumbered. Depending on how encumbered you are, this will increase your risk of sprains on sloped ground, prevent you from climbing ropes, and can even render you immobile under extreme conditions. To avoid this, don't bring along heavy items (i.e. Hunting Rifle, excess kerosene) if you won't need them and are only going for a short trip. If you're within carry weight, this is most desirable, but can be difficult to achieve without the Moose-hide satchel or the Well Fed benefit. 0-5 kg overweight: Generally OK for exploring, as long as rope climbing is not required. 5-10 kg overweight: You will be slowed down somewhat, but can still sprint. For longer trips, this is probably the maximum weight that's safe to carry. 10-15kg overweight: You will be unable to sprint, but can still walk decently. Adequate for short supply runs around your base if it's in safe, level terrain. 15-20kg overweight: You'll become very slow; carrying this much is only worthwhile if you've just killed an animal very close to base and are bringing it home. Carrying more than 20 kg over the limit makes you extremely slow and should generally be avoided, unless you're moving things around inside your base."

      "title": "Maintain your items.",
      "content": "Maintain your items. If you let the condition of your items deteriorates too much, they will become ruined and can't be fixed anymore. Stormy days are a good time to perform needed repairs."

    {
      "title": "Avoid planning ahead too far.",
      "content": "Avoid planning ahead too far. Deciding \"I'm going to go from Quonset Garage to Desolation Point tomorrow, no matter what\" is extremely unwise. If at all possible, do not travel, hunt, or explore unless conditions are favorable for doing so. Blizzards especially are very dangerous, and can result in your becoming disoriented and freezing to death just meters from your front door. Stay home when one strikes. If weather conditions start to deteriorate while you're out exploring, make finding shelter your top priority."
    },
    {
      "title": "Learn to live off the land.",
      "content": "Learn to live off the land. You will need to be able to live off the land once the loot runs out, and hunting, trapping, and fishing are three excellent ways to obtain food. You can also craft the pelts of hunted animals into clothing, if required. Hunting is easiest with the Rifle, though it can be done with the Revolver or Bow too. The recommended tactic is to sneak up to the animal you're trying to kill, aim, and fire at its head. Beware that bears and moose will charge and attack you if harmed and are best hunted from a safe area, such as a hunting blind. Rabbits can be caught using snares, which can be crafted from reclaimed wood and cured guts. Make sure to check the snares every day, or else a predator may claim your prize. Fish can only be caught in an ice fishing hut. You'll need something to break open the ice fishing hole (bring a prybar, hunting knife, heavy hammer, etc.) and fishing tackle to catch the fish."

    },
    {
      "title": "Don't panic.",
      "content": "Don't panic. In general, wildlife will give you some warning before an attack. Wolves will bark twice and proceed to stalk you, while bears will bellow and breathe heavily. Moose will grunt and point their antlers at you, while timberwolf packs will give a loud howl in unison. An exception to this is when coming over a blind crest. You can come face to face with an animal and be attacked with very little to no warning. As you near the top of a hill, slow down and listen carefully."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run.",
      "content": "Run. If there is a safe place you can reach by sprinting, now is the time to do it. Suitable safe places include entering cars or buildings, jumping onto a mountaineering rope, climbing upstairs, or entering an area only accessible by crouching (press [CTL] to crouch). Hunting blinds are a good place from which to hunt dangerous animals because you can shoot from them, but animals can't enter. Bears are fairly slow unless charging, so you can easily outrun them most of the time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Drop a decoy.",
      "content": "Drop a decoy. If you're carrying meat or guts, pressing the [3] key will drop one of said item. The predator will sometimes go grab the item, turn around, and walk away. This tactic doesn't work on timberwolves or moose."
    },
    {
      "title": "Light a fire.",
      "content": "Light a fire. Wolves are afraid of fire, and can be reliably be fended off by quickly lighting a campfire and remaining close to it. Lighting a flare or torch will usually stop a charge, but not always. Throw a lit flare at the wolf if it is stationary and growling at you. This will scare it off. Timberwolves aren't afraid of torches or flares, but will avoid campfires and marine flares. Throwing a lit marine flare at aggressive timberwolves repeatedly will break their pack morale and cause them to leave you alone for a time. Moose are not afraid of flares or torches, but will stay away from lit campfires. Bears do not mind fires at all, and will walk right through them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot a firearm.",
      "content": "Shoot a firearm. Wolves are afraid of shots from either the rifle or the revolver, and will run when they hear a shot fired. Beware that wolves will immediately charge if a firearm is aimed at them, and, once charging, will continue their charge even if shot non-fatally. Repeated shots at or near Timberwolves will lower their pack morale. Killing one of the pack members will lower it even more. Do not shoot a firearm if near a bear or moose. Bears will walk over to investigate gunshots, and will charge you if shot at. Moose will also charge if hurt. Generally, it is impossible to kill a bear or moose using firearms before it reaches you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shoot the flare gun.",
      "content": "Shoot the flare gun. Shots from this weapon will immediately scare off any hostile animal that's trying to attack you, including bears and moose. If you hit, the flare round will attach to the animal, but won't cause any significant damage. Flare shells are rather rare, so save this weapon for bear/moose attacks if possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fight back.",
      "content": "Fight back. If a predator reaches you (with the exception of a Timberwolf, which will do a \"drive-by\" attack, causing some damage), you'll enter a struggle. Pick your weapon (a knife or hatchet is recommended) and start left-clicking to try to convince the wolf to flee. If you are successful, the wolf will flee. Bladed weapons will cause it to start bleeding and eventually die. If unsuccessful, you'll eventually blackout. When you come to, your clothing will have taken some damage, and you'll likely have lost a lot of health. You may have bleeding wounds or sprains, as well. It's impossible to fight back when attacked by a bear or moose. Instead, you'll eventually blackout. When you come back to consciousness, you'll likely have lost a lot of health, and may have bleeding wounds. If attacked by a moose, you'll also have broken ribs, which will reduce your carry weight and stamina. Wearing tough clothes helps reduce the damage you take in struggles. In Interloper, wolves deal so much damage that you will almost certainly be killed if you don't manage to scare the wolf off fairly quickly. Avoid struggles in this difficulty if at all possible. The heavy hammer doesn't cause wolves to bleed, but it has a 20% chance of ending the struggle per swing, and may occasionally cause an instant kill."

These are the only regions with a forge, and the locations with the forge are: The Riken in Desolation Point: Relatively close to Coastal Highway with an abundance of coal in the nearby mines, this stranded ship also makes a popular base location. The one downside is that the interior is very dark, making navigation inside tricky without a light source. Old Spence Family Homestead in Forlorn Muskeg: Although the closest forge to Mystery Lake and Mountain Town, with plenty of coal to be found in the caves nearby, this forge is relatively open to the elements, and predators can occasionally walk in and interrupt you when forging. Maintenance Shed in Broken Railroad: This forge is safer than Spence (except for occasional live wires during the Aurora), and abundant supplies can be found in the shed and nearby hunting lodge. Coal may be difficult to find, though, and getting here may require getting around several wolves along the way."

From there, head towards the coast until you get to the radio tower. Stop at Pensive Lookout if you need to take a nap. To get to Last Prospect, you will need to follow a long and winding mountain path to the northeast of the prison, as the Mule Bridge can't be used in Survival.
