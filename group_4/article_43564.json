Even if you’ve used a multimeter before, the instructions of different models can vary and it’s important to read them to keep yourself safe. Read the instructions that came with your multimeter and check for specific information on how to safely test an outlet with the device. [1] X Research source It’s especially important to make sure that the multimeter is capable of testing the voltage of the outlet. If the voltage is too high for the multimeter to measure, you may break it by trying to measure it."

AC stands for alternating current and it is usually represented by an A with a squiggly line beside or above it, such as ~A or A~. [2] X Research source Locate the power switch on the multimeter and switch it on. Then, turn the dial on the front of the multimeter to the AC setting. The dial may be clearly marked to indicate what the AC setting is, or you might need to check the manual if it uses symbols. [3] X Research source Check your multimeter’s manual if you are unsure of how to turn it on."

Insert 1 of them into the left side of the outlet and the other into the right side of the outlet. [4] X Research source Even though the prongs are different colors, it doesn’t matter which one you put into each side of the outlet. The colors only matter for testing circuits and other types of electrical currents. [5] X Research source"

If it’s a digital multimeter , the number will be displayed clearly on the screen. If it’s an analog multimeter, look at where the needle is pointing to get the reading. [7] X Research source A typical reading for a household outlet in the United States is 120 volts. However, if it’s lower or higher, the outlet may be malfunctioning. Pull the prongs out of the outlet and switch off the multimeter after you’re done checking the outlet."

      "content": "Look for a reading of 0.001 on the multimeter screen. Once the red prong and the black prong are in place, look at the screen or analog dial on your multimeter. The reading should be 0 or 0.001 volts. This indicates that no electricity is reaching the outside of the outlet and it is well grounded. If the number is higher than this, the casing is a potential electrocution hazard. Call an electrician for assistance. [12] X Research source Remove the prongs from the outlet and switch off the multimeter when you’re done."
