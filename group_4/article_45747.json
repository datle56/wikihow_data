Generally, the easiest way to do this is by typing your computer's manufacturer name, your computer's model name, and \"drivers\" or \"BIOS\" into Google and then selecting the proper link. This process will vary depending on your computer's manufacturer, so you may have to click through a few different links before you find the correct one. If you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to look up your computer's motherboard name along with \"BIOS\" or \"UEFI\" and \"update\" and then open the manufacturer's website."

Even if your current BIOS version is a whole number (e.g., 301) and the file on the site is listed as a higher decimal (e.g., 301.1), the site's file is a higher version than your BIOS uses."

For most computers, this key is one of the function keys (e.g., F12 ), though some computers use the Del key or the Esc key. If you don't know your computer's BIOS key, look it up by typing your computer's manufacturer name, model name, and \"BIOS key\" into a search engine. In Windows 10 or 11, you can also access the BIOS settings from the Settings menu. From Settings , navigate to Update & Security > Recovery > Restart Now (under Advanced startup) .
