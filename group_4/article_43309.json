      "title": "Determine if your cat has matured enough to be fertile.",
      "content": "Determine if your cat has matured enough to be fertile. Once a cat reaches about 80% of her adult weight, she can go into heat—as early as 4 months old! If your cat isn’t spayed and has recently been in heat, she might be pregnant. [1] X Research source Domestic cats typically go into heat as the days get longer and the weather gets warmer, usually between spring and fall."

      "title": "Watch for mating behaviors.",
      "content": "Watch for mating behaviors. If your cat is in heat, she will try to attract a mate by “calling” (insistently meowing or mewling). She’ll also seem more affectionate and may lose her appetite. This lasts for about 4–6 days. [2] X Research source Tell if your cat is about to go into heat by looking for signs of restlessness, increased affection, and a bigger appetite. She will also begin making low calls. A cat in heat will roll around and prop her hindquarters up in the air while treading her back paws and holding her tail to the side. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Pay attention to your cat's behavior to determine her fertility phase.",
      "content": "Pay attention to your cat's behavior to determine her fertility phase. After being in heat, a cat enters a “quiet phase” lasting about 8–10 days, and her behavior calms down. Following the quiet phase, your cat will go into heat again and continue to go into heat approximately from April to September. [4] X Research source If your cat was recently in heat and had the opportunity to interact with male cats, pregnancy is a definite possibility. [5] X Research source The length of time from the beginning of one heat cycle to the beginning of the next typically falls in the range of 12–22 days. [6] X Research source To prevent your cat from getting pregnant, spay your cat as soon as it’s safe to do so. It's best to hold off until at least 2 weeks after the mating season, as surgical complications are more common while your cat is going through her heat cycles. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check for enlarged nipples.",
      "content": "Check for enlarged nipples. About 3–4 weeks into the pregnancy, a pregnant cat’s nipples will “pink up,” or become red and enlarged. [8] X Research source Enlarged nipples are also signs of being in heat, so bear in mind that growing nipples are not exclusively indicative of pregnancy. The mammary glands enlarge and may produce colostrum (a milky liquid). [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Look for weight gain and a \"pot belly.\" From the side, pregnant cats frequently look somewhat swaybacked, with a slightly round and bulging abdomen. Meanwhile, her ribs and spine may look bonier. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Many female cats assume this \"burro shape\" later in pregnancy. If your cat is merely overweight, she’ll be heavier all over, including her neck and legs, and not just in her abdomen."

      "content": "Watch for signs of “morning sickness.” Around the third week of pregnancy, some cats experience “morning sickness” like humans do. Your cat may vomit because she has an upset stomach. [11] X Research source Keep an eye on her water intake and make sure she stays hydrated. Test whether your cat is dehydrated by gently lifting the skin over her shoulders and seeing whether it quickly snaps back to its original position. If your cat is well-hydrated, that will happen almost immediately. [12] X Research source Entice your cat to drink more water by adding a splash of low-sodium chicken broth to her water dish.

      "content": "Notice any nesting behavior. A few days before giving birth, your cat will begin to show nesting behaviors as she prepares for the arrival of her litter. She may find a quiet place like a closet and start arranging blankets, towels, or other fabric to create a cozy place for her kittens.

      "content": "Ask the vet to take radiographs (x-rays). At approximately 45 days of gestation, the skeletons of the kittens can be seen with an x-ray, which will confirm the pregnancy and the number of kittens in the litter. X-rays won’t hurt your cat or her kittens. [19] X Research source The vet will typically take 2 x-rays in order to get views of the abdomen and count kittens while also looking for potential problems. An X-ray is better for counting fetuses than an ultrasound, though it still isn’t 100% accurate."
