      "content": "Select a study space with reliable Internet access. You will probably need to refer to online lectures and notes when you study.

Just make sure employees won't mind you hanging around these places for long hours while you study. You can also try a library."

      "content": "Make a calendar to follow. Oftentimes, deadlines won't be as obvious in an online course.

[7] X Research source Use headings and dates to keep track of what materials are covered in each section of your notes. You can refer to these headings later when studying. Do not try to record every single detail an instructor said. Instead, jot down the general idea and any insights that help you better understand the material. Later, when you're studying, you can refer to your notes to remember the major ideas of the course. Even if you can re-watch lectures, taking notes is still helpful. It helps better remember the material later and you can also write down key material.
