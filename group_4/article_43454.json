      "content": "Pick a room in the northeast of your home for the pooja (worship) room. According to Vastu, a traditional Indian style of architecture, the northeast corner of the home is the most auspicious and conducive to good energy flow (regardless of whether you have a north-, east-, south-, or west-facing house ). If the northeast is not available, a room on the north or east sides of the house are the next best options. [1] X Research source Sometimes, a room to the west is acceptable. A room in the south of the home is considered inauspicious. Preferably, choose a room where the doors and/or windows open to the north or east. If you’re designing a new room, a pyramid or gopura-shaped ceiling provides the best energy. [2] X Research source In a multi-level home, place the pooja room on the ground floor and ensure it is not directly underneath a staircase. Choose only one room or area to be your pooja room or mandir. This makes the space more special and reverent for worship."

      "content": "Arrange your mandir and idols to face west, east, or south. The direction your idols face is important since it determines the direction in which you worship, and placing them in the wrong direction can invite negative energy into your home. Place your mandir, idols, or sacred images so that they face the west, east, or south. This ensures that you pray to the east, west, or north (and never to the south, which is considered inauspicious in many cases). [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Position idols away from the wall and at least 6 in (15 cm) off the ground. When placing your idols or images in or on top of your mandir (preferably made of wood or marble), make sure there is space around them to allow for air circulation. This makes them comfortable and allows ceremonial incense smoke to waft all around them during worship. [4] X Research source Consider placing your mandir cabinet on a pedestal or platform to elevate it off of the ground. [5] X Research source"

This helps prevent the flow of negative energy around and inside the pooja room. [6] X Research source Also, make sure not to use idols or images that are chipped, broken, or otherwise damaged, since this is said to be inauspicious. Ideally, the idols will be no more than 9–10 in (23–25 cm) tall. [7] X Research source"

Never place a storage cabinet or shelf above the mandir, since this will block positive energy in the pooja room. [8] X Research source Store only what’s necessary for meditation and worship in the pooja room. Too much clutter is said to invite negative energy into the space."

If possible, use copper or brass lamps, as these metals are believed to purify the environment. [9] X Research source During meditation or worship, keep the lighting fairly dim (like in a temple). [10] X Research source At other times, the space can be brightly lit (preferably with natural light from windows in the pooja room)."

[13] X Research source If you’re including decorative images or artwork, avoid pictures of the dead or images of violence, since these invite negative energy into the pooja room.

If you don’t have space for a separate pooja room, use the northeast corner of your living room or another quiet, uncluttered space in your apartment (the kitchen makes a good backup). Hang some sacred symbols, like the Om, on the walls, along with framed images of the gods or idols you wish to worship. [18] X Research source It’s best to avoid putting a mandir in the bedroom, but if you must, place it in the northeast corner. Adjust the angle of your bed (whether the mandir is in your bedroom or not) so that your feet do not point toward the mandir while you sleep. If possible, make sure the mandir or makeshift pooja room does not share a wall with the toilet or bathroom."

First, remove and throw away any old or dried up flowers, used matches or incense sticks, or other clutter that may have accumulated over the past few days. Then, use a dust cloth to dust counters and shelves, intricate woodwork in your design elements or doors, and other items. [19] X Research source Since incense smoke and oils can leave a film on surfaces, use a glass cleaner spray or another cleaner to wipe down framed images and other cleaner-safe surfaces."

Be cautious not to use acidic cleaners on marble, since it is porous and can erode. If your walls are painted, wipe them down with a paint-safe cleaner now and then, and plan to repaint the walls about once a year to keep them bright and fresh. [20] X Research source"

Bright, reflective metal enhances the reverence for the space and can help purify the atmosphere of the room. Try these cleaning tips to keep your metal pieces and decor looking like new: [21] X Research source To clean brass : Soak the item in hot, soapy water for 10 minutes and use a metal scrubber to lightly wipe off oily residue. Rinse the item, then scrub it again with a lime-sized ball of tamarind soaked in water. Rinse again. To clean silver : Make a paste of water and vibhuti (sacred ash) and scrub the silver with your hands (do not use a scrubber, since silver is soft and may scratch). Then, wipe the piece clean with a thin, soft muslin cloth. Or, rub the silver with ketchup or toothpaste and a soft brush, then rinse thoroughly. To clean copper : Dip a cloth in a mix of equal parts salt and vinegar, then rub the copper item in gentle circles (use a soft toothbrush to reach into small crevices). Rinse in warm water and dry with a clean cloth."
