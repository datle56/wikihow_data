      "content": "Soak in warm water or a sitz bath. To reduce irritation, ease pain, and help shrink the veins, soak the hemorrhoids for 15 to 20 minutes three times a day in warm, not hot, water. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don't want to run a bath, try a sitz bath, which is a plastic tub that goes over your toilet seat. This lets you soak your buttocks and hips while in a seated position. It can reduce irritation, spasms of the rectal muscle, and itching. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source You can also place ¼ cup of sea salt in the sitz bath and sit 30 minutes at a time. Salt is an excellent antibacterial and is used to help with wound healing and drawing out infection. You may also add witch hazel, known for being a soothing and cooling remedy for hemorrhoids. This should be done a minimum of once a day and the Sitz bath should last for anywhere between 15 and 20 minutes."

      "title": "Apply an ice pack to the hemorrhoids.",
      "content": "Apply an ice pack to the hemorrhoids. Place the ice pack in freezer until it's completely frozen. Take care not to apply the ice directly to the hemorrhoids. Instead, wrap the compress in a clean towel or cloth before pressing it gently on the hemorrhoids. Do not leave the pack on for long periods of time or it may damage the surrounding skin. It is best to apply for few minutes, remove it until your skin is back to room temperature and then apply it again. This will help reduce the pain and swelling by reducing inflammation.

World Journal of gastroenterology. 2012 May 7; 18(17): 2009–2017. Try a topical cream with phenylephrine to constrict the vessels, which may reduce bleeding. You can also apply a cream to sooth the pain, irritation, and itching (which may cause bleeding). However, these will not stop the bleeding. Soothing creams can include hydrocortisone, aloe, witch hazel (herbal plant extract), and vitamin E. If you use hydrocortisone, apply it morning and night, but don't use it for more than one week. [5] X Research source Too much absorption may lead to an imbalance in your hypothalamus and pituitary hormones or cause the skin in the area to become thin."

      "title": "Use soft toilet paper and resist the urge to scratch.",
      "content": "Use soft toilet paper and resist the urge to scratch. Rough toilet paper can scratch and/or irritate the skin even more. To soothe the pain and reduce irritation, use moist or medicated towelettes. You can also use witch hazel, hydrocortisone, aloe, or vitamin E medicated pads. Do not wipe aggressively, which can irritate or cause further bleeding. Pat or blot the area instead. Scratching will only increase the bleeding and irritation, causing extra stress on your already tender hemorrhoids. This could lead to further infection."

      "title": "Take supplements to reduce bleeding.",
      "content": "Take supplements to reduce bleeding. Many of these supplements may be hard to find in drug stores, so check for them online and in herbal stores. Always talk with your doctor before taking supplements, especially if you're taking other medications. If you're pregnant or nursing, talk with your doctor before supplementing, since most of these have not been tested for use by pregnant or nursing women. These supplements or traditional medicines include: Fargelin extra: Take these traditional Chinese medicine tablets three or four times a day to strengthen veins which can reduce bleeding. [6] X Research source Kecskes A. Soothing, Natural cures for hemorrhoids. Pacific College of Oriental Medicine. 2014. Oral Flavonoids: These have been shown to reduce bleeding, pain, itching, and recurrence. They increase vascular tone which reduces the leaking of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). [7] X Research source Lohsiriwat V. Hemorrhoids: From basic pathophysiology to clinical management. World Journal of gastroenterology. 2012 May 7; 18(17): 2009–2017. Calcium dobesilate or doxium tablets: Take these for two weeks and follow the packaged instructions. These drugs have been shown to decrease leaking of tiny blood vessels (capillaries), prevent clots, and improve blood viscosity. All of these things can reduce the swelling of tissues that cause hemorrhoids. [8] X Research source Mentes BB. et al.

      "content": "Reduce pressure on the hemorrhoids. This can help prevent or put less strain on the hemorrhoids. Eat a high-fiber diet to soften your stools and reduce constipation. Try to eat fruits, vegetables, and whole grains or take supplements (aim for 25 grams a day for women or 38 grams for men of total fiber). Drink plenty of fluids and establish regular bowel habits and especially avoid straining when having a bowel movement You should also avoid sitting for long periods of time which can increase pressure on your hemorrhoid veins, causing them to bleed. Exercise and walk to reduce the pressure.

This is the usual method for treating external hemorrhoids, especially if they are large or haven't responded to less invasive procedures. Your surgeon removes hemorrhoids with various tools such as scissors, scalpels, or a ligasure (device that delivers electrical current to seal bleeding hemorrhoids). You'll be sedated using a local anesthetic combined with sedation, a spinal anesthetic or a general anesthetic. [10] X Research source Lohsiriwat V.

He will then attach a rubber band-like device at the base of the hemorrhoid. The device will cut off blood circulation and lead to the hemorrhoid scarring, which shrinks and eliminates the hemorrhoid after a time.

If the infrared method is used, a probe is applied to the base of the hemorrhoid. If a radio frequency is used, a ball electrode is connected to a radio-frequency generator. This is placed on the hemorrhoidal tissue, which causes it to coagulate and evaporate. Infrared treatments are more likely to result in recurring hemorrhoids, compared to rubber band litigation.

      "content": "Learn the causes of hemorrhoids. Chronic constipation, straining, and long periods of sitting on the toilet are causes associated with hemorrhoids. These can all put more pressure on and block your veins, impairing circulation. Pregnancy is another condition that puts a lot of pressure on these veins, especially during delivery when straining happens and can lead to hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are more common as you get older and in people who are overweight. Hemorrhoids can either be internal (inside the rectum) or external (around the outside of the anus). Internal hemorrhoids are painless while external ones are painful. But, both types can lead to bleeding if they rupture.

The color may vary from your normal skin tone to darker red. It may be painful if you press on the lumps. If so, you probably have external hemorrhoids. Pay attention to any blood on the toilet paper after you use the bathroom and wipe. Hemorrhoid blood is usually bright red, rather than dark (which could indicate bleeding from somewhere deeper in your digestive system). It can be hard to see internal hemorrhoids at home without the right tools. Make an appointment with your doctor. You'll be asked to give a detailed medical history to catch any other possible reasons for bleeding such as colon cancer and polyps, since both of these masses can bleed."

Bleeding can be a cause for concern, especially if you're at risk for or have another condition, like inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. You should also get medical attention if the blood is dark red or your stools are dark/tarry in color. These can mean there's bleeding higher up in your intestines or from a bleeding mass.

      "content": "Know what to expect from a medical examination. Your doctor will determine if you have hemorrhoids by looking at the outside of your anus and performing a digital rectal exam. Your doctor will insert a lubricated index finger to feel the walls of your rectum for lumps, masses, and look for any blood. If it's suspected that you have internal hemorrhoids, the doctor may insert an anoscope (a plastic tube) through your anus into the rectum. This lets the doctor shine a light and look for swollen, distended, or bleeding veins. Your doctor may do a guaiac test, which involves a smear of fecal matter on a strip of paper. This can detect microscopic blood cells within the feces, which can indicate several conditions including hemorrhoids, colon cancer, and polyps. If you do have a guaiac test, it is important not to eat red meat, turnips, radish, horseradish, cantaloupe or uncooked broccoli three days before, since they can cause false positive results.
