      "title": "Set a time each day to simply reflect on the person you are writing about.",
      "content": "Set a time each day to simply reflect on the person you are writing about. Clear your mind of work, school, kids, the news, or anything else that distracts you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be honest with yourself.",
      "content": "Be honest with yourself. Some of the ideas that come to you may seem corny, even to yourself, but that is the way love is, sometimes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think of the big things.",
      "content": "Think of the big things. Then, see if the big things are combinations of little things, and can be broken down that way. Here are some examples of \"she is beautiful\" (other qualities may be broken down the same way). Her hair is soft and smells sweet. Her lips are full and sensuous. She has a full, womanly figure. (Which may be broken down even further.) She has lovely, iridescent blue eyes. Her smile can light up a room."

      "title": "When the special person is around, look thoughtfully at them, taking note of anything that gives you a warm, tender feeling.",
      "content": "When the special person is around, look thoughtfully at them, taking note of anything that gives you a warm, tender feeling. If you are making your list secretly, take mental notes to write down later."

    {
      "title": "Listen to what their friends say.",
      "content": "Listen to what their friends say. They may notice things or qualities that you really love, but are not even aware of."
    },
    {
      "title": "Give thought to the things the person doesn't do.",
      "content": "Give thought to the things the person doesn't do. You may appreciate the absence of criticism, complaining, or other negative qualities. These characteristics, being absent, do not lend themselves to obvious recognition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about what you feel when the person is absent.",
      "content": "Think about what you feel when the person is absent. This may clue you in to things about them you never think about, but miss when they are not present. This could be the scent of their hair or perfume, or the sound of their voice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Try to remember the practical points.",
      "content": "Try to remember the practical points. This may be adrift from the \"romantic\" ideas, but these are qualities you may value greatly, when you consider them. Things like cleanliness, punctuality, or moderation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write all the things you think of in your notepad, then reread them, to see if they lead you to more discoveries about the person.",
      "content": "Write all the things you think of in your notepad, then reread them, to see if they lead you to more discoveries about the person. Often, you may find you associate other things only when you remind yourself deliberately."

    {
      "title": "Make your finished list, read it carefully, then put it away for a while.",
      "content": "Make your finished list, read it carefully, then put it away for a while. You may even try to forget it, but later on, when you take it out, or even rediscover it, you may be surprised by how you take many things on the list for granted."
    },
    {
      "title": "Think about sharing your list with the person.",
      "content": "Think about sharing your list with the person. Will they see it as a shallow, superficial gesture? That may depend largely on the things you choose to list. On the other hand, they may be flattered and happy you have spent so much time thinking about them."
