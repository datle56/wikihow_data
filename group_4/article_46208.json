      "content": "Use a cosmetic mouthwash to mask bad breath. If your aim is simply to freshen up your breath, there are a variety of products you can choose from to cover the bad odor. These leave your mouth feeling pleasant and temporarily improve your breath. Cosmetic mouthwash is a good choice for rinsing after eating a particularly pungent meal, such as garlic spaghetti sauce. It serves the same function as an after-dinner mint, with fewer calories. [1] X Research source If you have chronic bad breath, cosmetic mouthwash won't address the source of the issue, nor will it help reduce plaque, gingivitis, or cavities. It masks bad smells, but it doesn't kill the bacteria that produce them. The point of cosmetic mouthwash is to make your mouth taste and smell good."

If you're looking for a mouthwash that cleans your mouth, choose one with therapeutic agents that will reduce harmful bacteria. Look for an over-the-counter mouthwash in the toothpaste aisle that is labeled as being antibacterial or antiseptic. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Dental Association World's largest dental professional organization and advocate for proper oral health Go to source Using an antibacterial mouthwash may help you tackle the root of bad breath, which is often caused by bacteria. This is because it kills bacteria and inhibits their reproduction. That said, some antibacterial agents, such as chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium, may discolor your teeth. You might also want to try an antiseptic mouthwash . This will stop the growth of bacteria as well as fungi, protozoa, and viruses. However, antiseptic mouthwash contains a lot of alcohol, which can dry out your mouth and cause irritation.
