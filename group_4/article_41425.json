To change the settings, simply press the “X” button on your PS4 controller, “A” button on Xbox, or the left click button on your mouse to set to your desired choice. You can choose from four different vehicle access options: No-one – Only you and no other player in the game can get inside your car. This is the best setting you can pick since you can be sure that no one gets in and drives your car. Friends – Only your GTA online friends can get inside your car. Crew + Friends – If you have joined a crew in GTA V, only you, the members of the crew you joined, and your online friends has access to your car. Everyone – Every player in the game can get inside your car and drive it. This is the least secure of the four settings if you’re trying to stop other people from stealing your car."
