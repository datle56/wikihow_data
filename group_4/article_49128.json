      "title": "Start with dry bath bombs.",
      "content": "Start with dry bath bombs. If they're homemade , let them dry for 24-48 hours. In very humid areas, they may take longer to dry. Bath bombs are very reactive to moisture and will fizz early or fall apart if they aren’t fully dry before you wrap and store them. [1] X Research source You can determine if they’re dry by feeling to see if they are dry to the touch on all sides. If you bought your bath bombs from a store, then they will already be dry."

      "title": "Place the bath bomb in a plastic baggy that has a seal.",
      "content": "Place the bath bomb in a plastic baggy that has a seal. It's best that each bath bomb be placed in its own bag. Otherwise, they will press against each other, causing pieces to break off. Simple sandwich bags will work. Just pick a size that’s big enough for your bath bombs. [2] X Research source If your bath bombs are small, you might try snack-sized baggies for a tighter fit, which provides more protection."

    {
      "title": "Squeeze the air out of the bag so that it’s tight around the bath bomb.",
      "content": "Squeeze the air out of the bag so that it’s tight around the bath bomb. You want to keep the bath bombs as dry as possible, so press the baggy down to push the air out. [3] X Research source You may want to seal it most of the way and then squeeze the air out through a tiny hole on 1 end."

      "title": "Seal the baggy to lock out air and moisture.",
      "content": "Seal the baggy to lock out air and moisture. Run your finger over the seal a few times to make sure it’s fully closed. If it isn’t, then your bath bomb may start to break down early."

    {
      "title": "Store your bath bomb in a cool, dry place.",
      "content": "Store your bath bomb in a cool, dry place. Inside a cabinet is the best place. If you can, place it somewhere outside the bathroom to help it keep longer. Shower steam can activate the fizz in a bath bomb, making it break down early. However, bath bombs can be stored in a bathroom cabinet if you seal them properly. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure your bath bombs are completely dry before wrapping them.",
      "content": "Make sure your bath bombs are completely dry before wrapping them. For homemade bath bombs , this usually takes at least 24 hours, but may take longer if you’re in a humid area. If you wrap the bath bombs while they’re still wet, they may fizz early or fall apart. [5] X Research source If live in a humid area, it may take up to 48 hours for your bath bomb to fully dry. If you bought your bath bombs from the store, they will already be dry."

    {
      "title": "Place the bath bomb onto a piece of plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Place the bath bomb onto a piece of plastic wrap. Use regular plastic wrap that’s typically used in kitchens. Place the plastic wrap down on the counter and then put the bath bomb onto the center. The bottom of the bath bomb will be facing up. [6] X Research source Alternatively, you can put the bath bomb on the counter and then drape the plastic wrap over it. In this case, the bottom of the bath bomb will be the side that's on the counter top. Some people find this to be easier. For professional results, try not to wrinkle your plastic wrap before you get it onto the bath bomb."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the plastic wrap tightly over the bath bomb.",
      "content": "Pull the plastic wrap tightly over the bath bomb. The plastic wrap should be wrapped as tightly around the bath bomb as you can get it so that the seal is airtight. You should have excess plastic wrap hanging from the bottom of the bath bomb. This is considered the base of your bath bomb. [7] X Research source The base of your bath bomb is where you will seal the plastic wrap."

    {
      "title": "Pinch the plastic wrap together at the base of the bath bomb.",
      "content": "Pinch the plastic wrap together at the base of the bath bomb. You shouldn’t have any slack in the plastic wrap. The bomb should be tightly covered. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Twist the tail of the plastic wrap several times to seal it.",
      "content": "Twist the tail of the plastic wrap several times to seal it. Make sure that the plastic doesn’t loosen around the bath bomb. Your twists should be pulling it tighter and locking out any air. Continue twisting until the top of the tail near the base is tight. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Cut off the tail of the plastic wrap.",
      "content": "Cut off the tail of the plastic wrap. Make your cut as close to the bath bomb as possible without cutting into the wrap itself. You will have just a tiny nub of the tail remaining. [10] X Research source If you’re worried about messing up, you can always trim the tail multiple times, working toward the base."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place a sticker or a piece of tape over the base.",
      "content": "Place a sticker or a piece of tape over the base. The sticker or tape will seal the bath bomb until you’re ready to use it. This will prevent the tail nub from unraveling. [11] X Research source Tape works great, but you may want to use a nice sticker for a more professional look."

      "content": "Store your bath bombs in a cool, dry place. Even in plastic wrap, bath bombs are sensitive to humidity. For best results, keep them in a cabinet where they are less likely to encounter moist air. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Begin with dry bath bombs.",
      "content": "Begin with dry bath bombs. If your bath bombs are homemade , they must be dry before you wrap them. Otherwise, the bath bombs may start to break down. It takes about 24 hours for a bath bomb to fully dry, though it could take as long as 48 hours if you live in a humid area.

      "content": "Seal the bag if you have a heat sealer. It's best to use a heat sealer if you want a sleek result. Press the two open ends together, and then seal them with your heat sealer. This will make it easier to shape the bag around your bath bomb. You can find both full-sized and mini heat sealers either at a craft store or online. If you don't have a heat sealer, you can still use shrink wrap bags. However, the bath bomb will not look as neat."

      "content": "Heat the bag with a hair dryer to shrink it. Hold the nozzle of the hair dryer about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the shrink wrap. Move the hair dryer as you heat the shrink wrap. Continue to heat the bag until it is shaped around the bath bomb. [15] X Research source This usually takes just a few minutes."

      "content": "Start with bath bombs already wrapped in plastic for best results. Otherwise, your gift may start to break down before the recipient gets a chance to use it! Since this bath bomb will likely be brought outside your home, it’s especially important that it’s wrapped in plastic.

      "content": "Cover it in tissue paper for an easy gift. Tissue paper is not only lovely, it’s also a traditional bath bomb wrapping. You can simply cover the bath bomb in a sheet of tissue paper. Once the bomb is completely wrapped, use a sticker to affix the end of the tissue paper to the bomb. [18] X Research source Choose a tissue paper color that corresponds with the bath bomb color or scent. For example, use red tissue paper for a peppermint-scented bath bomb. You can also place the bath bomb in the center of the tissue paper, and then pull the paper up around it. Tie a piece of ribbon just above the bath bomb to create a nice gift."

Fold the tulle up around the bath bomb. Tie a ribbon just above the bath bomb to secure the tulle. [19] X Research source Choose a color that goes well with the color of the bath bomb or that corresponds with the scent."

      "content": "Nestle your bombs in a treat box for a decadent package. You can find a treat box in the baked goods or candy making section of your local craft store or online. You may want to place a few sheets of tissue paper inside the box before adding the bath bomb(s). [20] X Research source If you package more than 1 bath bomb together, it’s a good idea to either separate them with tissue paper or wrap them in tissue paper before you put them in the treat box. This will prevent them from grinding against each other, which can make them break down. A treat box is a small cardboard gift box that is most often used to package cookies or chocolates."
