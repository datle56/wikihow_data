Locate the disk that is not in use (it will be unnamed and empty) and right-click on it. Select New Simple Volume . [2] X Research source Do not mess with the disk where Windows is installed. If you have Windows 11, it’s installed on the drive marked “Disk 0.” For Windows 10, the system is installed on the “Local Disk” partition (almost always the C: drive). What if I don’t see my SSD? Try expanding the disk management window. For some reason, Windows doesn’t automatically expand the Disk Management tool to display all available drives."

Complete the steps by entering the following information to format your new SSD: [3] X Research source Click Next to start. Keep the Simple Volume size identical to the Maximum Disk Space. For example, on a 10 GB drive, it will say something like “10,020” in the Maximum Disk Space line. You’d keep your simple volume at “10,020.” Assign a drive letter. It doesn’t matter what letter you use. Keep the file system as NTFS and the Allocation Unit Size at Default . Enter a name for the drive (you can call it whatever you’d like.” Keep Perform a quick format checked. Select Next and Finish and your drive will be ready to use."

If you don’t see the drive in the Disk Management menu, re-run the Simple Volume tool and give the drive a new letter. This may help your PC recognize the drive. [4] X Research source Sometimes, Windows is just buggy about reading new drives. Giving the drive a new letter can help it recognize the SSD."

Check the arrow next to “Disk Drives” and right-click on the SSD you aren’t seeing on your PC. If you see Enable Device as an option, select that and see if the drive reappears. If “Enable Device” is greyed out, select the option to uninstall the device and restart your PC. Windows will automatically reinstall the drivers for the SSD if you uninstall them and restart the PC. If the drive still doesn’t show up, confirm the drive actually exists in the BIOS."

Make sure the pins are aligned correctly on the SATA drive and that they’re inserted all the way. Then, check where the cable connects to the power supply to ensure it is correctly attached. [5] X Research source What if I have an M.2 NVME drive? If you installed your SSD on the motherboard, confirm that you slotted the drive into the motherboard slot at the proper angle. If you haven’t installed the heat shield yet, do that now. Most motherboards won’t read a drive if the heat shield isn’t in place."

If you can get the SSD to appear in the Disk Management tool on that second PC, it’s a sign that your PSU cable is bad. [6] X Research source Alternative solution: If you’ve got an old PSU that you know works for sure, just swap the PSU out on your new build and test the power. What if I don’t have a modular PSU? If you have a power supply unit with built-in cables, your PSU is probably bad. Get a new PSU, and the SSD should work just fine."

If you happen to have another SSD that you’ve used successfully in the past, try swapping out the drive that isn’t showing up with the drive that works. If that old SSD shows up in your PC just fine, you have a bum drive. Try returning your SSD. If you just bought the SSD, reach out to whoever you bought it from and explain the situation. Some SSDs are bad when they’re shipped, so they should replace it for free."

If you’ve confirmed the SSD and PSU are working just fine but the drive just isn’t showing up in the BIOS, your BIOS probably needs to be updated . Follow your motherboard’s instructions to update it. Typically, you’ll need to flash the BIOS using the buttons on the back of your motherboard. [7] X Research source It’s pretty common to need to update an old BIOS. Motherboards don’t always ship with the most recent copy pre-installed on them."
