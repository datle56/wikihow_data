    {
      "title": "Watch for friendly and consistent communication.",
      "content": "Watch for friendly and consistent communication. After a breakup, friendly communication means that your relationship is still positive. This means that there is a chance that they still hold a flame for you and want to remain involved in your life. Some signs of their possible interest are: Frequent “hello's” and “hi’s” even if you’ve already seen them once that day. These little greetings can mean that they still want to talk to you, but are too nervous and unsure to take further steps. Reaching out to check in via phone or text often. Commenting or liking your social media posts regularly. Sending you pictures of themselves having fun, looking attractive, or doing something you would enjoy."

    {
      "title": "Watch for inconsistent or disrespectful communication.",
      "content": "Watch for inconsistent or disrespectful communication. In comparison to communication that is positive, watch out for exes who stalk, manipulate, or frighten you. If your ex refuses to take no for an answer, then the feelings they have are not ones of love, but of obsession and control. Watch out and stay away from exes who don’t respect your space. Also, if you have an ex who only contacts you once every few months or only after they’ve ended a relationship, then they likely do not care for you and are only seeking attention."

      "title": "Notice body language.",
      "content": "Notice body language . An ex who wants to get back together will often try to be close to you when they do see you. They might hug you, kiss your check or display other types of physical affection to show that they care. If they are still very emotional about the breakup, they might also look down, avoid eye contact or even cry. Their feelings may show in their actions. They might laugh louder, smile a bit too much, or their voice might be higher pitched. These are signs, sometimes called micro-expressions, that they may still have feelings that they now can't control or are trying to hold back. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Assess the frequency of your “run-ins” or times you hang out.",
      "content": "Assess the frequency of your “run-ins” or times you hang out. If your ex tries to schedule get-togethers or makes an effort to frequent the places you frequent, they are trying to spend time with you. Maybe they’re trying to get your attention or perhaps they just enjoy and miss your presence. Run-ins may mean that they're looking for a chance to ask you about your feelings. Make particular note of the places you find them at that they never went to or enjoyed before you two dated."

    {
      "title": "Consider any gifts that have been given.",
      "content": "Consider any gifts that have been given.

    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to their social media.",
      "content": "Pay attention to their social media. If they post statuses about moving on, it may mean that they're trying to get over you, or convince themselves to do so. If they're posting more direct things like, \"missing my ex,\" this probably means that they really do miss you ! Perhaps they wanted you to read that post so you would know their true feelings. See if they have deleted all photos of the two of you. Getting rid of your shared memories is often a major indicator that they really do want to move on."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask your mutual friends.",
      "content": "Ask your mutual friends. Though you should not try to put your friends in the middle, you can ask them casually how your ex is doing lately, especially if you have not heard from them. They may tell you if your ex cares. However, if your friends don’t want to share, don’t force them. Say something like “I was at the library the other day and I remembered the time that Dave and I went. How is he doing lately?” If you are very close to them, then you can be blunt. Say “Do you think Dave still has feelings for me?”"

      "content": "Pay attention to signs of flirting. Your ex might be hinting at the fact that they still care very coyly or they might be very direct with you. Notice signs that your ex is flirting include touching you often, complimenting you, winking, or using pickup lines. If they display these actions and are communicating with you regularly and being kind to you, then they might still have feelings. [2] X Research source If your ex is not particularly flirtatious, this could be an even bigger sign that they still care."

      "title": "Notice if they bring up old memories.",
      "content": "Notice if they bring up old memories. Exes who are still interested in you or who have feelings will also have a tendency to reminisce. By doing so, they are trying to get you to remember the good times that you had together in hopes that you might want to reconnect. [4] X Research source Consider the times that they have brought up trips you went on, inside jokes that you shared, or just fun you had in general."

      "title": "See if they mention who they’re dating now.",
      "content": "See if they mention who they’re dating now. An ex that still cares for you might try to make you jealous to see if you care, too. If they regularly talk about their dates or share details about their new significant other, it can be a clear sign that they still have feelings. [5] X Research source Notice in particular the times that they bring up who they’re dating completely out of the blue. For instance, if you are talking about homework or your family and they randomly mention their new love interest, then they might be trying to make you jealous. Remember also how they treated their exes. If they often flirted with and kept open communication with their exes, then perhaps they are just possessive and not really intent on getting back together."

      "content": "Make note of how often they ask about your love life. An ex that still has feelings for you might also try to keep tabs on who you’re dating. If they regularly ask you things like “So, who are you seeing now?” or say “Did you see that movie with someone you’re dating?”, they might still care for you. [6] X Research source Make note also if they make jokes about who you date. They might be trying to tarnish that person’s image in your head so that you find them less desirable. If your ex is shooting dark looks at people who flirt with you or trying to steal you away from spending time with others, this is a sign of possessiveness. They don’t want you to move on without them."

      "title": "Be calm",
      "content": "Be calm , clear, and casual. Ask, “Do you have some time to talk? Can we go somewhere private?” This may be a scary step that many people don’t want to take, but the best way to know how someone else feels is to get a straight answer from their mouth. You can find them and talk to them in-person, then and there, but it is probably best to negotiate a future time and place to meet. If you are nervous, use a non-invasive form of communication like a phone call, chat, or text to communicate your feelings."
