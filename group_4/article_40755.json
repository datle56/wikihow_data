[1] X Research source You will need a level with a bubble vial in the middle. Put the level on the table or shelf where you want the record player to sit. Adjust the furniture until the bubble appears in the middle of the vial. Once you see the bubble stay in the middle of the bubble vial, the surface is level. If the table, shelf or other surface is not completely level, you will never get the machine to work properly. [2] X Research source You may need to put some wood shims underneath the furniture in order to get it level."

[4] X Research source After determining the correct speed for the record, make sure your record player is adjusted for this speed by clicking the speed selector button. Some 12 inch vinyl records play at 45 revolutions per minute. To adjust the speed on some manual players, you may have to take off the platter. Then, move the belt to the appropriate groove for either 33 1/3rd or 45 revolutions per minute. The appropriate groove should be indicated in your owner’s manual."
