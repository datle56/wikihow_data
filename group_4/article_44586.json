It typically occurs in areas of the body that retains moisture from sweat. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Jock itch gets its common name from athletes, who often sweat frequently in this area of the body. You do not have to be an athlete, however, in order to get it. Many studies have shown that overweight patients sometimes suffer from jock itch due to sweat near their groin as well.

      "content": "Clean the affected area. If you have a red, irritated rash, you might be tempted not to wash it, but you should clean it before applying any ointment. While taking a shower or bath, apply a gentle, hydrating cleanser to the area. Gently apply the cleanser to wet skin with your fingertips. Avoid using thick washcloths or a loofah as these can irritate the bumps on the rash. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use a thick, creamy cleanser on the area, such as a milky body wash or face wash. A gel-based cleanser might be too drying. If you are using a bar soap, you can also apply this directly to the skin. Choose a soap that is made for dry or sensitive skin to avoid irritating the area. Avoid cleansers with exfoliating agents in them, such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide (typically found in face washes for acne). These will only further irritate the layer of skin affected by the rash. Do not shave the area. This will only cause painful irritation and could transfer bacteria from your razor to the infected skin. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure you have thoroughly removed all of the soap from the affected area before leaving the shower."
