      "content": "The charging port could be clogged with lint or debris. Most phones, including the newer iPhones and Google Pixel, don't have a cover over the charging port, making the ports susceptible to gathering lint when you shove the phone into your pocket. This lint and debris can pile up until your charger no longer works, or sometimes the phone will only charge if the cable is in a very specific position. Add some rubbing alcohol to something like a Q-Tip and gently wipe away the lint or debris that you can see. You can use any other small non-metal tool, like a toothpick, to get rid of gunk. If you're cleaning a Lightning port on an iPhone (14 or older), you can clean side-to-side. If you're cleaning a USB-C port on a newer iPhone (15 and newer) or Android, there's a charging piece in the middle that you'll need to clean around."

This might be the case if you leave your phone plugged in and notice that it loses charge instead of gaining charge. Try a different charging cable."

      "content": "The charger's adapter may have stopped working. This is the brick between the power source and the charger cable; you may not even have one. If you have a USB-C to USB charger, you might plug it directly into a USB port from the power source. Try a different charging adapter. They are each rated for different charging levels, so make sure the one you're using provides the correct amount of voltage."

      "content": "Optimized Battery Charging is enabled. Since iOS 13, iPhones now use Optimized Battery Charging to maintain battery health by slowing down the charge to your phone. Your iPhone uses machine learning to figure out your daily usage habits and keeps your charge at 80% until you really need it. If you don't want this setting on, you can turn it off in Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging . If you have an iPhone 15 or later, you can adjust the charging limit so your iPhone stops charging at 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%. [1] X Research source To see your charge limit and make changes if needed, go to Settings > Battery > Charging and drag the slider to pick your charge limit."
