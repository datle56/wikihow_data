      "title": "Wash the bitten skin with soap and warm water.",
      "content": "Wash the bitten skin with soap and warm water. If you have a cluster of tiny itchy red spots rising up on your skin, you've likely been bitten by no-see-ums. Pat the area gently with soap and warm water. Don't rub or scrub—you could damage or irritate your skin further. [2] X Research source No-see-um bites tend to be smaller than mosquito bites, but they also itch a lot more—especially if you happen to be allergic. The soap cleans the area and reduces the risk of infection, as well as washing away any saliva that the insect might've left on your skin."
