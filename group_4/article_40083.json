For example, for the exponential expression 81 0.75 {\\displaystyle 81^{0.75}} , you need to convert 0.75 {\\displaystyle 0.75} to a fraction.

Since you will be taking a root corresponding to the denominator of the exponent’s fraction, you want the denominator to be as small as possible. Do this by simplifying the fraction. If your fraction is a mixed number (that is, if your exponent was a decimal greater than 1), rewrite it as an improper fraction. For example, the fraction 75 100 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {75}{100}}} reduces to 3 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} , So, 81 0.75 = 81 3 4 {\\displaystyle 81^{0.75}=81^{\\frac {3}{4}}}"
