You can buy the Sixaxis Controller app from the Play Store without rooting your phone, but your controller won't work when paired with the app unless your Android is rooted.

      "content": "Buy a USB adapter cable. Since the PS3 controller uses a USB 2.0 cable to plug into the PS3, you'll need a way to connect a USB 2.0 cable to your Android's micro USB port. You can do this by purchasing a USB 2.0 to micro USB cable. If your Android uses a USB-C charger port, you'll need a USB 2.0 to USB-C adapter cable."

      "content": "Make sure that you have an original PlayStation 3 controller. The Sixaxis app doesn't work reliably when used with third-party PlayStation 3 controllers, so you'll want to ensure that you're using a PlayStation 3 controller that came directly from Sony (e.g., as a part of a PlayStation 3 bundle). You'll also want your PS3 controller to have enough battery charge to be able to turn on without being plugged into a power source. You can buy PS3 controllers directly from Sony on platforms like Amazon and eBay, as well as in physical stores like Best Buy."
