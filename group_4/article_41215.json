      "content": "Love bombing is the use of affection as a form of manipulation. “Love bombing” is a strategy used to win a romantic target over by overwhelming them with a distracting amount of adoration, like a daily stream of gushing texts, early on in a relationship. While it might be nice to receive all that praise and attention, when someone is \"love bombed,\" they usually become emotionally dependent on a partner. \"Love bombing\" can also be used as a way to distract a significant other from abuse in toxic relationships. [1] X Research source The first steps in normal dating look different from love bombing that happens early on in a relationship. For example, in an everyday situation, you might get a nice text after dinner, while a love bomber may surprise you with a gold bracelet. Love bombing is a common tactic narcissists use because it helps them get their \"supply\" or people who obsess over them. A toxic person may put you through cycles of love bombing and \"devaluing,\" or degrading or ignoring you so you come to depend on their \"love\" and approval."

Share your romantic expectations and establish your boundaries . Be clear that you want a healthy dynamic and that you identify red flags in relationships instead of ignoring them. [3] X Research source Set a boundary in the early stages of a relationship with a comment like, “ I have a very busy schedule, and I’m not able to drop everything for a romantic partner. I can only hang out once a week .” Share what a sustainable partnership looks like to you. For example, say, “ I want to date someone who is reliable. All the bells and whistles of romance are less important than consistency .” Point out you’re aware of red flags associated with love bombing. You might make a remark like, “ If someone tells me that we should move in with each other after four months, I know that they’re trying to rush a commitment .” Reader Poll: We asked 264 wikiHow readers for their most effective way to protect themselves from love bombing, and 55% of them said, recognizing and setting healthy boundaries.

If you were mistreated in a past relationship, then your former partner might try to woo you with romantic texts and gestures. While it might be tempting to date them again, be aware that love bombing is usually just a narcissist's ploy to have control over you again. Go \"no contact,\" a strategy that involves stopping all communication with a narcissist so they can't play with your heart. [4] X Research source Respond to a narcissist's texts by being clear and firm. Let them know you want to move on with a message like, \" For the sake of my own healing, I no longer want to stay in touch. I wish you the best. \" Since your ex might try to make you feel vulnerable by saying something like you're both \"destined\" to be together, focus on practicing self-care and developing resilience so you aren't emotionally dependent on them."

Maybe they look great on social media and are well-spoken but they only seem to brag. If your current partner is a master at romantic gestures but doesn’t express a lot of empathy, that’s also a sign you may be with a narcissist. Consider severing ties since they may exploit you later. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources.

In order to determine the difference between love bombing and a harmless rush of excitement, gently tell this individual that it’s too soon for such an extravagant gesture. Watch how they react to your request to slow down to see if they’re safe to date. [6] X Research source For example, if it’s just your second date and they ask to take you on a cruise, say, “ This is very sweet, but I think it’s a little too soon for me .” If they try to convince you to take it, then they’re not respecting your boundaries. Be wary of gifts that an ex gives you, from small tokens to impressive mementos. Remind them to respect your space with a comment like, “ It’s really best if we continue to go without contact. Please respect my need to move on. ”"

[8] X Research source Consider what seems like a “plus” but is actually a red flag. For example, if your partner wants to stay in contact all the time, it may seem like clear communication.

Seek out a third party perspective from a person who’s close to you, like a friend or family member. Describe your relationship and see if anything raises their suspicions. Since your loved ones are protective of you, they may be very straightforward about subtle situations you might’ve missed.

Think about a more honest approach to dating—in this case, discuss your goals and passions, even if they're different.

It’ll take a lot of willpower, but it’ll also be an important way to show your significant other some empathy. If it’s too difficult to accept feedback from your partner, then it may not be a good time for you to be in a relationship. Try asking them something like, “ I really want to be a great partner. How can I be better? ” Be prepared to make some changes–no one is perfect, and making personal changes is healthy and normal. Be vulnerable and admit to some toxic habits. For example, say, “ Hey, I realize that I may have been blowing up your phone this week. I’m sorry about that, I just really enjoy talking to you–but I totally understand if you think it was too much .” If your partner is concerned that they're experiencing less independence in the relationship, discuss how you can respect their autonomy. They might want alone time or more opportunities to see their friends."

The latter is very easy to fix, especially if you commit to a steady pace. For now, just focus on building rapport and getting to know the person you're dating . Take heart in the fact that there’s plenty of time to buy your new romantic partner gifts, and if you maintain a healthy relationship, then you’ll have lots of opportunities to bond in the future. Remember that people feel love in different ways; just because you like to move quickly and intensely doesn’t mean everyone does. Simply appreciating that someone is in your life without having any expectations or giving them excessive praise is a great way to avoid \"clingy\" behavior. To handle the early stages of a relationship, instead of love bombing, just stay curious and ask the person you're dating questions to show you're engaged. Through communication, you can both show affection using different love languages and find a happy balance."
