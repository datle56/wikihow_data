      "title": "Create a new Instagram account with a fake identity.",
      "content": "Create a new Instagram account with a fake identity. The easiest way to view someone's stories anonymously is to hide behind a new account with a different identity. You can view public stories this way, and potentially even private ones, if you request to follow a private profile and are approved. Use a brand new email when you sign up for the account. If you use an email tied to other social media accounts, especially Facebook, your new account may get suggested to people you know. Go on a VPN or use mobile data when using this account, as Instagram might flag you for having multiple accounts if you're connected to the same Wi-Fi your main account frequently connects to."

      "title": "Use Airplane Mode to watch stories anonymously.",
      "content": "Use Airplane Mode to watch stories anonymously. This simple method doesn't require using any special apps or making a new account. The gist is that you'll turn on Airplane Mode right before you watch a story, which will keep Instagram from knowing you saw it since you won't be connected to their servers while watching. Open Instagram and go to the profile of the person you want to watch stories from. Wait for the stories to load at the top of their profile. Turn on Airplane Mode to temporarily disable your phone's network capabilities. This will disconnect you from both Wi-Fi and mobile data. If you don't know how to turn on Airplane Mode, you can do so from the Notification Panel on Android and the Control Center on iOS. Tap the story you want to view. Once you're done watching it, close the Instagram app entirely and turn Airplane Mode off."

If the story you want to view is on a public profile, you can watch it (and even download it) at https://www.storysaver.net . This is much safer than using a third-party app that asks for your login information, as that can lead to your account getting disabled by Instagram or your information being stolen from a shady app developer. Go to https://www.storysaver.net and enter the username of the Instagram account you want to view the stories of. Click the Download! button and complete a CAPTCHA (if required). After you click Download! , the current stories for the account you searched will appear. You can watch them here or download them by clicking Save as Video ."

      "content": "Perform a half-swipe to get a peek at a story. If you half-swipe on another user's story, you won't be able to watch the video or hear what's said. But you can get a peek at the story, which may work in some situations. Open Instagram and tap the previous story to the one you want to half-swipe. Note that this will show the user that you viewed their previous story. [1] X Research source Hold your finger on the screen and half-swipe right without lifting your finger. This will show you the thumbnail screen of the next video. Make sure not to swipe all the way or lift your finger, or the story could flip over to the next one. Swipe back to the left before lifting your finger and closing the story."

      "content": "View the stories of people who've added you to their Close Friends list. If someone has added you as a Close Friend, there will be a green star icon by their notes, reels, and stories. You also may see a green ring around their profile picture. [2] X Research source If you view a story of someone who's added you to a Close Friends list, it'll show that a \"Close Friend\" viewed their story but not show your username. This isn't completely anonymous, as the user will know that one of their Close Friends has watched their story, and you may be the only person on their Close Friends list. Use this method with caution if you're trying to truly view a story anonymously!"
