      "content": "Use a person's name. No matter where the letter is going, it's best to address it to a person, if possible. Figure out who would be the most appropriate person for the letter to find. If you can't find a person's name, consider using a department, such as the HR department. Do your research to find out who you should send it to. For example, if you are sending in a resume, look around online to figure out the appropriate person. If you can't find a person, it's acceptable to call the company and ask who the letter should be addressed to."

However, always pick a professional designation or title over MR, MS, MISS, or MRS. For example, if you're writing someone with a doctorate, you'd use \"DR\" before their name. [1] X Research source"

On the next line, place the individual or professional title of the person, such as \"CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT.\" On the next line, use the person's title within the company, such as \"HEAD ACCOUNTANT.\" If you can only find one, use that one.

The street number goes first, followed by a directional abbreviation (if applicable), such as \"NW\" or \"S.\" Next, place the street name, as well as any suffixes to the street name, such as \"ST.\" [5] X Research source You may also need to at a suite number, such as STE 118."

After that, use the 5-digit zip code, as well as the 4-digit extension with a hyphen in between. If you don't know the 4-digit extension, you can look it up using the other information you have on the USPS website. [6] X Research source"

Also, don't use periods after abbreviations such as \"ST\" or \"NW.\" [9] X Research source However, you can use hyphens if the street number calls for it. [10] X Research source You can also use a hyphen between the 5-digit zip code and the 4-digit extension."

You can also just print on a plain piece of paper, cut the label out, and glue it on, though that can end up being messier. Your word processing software should have templates for printing on both labels and envelopes. Pick the template that matches the labels you bought, then type out the address for both the sending address and return address. Alternatively, pick the template that matches your envelope, then type in the addresses and print it."

That way, you don't have to fold your letter to fit in the envelope. When the recipient gets it, it will look more professional. Keep in mind, though, that larger envelopes cost more to mail. Keeping it uncreased also allows the employer to make copies more easily."
