      "content": "Find a Gen Z person that you can talk with. Gen Z'ers often get their information from the internet, as Gen Z'ers were born in the tech age. As you talk with a Gen Z person, notice if they occasionally use colloquial language and slang that you haven't heard of. It's pretty easy to slip in some slang terms in informal conversation (especially if they talk like this with friends), so listen carefully for any words you haven't heard of. Note them down and ask them what they mean. Some Gen Z people (especially teens) may get indignant and impatient if you don't understand them. This is to be expected, as there is a knowledge and age gap between you two. If they don't answer you, search for the terms online. It's nothing to be embarrassed about!"

      "content": "Be aware of red flags in slang-filled conversations. There are some slang terms that mean inappropriate or risky things. Watch online conversations carefully if you are talking with your friends online. If you're a parent or guardian, it doesn't mean that you should invade your child's privacy and go onto your child's online conversations daily- it just means that you need to be aware of what your child is saying online. Some slang words can indicate something risky or offensive. Asl - could mean \"age, sex, location\". Body count - how many people someone has had sex with. Kys/kms - kill yourself/kill myself. This should be taken seriously, as it could indicate a threat to someone's safety. If your friend or child was just joking, talk with them about their behavior, and how they should completely avoid the subject of death or other offensive topics in jokes. LMIRL - let's meet in real life Netflix and chill could mean an innocent night with friends watching Netflix, but it could also mean inviting someone over to have sex [23] X Research source Mention of drugs (\"X\" and \"Molly\" could mean ecstasy, \"the plug\" could mean someone who supplies people with drugs, \"vape\" meaning to smoke an e-cigarette, \"shrooms\" or \"magic mushrooms\" being psychedelic drugs, etc.) Excessive cursing in in-person and online conversations Slurs of any kind"
