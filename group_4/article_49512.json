[6] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Be short and specific in this opening paragraph—save those details for later. Think of your first paragraph as a sales pitch. What can you say that’ll grab their attention immediately? Is there something you have that other candidates don’t that make you more qualified for the position? Show the employer that you’re familiar with the company and job application by noting keywords and characteristics valued by the company. For example: “I write to apply for the Office Manager position at Acme Investments, Inc. I am an excellent fit for this position, as demonstrated by my extensive background in management and proven success as a corporate administrator.”"

A hiring manager can read your resume or CV for the cliff notes of your experience; what they want now are the details. Show them the person behind the accomplishments by highlighting your passions and drive. [10] X Research source For instance, you could express how the company has impacted you personally and why that’s driven you to apply for the position. Although you want to provide details, keep it short. Stick to a 1 to 2-sentence description rather than a full-length story. Your letter should stay under 3 paragraphs. Here’s an example: “My passion for teaching began the summer of my sophomore year of high school when I was a camp counselor. I was given the opportunity to teach a class focusing on local plant life, and the campers’ enthusiasm cultivated my love for teaching and conservation."
