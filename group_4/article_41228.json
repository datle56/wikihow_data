      "content": "Practice deep breathing to help you produce a strong voice. Your breathing affects your speech, so deep breathing can help you stop mumbling and speak clearly. Do breathing exercises every day to help you strengthen your voice. Here are some deep breathing exercises you can try: Exhale all of the air from your lungs, then inhale deeply until your lungs are totally full. Do this 3 or 4 times a day to help you breathe better. Exhale until your lungs are empty, then take 5 quick gasps of air to fill your lungs. Gasping engages your diaphragm, so it will help you learn to breathe more deeply. Do big “ha ha ha” laughs to help you inhale and exhale deeply. Press your lips together and laugh through your nose to help you control your breath. Lie down, place a book over your abdomen, and relax. Then, breathe in deeply so that the book rises. When you exhale, the book should fall."

[11] X Research source In some cases, you might want them to tell you when they’re having trouble understanding you. You may even have them give you a non-verbal signal, like touching their ear or their lips. However, sometimes you might just want them to let you finish your thought or restate a word that tripped you up. Tell them, “Don’t pronounce words for me,” or “Don’t try to guess what I’m trying to say. I’ll repeat myself if I need to.”"
