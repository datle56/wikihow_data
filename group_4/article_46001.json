If you haven't already connected your DMX controller to your lighting fixtures and created the scenes you want to activate with sound, you'll want to do that first."

You can use a hardware sequencer or software on your computer, iPad, phone, or any other device using a USB to MIDI interface . If you're using a tablet, you'll likely need a USB adapter to be able to connect to the USB to MIDI interface, such as a Lightning to USB cable for an iPad. The sequencer must allow you to do MIDI out while recording audio so you can sync MIDI with the DMX fixtures. Most sequencers will have no problem with this."

If the audio you're playing is coming through your computer, phone, or tablet, using a software DMX controller should come naturally. You'll find free and paid DMX controller apps and/or VST plugins (if you're using a DAW like Ableton Live or FL Studio). Be sure to choose software that is intended to work with audio triggers. For example, if you want to trigger DMX lighting with MIDI from Ableton Live, you'll need a DMX software controller that supports MIDI like ENTTEC DMXIS. Before settling on software, make sure that software supports the lighting fixtures and other devices you want to control."

Check the DMX controller app you want to use to learn which type of dongle or interface you'll need. If you're using a tablet, look for a Wi-Fi DMX interface or an ethernet-to-DMX interface, which would require a Lightning-to-ethernet adapter. Some DMX controller software comes with an interface."

If you have multiple light fixtures, connect the cable to the first light in the daisy chain. If you only have one DMX device, plug a DMX terminator into its output to end the chain. While DMX cables look like XLR cables, they are different. Don't use an XLR/microphone cable for DMX devices, as they can't carry data."

The software will scan for compatible DMX device and you'll be able to address them as you want. Each fixture will need a starting address, which contains a bank of channels. Each channel reflects a different parameter, such as strobing or dimming, for that light. [6] X Research source To control each fixture independently, you'll need to assign each a different starting address that's not in the same group of channels for another fixture. Check the manual for your lights to find out how many channels it uses and what each channel does. Some software is simply drag-and-dropâ€”you'll select individual fixtures by manufacturer and drag them into your workspace to assign addresses."

Now that you have some lighting preferences configured, you can use the software to create a show based on certain parameters, such as BPM or by MIDI trigger points that you add yourself. Some software will automatically assign your scenes to specific points in the music without you having to record your own scene changes yourself. To customize the triggers yourself, create a new MIDI track in your audio software and record the lighting changes you make as the song plays. When you play the track live, it will also trigger the DMX lighting."
