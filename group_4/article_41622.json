      "content": "Select firm, dry shallots to store. Feel the shallots and choose ones that don't have soft spots. Look for any cuts that might cause the shallot to rot or dry out quickly. You want to store shallots that feel plump and don't have wrinkles. [1] X Research source Avoid storing shallots that are sprouting out of the top. Instead, use these quickly since their flavor will begin to turn bitter."

      "content": "Place shallots into a paper bag with holes that allow air to circulate. Take a brown lunch bag and fold it. Then, punch holes along each edge of the bag so the holes are around 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Put the shallots into the bag and fold the top closed. [2] X Research source Label your bag with the date, especially if you'll be storing more bags of shallots throughout the year. Don't fill the bag more than half-full or air won't be able to circulate between the shallots and they could mold."

      "title": "Put shallots into a mesh bag if you don't have a paper bag.",
      "content": "Put shallots into a mesh bag if you don't have a paper bag. Get out a mesh bag made of string and place as many shallots as you want to store into the bag. If your bag was woven, ensure that the gaps between the strings aren't too wide or your shallots may fall out. [3] X Research source If you don't have a string mesh bag, use a nylon hose or a metal mesh basket. These will hold the shallots together, but will allow air to move around the shallots."

      "title": "Choose a cool, dry storage space.",
      "content": "Choose a cool, dry storage space. Shallots will last longer when they're stored between 32 and 40 °F (0 and 4 °C). Since this is probably too cold for most people's kitchens or pantries, consider storing your shallots in a cellar or basement. Your space should be between 60-70% humidity to prevent the shallots from molding. [4] X Trustworthy Source Iowa State University Extension and Outreach Iowa State University's Extension and Outreach program dedicated to educating and engaging communities Go to source You can store the shallots outside as long as air is able to move between them. For example, put the shallots in a drying rack so they're in a single layer. You might find that a cupboard in the basement is cool and dry."

If the shallot smells rotten, you should also discard it."
