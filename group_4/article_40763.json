    {
      "title": "Get your readers' attention, give an overview, and list a thesis statement.",
      "content": "Get your readers' attention, give an overview, and list a thesis statement. Start the intro with an attention-grabbing first sentence to draw your readers in. Then, write a few sentences that summarize what your essay will cover. Finish the introduction paragraph with a short thesis statement that directly answers the prompt. [1] X Research source A great intro sentence could be something like, \"I never thought I'd have to raise my siblings,\" or, \"On April 7, 1997, my life completely changed.\" Your overview sentences could go on to say, \"My parents struggled to look after us, so I become the only constant in my brothers' lives. I had to grow up fast, but I also learned a lot about myself in the process.\" Your thesis statement might look like this, \"I realized that I have a lot to offer and I'm starting a career in social work. This scholarship will give me the financial support that I need to start my educational journey.\""

      "title": "Use a surprising or shocking fact about yourself to draw in the reader.",
      "content": "Use a surprising or shocking fact about yourself to draw in the reader. If there's something about you that's extremely unusual, you can sometimes use it to your advantage. Start your essay with a more conventional description of you, then transition into the unexpected to surprise your reader and make them want to know more. [2] X Research source For example, you might write: \"If you looked at my parents' mantle, overflowing with trophies and medals, you'd probably conclude that I was an athlete. But what you wouldn't know is that I was born with only one leg.\""

    {
      "title": "Show what you have in common with the person for whom the scholarship is named.",
      "content": "Show what you have in common with the person for whom the scholarship is named. Many scholarships are created in honor or in memory of another person. Read up on that person and find out what you have in common with them. Drawing parallels between their life and yours could give you a leg up for the scholarship. [3] X Research source For example, you might write: \"Mary Lewis dedicated her life to improving her community with public vegetable gardens. Last year, I worked with fellow disabled students to create a sustainable vegetable garden at our school that was accessible to others with disabilities.\""

      "title": "Ask your readers a question to stir their curiosity about the answer.",
      "content": "Ask your readers a question to stir their curiosity about the answer. Rhetorical questions can be tough to use in writing. But done correctly, a question can help you set the stage for the rest of your essay. Questions are most effective when the answer is something unexpected. [4] X Research source For example, you might write: \"For the past 4 years, I've volunteered with my local hospice. Why would a healthy, athletic young woman want to volunteer with people who are dying? Because I, too, have faced death. I know what it's like to be told you only have a few days to live.\""

      "title": "This option works well if you have a strong, compelling personal experience.",
      "content": "This option works well if you have a strong, compelling personal experience. If your essay hinges on a life-changing personal event, make it the centerpiece by taking your readers into the experience with you from the very beginning. Write in present tense and use short fragments to really put your reader into the middle of the experience. [5] X Research source For example, suppose you're writing an essay about rescuing an injured dog and how that made you decide to become a veterinarian. You might write: \"I could smell him before I saw him. Small and frail, he limped toward me. His fur was matted and he trembled. His large eyes were full of fear. He pleaded with me for help.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Use famous quotes only if you can quickly tie them to personal experience.",
      "content": "Use famous quotes only if you can quickly tie them to personal experience. Something someone else said, no matter how famous, isn't likely to say anything about you —and that's what your essay is about. At the same time, a short, punchy quote used well can pull your reader in and interest them in your story. [6] X Research source For example, you might write: \"Nevertheless, she persisted.\" I never really understood the meaning of that rallying cry until, at 14 years old, I stood in front of the principal of my school to speak on behalf of myself and other disabled students.\""

Make it so many, if not all, of these words appear in the first paragraph of your essay. This lets the reader know that you're paying attention to the prompt and addressing it directly. [8] X Research source Look into the background of the organization awarding the scholarship as well. Find out what the organization's core values are and how you can best communicate that you embody those values. The organization's website is a good place to start, but you might also search for any articles written about the organization.

      "title": "Share tangible, real-world examples that directly address the prompt.",
      "content": "Share tangible, real-world examples that directly address the prompt. Use the last part of your introduction to let your readers know what you're going to tell them in the rest of the essay. Explain clearly how the content connects directly to the prompt you were given. [10] X Research source For example, you might write: \"My compassion for and special connection to animals spurred me to pursue a career in veterinary medicine.\" Then, in your essay, you would provide an instance that demonstrated your compassion and another that demonstrated that special connection. Your roadmap doesn't necessarily have to be a \"spoiler.\" For example, if the prompt is to \"discuss a book or experience that made you want to be a writer,\" you might write: \"While I'd always loved reading, I never considered writing stories myself until my 7th grade English teacher gave me a book for an extra-credit report.\" In your essay, you would then go on to discuss the report and name the book.

      "title": "Your thesis statement tells your reader the purpose of your essay.",
      "content": "Your thesis statement tells your reader the purpose of your essay. Use your thesis statement to relate back to the prompt and tie the introduction into the rest of the essay. Look back to the prompt for clues on how to structure your thesis to answer it directly. [12] X Research source For example, if the prompt is to describe what sparked your interest in veterinary medicine, your thesis might be: \"My experience rehabilitating stray dogs sparked my interest in pursuing a career in veterinary medicine.\""

      "title": "Let the reader know who you are from the first line.",
      "content": "Let the reader know who you are from the first line. Make it clear from the first line that this essay connects your unique experiences, perspectives, and ambitions to the core values of the scholarship. [13] X Expert Source Jake Adams Academic Tutor & Test Prep Specialist Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Don't write in the style you imagine the readers expect—let your passion and personality shine through. [14] X Research source Focus on standing out, not writing like everyone else. Although you can look at samples of other winning scholarship essays to get ideas, make sure the words in your essay are your own. Your own perspective is key. For example, if you're a person of color, don't try to \"whitewash\" your essay. Scholarship committees like diversity, so if you try to cover up your identity, you're only hurting yourself."

      "title": "Use short sentences and action verbs to make your writing pop.",
      "content": "Use short sentences and action verbs to make your writing pop. Compelling writing carries your reader along. Maintain the active voice throughout your essay to show, rather than tell, your reader why you're the best choice for the scholarship. [15] X Research source For example, you might write: \"I strive to demonstrate my passion for the environment every day. In my sophomore year, I started the recycling program at my school. As president of the environmental club, I teach fellow students what they can do to help save the world we live in.\""
