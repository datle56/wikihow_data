For optimal results, this 4-week plan will include cardio, bodyweight exercises, free weight exercises, mobility (or stretching), and strength training. Aim to spend 30-60 minutes on each workout , increasing in intensity, volume, and length as the weeks progress. [1] X Research source Reps refer to the number of times an exercise is performed in one session, while sets refers to the number of sessions per muscle or muscle group. For example, curling a barbell 10 times over the course of 3 sets equals a total of 30 reps. Start with 30-minute workouts and incrementally increase time, intensity, and volume as you see fit. Begin with lighter weights while you master form. Then, select more challenging weights. There are lots of factors to consider when choosing the appropriate starting weight, including age and current body weight.

He says, “Setting an earlier alarm is really the best way to fit exercise into a busy weekly schedule.” He adds, “It doesn’t sound easy, but it really is when you give yourself enough time to adjust to the new sleeping pattern.” If you don’t have time to go to the gym and complete a full workout, Kanellopoulos recommends HIIT, or High Intensity Interval Training. Kanellopoulos notes, “You can get a full body workout using this training technique in a few minutes [consisting of] maximum effort in small bursts of exercise followed by short recovery breaks.” Regardless of the length of your workout, setting some time aside each day to pursue your fitness goals is instrumental in turning them into a habit and ultimately, a reality.
