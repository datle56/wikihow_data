      "content": "Identify the base, legs, and wheels. The lift should have 2 \"legs\" parallel to the floor, supported by 4 wheels. These need to be stable at all times, so make sure the wheels are tightly attached and do not use the Hoyer lift on uneven floors."

      "content": "Move the legs of the lift apart with the spreader handle. A vertical spreader handle (or shifter handle ) next to the main column of the lift can be pulled to move the legs further apart or bring them back together. The handle should lock into a slot to keep the legs from moving once they reach the proper position. Some models may have a foot pedal instead of a spreader handle. Always lock the legs to their widest position before lifting a patient, and as long as the patient remains in the lift. Failing to do so could cause the lift to fall over."

      "content": "Find out how to raise and lower the boom. There are 2 types of Hoyer lifts: manual (or hydraulic) and powered (or electric) . The only difference between these types of lifts is the method used to raise or lower the boom. Manual lifts have a pump handle which must be moved up and down repeatedly to raise the boom, whereas battery-powered lifts have simple \"Up\" and \"Down\" arrows to control the boom. [1] X Research source Find the small control valve at the base of a manual lift's pump handle. When the control valve is positioned toward the pump handle, the valve is closed. The valve must be in this position in order for the pump to work when elevating the boom. Keep pumping until the boom locks into place. [2] X Research source When the control valve is positioned away from the pump handle, the valve is open. Gently move the control valve from the closed to the open position to control the rate at which the boom lowers. Experiment with raising and lowering the boom before you put the patient in the lift. It’s important to thoroughly familiarize yourself with how the lift works before using it to move a patient."

      "title": "Look for an emergency release on electric lifts.",
      "content": "Look for an emergency release on electric lifts. In case of power failure, most electric patient lifts have an emergency release control, which mechanically lowers the patient. Know where this is located and how to operate it. Some models have an inset button which requires a pen to reach, but you should check your lift's manual for specifics. Manual lifts do not have an emergency release, since the lift is controlled by human power rather than a battery with a limited lifespan. There may be 2 or more emergency releases on your model. Know which is the primary release, and which should only be attempted if the first fails."

      "title": "Identify your type of sling.",
      "content": "Identify your type of sling. U-slings are the easiest and quickest to use, and are appropriate for users that can sit up, even slightly. Lifting with a full body sling, or hammock sling, takes more time but is required for users that cannot sit up on their own. U-slings are shaped roughly like the letter U, with 2 long extensions running parallel to each other. They are often padded for greater comfort. A full body or hammock sling is 1 large piece, sometimes with a commode hole. Use a sling that provides head and neck support for users who cannot support their own neck. Make sure the sling you use is appropriate to your model of lift. Contact the manufacturer to ask if necessary. Use the advice of a physician to select a sling that is the right size and type for each user, and make it their personal sling. Slings come in small, medium, and large sizes. Familiarize yourself with the dimensions of the different sizes so that you can pick the right one for your patient."

Familiarize yourself with these attachment points, using the owner's manual or an experienced user to guide you. If using a sling with hooks, attach them so the open side of the hook points away from the user, to prevent injury. Understand which side of the sling the patient should sit on, and which is the outside. Consult an expert or the manufacturer if unsure."

You should follow safe lifting practices to minimize risk of injury. All the tips that apply to lifting furniture or other heavy objects apply here as well. Use your legs to provide strength and stability. Place them apart and bend at the knees before lifting. Keep your back as straight as possible while lifting. Do not twist your body as you lift. Position yourself directly in front of where the patient is going so you do not need to rotate your torso halfway through lifting."

Follow these instructions several times using an empty Hoyer lift, then practice on a volunteer who has full mobility. Be familiar with each step before you try to perform a transfer on the intended user, especially alone. If possible, perform your transfers with an assistant who also knows how to operate the lift. Many hospitals require 2 people to operate the lift even if they are experienced operators, to reduce the chance of injury. Even when you’re using a Hoyer lift correctly, there’s a chance you could injure yourself or your patient if you try to do a lift by yourself. Get another person to help you if at all possible, even if you’re using the lift in a home rather than a hospital setting. Risks of doing a lift by yourself include the patient slipping out of the slings, the weight of the patient causing the lift to tilt, or injury to your back."

Never attempt to lift a user too heavy for the lift or sling. Always use the correct sling for the user's needs. Ask about a new user's mobility before lifting so you know how much they can contribute to the movement. For example, find out if they are able to sit up on their own or hold onto the sling. Use your best judgement when asked to lift a user who makes sudden involuntary movements, has a hostile attitude, or could otherwise cause injury to one or both of you. Refuse if necessary rather than endangering yourself and the user. Don’t try to lift someone who is arguing or physically resisting you."

You will need to move from one side of the bed to the other several times if you do not have an assistant, but make sure to raise and lock the guard rail each time before leaving a side. It's fine to temporarily lower the rail if it gives you better access to the user when assisting them into the sling. You will need to position the slings under the patient at the top and bottom before attaching them to the lift. Make sure the slings are correctly positioned and even on both sides before attaching them. Once the sling is attached to the Hoyer lift, raise and lock the guard rails again before lifting. The user may wish to hold onto the guard rails for stability as the lifting begins. Try a slight lift off the bed to make sure everything is positioned correctly before you move the Hoyer lift."
