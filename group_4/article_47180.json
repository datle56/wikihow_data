      "title": "Tell the person \"Good morning!\"",
      "content": "Tell the person \"Good morning!\" in a loud voice. This simple, direct technique is a classic for a reason. Your voice should be enough to wake up most people, and you let them know it's time to get up without actually saying as much. [1] X Research source If they respond to you with a muffled, \"ughhhhhh,\" keep at it. They're awake, but don't want to wake up. Remind them of what's going on that day and possibly tempt them with coffee or breakfast. You could also try gently touching their shoulder to help wake them."

    {
      "title": "Make your phone ring in the person's room.",
      "content": "Make your phone ring in the person's room. Turn the volume all the way up on your phone! Leave your phone in the person's room and then call it from another phone. If you leave it far enough away from the bed, they'll have to get up to figure out what the noise is. [2] X Research source You can also set an alarm to go off, instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn on the TV with the volume up.",
      "content": "Turn on the TV with the volume up. If there's a television in the room they're sleeping in, put the television on one of their favorite shows, and turn the volume up a little bit. You could also put it on an annoying cartoon instead. Whatever way, the light and noise coming from the television should wake them. Don't turn it up so far that even you are uncomfortable in the room. Just turn it up enough to make it difficult for the person to sleep."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the person's pet to your advantage.",
      "content": "Use the person's pet to your advantage. A dog or cat can be the perfect way to wake someone up. If your animal will naturally bark or climb on the person, just let them in the room, and let the animal do the rest. [3] X Research source Otherwise, use a treat or a toy to lure the pet into the room. You can even use it to lure the pet on top of the person!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull their covers off the person.",
      "content": "Pull their covers off the person. If they're still out like a light, try gently pulling the covers off of them. Grab the loose ends up near their head, making sure to grab all the sheets and blankets at once, and lift the covers off them and the bed, making them face the day!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Give the person a massage.",
      "content": "Give the person a massage. If you're looking for a nicer way to wake someone up, treat them to a massage! Gently rub their scalp, neck, or back with long, soothing strokes. Though massages are relaxing, your touch can actually wake a sleeping person."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the light shine in.",
      "content": "Let the light shine in. Throw open the curtains or blinds, as natural light works best! However, if there are no windows or it's still dark outside, just turn on the overhead light and any other lights in the room.

    {
      "title": "Use an appetizing smell to attract their attention.",
      "content": "Use an appetizing smell to attract their attention. Make sure the door is open, and then head down to the kitchen. Fry up some bacon or even bake some quick muffins. Coffee is also a great smell. Typically, the smell of good food will wake the person up enough to come out of their room. [5] X Research source If you don't have much time, use the microwave! Heat some bacon up or put a baked good in there to warm up. If the scent wafting through the house isn't enough, try bringing them breakfast in bed. Not only do you get them up, but they'll feel like you're doing them a favor, getting you in their good graces."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the alarm far away from the bed.",
      "content": "Set the alarm far away from the bed. If the person can just roll over and hit the snooze button, they'll stay in bed longer. If you set the alarm out of reach (even if it's a smartphone!), they'll have to get up to turn the alarm off, making them wake up more. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Adjust the temperature.",
      "content": "Adjust the temperature. If you can spare a bit of time, changing the temperature can wake a person up. Try turning the fan on high, for instance, or turning the AC or window unit much colder. Alternatively, try blasting heat from a space heater. The change in temperature can take a bit, but often, it will make them uncomfortable enough to wake up. [7] X Research source Using whole-house heating and air to change the temperature may make you a little uncomfortable! You can also open a window, if it's very warm or very cold outside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make a bit of noise in the room.",
      "content": "Make a bit of noise in the room. Walk into the room where the person is sleeping and make just a little bit of noise. Be careful not to be too loud, or you'll shock them awake, which can make the sleeping person wake up cranky. Simply making a little clunking noise by picking something up and setting it back down on a table may be enough. You could also open the door to \"check on them,\" and close it after you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make some noise in the rest of the house.",
      "content": "Make some noise in the rest of the house. Bang pots around in the kitchen or open and close doors loudly. Turn the television up in a close room. The ambient noises will likely wake the person up. Another option is run some water in the nearest bathroom or have a conversation outside of their door."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a loud noise that's obviously meant to wake them up.",
      "content": "Create a loud noise that's obviously meant to wake them up. Go in their room, and bang a metal or wooden spoon on the bottom of a pot or clap 2 objects together that make a loud noise, such as 2 pot lids. Just pick some loud noise that will wake them up. This technique works best if it's a surprise. If you have an instrument, such as a drum or trumpet, try playing it in their room. You could also try a whistle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Blast some tunes.",
      "content": "Blast some tunes. Another option is to put on one of their favorite songs that has a good beat. Blast it on some nearby speakers in their room or the next, and play it loud. They'll likely hop out of bed pretty quickly! [8] X Research source You can use headphones for this prank, but make sure the music isn't so loud that it damages their hearing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the person out of bed by their feet.",
      "content": "Pull the person out of bed by their feet. Of course, you don't want to hurt the person, and you don't need to pull them all the way out of bed. As soon as you start pulling, they're likely to wake up, especially if you just pulled the covers off. [9] X Research source It's best to grab them by the backs of their ankles or calves so you don't hurt their feet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pretend there's an earthquake.",
      "content": "Pretend there's an earthquake. Shake their mattress, and at the same time, say loudly, \"Wake up, there's an earthquake!\" By the time they realize there's no earthquake, they'll likely be fully awake. [10] X Research source You could also shake the bed frame a little instead of the mattress."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dump some cold water on the person.",
      "content": "Dump some cold water on the person. Nothing wakes a person up like a bit of cold water on the face. Shake some water in ice, and then pour the water into another glass. Slosh the water on their face and chest for the most immediate effect, but be ready for some anger! [11] X Research source Stand by with a towel to help put them back in a better mood!"

      "title": "Identify when a person is sleepwalking.",
      "content": "Identify when a person is sleepwalking. People who are sleepwalking tend to have a glazed expression. You likely won't be able to get their attention, and they may even be wandering around in the dark. If you find someone in this state, they're likely sleepwalking. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Redirect the person back to bed.",
      "content": "Redirect the person back to bed. The best course of action is to take them back to their bed. Gently guide them through the house, and make sure they climb back in bed. They will most likely go right back to sleep. [13] X Research source Use your hands to gently guide the person by turning them in the right direction."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wake the person up only if they're trying to do something dangerous.",
      "content": "Wake the person up only if they're trying to do something dangerous. Some sleepwalkers do things like cook, tear down doors, and even drive while sleepwalking. While it can be difficult to wake a sleepwalker, you may need to do so if they're doing an activity that could endanger them or others. [14] X Research source Because sleepwalkers tend to be very deeply asleep, it will be hard to wake them. Try saying their name loudly or gently shaking their shoulder. If that doesn't work, try a loud noise or spritz a bit of water in their face. Keep in mind, they will be very disoriented when you wake them up and will also likely be very cranky."
