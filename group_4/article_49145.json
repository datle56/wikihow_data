      "title": "Obtain cutlery and a square paper napkin.",
      "content": "Obtain cutlery and a square paper napkin. You can use any silverware or paper napkins you like. You can choose to use napkins that are all white, solid colored, or patterned. Just make sure they are square shaped and large enough to hold your silverware. Make sure your paper napkins are high quality and durable. You do not want them to rip while folding. Avoid cocktail napkins that are only 9 1 ⁄ 2 inches (24 cm) square. Use lunch or dinner napkins, which are typically 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) square, and large enough to hold standard size silverware. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the knife on the napkin diagonally. To begin, put your napkin flat on the table. Then, place your knife on the napkin so that it lies diagonally. The point of the knife should be just slightly past the corner point, about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm). Where you place your knife is very important, as this how far your cutlery will stick out of the napkin roll when you’re finished. Make sure the knife doesn't stick out too far, or your silverware may fall out of the napkin."

      "content": "Bring a side corner over the silverware and roll the silverware in the napkin.

      "content": "Get a square napkin with your choice of colors and patterns. If you want to create a decorative napkin pouch for your silverware, opt for a napkin style with a decorative pattern or picture instead of just plain white. This will give your table a fun and stylish look. There are many different patterns to choose from, especially during the holidays.
