[1] X Research source Candles can also represent a burnt offering to the Lord, a tradition as old as the Old Testament. “No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light” (Luke 11:33)."

      "content": "The color, scent, and image on the candle can all hold symbolic significance. It’s perfectly fine to just use a basic votive, which is a small white candle used by Catholics to pray and provide offerings. However, you may find it spiritually fulfilling to use a prayer candle with a saint, Jesus, or the Virgin Mary on it. Similarly, the scent and color may hold special symbolic significance. [2] X Research source Most prayer candles are unscented, although you may burn a frankincense or myrrh candle for Christmas, or an osmogenesia candle to honor a fallen saint. There’s nothing wrong with white prayer candles, but you might choose purple for Lent or Advent , gold for Easter, or red for feasts of martyrs. You can find a wide variety of Catholic prayer candles online. Your local parish or grocery store may sell candles as well."

A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house” (Matthew 5:14-15)"

Don’t leave the candle unattended. If you’re going to leave, extinguish the candle."
