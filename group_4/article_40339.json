      "content": "Hair represents self-assurance, spiritual growth, and new beginnings. [1] X Research source Since hair grows from your head, it is often considered to represent wisdom, thought, and power. Hair is something that changes a lot, also. If you’re cutting your hair or growing it out, you’re moving into a new stage in your life. Biblical interpretations from the story of Samson (who gets his power from not cutting his hair) and of Mary Magdalene (a disciple of Christ who washes his feet with her hair) suggest that there is a spiritual connection to hair. Since we get a fair amount of self-confidence in waking life from our hair—good hair day, anyone?—dreaming about long, luscious locks can indicate you’re feeling good about yourself and your image."

Keep your self-esteem high by treating yourself like a friend. What you tell others often doesn’t always reflect what you tell yourself, so by switching your perceptions, you’re more likely to be kind."
