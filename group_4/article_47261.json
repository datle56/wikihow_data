      "content": "Select the cycle setting based on the other clothes in your washer. Cotton-polyester clothing will hold up just fine in basically any wash cycle, so use the other clothing that you’re washing to determine your wash cycle. If you’re washing silk, linens, or other sensitive fabrics, use the delicate cycle setting. For thicker textiles, like denim, use the normal or standard setting. When in doubt, use the permanent press setting, which is usually a good middle ground for a variety of different fabrics. [8] X Research source If you’re only washing cotton, polyester, or cotton-polyester clothes, use the standard setting if they’re really dirty. If they aren’t particularly filthy, use the permanent press setting."

[10] X Research source Unless you have some bulky sheets or a thick cotton-polyester sweater, air drying should take 2-4 hours. You can use a drying rack instead of a hanger or clothesline if you prefer. Just be sure that your clothes aren’t touching one another while they dry or they may not dry properly."
