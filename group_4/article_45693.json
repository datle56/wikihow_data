      "title": "Pick out a deep conditioner or oil to use on your hair.",
      "content": "Pick out a deep conditioner or oil to use on your hair. Deep conditioners are great at restoring moisture to your hair and making them easier to untangle, while detangling conditioners are meant specifically to add more slip to your hair to prevent knotting. Coconut , olive , or Moroccan argan oil can help detangle natural or kinky hair while taming frizz. [1] X Research source Deep conditioning your hair may be ideal for dealing with intense matting in large sections. While some people use mayonnaise to detangle their hair, it can cause an unpleasant smell and be less effective than other conditioning options."

      "content": "Dampen your hair with water before applying your chosen product. Use a spray bottle to cast a fine mist over your hair, or briefly hold your hair under the shower or sink faucet. [2] X Research source Ensure that you’re hair is damp or slightly wet rather than soaking wet, as very wet hair is more susceptible to breakage."

      "title": "Rub your chosen product into your hair.",
      "content": "Rub your chosen product into your hair. Apply a handful of your chosen treatment thoroughly to all parts of your hair, including the ends. Rub it into each section of your hair separately (rather than across your entire scalp at once) to avoid tangling your hair further. Most hair-detangling products, such as conditioners and hair oils, come with instructions. Make sure to follow those to ensure you’re using the correct amount of product."

      "title": "Let the product sit on your hair for 20 minutes to 2 hours.",
      "content": "Let the product sit on your hair for 20 minutes to 2 hours. The type of treatment you use will determine how long it needs to stay in your hair. If you’re using ordinary conditioner, it’ll help smooth out tangles in a matter of minutes. [3] X Research source Coconut oil and other hair oils typically have to stay in between 30 minutes and 2 hours. Deep conditioners vary but typically need at least 20 minutes to work. [4] X Research source Always refer to the packaging of your chosen product or treatment for in-depth instructions on how long to leave the product in your hair. Keep your hair out of your face while waiting for a product to work by wearing a plastic shower cap ."

      "title": "Untangle the easiest knots with your fingers.",
      "content": "Untangle the easiest knots with your fingers. Once the hair treatment has had time to take effect, attempt to gently pull apart the tangled sections of your hair. Small knots or loose mats can sometimes be pulled into smaller, separate tangles from the root side of the knot, nearer to your scalp. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You can also use the small end of a rat-tail comb to help undo the knots. Don't expect to fully untangle your hair during this step. If you feel tension, stop and try a different tangled area."

      "title": "Use a wide-toothed comb to take out knots gently.",
      "content": "Use a wide-toothed comb to take out knots gently. A comb with sturdy, widely spaced teeth is essential for combing out severe tangles. Fine combs and brushes are likely to meet too much resistance, forcing you to either pull out clumps of hair or stop brushing. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Be sure to pick a comb that doesn't have teeth so wide that smaller tangles slip through."

      "title": "Comb",
      "content": "Comb the ends first. Place the comb a few inches (several centimeters) from the end of the tangled hair and brush downward. Repeat until the section of hair is free of tangles. Then, move the comb slightly higher up, brushing until the entire length of your hair is combed. [7] X Research source If you have a sensitive scalp, hold a section of your hair as you brush it. Comb the hair beneath your hand, moving your grip higher once the hair below is successfully untangled."

      "content": "Thin stubborn matted sections with scissors if needed. If a mat of hair refuses to come apart despite your efforts, you may need to thin it out. Hold your hair taut with your other hand. Use a pair of texturizing scissors over the mat, then gently tug at your hair to remove loose strands. [9] X Research source If it has been weeks or months since the last time you combed your hair, cutting mats out may be your best option, as you could potentially spend hours detangling with little results."
