      "content": "Put your dog in a hot, steamy room. Steam can help open your dog’s airways and lessen their cough. Run the shower on hot for a few minutes with the windows and doors closed. Then, after the room has steamed up, turn off the water and sit with your dog in the steamy atmosphere for 5 to 10 minutes. [2] X Research source Repeat this process throughout the day whenever your pup’s cough gets excessive. Never leave your dog unattended in the bathroom with hot water running, as they may injure themselves. Alternatively, set up a humidifier near your dog’s bed or resting place. This will moisten the air around them and make it easier for them to breathe."
