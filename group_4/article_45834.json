      "content": "Use Hoku/Hegu/Large Intestine 4. This pressure point is considered one of the most popular ones to induce labor. It is located on the hand between the thumb and the index finger. Pinch the webbing between your index finger and thumb. You will be focusing on the area towards the middle of your hand, between the first and second metacarpal bones. Apply steady, firm pressure to this point. Then, start rubbing a circle with your fingers. [1] X Research source When your hand gets tired, just shake it out and start again. When a contraction starts, stop rubbing the pressure point. Resume when the contraction passes. This pressure point is believed to aid in helping the uterus contract and the baby descend into the pelvic cavity. You can also use this during labor to help ease the sensation of contractions.

      "content": "Rub Ciliao/Bladder 32. This pressure point lies on the lower back, between the back dimples and the lumbar spine. It is used for inducing labor, easing pain during labor, and helping the baby descend. To locate this point, have the pregnant person kneel on the floor or a bed. Drag your fingers down alongside the spine until you feel two small bony hollows (one on either side of the spine). These hollows will be between the dimples and spine - but not the dimples themselves. [3] X Research source Press your knuckles or thumbs into the BL32 pressure point for constant, steady pressure or rub in a circular motion. If you cannot find the hollow, measure the length of the pregnant person's index finger. BL32 lies approximately the length of index finger above the top of the buttock crease, approximately one thumb width to the side of the spine."

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the concept of acupressure. Acupressure is a therapy developed over 5,000 years ago in Asia that is important in Chinese medicine. It uses specific finger placement and pressure along pivotal points on the body. Acupressure most commonly uses the fingers, especially the thumbs, to massage, rub, and stimulate the pressure points. However, elbows, knees, legs, and feet can also be used. [5] X Research source The points are thought to be arranged along channels, called meridians. According to Asian medical philosophy, stimulating these areas can release tension and increase blood flow. The popular massage technique of Shiatsu massage is a form of Asian Bodywork Therapy from Japan."

      "title": "Know what acupressure is used for.",
      "content": "Know what acupressure is used for. Like a massage, acupressure is thought to cause deep relaxation and a decrease in muscle tension. The technique is also used to relieve pain. People use acupressure to help with nausea and vomiting, headaches, back and neck pain, fatigue, mental and physical stress, and even addiction. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source It is believed that acupressure and other Asian body therapies correct imbalances and blockages of the flow of vital energies through our bodies. [7] X Research source Many Western spas and massage services have started offering acupressure massage. While many people are skeptical of acupressure's efficacy, many doctors, practitioners, and advocates of holistic health believe in the positive effects of acupressure. For example, researchers at the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine study the scientific basis of acupressure while providing explanations and practical applications of the techniques. Licensed acupressurists attend formal training programs, either at special acupressure and acupuncture schools, or through massage therapy programs. Look for an acupressurist who is an LAC (licensed acupressurist) and/or has an NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) license."
