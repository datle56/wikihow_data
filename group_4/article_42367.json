      "content": "Know what to expect from a beagle generally. Keep in mind that a beagle is a hunting dog. When you understand how a beagle's mind works you can then make sure you put everything in place to satisfy your puppy's needs (mental and physical) so they grow up into a well-adjusted, content, and fulfilled adult dog. [2] X Research source For example, a beagle's hunting instincts means they are hugely inquisitive and will have their nose into everything whether it's their business or not."

      "content": "Puppy proof your house. Before bringing your puppy home, you should always make sure your house is \"puppy proof.\" Pick up any garbage on the floor, personal items, food that is not for puppies or dogs, and other object that your puppy can swallow and/or choke on. Basically, it's essential to puppy proof the house because anything that isn't tidied away out of reach will be explored by the puppy's mouth and teeth."

      "title": "Introduce yourself to the puppy.",
      "content": "Introduce yourself to the puppy. If you can't bring the puppy home right away, visit it often so that it will become comfortable around you. Many breeders will allow this, as it is good to get the puppy acclimated to you. Clearly this depends greatly on where and who you are adopting the puppy from. If you are adopting a puppy from a pound, for example, you should take it home as soon as the animal shelter allows. If, on the other hand, you are adopting the puppy from a purpose breeder, you should pick up the puppy once the breeder recommends."

      "title": "Set up a vet.",
      "content": "Set up a vet. Find a vet near you with good reviews who treats household pets (as opposed to exotics or livestock) and call them to set up an appointment for its vaccinations and to be microchipped if the breeder or rescue did not do this already."

      "title": "Buy supplies.",
      "content": "Buy supplies. Before bringing home a puppy you will need to get a lot of supplies. Here is a list to get you started: Food and water bowls: Bowls should preferably be stainless steel or ceramic, as these can be put in a dishwasher and the surface is easy to keep hygienically clean. A dog bed: The bed should be soft and snuggly, to help puppy feel safe. Choose one with a washable cover and consider getting two beds, so you can have one in the wash and one for puppy. Puppy pads: These are disposable absorbable pads that are useful for the inevitable toilet training accidents. Disinfectant and household gloves: These can be used for cleaning up after accidents. Choose an enzymatic cleaner and avoid those containing bleach or ammonia as this can amplify the scent of urine and inadvertently attract puppy back to that spot [3] X Expert Source David Levin Professional Dog Walker & Trainer Expert Interview. 19 December 2019. A crate: Choose a crate that allows the beagle to stand up and lie with its legs outstretched. If the adult-sized crate is too big, devise a barrier to partition the crate to make it the correct size for the puppy. Make sure the crate will be big enough for the beagle to grow into as an adult. [4] X Expert Source David Levin Professional Dog Walker & Trainer Expert Interview. 19 December 2019. A collar and tag. Get a nylon collar and metal tag. If possible, get the tag engraved with the dog's name and your phone number(s) in case the dog gets lost. Start using a collar at 6 months of age at the latest. Remember when sizing the collar that puppies will grow, but don't be afraid to get new collars over time. Buy a flat-buckle collar to wear all the time. Many other types of collar are unsafe for a puppy to wear all the time. Harness and leash: It is great to get your puppy used to these from the start. They also help control the dog in the yard, so it doesn't run off when you are trying to toilet train it. Toys: Beagle puppies are avid chewers, so make sure all toys are certified as safe. Check toys regularly to see if they are damaged and discard if necessary. Remember stuffing, a toy's eye or nose, or even the squeaker inside could potentially cause a bowel obstruction if swallowed, so make sure to monitor your pup around toys with these things. Stuffed toys for your dog should never have plastic components (except a squeaker). Puppy treats: Make sure you get some soft and some crunchy treats. Different dogs and people like using different types of treats while grooming, training, or walking. Puppy food: Make sure you get the food it has already been eating if at all possible. Ask the breeder or shelter the exact food. If they give you a bag of food with your puppy, use that brand. Dental chews: These are specialized to clean dog's teeth without brushing. They come in enticing flavors for a dog. Monitor your dog when you give them dental chews until they finish them. Do not try to take away dental chews unless you have to. Basic grooming tools: Get a bristle brush, comb, rubber gloves, nail clippers, dog shampoo, dog conditioner, dog toothpaste, toothbrush, and towels. Watch videos online or talk to a friend who owns a dog to learn to properly use each tool."

      "content": "Ask the breeder for 4 - 5 days worth of the food the puppy has been eating. This is so it can eat something familiar that its system is used to digesting. Make a gradual change over to the food you select, once the puppy has had one or two days to get used to its new home. [10] X Research source The Happy Puppy Handbook. Pippa Mattinson. Ebury Press To make this change add in a little of the new food (say ¼) and cut down on its previous diet (to ¾). Over 2 - 3 days further increase the amount of new food as you wean the puppy off the original diet. This gives the bugs in its tummy a chance to change over so that it doesn't get diarrhea because of a sudden change of food."

Examine the label on the food packaging and check that a named meat, such as chicken, beef, or lamb, heads the list. This means the main ingredient is that named meat and is an indication of quality. Avoid foods which list cereals as the main ingredient. Once puppy is a year old switch it onto adult food. Do not change your puppy's food without consulting a vet if she's showing signs of stomach problems such as diarrhea, vomiting, loose stools, bloody stools, not eating, or general discomfort.

      "content": "Don't give the puppy lots of extra treats or food. Remember that beagles are exceptionally greedy. The beagle has no concept of when it is full, so don't give into that appealing expression and give it extra food. Only use one treat when rewarding your beagle because one treat is equal to a handful for them. Obesity in dogs can decrease their lifespan by 1-2 years. Make a plan with your vet if your beagle starts to gain weight. Make sure all food is kept out of reach and in a sealed container, because your puppy will relish the challenge of finding a way to break into a food bin.

A good rule of thumb is never to exercise your puppy past the point where it drags itself along, or when you can see drool on it tongue. If its muscles are tired, the puppy will stop supporting the joints. This is when it is most likely to injure its joints. If the puppy still has a spring in its step then you are OK.

[14] X Research source If your puppy truly can't escape be aware that frustration may cause the pup to bay or howl. Your best bet to prevent this is plenty of exercise and mental stimulation so that it is contentedly tired and doesn't feel bored or frustrated."

Feed the puppy in the crate, especially if you have other dogs who might steal the beagle's food. At first feed with the door open. Once the pup goes in of its own accord, shut the door for a few seconds, open the door, and then praise the pup afterwards for being so good.
