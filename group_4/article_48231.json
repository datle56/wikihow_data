      "content": "A homie hopper hooks up with multiple people within the same social group. While “homie hopping” is a gender-neutral term, often, the phrase demeans or shames women for their intimate relationships. It characterizes people as disloyal or even disrespectful to their friends for “hopping” around. [1] X Research source The term was popularized in pop culture and used in alternative and R&B music. [2] X Research source People may also call someone a homie hopper in non-sexual relationships. For instance, a person hops from one social group to another to fulfill their own social agendas, like becoming popular."

      "content": "Displays affection towards multiple people An early sign of a homie hopper is someone who expresses seemingly innocent affection towards others, like long hugs, holding hands, or finding any excuse to touch the other person. Affection doesn’t always mean someone is a homie hopper. It’s about the person’s intent. Pay attention to body language, compliments, and invitations to hang out one-on-one that can signal when someone likes you."

      "content": "Flirts with friends in the same group Take note of how a homie hopper interacts with other friends in the group. Are they all smiles and giggles when their new crush is around? Do they find ways to “accidentally” touch or bump into them? These are just a few signs of flirtation. If a homie hopper tries to be low-key, they may not attempt to flirt in person. They may drop heart-eyed emojis on a friend’s Instagram post or always smile down at their phone."

      "title": "Jumps from one person to another after a breakup",
      "content": "Jumps from one person to another after a breakup A common conception of homie hoppers is that they waste no time moving on to the next friend in the group. In some cases, they start flirting or making sexual advances or suggestions while they’re already in a relationship. [3] X Research source It’s important to note that the homie hopper isn’t the only person to “blame” in this situation. A friend who accepts these advances behind someone else's back isn’t a good friend."

      "content": "Several friends have hooked up with the same person Imagine you’re at a party talking to friends about someone you hooked up with. Suddenly, multiple people in your group say they did, too. This knowledge may rustle some feathers, especially if there was ill intent."

      "title": "Be honest with your friends.",
      "content": "Be honest with your friends. When you’re in the same social group as others, it’s possible to build genuine connections because there’s a sense of comfort and familiarity. [4] X Research source However, it’s important to be mindful of other existing and past relationships when this happens. Let the people in your social group know you’re interested in dating one of your friends. If you have an ex-partner in the same group, consider having a private conversation with them. You could say, “Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I’ve been talking to John for the last few months, and things are getting serious. I wanted you to hear it from me.” Letting your ex know allows them to ask questions, so there’s no room for drama or miscommunication."

      "title": "Allow time to pass between relationships.",
      "content": "Allow time to pass between relationships. There is no concrete amount of time to wait to date after a breakup, but generally, aim for at least one month—or three if it was a serious relationship. [5] X Research source It’s not a good look to start dating again, especially if it’s a friend of your ex. Give yourself and your ex time to separate your romantic feelings before becoming friends again. When you hop from one relationship to another, others may perceive that you are going behind your ex’s back, which could jeopardize your relationship and the friend group."

      "title": "Respect people’s boundaries.",
      "content": "Respect people’s boundaries. In friend groups, feeling safe and comfortable around someone may cause you to fantasize about something more. That’s totally normal! However, for some, friends are just friends. If someone in your social group isn’t interested in hooking up or being friends with benefits, don’t pressure them. If you’re making a move on a friend, look for non-verbal cues if they’re uncomfortable. Their body language, facial expression, or movement, like inching away from you, is a sign they’re not receptive to your advances. [6] X Research source When in doubt, don’t be afraid to ask what their boundaries are. If you’re naturally affectionate, you can ask, “Is it okay if I touch you?” Be empathetic and receptive to how they respond. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Be mindful of current and past relationships. If you’re interested in a friend who is already in a relationship, be careful not to overstep your boundaries by flirting or touching them. Instead, “friend zone” yourself by reminding yourself why you can’t be with that person. [8] X Research source Just like you wouldn’t want someone trying to steal your partner from you, don’t do the same to someone else. If your feelings are genuine and your crush is in a healthy relationship, limit your interactions in person and on social media. Use your free time to distract yourself with other people and activities. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Being a homie hopper can damage friendships.",
      "content": "Being a homie hopper can damage friendships. Dating within a small pool creates an unintended shift in the friendship dynamic. It can lead to potential confrontation, jealousy, and gossip. [10] X Research source This is especially relevant in cases where a previous relationship ended poorly or resulted in cheating. It can make others in the group feel like they need to pick sides."

      "title": "Being a homie hopper may stem from unresolved issues.",
      "content": "Being a homie hopper may stem from unresolved issues. In some cases, homie hoppers crave validation and connection. [11] X Research source It’s easier to date within the same social group rather than having to put yourself out there to meet new people. There’s less stress about impressing another person when a friend already knows your personality, likes, and dislikes. If crushing on a friend is the result of craving physical intimacy or feeling lonely, it may be better to take the extra step to date new people. [12] X Research source Self-reflection is critical in these moments, as meditation or journaling can help identify a person’s motives. Is there a genuine connection in this relationship? Or is there a hidden agenda, such as getting back at an ex? Seek advice from a licensed therapist or a relationship counselor to address underlying causes or the complexities of dating within the same friend group. [13] X Research source"
