    {
      "title": "Get your bird examined by an avian vet.",
      "content": "Get your bird examined by an avian vet. The condition can be caused by a lot of different things, such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa, and injury. Your vet will examine your bird, including lifting the eyelid. They may also test the discharge from the area to look for a bacterial or fungal infection. Your vet will also determine if your bird has an upper respiratory infection, since they can cause conjunctivitis. [2] X Research source There are a few other conditions that are similar to conjunctivitis, which is another reason why it’s so important to get your bird tested before treatment."

    {
      "title": "Give your bird prescription medication.",
      "content": "Give your bird prescription medication. Your vet may prescribe topical medication, such as ointment or drops, to give to your cockatiel. The vet may also prescribe oral medications, antibiotic ointments, or sprays for the bird. For fungal infections, the vet will prescribe topical antifungals. [3] X Research source These medications are often only available by prescription, so you will need to obtain them from your vet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply carbamate powder.",
      "content": "Apply carbamate powder. If your bird has conjunctivitis due to nematodes, the small flukes will irritate the bird’s eye. To get rid of the flukes, you can apply topical carbamate powder to the eye. You can get this powder from the vet or a bird supply store."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe the eye with water.",
      "content": "Wipe the eye with water. Since the cockatiel’s eyes are crusty, you should help clean them. Dip a soft cloth in warm water. Gently wipe and dab at the bird’s eye to remove the buildup around the membrane. [4] X Research source Be very careful to avoid touching your bird's eyeball."
    },
    {
      "title": "Clean any debris.",
      "content": "Clean any debris. Your bird may get conjunctivitis if debris gets into their eye. This can cause irritation and swelling. Look at your bird’s eye and see if there is any debris inside. If there is, use a warm damp cloth to gently remove it. [5] X Research source Common debris that can get in a bird’s eye include dust or cracker crumbs."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use eyedrops.",
      "content": "Use eyedrops. You can help your cockatiel’s irritated eye by dropping sterile eye drops into the eye. This helps keep the eye lubricated and reduces discomfort. You can use this if the conjunctivitis is caused by debris, or if you have to wait to take the bird to the vet. Be careful to only use sterile water eye drops, unless your vet provides you with a prescription eye drop."

    {
      "title": "Notice any swelling of the eye membranes.",
      "content": "Notice any swelling of the eye membranes. The conjunctiva is the light pink membrane that surrounds the whites of your bird’s eyes. When they have conjunctivitis, this membrane gets inflamed. Look for red or irritated areas around the bird’s eyes. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for crusting around the eyes.",
      "content": "Look for crusting around the eyes. Birds that have conjunctivitis may also produce a clear or cloudy discharge from their eye. This causes a crusty, thick build up around the area. It may crush along the swollen membrane, or get inside the bird’s eyes. [7] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for eyelid irregularities.",
      "content": "Check for eyelid irregularities. Another symptom that may occur with conjunctivitis is problems with the eyelid. The lower eyelid may droop or hang down slightly. The bird may also have a prolapsed third eyelid, where you can see the reddish membrane. A bird's third eyelid is a nearly clear membrane that allows the bird to clear dirt and debris from its eye while still maintaining nearly clear vision."

    {
      "title": "Monitor for excessive preening.",
      "content": "Monitor for excessive preening. Birds with conjunctivitis may start to preen more than they used to. You may notice that the feathers around the eyes are wet, or that the feathers on the wing or leg are wet and matted due to increased rubbing. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Watch for rubbing of the eye.",
      "content": "Watch for rubbing of the eye. Some birds may rub the eye repeatedly against their cage or try to scratch the eye with their foot or wing. They may even rub the infected eye with the ball of the foot. [9] X Research source"
