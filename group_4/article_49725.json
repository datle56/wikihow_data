This research can help you determine if your survey results support current beliefs on the topic or disagree with them. Write 2 or more pages explaining the issue and how other researchers have approached it. [1] X Research source Look for surveys done by researchers in peer-viewed academic journals. In addition to these, consult reports produced by similar companies, organizations, newspapers, or think tanks. Compare their results to yours. Do your results support or conflict with their claims? What new information does your report provide on the matter? Provide a description of the issue backed with peer-reviewed evidence. Define what it is you're trying to learn and explain why other studies haven't found this information."

It comes after the background and objectives section. Depending on the complexity of your study, this section may be several pages long. Some things you should cover in this section include: Who did you ask? How can you define the gender, age, and other characteristics of these groups? Did you do the survey over email, telephone, website, or 1-on-1 interviews? Were participants randomly chosen or selected for a certain reason? How large was the sample size? In other words, how many people answered the results of the survey? Were participants offered anything in exchange for filling out the survey?"

Describe the general theme of the questions here, providing a few examples of questions. For example, you might sum up the general theme of your questions by saying, \"Participants were asked to answer questions about their daily routine and dietary practices.\" Don't put all of the questions in this section.

This section is usually several pages long. If needed, break up some of your results into bullets to make them easier to read. If your survey interviewed people, choose a few relevant responses and type them up in this section. Refer the reader to the full questionnaire, which will be in the appendix. If your survey was broken up into multiple sections, report the results of each section separately, with a subheading for each section. Avoid making any claims about the results in this section. Just report the data, using statistics, sample answers, and quantitative data. Include graphs, charts, and other visual representations of your data in this section."

Appendices are typically labeled with letters, such as Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C, and so on. You may refer to appendices throughout your paper.

In some classes and professional fields, you may be asked to format the report according to a specific style guideline. Common ones used for survey reports include American Psychological Association (APA) and Chicago styles. Typically, you will cite information using in-text parenthetical citations. Put the name of the author and other information, such as the page number or year of publication, in parentheses at the end of a sentence. Some professional organizations may have their own separate guidelines. Consult these for more information. If you don’t need a specific style, make sure that the formatting for the paper is consistent throughout. Use the same spacing, font, font size, and citations throughout the paper."

Try not to cast judgment on the participants or the survey results. If you would like to make recommendations, only do so in the last section of the paper. Try not to editorialize the results as you report them. For example, don’t say, “The study shows an alarming trend of increasing drug use that must be stopped.” Instead, just say, “The results show an increase in drug use.”"

      "title": "Write in concise, simple sentences.",
      "content": "Write in concise, simple sentences. State the information in the simplest way possible. Avoid flowery or complicated language. Since some surveys can be very complex, a simple writing style will help your readers understand your results. If you have a choice between a simple word and a complex word, choose the simpler term. For example, instead of “1 out of 10 civilians testify to imbibing alcoholic drinks thrice daily,” just say “1 out of 10 people report drinking alcohol 3 times a day.” Remove any unnecessary phrases or words. For example, instead of “In order to determine the frequency of the adoption of dogs,” just say “To determine the frequency of dog adoption.”"

Before submitting the report to your boss or professor, check that the formatting is correct. Make sure you have page numbers on the bottom of the page. Check that the table of contents contains the right page numbers. Remember, spell check on word processors doesn’t always catch every mistake. Ask someone else to proofread for you to help you catch errors."
