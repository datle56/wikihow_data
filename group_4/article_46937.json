Many email services are free and good ones include GMail and Outlook.com. When you go to check your email, you will go to the website for the service you signed up with and only the service you signed up with in order to read your mail. Email addresses don't look like street addresses. They are in a format like yourname@website.com. For example, the email to reach us here at wikiHow is wiki@wikihow.com. If your name is John Doe and you sign up with Gmail, your address could look like JohnDoe@gmail.com, JDoe@gmail.com, JohnD@gmail.com, or even something totally different like WarVet63@gmail.com."
