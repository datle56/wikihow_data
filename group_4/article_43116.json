      "title": "It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours.",
      "content": "It can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours. For some people, the body can break down and process edibles in 30 minutes to 2 hours. [1] X Research source For others, tangible symptoms of a high won’t pop up for around 4 hours after the fact. [2] X Research source Since edibles are processed and metabolized via your digestive system, the onset time really depends on the individual. [3] X Research source Inhaling weed (like through a joint, vape, vaporizer, etc.) causes the THC (the compound in cannabis that makes you high) to go directly to your brain, which allows you to feel high right away. Consuming weed, on the other hand, causes the THC to go through the digestive tract, so it takes longer to experience the effects. [4] X Research source To get a better idea of how and when edibles impact you, start a stopwatch (either on your phone or a free website ) and time how long it takes for you to feel symptoms. Keep this time in mind whenever you take edibles in the future. Many factors influence how long an edible takes to kick in, like your sex, metabolism, weight, and how recently you've eaten. [5] X Research source Your high may kick in more intensely if you take an edible on an empty stomach. Some people find that fattier edibles (like a cookie or brownie) hit a little harder than other edibles, due to the way the cannabis is processed in the body. Others report that dissolvable edibles (like lollipops) tend to hit more quickly than gummies and baked goods."

You guessed it—there isn’t a concrete estimate for how long an edible high can last, since it depends on the individual body processing it. With that being said, don’t be alarmed if your high peaks after 4 hours, or if you’re still feeling the effects after 12 (or if some leftover symptoms even last a full day). [20] X Research source The core symptoms should be gone after around 12 hours, but you might not feel 100% for up to a day after the fact.

Make sure you know how much weed is in your edibles, and what the total THC percentage is—this gives you a better idea of how strong the edibles are and how long you can expect them to kick in. Double-check the serving size, too, before enjoying multiple edibles at once. If you’re making homemade weed edibles, calculate the dosage manually .
