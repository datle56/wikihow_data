      "content": "Maintain a consistent bathroom schedule. A consistent bathroom schedule is a key component of proper house training . It will teach your dog to urinate outside at certain times, such as after waking up, after a meal, and about 20 minutes before going to bed. This is especially important for puppies, since they have weak bladder muscles and are still learning where they should urinate.

      "content": "Designate a specific outdoor bathroom area. Having a specific outdoor bathroom spot will teach your dog to urinate outside, not inside. If you have a backyard, put your dog on a leash and take it to an area of the yard that’s protected from weather elements (rain, wind). Allow your dog to pick the exact bathroom spot within this area. [3] X Trustworthy Source The Humane Society of the United States National organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare Go to source Give your dog praise when it urinates in this area, or just shows interest in it. This will not be as important if your dog already has a specific bathroom spot, or you do not have a backyard."

Your dog may need some time before its bladder muscles relax enough for urination. Also, if you have a puppy, it may need a few minutes to get focused on going to the bathroom.

      "content": "Do not go inside immediately after your dog finishes urinating. If you’re in a rush, you may want to go back inside as soon as your dog finishes urinating. However, to your dog, this can signal the end of ‘fun time’ outside. It may not fully urinate to prolong the fun time, then urinate once it’s back inside. Rather than going right back inside, have extra outdoor playtime or continue the walk even after your dog’s finished urinating. If the weather is bad, don’t feel obligated to spend extra time outside. Your dog will probably want to go back inside as much as you do."

If you continue to see urine puddles in your home, do not punish your dog by rubbing its face in the urine. Not only is that form of discipline ineffective, but it will make your dog fearful of you. Your dog may think the problem is urinating in front of you, not urinating inside. Therefore, it may find secret places to urinate. [10] X Research source"

If you try to discipline after the fact, your dog will not know what it’s being punished for. If you’re lucky enough to catch your dog in the act, firmly say ‘No!’ to your dog and immediately take it back outside. Praise your dog when it finishes urinating outside.

To completely remove the urine scent, use a pet-specific enzymatic cleaner that will break down the ammonia in the urine. Standard household cleaners will not get rid of the urine scent.
