      "content": "Pubic lice are small parasites commonly seen in the genital region. Pubic lice come in three forms: nits, nymphs, and adults. Nits are lice eggs, which look like tiny white or yellow ovals, while nymphs are immature lice that look like smaller versions of adult lice. Adult lice are tan or greyish-white and have six legs—if you view them under a microscope, their two large front legs look like pincher claws, which is why they're nicknamed \"crabs.\" [1] X Research source"

      "title": "",
      "content": "Nits are very hard to see, but you can find them attached to your body hair. They take 6-10 days to hatch. Nymphs take 2-3 weeks to fully mature into adults and reproduce. Both nymphs and adult lice need blood in order to survive. Nymphs and adult lice may feed up to 5 times a day. If they fall off you, nymphs and adult lice will die in 1-2 days."

      "title": "People who are sexually active are most at risk of getting pubic lice.",
      "content": "People who are sexually active are most at risk of getting pubic lice. Since pubic lice prefer to live in pubic hair, these insects are spread whenever people's pubic regions come into close contact. Any sex act with an infected individual increases the likelihood of an infestation. [2] X Research source Once people's pubic regions are close to each other, lice can easily move from one person's hairs to another individual's hairs. Other forms of close contact can spread pubic lice. For example, if someone kisses you, pubic lice on their eyelashes can move onto the hair on your face. Quick forms of contact, like a handshake, won't spread pubic lice because they aren't close and prolonged enough to expose anyone to crabs."

      "content": "Anyone who shares items, like towels, can also contract pubic lice. If you use bedding, towels, or clothing that is infested with nits or pubic lice, then you'll come in contact with these parasites. As soon as you place the infested item against your body, the pubic lice may move to your pubic region, armpit region, eyelashes, or eyebrows. [3] X Research source This way of spreading pubic lice is less common than sexual activity. Pubic lice are highly unlikely to survive on smooth surfaces, like toilet seats. They usually slip off because they can't hang onto them. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Itchiness and inflamed skin are common symptoms of pubic lice. You'll see nits attached to your hair or lice crawling in your genital area. Pubic lice bite to feed on blood, so you'll notice itchiness as well as inflamed skin. Excessive bites from lice can lead to tiny bruises in the genital area and severe itching. You may also find small blood spots in your underwear or black spots, which are lice droppings. [5] X Research source Sometimes, you'll have skin lesions that fill with pus from a bacterial infection. They do not, however, transmit any diseases. In some rare cases, you may find pubic lice in your eyebrows and eyelashes. This can cause itching, red eyes, and inflamed eyelids. While it's not common, pubic lice may also infect your armpit region, so you may experience itchiness and inflammation there, too."

Dry the area with a clean towel. [8] X Research source It will be easier to thoroughly apply the treatment over the infested region when the skin is cool, clean and dry. Do not shave during this step, as live lice can just crawl to another area with body hair. Once you've dried off, immediately throw the towel into the washing machine.
