This sort of drainage is not produced enough that it can soak a bandage. Serosanguinous drainage: This type of drainage manifests as a thin, watery discharge that is made of blood and serum. Because there is only a small amount of blood, the discharge may be pinkish."

Washing and cleaning the draining wound with saline or soapy water will help remove old dead skin cells and wound debris, which can facilitate wound healing. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Clean a draining wound once a day or when the bandage over the wound gets soiled or wet. Before cleaning the wound, be sure you have washed it under running water. Pour the solution on a piece of gauze or a clean cloth and run it gently over the wound with gentle dabs and wipes. Clean the wound in a circular motion, starting from the center of the wound and working your way out to the edges of the wound. Do not use alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, skin cleansers, or antibacterial soaps as these can damage the wound tissue and slow down the healing process."

Call your doctor right away and go to the nearest hospital as severe wound bleeding or a hemorrhage can potentially be fatal due to excessive blood loss."
