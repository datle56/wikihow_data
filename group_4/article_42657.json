This can be particularly intimidating when you want to talk to someone that you have not previously met. To strike up a conversation with a new person, try to find some common ground. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, if you are waiting in line at your neighborhood coffee shop, you could say to the person in front of you, \"What's good here? I've never tried any of their specialty drinks.\" You can also comment on the situation. Try saying, \"Isn't it nice out today?\". If the person responds in a favorable tone, you can follow up with some more specific comments. Another conversation starter is making a comment about the person you want to talk to. You could say, \"I really love that bag you're carrying.\""

      "content": "Choose the right person to approach. Look for someone who is not otherwise occupied and has a friendly expression. For example, if you are standing in line and someone makes eye contact with you, offer a smile and an opening question. Avoid trying to start a conversation with someone who is speaking to someone else or who is actively engaged in a task. [2] X Research source At a party, a good place to start a conversation is near the food table or bar. These things provide natural conversation starters, such as \"Have you tried the spinach dip?\" or \"Can you show me how to use this wine opener?\" If you are having trouble mingling at a party, head towards the kitchen. This is often a gathering space, and you can join in the crowd by helping to mix drinks or set out snacks. The same rules apply when deciding when to approach a co-worker. Wait until they are not obviously engaged with someone else. Lunch is an ideal time to start a conversation."

One effective approach is to ask that person something about themselves. Questions are a great way to get the conversational ball rolling. [3] X Research source If you want to chat to a colleague in the cafeteria, questions are a good way to start. Try saying, \"How was your weekend? Did you take advantage of the great weather?\" Maybe you'd like to get to know your new next door neighbor. When you see her grabbing her mail, say, \"How are you adjusting to your new neighborhood? Let me know if I can recommend a good pizza place.\""

The other person will often take it from there and keep the conversation going. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source You can make a simple statement about yourself. After a challenging spinning class, say to the person next to you, \"Wow, I'm going to be sore later.\" By keeping things simple, you are starting the conversation, but allowing the other person to help you get things started. It also takes some of the pressure off of you to find something clever to say.

      "content": "Avoid over-sharing . When you are trying to start a conversation, it is important that you do not make the other person feel awkward. Many people have a tendency to babble or chat nervously when making small talk. This can lead to a common social problem known as over-sharing. [5] X Research source Unless you are talking privately to someone you know well, it's best to avoid sharing sensitive information about yourself. For example, don't try to start a conversation by telling a casual acquaintance the results of your most recent checkup at your gynecologists office. People often feel uncomfortable when you share personal information. The cashier at the grocery store likely does not want to hear that your teenage daughter is not performing well at school. When you are starting a conversation, stay away from potentially sensitive subjects. Don't monologue at peopleâ€”good conversations are dialogues with questions and anecdotes.

However, there are times that it is best to stay silent. [7] X Research source If you are bored on an airplane, you might want to entertain yourself by talking to your seatmate. But if she is giving you certain social cues, find another way to amuse yourself. If someone is avoiding making eye contact, that is a sign she doesn't feel like talking. Someone who is reading or listening to headphones is probably also content to remain silent."

Consider saying, \"Brad, your Powerpoints always look so polished. Would you mind offering me some tips?\" If you're on a date, you could ask something like \"what are some of your pet peeves?\" or \"what's something people would be surprised to learn about you?\" [9] X Expert Source Cristina Morara Dating Coach Expert Interview. 29 September 2020."

Ask questions that require much more than a yes or no answer. [10] X Research source Instead of saying, \"How was your trip to Phoenix?\" try saying, \"I remember you saying you were traveling. What sorts of things did you do on your vacation?\" This will allow for elaboration. Continue asking questions after the initial response. If the person says, \"We did a lot of golfing\", you can say, \"Oh, what's your handicap? Can you recommend any good courses? I'd love to improve my game.\" You can also turn compliments into questions. For example, you could say, \"I really love that dress you're wearing. How do you find such great pieces?\" Asking people \"what were you like in high school?\" can lead to some surprisingly fun and interesting responses.

But you still need to make an effort to make the conversation flow smoothly. Part of being a good conversationalist is knowing how to avoid saying things that will make the other person uncomfortable. [13] X Research source You've probably heard the old adage that you should avoid talking about politics or religion in social settings. You should heed that advice when you are in a diverse group of people. Avoid boring people. For example, don't give long, intricate summaries of your favorite reality show or your cat's health. Give others a chance to participate in the conversation. Strike the right tone. For the most part, small talk should be happy. After all, you are looking to make someone like you. And we are all naturally drawn to positive people. When in doubt, try to look for something upbeat to say. [14] X Research source For instance, you could say, \"Wow, we've had a lot of rain lately. But at least we're likely to have some gorgeous spring flowers!\" It's ok to commiserate about an uncomfortable situation. Just try to put a positive spin on it.

Be prepared to move on to something other than your ice breaking question. A good way to be prepared is to pay attention to current events and pop culture. You'll always be able to offer observations about those things. For example, you could say, \"Did you see any of the movies up for Best Picture this year? I really loved Spotlight.\" Be ready to transition to new topics. Try saying things such as, \"Oh, your story reminds me of my trip to Greece.
