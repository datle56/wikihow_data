      "content": "Talk to your hair stylist about treatments and styling. Some chemical processes might cause hair to break off or fall off temporarily. These include bleaching and coloring, straightening, and perms. Heat from straightening irons or blow-drying can also cause hair loss. Hairstyles that pull your hair tightly can cause \"traction alopecia,\" in which follicles are damaged over time. If you feel scalp pain, avoid pulling your hair back into tight ponytails or other styles that pull the hair."

The most common cause of hair loss in adults — male or female pattern baldness — is genetic. However, a combination of genetics and hormones can start this sort of hair loss in your mid-teen years. Recent studies show that genetic hair loss can be inherited from either parent in both boys and girls.

However, stress or traumatic events (accidents, surgery, illness) can cause excessive shedding.

      "content": "See your family doctor or dermatologist about medical conditions. There are many illnesses and conditions that could cause hair loss. Hormonal conditions like uncontrolled diabetes, thyroid disease, or polycystic ovary syndrome can interfere with hair production. Those with lupus can also experience hair loss. Eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia can starve the body of essential proteins, vitamins, and minerals needed for hair growth. Some vegetarian teens also lose hair if they don’t get enough protein from non-meat sources. Athletes are at a higher risk for hair loss because they’re more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia can then result in hair loss. One cause of patchy hair loss, often with scaling and broken hairs, is ringworm of the scalp, called tinea capitis . It is not very common in teens, but it can occur. This is caused by a fungal infection and is treated with oral medications and special shampoos."
