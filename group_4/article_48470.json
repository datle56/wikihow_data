Religion-based messages can be a really sweet way to show the new baby some love, so long as it matches the family’s religious beliefs. Share a quick passage from their religion’s holy book in your message. Religion can be a delicate topic, so only share religious messages with close family and friends. “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you. —John 14:27” “Do not fear, for I am with you. —Isaiah 41:10” “Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him. – Psalm 127:3”"

If you plan to give another gift , be it money, a gift card , a piece of jewelry, or something else small, you can always tuck it into the book and leave a line about it in your baby shower book message. Depending on the subject of the book, you could even get something a little bigger for the baby, like a stuffed animal. [11] X Research source “I chose a book I hoped you’d love, but I’m including extra funds to expand your bookshelf!” “Enclosed is a little something extra for your parents.
