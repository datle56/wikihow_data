      "content": "Recognize the structure of an argumentative paragraph. Most argumentative paragraphs have a clearly defined structure, especially if they are in an academic context. Each paragraph helps to support the overarching thesis (or argumentative claim) of the paper, and each paragraph presents new information that can convince a reader that your position is the correct one. The components that make up a paragraph are the following: Topic sentence. A topic sentence explains to the reader what the paragraph is about. It usually ties back to the bigger argument in some way, and it explains why the paragraph belongs in the essay. Sometimes a topic sentence might be 2 or even 3 sentences long, though it is usually just a single sentence. [2] X Research source Evidence. Most body paragraphs in an argumentative paper include some kind of proof that your position is the correct one. This evidence can be all kinds of things: quotations, surveys, or even your own observations. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source Your paragraphs are where this evidence can be presented in a convincing way. [4] X Research source Analysis. A good paragraph doesn't just present evidence. It also takes some time to explain why the evidence is worthwhile, what it means, and why it is better than other pieces of evidence out there. This is where your own analysis comes into play. Conclusions and transitions. After the analysis, a good paragraph will conclude by explaining why the paragraph is significant, how it fits in with the thesis of the essay, and will begin to set up the next paragraph.

      "content": "Reread your thesis statement. If you are writing an argumentative essay, each paragraph should help further your overarching claim. Before you can write an argumentative paragraph, you must have your thesis statement firmly in mind. A thesis statement is a 1-3 sentence description of what you are arguing and why it is important. Are you arguing that all Americans should use energy-efficient bulbs in their homes? Or are you arguing that all citizens should have the freedom to choose which products they buy?

[12] X Research source As you write out your related pieces of evidence, keep your reader in mind. Always explain what your evidence is, how and why it was collected, and what it means. A few special things to keep in mind include: You must define any key terms or jargon that might be unfamiliar to your reader. (What) You must provide any key dates and locations, if relevant (such as where a historical document was signed). (When/Where) You must describe how evidence was obtained. For example, you might want to explain the methods of a scientific study that provided you with your evidence. (How) You must explain who provided you with your evidence.

After you present your key, related piece(s) of evidence, you have to spend some time explaining how you believe the evidence contributes to your larger argument. This is where your own analysis comes into play. You cannot simply list evidence and move on: you have to explain its importance. A few questions you can ask yourself as you analyze your evidence include: What is it that ties this evidence together? How does this evidence help prove my thesis? Are there any counterpoints or alternative explanations I should keep in mind? What makes this evidence stand out? Is there anything special or interesting about it?"

      "content": "Write your topic sentence. The topic sentence of each paragraph is a signpost that the reader will use to follow your argument. Your introduction will include your thesis statement, and each paragraph will build upon this thesis by offering evidence. As the reader goes through your paper, she will recognize how each paragraph contributes to the thesis. Remember that the thesis is the larger argument, and the topic sentence helps prove the thesis by focusing on a smaller topic or idea. This topic sentence will make a claim or argument, which is then defended or reinforced in the following sentences. Identify the main idea of your paragraph and write a mini thesis statement that states this main idea. Let's say your thesis statement is \"Charlie Brown is the most important comic strip character in America,\" your essay might have the following topic sentences: \"The high ratings that Charlie Brown television specials have garnered for decades demonstrate the influence of this character.\" \"Some people contend that superheroes such as Superman are more important than Charlie Brown. However, studies show that most Americans identify more readily with the hapless Charlie than with the powerful, alien Superman.\" \"Media historians point to Charlie Brown's catchphrases, distinctive appearance, and sage wisdom as reasons why this character is beloved by adults and children alike.\""

Ask yourself if the topic sentence supports the paragraph’s ideas and details. Do they fit together? Are there ideas that seem out of place? If so, think about how you can alter the topic sentence to cover all of the ideas in the paragraph. If there are too many ideas, you may need to break up the paragraph into two separate paragraphs. Be sure that your topic sentence isn't simply a restatement of the thesis itself. Each paragraph should have a distinct, unique topic sentence. If you are simply restating \"Charlie Brown is important\" at the beginning of each body paragraph, you will have to narrow down your topic sentences more thoroughly. [13] X Research source"
