      "content": "Wonyoungism is a self-improvement trend that emphasizes self-care. Inspired by Jang Wonyoung of the K-pop group IVE, Wonyoungism is all about striving to be the best version of yourself, looking and feeling good, and not caring what other people think. Although the trend is centered around Wonyoung, she doesn’t promote her lifestyle, telling her audience “I don’t care. You are you, I am me.” This became the basis of the Wonyoungism movement, as it emphasizes her mindset of not caring about other people’s opinions. [1] X Research source In Wonyoungism, self-care and improvement are usually done through morning and nighttime routines, skincare, and specific eating habits. While Wonyoungism is all about self-improvement, there are risks associated with the dieting aspect , as many online fans advocate for unhealthy fasting that normalizes eating disorders. The Wonyoungism aesthetic is similar to the clean girl aesthetic , emphasizing cute makeup, hair, and style with clean, preppy, pink clothing."

Wonyoungism is known for promoting specific dieting habits among its fanbase, many of which are considered pro-ana (a digital movement that means pro-anorexia).

This isn’t promoted by Wonyoung herself, but many followers of Wonyoungism use these methods to look like her, raising eating disorder risks. [26] X Research source To prevent eating disorders, clinical nutritionist Tara Coleman says that a mindset shift is important. Rather than focusing on removing or restricting foods, focus on what you can add to make your meals healthier. For example, instead of cutting carbs, include both carbs and protein and focus on adding vegetables. When figuring out what foods are going to benefit your nutrition and diet, Nutritionist Amy Chow recommends looking at what you’re trying to achieve and determining what foods are going to help with your goals. Chow also recommends getting your dieting and nutrition information from a trusted source, like a registered dietitian or nutritionist."
