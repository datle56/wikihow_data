      "content": "Avoid introducing any new ideas. When concluding any kind of essay, avoid introducing an idea that isn't already in the body of the paper.

      "content": "Use strong, simple language. Your concluding paragraph should drive your point home in a straightforward, assertive way. Avoid too much detail in your writing (such as lengthy adjectives or descriptions), as it can be distracting. Choose the simplest manner to say what you want to communicate.

      "content": "Avoid being obvious. A well-written paper does not need to use phrases like \"to conclude\" or \"to summarize\" in its conclusion.

Your reader, having read the rest of your paper, will understand on their own that you are summing up the contents of your essay and presenting your conclusion. [8] X Research source"
