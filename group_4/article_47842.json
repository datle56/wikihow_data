      "content": "Light Brown Light brown shoes are a slightly unexpected but still fashionable option for a grey suit. Light to mid shades of brown, like tan and walnut, work best with lighter grey suits, like silver and dove-grey, as long as they have cool or neutral undertones that compliment the undertones of the grey. However, a light grey suit paired with lighter brown shoes isn't usually appropriate for truly formal occasions, and should be reserved for daytime events, like weddings. [1] X Research source Pairs best with: lighter grey suits. This combination would help make a great first impression at a daytime social networking event, like a business brunch."

      "content": "Dark brown Dark brown shoes, like burnished brown and mahogany, are an excellent choice for grey suits in general, but darker shades of grey in particular, like charcoal. Mid-grey suits, like pewter and steel, can also benefit from a pop of deep and luxurious brown. Additionally, dark brown shoes are super versatile, able to take a daytime business look to a formal evening look. [2] X Research source Pairs best with: darker grey suits. A dark grey suit isn’t as formal as a black suit, but is still the most formal of all the shades of grey; dark brown shoes elevate the look even further."

A black shoe and grey suit combination commands attention while radiating power and timeless elegance. Ideal for more formal occasions, it’s hard to go wrong with this stylish mashup. As a good rule of thumb, it’s best to reserve black patent leather shoes for the most formal events, like black-tie weddings. [3] X Research source Pairs best with: grey suits of all shades. Although light brown shoes go best with light grey suits, black shoes could add a surprising touch to a light grey suit, as well."

      "title": "Burgundy",
      "content": "Burgundy Burgundy is often used interchangeably with “oxblood,” which makes sense since both of these colors are composed of the same hues: dark brown, red, and purple. One subtle difference is that burgundy has a bit more purple in it, while oxblood has more brown. Although this may seem small, it can play an important role when it comes to coordinating with your grey suit. If you opt for burgundy, the pop of purple will be more prevalent, whereas oxblood offers a warmer, more neutral look. [4] X Research source Pairs best with: mid-dark grey suits. Try wearing a dark charcoal suit with dark burgundy or oxblood shoes for a rich and sophisticated combination."

When worn properly, an unexpected touch of white may help you stand out from the crowd in the right way. Pairs best with: light grey or linen suits.

      "content": "Create a cohesive look by matching your belt to your shoes. Accessories can make or break a tailored look and a belt is no exception. In a formal setting, pairing black shoes with a black belt is appropriate, as is pairing brown shoes with a brown belt. Additionally, the textures and textiles should match, too, meaning a leather belt should be worn with leather shoes and so on. However, there are some other considerations to keep in mind when going for a less formal look. [5] X Research source When dressing casually, your belt should match your outfit as a whole. Pair shoes on the black-and-white scale, such as white, grey, or black shoes, with a black belt. Earth-toned shoes or vibrantly colored shoes, like navy, dark green, or purple, work best with brown belts. For a formal event, the metal details in your belt should match the metal of your watch and/or cufflinks. These small touches can easily elevate your outfit!"

There are tons of successful sock, shoe, and suit combinations that work as long as the tones are similar. Here are some general guidelines for best sock-shoe practices: [6] X Research source Wear black shoes with grey, black, or navy socks , as they’re all in the same shade family. Wear brown shoes with brown, khaki, or olive socks , reflecting those warmer earth tones. If your grey suit is patterned, select socks that are solid to strike a stylish balance. If you want to add a fun and funky touch to your neutral grey suit and black shoes, socks can also offer that pop of color at the flash of an ankle."

You can wear a light to mid grey suit to a daytime wedding, paired with medium brown or dark brown shoes. If attending a more formal, evening wedding, pair a charcoal grey suit with black shoes to play it on the safe side, or with burgundy or oxblood-colored shoes for a bolder look.

      "content": "Pick darker shades of grey for more formal events. Generally speaking, the darker the shade, the more appropriate for a formal occasion, with few rare exceptions. Not wearing brown after 6PM, for example, is an old-fashioned faux pas that still rings true for highly formal occasions, reminding us that black shoes are the number one footwear for black-tie events. Consider the seasons, too, as darker outfits are more appropriate for autumn and winter, so you can think of pairing a dark grey suit with a classic white dress shirt during those colder months. [8] X Research source Charcoal and dark grey suits paired with dark brown or black shoes work best for important business meetings, formal events, nighttime events, and evening weddings."

      "content": "Pick lighter shades of grey for more casual events. The less formal the event, the more reason you have to wear a lighter shade of grey. Light-mid shades, like dove gray and silver, are perfect for outdoor events, beach weddings, business brunches, and smart casual looks in general. As noted, the season during which your event is set to take place is important to consider, too, as a light grey suit would work best in spring and summer. For a fun and colorful twist, opt to pair your light grey suit with a pastel-colored shirt underneath, like baby blue or pink."

In fact, the style of shoe might require even more consideration and there are quite a few options to choose from. Here are some of the most popular shoe designs to wear with a grey suit, from fancy casual to elevated elegance. Oxfords: This type of lace-up shoe is a no-brainer for nearly any occasion. With roots at Oxford University, this preppy shoe can be dressed up or down, offering versatility as well as unparalleled class. [9] X Research source Derbies: The main differences between Oxfords and Derbies are the lacing patterns and the level of formality. Derbies have open lacing and are less formal than Oxfords, great for daytime looks. [10] X Research source Monk strap: A slightly less formal and more flashy style, the monk strap features 1 or 2 leather straps instead of laces, and was named after the 2-strap sandals monks used to wear. This shoe is a great way to push the limits of personal style! [11] X Research source Brogues: Broguing refers to the decorative hole pattern in leather shoes, not the shoe itself. Oxfords can be brogue, for example, and vice versa! This is another bold option for the adventurous dresser. [12] X Research source Chelsea boots: Cool and casual, Chelsea boots typically extend to the ankle and have origins in Victorian England. Wear Chelsea boots with a dark charcoal suit for a stylish yet informal look. [13] X Research source"
