      "content": "Understand that subtraction of percentages may be done in several ways: You can convert the percent to a fraction or decimal. While you might need to subtract a percent from a percent when working in finance, if you are working on homework you more likely will come across problems where you need to subtract a percent from a whole number. Three of the methods and examples below each have an elegant/straight forward alternative technique that cuts away the complexity of awkward conversions that are optional."
