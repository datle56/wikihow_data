If you have allergens on your sheets and pillow, you are spending a third of your time breathing in those allergens. Use a dust mite cover on your mattress to prevent allergens from settling. Wash your hair before you go to bed to rinse out any pollen that might be stuck in it. If you are allergic to particular pollens, stay at home as much as you can at the time of the year when the levels of those types of pollen are high.
