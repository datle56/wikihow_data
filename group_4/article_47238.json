      "content": "A wandering eye is when a person in a relationship looks at others romantically or sexually. In general, a wandering eye is when someone in a committed relationship notices and checks out other people in a romantic or sexual way. This can include talking about how attractive someone is, flirting with them, or fantasizing about them. However, people have different definitions of what a wandering eye entails. [1] X Research source People also feel differently about wandering eyes in a relationship. Many think it’s an inoffensive, normal behavior while others find it disrespectful or embarrassing, like they have to compete for their partner’s attention. Some even see wandering eyes as “ microcheating ,” or small actions that create intimacy with someone outside the relationship. To some, this can undermine their trust in their partner or be a sign of future infidelity. [2] X Research source"

Some examples of wandering eye behaviors can include: Checking someone out (staring at their body, ogling, etc.) Commenting on how attractive, hot, or sexy someone is (as opposed to more neutral comments, like saying they look nice) Flirting with someone Having sexual fantasies about someone Talking about their sexual desires with someone Making romantic or sexual plans with someone"

      "content": "Some people think wandering eyes are normal and not a red flag. According to psychotherapist Kelli Miller, it is “natural for humans to look at other humans” even when they’re in committed relationships. So, many couples don’t think anything of wandering eyes. They recognize that it’s normal to notice if someone is attractive and understand that it doesn’t negate their love for their partner (or mean their partner isn’t into them). Many people believe it’s unreasonable to never check out another person once you're in a relationship—it’s okay to look and even fantasize. What’s more important is that you treat your thoughts as fantasy and don’t act on them. Miller agrees, saying, “We're not our thoughts. It's more the actions around it. So it's okay…if a partner fantasizes about somebody else. It's the actions that concern me more” or “that they're going to do something about that.” In Miller’s opinion, she would “be more worried if somebody wasn't looking at other people” because this could mean their “blood isn't pumping” or “they're not having hormones.” She asserts that there’s normalcy in couples noticing and finding other people attractive."

To them, it can mean their partner doesn’t respect their relationship which makes it a red flag . Some people may also see wandering eyes as a type of micro cheating that can lead to infidelity. [3] X Research source For many people, having a partner with a wandering eye can make them feel unloved and insecure. It can seem like their partner is neglecting them, comparing them to others, unexcited by the relationship, or not dealing with issues. Does a wandering eye lead to cheating? There is some evidence that people who find others attractive are more likely to cheat later in the relationship. [4] X Research source However, this doesn’t mean a wandering eye causes someone to cheat or always leads to cheating. Every person and relationship is different. Is a wandering eye considered cheating? Some people might see a wandering eye as a form of infidelity. Licensed clinical social worker Raffi Bilek says what people consider cheating depends on their relationship needs and boundaries—there’s no “one size fits all” definition."

Miller says that it’s normal for your self-esteem to take a hit when your partner’s behavior crosses boundaries. While it often feels personal or like you’re not good enough, that’s not the case—it’s really about your partner. To help build your self-esteem , recognize your accomplishments and wonderful qualities. Work to replace your negative thoughts with positive ones.

Be patient and monitor your partner’s behavior. Miller says rebuilding trust “does take time” so it’s important to see “what your partner is doing to build that trust up with you again.” Connect with your partner by spending time together: go on dates, cuddle on the couch, practice a hobby, or try a new experience."
