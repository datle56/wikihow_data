      "title": "Look for telltale characteristics.",
      "content": "Look for telltale characteristics. Mold often has a fuzzy appearance but can also look like a stain if it's growing on a wall or furniture. Its most common colors are black green, brown, or white. Mold can feel like cotton, leather, velvet, or sand paper. It usually gives off a musty or earthy odor. Also look for visible signs of possible water damage such as stains or paint bubbling. This could mean there is mold growth within the wall cavity."

    {
      "title": "Check the basement.",
      "content": "Check the basement. This should be the first place you look. Its underground location makes it especially vulnerable to moisture and humidity buildup. After each heavy rain, look for and immediately treat any water seepage. Check the following spots: Baseboards Walls, especially where they meet the ceiling Behind and under appliances, especially the washer and dryer"

      "title": "Check the utility room.",
      "content": "Check the utility room. Look in and around the clothes dryer duct for mold growth. If it's not properly ventilated, it can trigger a build-up in humidity in the room. Make sure the duct is vented toward the exterior of the house.

      "title": "Check places recently damaged by water.",
      "content": "Check places recently damaged by water. Inspect the baseboards in the basement and first/ground floor if your house recently flooded. Tear out all carpeting in these areas. If you recently experienced heavy rain, look for water stains in the attic and on the upper-story living areas.

      "title": "Check shower curtains.",
      "content": "Check shower curtains. Dirt and grime that washes off your body has a tendency to mix with shampoo and soap residue. This mixture ultimately collects on shower curtains. Make sure the bathroom is well lit. Spread out the shower curtain to check the entire surface. Use a magnifying glass to check for small patches of mold that you could otherwise miss."

    {
      "title": "Check ceiling corners.",
      "content": "Check ceiling corners. The corners where your walls meet the ceiling are prime locations for mold growth because they trap water from roof leaks. Check for growth and accumulation in all four corners of each room. If your wallpaper is peeling at the ceiling juncture, check behind it for mold growth.

      "content": "Check air ducts and vents. Fluctuations between heating and air conditioning cause moisture buildup on cooling coils and in drain pans. Remove the vent plate from the duct and inspect it closely. Turn on the lights or use a strong LED flashlight to easily catch mold clusters. Check the duct for as far as your eye can see."

      "content": "Use an in-home mold testing kit. In-home testing kits come equipped with their own instruments and instructions. Follow the kit's directions. Submit the sampling to a local lab. If you see mold in a visual inspection, a testing kit isn't necessary. [6] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source These kits can be difficult to use, and their results can be unreliable. Use them only as a last resort if other options aren't available."

      "title": "Use a borescope.",
      "content": "Use a borescope. A borescope can be helpful for inspecting spaces between walls. [7] X Trustworthy Source United States Environmental Protection Agency Independent U.S. government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices Go to source Drill a small hole into a wall recently affected by water or moisture. Slowly insert the fiber optic cable end through the hole. Check the monitor for signs of mold. Continue to move slowly as you probe deeper into the area. Borescopes distort the size and color of mold on the monitor. If you find areas of discoloration inside the wall, contact a professional for a second opinion. You can also use a borescope to inspect air ducts, but there are drawbacks. The instrument only lets you see so far into a duct. If the duct makes a sudden 90-degree turn, you won't be able to see beyond that turn."
