      "title": "Layer 2-3 pieces of tissue paper on top of one another on a table.",
      "content": "Layer 2-3 pieces of tissue paper on top of one another on a table. Pick out several pieces of tissue paper, either all in one color or in multiple different colors. Spread them out on a flat surface, layering them on top of one another evenly. [1] X Research source Layering several pieces of tissue paper on top of one another will prevent your gift from being seen through the paper. Choose pieces of tissue paper that aren’t too crumpled for a smooth look."

    {
      "title": "Place your gift in the center of the tissue paper to check the sizing.",
      "content": "Place your gift in the center of the tissue paper to check the sizing. Pull the sides of the tissue paper over the gift to make sure it’s large enough to cover each side. If your piece of tissue paper is too big, either trim it using scissors or fold the excess over the edges. [2] X Research source Set the gift down on the tissue paper face down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold one edge of the tissue paper around and over the top of the gift.",
      "content": "Fold one edge of the tissue paper around and over the top of the gift. With the gift placed on the tissue paper, fold an edge of the tissue paper over the gift tightly. Hold this edge in place covering a side of the gift so it doesn’t fall off. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull the opposite edge overtop the first edge, securing it with tape.",
      "content": "Pull the opposite edge overtop the first edge, securing it with tape. While still holding the first edge in place, bring the opposite edge of tissue paper to the top of the gift as well, layering it over the first. Tape down the edge so it stays in place on the gift. [4] X Research source For a cleaner look, fold the opposite edge of the tissue paper along its length, creating a nice seam before placing it on top of the other edge. Use double-sided tape if you don’t want the tape to be visible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the ends of the wrapped gift in towards each other to form straight creases.",
      "content": "Fold the ends of the wrapped gift in towards each other to form straight creases. With the tissue paper secured around your gift, all that’s left are the 2 ends. Bring each edge of the tissue paper to the center of each side, creating creases along the gift so the tissue paper lies flat. Use tape to secure the ends. [5] X Research source If your gift is awkwardly shaped, consider gathering each end of the present and tying them with ribbon instead."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decorate the tissue paper with ribbons or embellishments if desired.",
      "content": "Decorate the tissue paper with ribbons or embellishments if desired. Use ribbon to tie a bow onto the wrapped gift, or stick on a premade bow for a quick finishing touch. Get creative by drawing on the tissue paper with markers or pencils, or add stickers to the tissue paper for a unique design. [6] X Research source For example, if the gift is for someone’s birthday, draw birthday balloons on the tissue paper using colorful markers. Add tissue paper pompoms to your gift for a creative finishing touch."

    {
      "title": "Lay 3 sheets of tissue paper on a flat surface.",
      "content": "Lay 3 sheets of tissue paper on a flat surface. Choose tissue paper in any colors that you like. Lay them flat on top of one another with their edges lined up. [7] X Research source If you choose lighter colors like yellow or white, you may need to use more than 3 sheets to make sure you can't see the gift through the paper."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your item at the top of the tissue paper.",
      "content": "Place your item at the top of the tissue paper. Set down your gift right below the top edge of the tissue paper. Situate it in the center so that you'll have equal amounts of tissue paper on both sides of the gift when you go to tie off the ends. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the object in the tissue paper all the way down to the bottom edge.",
      "content": "Roll the object in the tissue paper all the way down to the bottom edge. Holding the top edge of the tissue paper in place against the object, start gently rolling the item in the tissue paper towards the bottom edge of paper. Go slowly to create a tighter roll and keep the object centered in the middle of the tissue paper. [9] X Research source If your item is weirdly shaped, it may be difficult to keep it perfectly centered in the tissue paper as you roll, and this is okay."

    {
      "title": "Fold the bottom edge of tissue paper over to create a long crease.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom edge of tissue paper over to create a long crease. This isn't required, but it will make your wrapping job look neater. Fold the bottom edge of your tissue paper in towards your gift going along the entire length. Finish rolling the gift so that the folded edge is placed on top of the roll. [10] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Secure the rolled tissue paper edges using tape.",
      "content": "Secure the rolled tissue paper edges using tape. Holding the tissue paper edge in place on the roll using your fingers, place a piece of tape along this edge so that the roll doesn't come undone. Place multiple pieces along the tissue paper roll if your gift is long. [11] X Research source Use double-sided tape if you don't want the tape to be visible."

    {
      "title": "Use ribbon to tie off each open end of the tissue paper.",
      "content": "Use ribbon to tie off each open end of the tissue paper. Pick out ribbon that matches your tissue paper and cut it into strands that are roughly 1 ft (0.30 m) long. Feel the tissue paper to find the edges of your gift, and tie the tissue paper using ribbon to secure the present in place. [12] X Research source Tie your ribbon into a bow on each end, or use scissors to create curls if you're using curling ribbon. This method can be used to wrap small and irregularly shaped items like stuffed toys , socks, or baggies of actual candy."

      "title": "Wrap the gift in a layer of tissue paper before putting it in the bag, if needed.",
      "content": "Wrap the gift in a layer of tissue paper before putting it in the bag, if needed. If your gift is fragile or you just want it covered up, wrap it in a piece of white or colored tissue paper and place it inside the bag. The gift doesn’t need to be wrapped perfectly, just as long as the tissue paper is covering it. [13] X Research source If you’re worried about the gift falling out of the tissue paper, use tape to secure it. Wrap extra fragile items in several sheets of tissue paper."

      "title": "Spread out 1-4 sheets of tissue paper depending on the size of your gift bag.",
      "content": "Spread out 1-4 sheets of tissue paper depending on the size of your gift bag. If you’re adding tissue paper to a small bag designed for something like a gift card or piece of jewelry, you’ll likely only need 1 piece of tissue paper. Larger bags can use anywhere from 2-4 pieces of tissue paper. Spread the tissue paper out so that each piece is laying flat. [14] X Research source Cut your piece of tissue paper in half for super small bags."

    {
      "title": "Layer the tissue paper in a fan pattern if you’re using multiple sheets.",
      "content": "Layer the tissue paper in a fan pattern if you’re using multiple sheets. Instead of placing a bunch of pieces directly on top of each other all lined up, fan the pieces out on top of each other in a circle so each paper's corners are visible. This adds volume and creates a beautiful tissue paper display. [15] X Research source If your tissue paper is one-sided, place the side with the color or pattern face-down so it will be seen."

    {
      "title": "Pinch the middle of the tissue paper and wave it gently through the air.",
      "content": "Pinch the middle of the tissue paper and wave it gently through the air. Grasping the piece or pieces of tissue paper in the center using your fingers, gently lift the paper up in one quick motion so the ends all point in one direction. Be careful not to pull the paper through the air too harshly or it might rip. [16] X Research source Pinching the center of the tissue paper helps create the flower-like visual after the tissue paper’s ends are sticking up."

      "title": "Stick the tissue paper in the bag to display the crisp points.",
      "content": "Stick the tissue paper in the bag to display the crisp points. Holding the pinched portion of the tissue paper, settle the paper down into the bag so the points are sticking up out of it evenly. Play around with the placement of the tissue paper, adjusting it until you’re pleased with how it looks. [17] X Research source Leave enough tissue paper sticking out of the bag so you can see its colors."

    {
      "title": "Add embellishments like gift tags or bows if desired.",
      "content": "Add embellishments like gift tags or bows if desired. Tie a gift tag onto the bag’s handle, or use tape to attach a premade bow to make the bag look extra festive. Don’t forget to put your card in the bag too, if needed! [18] X Research source Instead of using a premade bow, consider tying your own bow onto the bag’s handle using ribbon in a color that matches the tissue paper."
