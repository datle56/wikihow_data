A different method for wrapping your wrist may provide greater stability for the injured area and allow you to resume minor activity when you are ready. Start your wrap by securing the elastic bandage wrap at an area just above the injury, meaning on the elbow side of the injured part of the wrist. Wrap the bandage around your forearm at this location two to three times. The next wrap should move across the injured area, and include several wraps around your forearm just below the injury, closer to your hand. This method provides added stability for the injured part of your wrist, which is now located between the two sections of the wrapped elastic bandage. Make at least two figure 8 passes between your thumb and index finger, securing each one with an additional wrap around your wrist area. Continue to wrap your wrist moving toward your elbow, covering 50% of the previous section with each wrap around your forearm. Reverse direction and wrap back in the direction of your hand.

A sprain occurs when a ligament is overstretched or torn. Ligaments connect one bone to another bone. The symptoms of strains and sprains are very similar. You can expect the area to be painful, swollen, and have limited movement of the affected joint or muscle area. Bruising is more common with a sprain, as well as sometimes hearing a “pop” sound at the time of the injury. Strains involve muscle tissue, so muscle spasms can sometimes occur with a strain."

Do not allow your wrist to do any work at all if possible. This means no lifting of items with that hand, no twisting of your wrist or your hand, and no bending your wrist. This may also mean no writing or computer work, depending on the severity of your wrist injury. To help your wrist to rest, you may want to consider purchasing a wrist splint . This is especially important if you have a tendon injury. A splint provides support for your wrist and helps immobilize it, to keep you from causing further injury.

These are known as hyperextension and hyperflexion. [20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Hyperextension is the most common type of wrist injury. This occurs when your hand goes out to break your fall, and you land on your opened hand. [21] X Research source This type of falling causes your wrist to bend further back to bear the weight and impact of the fall. This is called hyperextension of the wrist. Hyperflexion occurs when the outer part of your hand catches your weight as you fall. This causes your wrist to bend too far towards the inside of your arm."

      "content": "Wrap your wrist to prevent hyperextension. In some sports this injury is more common, and athletes often have their wrists wrapped to prevent a hyperextension injury or re-injury. [22] X Research source The first step in wrapping a wrist to prevent hyperextension is to start with a pre-wrap. Pre-wrap (sports tape) is a type of lightly adhesive, rolled tape that is used to protect the skin from irritation that is sometimes caused by the stronger adhesives used in athletic and medical tape products. [23] X Research source Pre-wrap, sometimes called underwrap, comes in a standard width of 2.75 inches (7 cm) and is available in different colors, and also in different textures. Some pre-wrap products are thicker or have a foam-like feel. Wrap a few strips of pre-wrap around the wrist and base of the hand to start. [24] X Research source The pre-wrap should be snug but not too tight. Wrap the pre-wrap several times around the wrist area and up through the hand, passing between the thumb and index finger at least once. Continue back down to the wrist and forearm area, and wrap the pre-wrap several more times around the wrist and forearm."

[25] X Research source Anchors are pieces of tape that reach around the wrist with a few extra inches to secure the anchors. Begin securing the anchors in place by wrapping them around the pre-wrap starting closest to the elbow. Continue to place anchors over the pre-wrap along the area of the wrist and forearm. The section of pre-wrap that passes through the hand also needs to be anchored with a longer piece of tape that follows the same pattern as the pre-wrap."

[26] X Research source Unroll more as you need it from the original roll of athletic or medical tape. Follow the same pattern as that used by the pre-wrap, including passing through the area between the thumb and index finger several times.

      "title": "Add a fan.",
      "content": "Add a fan. A fan is the key part of the wrap that not only strengthens the wrap but provides stability in the position of the hand to prevent injury or re-injury. [27] X Research source While it is called a fan, in reality the shape is more of a crisscross, similar to the shape of a bow tie. Start with a piece of tape that is long enough to reach from the palm of the hand, across the wrist area, and extend about one third of the way up the forearm. Lightly place the piece of tape on a clean, flat surface. Follow that piece with another piece the same length, crossing in the middle of the first, and at a slight angle. Continue with another piece of tape done the same way, but along the opposite side of the original piece as the first, and at the same slight angle. You should have something shaped like a bow tie. Place one more piece of tape directly over the very first piece. This gives added strength to your fan."

      "title": "Tape your fan to your wrap.",
      "content": "Tape your fan to your wrap. Place one end of the fan in the palm of the hand area. Gently pull the hand into a slightly bent position to minimize its motion. [28] X Research source Secure the other end of the fan along the inside of the wrist area. The hand should not be bent too far inward. That would interfere with the ability to use the hand during the sporting activity. By securing the hand in a gently bent position, you are ensuring that the person can still use the hand, but it is taped securely to avoid hyperextension. Follow the taping of the fan with one final complete wrap of tape securing the fan in place."

[29] X Research source The fan is created in the same manner, creating a bow tie shape. The fan is then placed on the outer part of the hand, and the hand is gently pulled into a very slight angle that opens up the hand. Secure the other end of the fan, past the wrist area, and onto the taped part of the outside part of the forearm. Secure the fan in place in the same manner as preventing hyperextension, by wrapping the wrist again using a continued piece of tape. Be sure that all ends of the fan are securely taped down. You can also use a fan on the sides of the wrist to prevent it from bending too far to the left or right."

      "title": "Use a less restrictive wrap.",
      "content": "Use a less restrictive wrap. In some cases, only a light wrapping may be needed. Apply one strip of pre-wrap around your hand along the area of your knuckles, passing between your thumb and index finger. Apply a second strip of pre-wrap just below your wrist area, on the elbow side of your wrist. Apply two pieces in a crisscross fashion to the outside of your hand, attaching the ends from one side of the crisscross to the pre-wrap that passes through your thumb and index finger, and the other end attached to the pre-wrap piece along your forearm. Copy the crisscross piece, and attach it in the same manner, but to the inside of your hand and inside part of your wrist and forearm. Using the pre-wrap material, wrap the wrist by starting at the forearm location with several passes around the wrist area. Follow this with a crisscross, or X-like pattern. Pass the pre-wrap through your thumb and index finger area then around your hand along your knuckles, and back down to the wrist area. Continue wrapping to provide the crisscross pattern on the inside and outside of your hand area, securing each pass to the wrist and forearm area. Follow this with anchors using standard 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) athletic or medical tape. Start at the forearm area and progress toward your hand area. Follow the same pattern used with the pre-wrap. Once the anchors are in place, begin wrapping with a continuous section of tape, following the pattern used with the pre-wrap. Be sure all areas of pre-wrap are covered as well as all loose ends of the anchors."
