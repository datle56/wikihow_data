      "content": "A“work wife” is a coworker you have a close platonic bond with. The term can refer to someone of the opposite gender or the same gender, and it does not have any romantic or sexual connotations. [1] X Research source If you have a “work wife,” you likely trust each other deeply, support and confide in one another, and collaborate on work projects together. In other words, you have a true, genuine friendship. Common variations of the term include “work husband,” “work spouse,” and “office spouse.” Many people believe the term originated with a 1933 New York Times article, which stated that the British Prime Minister had used the term “office wife” to describe the perfect relationship between a prime minister and his secretary.

      "content": "The term “work wife” is commonly used in many American workplaces. In fact, in a 2020 study on this phenomenon, 63.3% of the study’s subjects reported that they either currently or previously had a “work spouse.” [3] X Research source With this in mind, it seems pretty clear that work spouse relationships are a common feature of modern office culture.

      "content": "It’s usually okay to refer to someone as your “work wife,” but ask first. These terms are commonly used in workplaces, and most people see them as a harmless way to describe a close platonic friendship with a coworker. [6] X Research source Some people, however, may be a bit uncomfortable with these terms and see them as having romantic connotations, even if this wasn’t your intention. [7] X Research source Because of this, it’s important to ask your coworker if they’re comfortable with being called your “work wife” or “work spouse.” If your coworker tells you that they would like you to refrain from using these terms, respect their wishes. If you’d like, you can ask if it’s okay to refer to them as your “work bestie” or “work best friend” instead."

      "content": "Having a work spouse can make work more enjoyable and productive. When you’re spending time with coworkers for 8 hours a day, 5 days per week, it makes a huge difference if you actually enjoy their company. In fact, research shows that having friends in the workplace boosts job satisfaction, improves performance, promotes mental wellness, and reduces the risk of burnout. [8] X Research source Because a “work spouse” or “work wife” is essentially a best friend at the office, the relationship can have these positive effects. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Calling someone your “work wife” can be a slippery slope. Even though this term is supposed to be purely platonic, it can sometimes turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you have any level of attraction to the coworker you’re calling your work spouse, you may start to think about them in a romantic way, or compare them to your actual spouse if you’re married. And, once you start seeing this person in a romantic light, an office affair can easily follow. [10] X Research source Because of this, it’s usually best to avoid calling someone your work spouse or work wife if you’re attracted to them or think you might develop romantic feelings for them."

To avoid uncomfortable situations, make sure to establish healthy boundaries , keep things professional, and abide by any rules that your HR department has in place. Avoid prying about personal topics if your coworker isn’t comfortable discussing them, and don’t flirt or make romantic comments (even if you’re joking). [14] X Research source If you feel you are getting a bit too close or the lines between the personal and the professional are blurring too much, try to take a step back from the relationship. [15] X Research source Consider using this time to work on building friendships with some of your other coworkers."

      "content": "Be careful not to exclude others. If you have a super close relationship with your work spouse, you may end up isolating yourselves from other coworkers. If this happens, your coworkers may feel excluded or assume that you aren’t interested in being friends with them. [16] X Research source If you notice that you’re giving most of your attention to your work spouse, make an extra effort to connect with your other coworkers, as well. For example, if you and your work spouse usually go out to lunch together, consider inviting a few more coworkers to join in. This will show your colleagues that you and your work spouse are not a closed unit, and that you’re interested in building positive relationships with the rest of the team, too. Having good connections with all your coworkers, rather than just one, makes for better camaraderie and teamwork in the workplace."
