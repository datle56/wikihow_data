      "title": "He’ll want to spend time with you and support your spiritual growth.",
      "content": "He’ll want to spend time with you and support your spiritual growth. Depending on your current religious circumstances, he may start slow—for instance, asking “Do you mind if I pray for you?” From there, he might invite you to a church social event (like a youth group outing or a movie night) and eventually to a religious service with him. [1] X Research source If you’re hesitant about doing church activities with him, don’t expect him to just give up. Instead, he’ll likely shift to a more long-range strategy, focusing on praying for you and building up a relationship in hopes that you’ll change your mind over time. If you want to show that you’re interested in him, beat him to the punch and invite him to a church event!"

      "title": "Understanding your beliefs helps him evaluate your compatibility.",
      "content": "Understanding your beliefs helps him evaluate your compatibility. This is a fairly normal part of getting to know someone better, but will likely carry even more importance because of his religious perspective. He’s looking for compatibility, of course, but also self-awareness—evidence that you’ve really put a lot of thought into what you believe. [2] X Research source This doesn’t mean you need to have all the answers—it’s a good sign if you have struggles and questions and an acceptance that there’s more for you to learn, feel, and understand. This shows you’re open to growth. Don’t let yourself feel like you’re being quizzed or interrogated. Just share your thoughts and feelings in a way that’s comfortable for you, and ask him questions of your own. Asking thoughtful questions is a clear sign of genuine interest. \"Players\" won't take the time to get to know your values and what's important to you.

      "title": "It’s important to him that you’re a good and caring person.",
      "content": "It’s important to him that you’re a good and caring person. This is something every guy wants to see, but probably even more so for a Christian. One of his main goals is to live by the “golden rule”—treating others like he wants to be treated—so he’ll definitely appreciate any signs that you aim to live by that same code. [4] X Research source If you come from a similar faith tradition as him, he’ll be looking for a compatibility between what you say you believe and how you live what you believe. Alternatively, if you come from a different (or no) religious background, he’ll likely want to see if you act in ways that are at least generally compatible with his beliefs."

      "title": "Doing this reveals a growing comfort level and amount of trust.",
      "content": "Doing this reveals a growing comfort level and amount of trust. He might share elements of his faith journey, possibly including difficulties and doubts he has faced (and might currently be facing). He might also start talking more about his future and subtly look for signs that you approve of it. After all, if he really likes you, he hopes you will also be a part of his future! [5] X Research source It’s also possible that he’s confiding in you because you’ve become a close friend—but not a romantic interest. So don’t rely on this alone as clear a sign that he likes you romantically. If your guy mentions marriage, then that's a great sign that he likes you a lot. Most people do envision marriage as part of their future, but only with someone they really care about. Reader Poll: We asked 545 wikiHow readers how they feel about marriage, and 72% said that they’d like to get married someday . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "If he likes you, it means he accepts you for who you are.",
      "content": "If he likes you, it means he accepts you for who you are. There certainly may be elements of your personality or lifestyle or beliefs that he hopes you’ll be inspired to change, possibly with his help. But he’s not looking for you to pretend to be someone you’re not. He likes the authentic you and wants you to achieve the highest version of yourself (according to his Christian understanding of your “highest version”). [6] X Research source [7] X Research source [v161898_b01]. 19 August 2021. The more comfortable you are being yourself and loving yourself , the more attractive you’ll be to guys. Even more importantly, being comfortable in your own skin is essential to your physical and emotional wellbeing. He's more likely to see you as a long-term partner when you confidently know your worth, share your vulnerabilities, have aspirations in life, possess great listening skills, and make quality time for the connection to grow.

      "title": "If you like him too, go ahead and let him know!",
      "content": "If you like him too, go ahead and let him know! As a religious guy, he might be turned off if you go after him in an aggressive or highly-sexualized manner. But that doesn’t mean he wants you to be completely passive, either. Drop little hints that you like him—similar to the hints he’s giving you—or just tell him directly. [9] X Research source It’s okay to drop hints and wait for him to ask you out, but it’s just as okay for you to take the initiative and ask him out. If you’re ready to ask him out, keep it simple and straightforward: “Jake, would you like to go out to lunch with me on Saturday?”"

      "title": "Trust your faith and feelings if you’re also a religious person.",
      "content": "Trust your faith and feelings if you’re also a religious person. No, the average matchmaker wouldn’t include “faith in God’s plan” as a sign that you’re meant to get together with a particular guy. But if you have that faith that this guy is meant to be a part of your life, trust that God will inspire him to have those same feelings for you. Some signs that a guy likes you (and that you like him) can come from a higher power! Pray about what you’re feeling and for guidance about how to approach things with the guy. Look for signs that he’s a genuinely Godly person—that he truly tries to explore his faith, live his faith, share his faith, and make amends when he falls short of his faith."

      "title": "His memory and eye for detail may seem to magically improve.",
      "content": "His memory and eye for detail may seem to magically improve. Well, that is, at least when it comes to details about the object of his interest—you. You might notice him saying things like the following: [10] X Research source “Hey, you changed your hairstyle a little. It looks very nice that way.” “Last week you mentioned you had a dental appointment that you weren’t looking forward to. How did that end up going?” “That’s a nice new cover you got for your Bible. Where did you find that one?”"

      "title": "He’ll praise things like your personality, compassion, and spirituality.",
      "content": "He’ll praise things like your personality, compassion, and spirituality. It’s natural and inevitable that a guy is going to want to flatter someone he likes with compliments about their beauty. But a Christian guy in particular may be more eager to compliment your religious faith and practices as well. [11] X Research source He might, for instance, use a physical compliment to lead into a deeper compliment about how you practice your faith: “You look great today—you’re glowing! It’s obvious how much fulfillment you get from teaching the second-grade Sunday school class.” If you’re interested in him, too, try giving compliments that similarly go beyond just his good looks: “You look cool in that K-LOVE t-shirt! I heard that you interned at the radio station last summer—that’s a really great way to share your faith.”"

      "title": "Watch for some extra “pep in his step” when you respond well.",
      "content": "Watch for some extra “pep in his step” when you respond well. When you laugh at one of his jokes, ask him for some advice, or just choose to walk up to him and say hello, does he get super enthused with a big smile? If so, it’s probably because every little bit of positive feedback you provide gives him hope that you’re interested in him. [12] X Research source Everyone likes getting positive feedback, so compare how he reacts to your positive feedback versus that from other people. If he seems happy when other people thank him but ecstatic when you do it, that’s a strong signal! To give effective positive feedback in the form of a compliment, be specific and direct: “Cal, you did a great job doing the Old Testament reading during yesterday’s service. You read with enthusiasm and did a great job pronouncing all those tricky names!”"

      "title": "Watch for him to take his desire to be a good person to the next level.",
      "content": "Watch for him to take his desire to be a good person to the next level. As a Christian guy, he’s almost certainly been taught to “help thy neighbor” without concern for recognition or rewards. But, if he likes you, it’s natural for him to do a bit more to show you kindness and to feel a bit of pride if you seem impressed. [13] X Research source He might not openly strive for your recognition like some other guys you may have come across, but you’ll probably notice an extra glint in his eye when you show any sign of being impressed."

      "title": "Religious or not, this is pretty much an every-guy strategy.",
      "content": "Religious or not, this is pretty much an every-guy strategy. He probably assumes that you—like most everyone—find a good sense of humor to be attractive, so he’ll definitely want to showcase his fun (and funny) side. He may not go into a full-on comedy routine, but he’ll likely be more jokey than usual when you’re around. [14] X Research source Especially if you come from outside his faith tradition, he may worry that you think a religious guy like him is serious all the time. In that case, he may try even harder to show off his funny side."

    {
      "title": "This is a universal human trait that shows interest.",
      "content": "This is a universal human trait that shows interest. Eye contact equals connection, so he’s naturally going to want to lock eyes with you. If he’s shy he might glance away pretty quickly, but he’ll be sure to look your way again soon! [15] X Research source We’re talking about friendly glances here, usually paired with a smile. Steer clear of a Christian guy—or any guy—who gives you an aggressive or creepy stare-down."
    },
    {
      "title": "He’ll want to focus and close in on you without causing worry.",
      "content": "He’ll want to focus and close in on you without causing worry. Observe his body language carefully, because it’s sure to reveal some “tells” that he may not even be aware of. Any of the following can be signs that a guy is interested in you: [16] X Research source He turns his body, from head to toe, directly towards you. He keeps his arms visible and to his sides in an “open” gesture. He removes obstacles between you, such as a bag that’s resting on the table. He leans in towards you, or subtly shuffles (if standing) or slides (if sitting) closer to you. He reaches out to touch you in a non-threatening, non-sexualized way, such as by lightly touching your forearm as you both laugh at a joke."

    {
      "title": "Even confident guys get nervous and worry about how they look.",
      "content": "Even confident guys get nervous and worry about how they look. You might, for example, notice him running his fingers through his hair or adjusting his shirt a lot. Such activity is both nervous fidgeting and an unconscious effort to “preen” himself so he looks as attractive to you as possible. [17] X Research source If you notice that he wears the best of his “Sunday best” outfits when you’re around, that’s another strong sign that he’s trying to look extra-good for you! While this isn’t true in all cases, a Christian guy may be more fidgety and nervous in this situation than the average guy. Why? He may put more pressure on himself to handle his attraction toward you in a respectful fashion."
