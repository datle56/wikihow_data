      "content": "The sign means aircraft flying over the road may be checking your speed. When you see a “Speed Limit Enforced by Aircraft” sign, there’s a chance that a small plane or helicopter is overhead and measuring your speed. If they determine that a vehicle is going too fast, then they can have another officer in a patrol car pull you over and give you a ticket. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Planes or helicopters measure vehicle speed using road markings.",
      "content": "Planes or helicopters measure vehicle speed using road markings. Areas monitored by aircraft have markings on the side of the road that are a set distance apart. When a vehicle passes one of the markings, an officer in the aircraft times how long the vehicle takes to reach the other mark. The officer then calculates how fast the vehicle is going. [2] X Research source Aircraft usually have special laser cameras that can help track speed, or they have a spotter with a stopwatch keeping an eye on the vehicle. In some areas, aircraft may fly above a vehicle to keep pace with it. If the aircraft is going faster than the posted speed limit, they know the vehicle below them is speeding too."

      "title": "The aircraft contacts ground patrol units so they can give out tickets.",
      "content": "The aircraft contacts ground patrol units so they can give out tickets. The officers in the aircraft will radio another officer on the ground about the type of car and where it’s located. When the officer finds the vehicle, they will pull the person over and issue them a speeding ticket."

      "content": "Aircraft might take pictures of the license plate and mail a ticket. Some aircraft are equipped with high-definition cameras that can zoom in on a passing license plate. If there’s not an officer on the ground, a ticket gets mailed to whoever owns the vehicle saying that the speed was captured by aircraft."

      "content": "Speed limits are enforced by aircraft, but not as frequently as before. Police departments still fly aircraft and check speed limits from time to time, but it’s too expensive for them to constantly do it. Plus, many other ways to monitor speed limits are cheaper and easier for police. Check our breakdown on other ways speed limits are enforced ."

      "content": "Many states still use aircraft to monitor speed. If you see a “Speed Limit Enforced by Aircraft” sign, then there’s always a (somewhat small) chance that your speed is being monitored from above. Some Reddit users have mentioned getting tickets in California, Florida, Colorado, and Wisconsin, but other states that use aircraft include: [3] X Research source Alabama Arkansas Connecticut Delaware Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nebraska New Hampshire New Mexico North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania South Dakota Washington"

      "content": "Some areas have stopped using aircraft to enforce speed limits completely. Because it’s more expensive to fly aircraft, many state police have cut back on using them. Some reports say that even though there are signs in places like Virginia and Maryland, they have not used aircraft since around 2012. [4] X Research source New York State Police have also mentioned that they still have aircraft but haven’t used them to monitor speed limits since 2004. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Follow the posted speed limit to be safe. Even though enforcing speed limits with aircraft isn’t as common anymore, there’s still a chance that your speed is being monitored. Check the speed limit signs and keep an eye on your speedometer while you’re driving so you don’t end up with a ticket. [6] X Research source Aircraft usually stay around an altitude 12,000–15,000 feet (3,700–4,600 m) so you’re not able to see them from the ground easily. Even if an aircraft isn’t monitoring your speed, driving the speed limit ensures that you stay safe and in control of your vehicle."

      "content": "LIDAR or radar sensors LIDAR lasers and radar guns are held by officers or placed on the side of the road. When the laser or radar is pointed at a vehicle, it measures how far the vehicle travels within a few seconds to calculate its speed. [7] X Research source LIDAR and radar sensors are usually not marked, but there are sometimes signs that say “Speed Limit Enforced by Radar.” They’re the most common on long, open roads where they get more accurate readings."

      "title": "Speed cameras",
      "content": "Speed cameras Speed cameras are placed along the side of the road and use radar or lasers to monitor speed. If they measure a vehicle moving 10 mph (16 km/h) over the speed limit, the camera takes a picture of the license plate and mails a ticket to the driver. [8] X Trustworthy Source State of New York Official website for the State of New York Go to source Some areas have signs saying “Photo enforced ahead” to warn drivers about speed cameras, but other areas may not post any warnings."

      "content": "Following a speeding driver An officer drives behind another vehicle and matches their speed. The officer’s speedometer is properly calibrated so they can judge how fast the vehicle in front of them is going. If they’re speeding, then the officer will issue a ticket. [9] X Research source Law enforcement may pace your vehicle without any posted warnings."

Check the amount you owe on the ticket and make sure you pay before the deadline. [10] X Research source Contact the court if you can’t afford a fine to ask if they’re able to lower the amount or extend the due date. If you ignore the ticket and don’t pay the fine, you may have to pay additional fees and the ticket could go on your record. [11] X Research source"

The exact process for contesting a speeding ticket varies by state and municipality, but follow the instructions listed on the ticket you were given. Typically, you can either contest the ticket through a written statement or by attending a court trial. [12] X Research source The law enforcement officers from the aircraft and the ground unit will give their statements to a judge to determine if they’ll reduce the charge or drop the ticket. Some points that can help you contest your ticket include: Does the aircraft have evidence that you were the vehicle being observed, like pictures or video? Did the aircraft have properly calibrated equipment that accurately measured your speed? Were there any clouds or poor weather when you were ticketed that could have obscured the aircraft’s view? Do your research and look up the specific violation written on your ticket so you know exactly what you’re charged for."

Many of the memes show a picture of the “Speed Limit Enforced by Aircraft” sign followed by a picture of a military plane or helicopter chasing them with funny captions like: “If that SUV goes 10 over the limit, we take him out.” “70 in a 55 zone? They’re toast!” “Tower, we have a northbound car going 15 over. Permission to strike?”"
