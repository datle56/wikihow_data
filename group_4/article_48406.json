It can be hard to control your emotions, especially when things get heated and your boyfriend yells at you. If you need to, mentally count to 10 before you respond to him. Try to stay composed and focus on de-escalating the situation. [3] X Research source If your boyfriend is being aggressive or cursing at you, that is absolutely not okay. You don’t deserve that kind of treatment. Try to stay calm so you can diffuse the situation and get away from him as soon as possible. [4] X Research source It might seem like smiling at him is a good idea, but if he's already angry and not thinking clearly, it may provoke him. People with anger issues may interpret a smile as mockery. It’s safer to keep your facial expression blank."

The calmer you are, the more chance you have of calming him down, too. [7] X Research source You might say something like: \"Jack, let's talk about this at a normal volume. We don't need to yell.\" \"Would you mind lowering your voice, Eric? I’m right here.\" \"I really want to solve this issue with you, but I can’t if you’re yelling at me.\""

I’ll be back in 15-20 minutes. Can we use that time to calm down and then circle back?\" If you feel scared or threatened, you don’t have to go back. It’s important to get yourself out of that situation as fast as possible. Always set a specific time limit for timeout; that way, your boyfriend knows that you're coming back.

If your boyfriend has never yelled at you before, it’s worth giving him the benefit of the doubt; he may be dealing with stress, grief, or pressure that you don't know about. It’s not okay to take it out on you, but it's something you can talk through together. Here are a few other things to consider before speaking to your boyfriend again: Is this the first time he’s yelled at you? What triggered the yelling? Is there an actual issue or did he fly off the handle for no reason? [15] X Research source Did he call you names , make demeaning comments, or threaten you? That's verbal abuse; you don’t deserve it and you don't have to put up with it. [16] X Research source Did he try to blame his yelling on you? This is another common tactic abusers use to manipulate their partners. [17] X Research source"

[20] X Research source You might say something like: \"I felt shocked and confused when you raised your voice at me earlier. You’ve never done that before. Will you talk to me about what upset you so much?\" \"I have a tough time thinking rationally when someone is yelling at me. Now that we’re both calm, please talk to me about why you’re so upset.\""

[21] X Research source If your boyfriend has never yelled at you before, he may be feeling insecure, overwhelmed, or afraid for some reason. [22] X Research source That's worth exploring with him. If he got angry and yelled at you because he wanted control over something and he didn’t get what he wanted, that’s not acceptable. [23] X Research source For example: If your boyfriend got upset because you’ve been partying a lot during the week, he may be worried you’ve met someone else or scared that you'll get hurt. If you put yourself in his shoes, you can see where he's coming from. If your boyfriend was upset because you spend more time with your friends than with him, he's trying to control you. When you put yourself in his shoes, his feelings don’t make much sense. [24] X Research source If he won’t admit he yelled at you or says you're overreacting, that’s gaslighting —another form of abuse. You don’t deserve that and it's not okay. [25] X Research source"

He was likely abused himself and probably needs some therapy to work through that. You can’t help him work through it or change him on your own, though. Breakups are tough, but if he can't control his temper, it’s the right thing to do for both of you (even if it hurts).
