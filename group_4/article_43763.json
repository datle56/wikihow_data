      "content": "Watching a few long movies can make time fly by. A plane ride is the perfect time to catch up on all of the films you’ve been dying to see but just haven’t had the time to sit down and watch. Well, now you’ll be sitting for a couple of hours at least, so start scrolling through the inflight entertainment options and see what your airline is offering. [1] X Research source Be sure to also download some movies onto your phone or laptop before you start your travels in case your plane’s selection is a bit lacking."

      "title": "Download some episodes before you board the plane.",
      "content": "Download some episodes before you board the plane. A long-haul flight is the perfect time to binge-watch one of your favorite TV series or start a new one. Many flights offer select shows on their inflight entertainment systems, but you may also want to download a few episodes before take-off to make sure you have plenty of material to watch. If you use a streaming service, such as Netflix, you can easily download episodes of your favorite shows while you still have WiFi or data."

      "title": "Bring a physical book or download an audiobook.",
      "content": "Bring a physical book or download an audiobook. Nothing helps time pass by like getting absorbed in a riveting mystery novel or a fantasy book with amazing worldbuilding. Be sure to pack a few books in your carry-on, or download some audiobooks to listen to. Another idea is to get the physical and audiobook versions of the same book so that you can flip between the two modes if your eyes get tired. [2] X Research source Another great idea is to read up on your destination if you plan on exploring the area. Pack a travel guidebook that introduces you to the history of your destination and some of the best tourist spots. Pack a few age-appropriate books for your kids if they’re coming along as well."

Whatever your interests or hobbies are, there’s sure to be a podcast for you to tune into during your flight. Do a bit of research before your departure and be sure to download multiple podcast episodes so you have lots of listening content for your flight. [3] X Research source Some podcast genres include things like true crime, business, education, politics, mental health, sports, music, and technology. There are also plenty of kid-friendly podcasts that revolve around storytelling or education.

      "content": "Create a playlist of your favorite songs to vibe to. Before you board the plane, spend some time curating the perfect playlist that’ll set the mood for your trip. Either purchase music to put on your phone, or download music to listen to offline on music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. If you’re traveling with friends or family, a fun idea is to create a playlist together where you can all contribute songs that reflect your unique music tastes."

      "content": "Kill some time by focusing on something like a crossword puzzle. When you’re super focused on a task, time will just fly by. Engage your brain by doing some challenging puzzles. For example, play sudoku, do a word search or word jumble, or buy a book of fun riddles to solve. [4] X Research source Do a physical puzzle like a Rubik’s cube or a small jigsaw puzzle so that you can exercise both your mind and keep your hands busy."

[5] X Research source Just keep in mind that the plane ride can be a bit bumpy at times, which might present you with a fun challenge if you’re attempting to draw or color.

      "content": "Journal or do some creative writing to pass the time. Either bring a notebook and pen with you or open up a blank note on your phone and start writing. Write a journal entry about your travels so far and everything you’re looking forward to. Or, if you enjoy creative writing, write a short story and let your imagination guide the way. If you have kids, have them write about what they want to do during their trip or ask them to make up a story and share it with you."

      "content": "Play something like Solitaire by yourself or play with a friend. Playing Solitaire can keep you entertained for literal hours, and there are plenty of variations of this classic game you can try out to keep yourself busy. If you have a travel partner (or partners) sitting next to you, play a game like Go Fish, Gin Rummy, or Blackjack (betting is optional) to pass the time. Card games like Crazy Eights , War , and UNO are easy (but just as fun) options for kids."

      "content": "Purchase a travel-sized board game to pack in your carry-on. Game creators know how boring it can be to sit on a plane for hours on end, so they’ve taken matters into their own hands and created perfect travel-sized games for you and others to play. Games like chess , Connect Four, Sorry! , and Trouble all come in mini versions that will fit perfectly in your carry-on luggage. Don’t forget to also check your flight’s inflight entertainment options to see what digital games they have available.

      "content": "Download games and apps that don’t require WiFi. Your phone will likely become your best friend (if it hasn’t already) during a long flight. Aside from using it to watch shows or read, be sure to download some fun games and apps you can play while you’re up in the sky. Just make sure that you can easily play them while you’re phone’s in airplane mode. Before your flight, test out your apps to see which ones still run in airplane mode. Be sure to download some kid-friendly games if you’re traveling with children."

      "content": "Keep yourself entertained with fun conversation games. If you happen to be traveling with a friend, partner, or family member, make the time go by faster by playing some fun conversation games like 20 Questions, Truth or Dare, or Would You Rather. Not only can you play these games for literal hours, but you might learn some new and hilarious things about your travel partner. Here are some fun questions to ask your travel buddy to start an interesting conversation: If you could learn one skill instantly, what would it be? What’s a concept you just can’t understand no matter how hard you try? Would you rather travel to the past or the future? What song is your go-to for karaoke? What’s something that never fails to make you laugh?"

      "content": "Strike up a conversation with the people next to you. If you’re feeling in the mood and your seat neighbor looks like they wouldn’t mind chatting for a bit, introduce yourself and see if you can make a new friend during your flight. There’s no better place to meet people from all across the country (or world) than on a plane. Ask them things like where they’re from or where they’re headed to get the ball rolling. [6] X Research source Of course, be mindful and considerate if it seems like the person next to you isn’t really up for having a conversation. For some, plane rides are the perfect time to get in some much-needed “me” time."

      "content": "Capture the scenery outside your window. Be sure to snap lots of photos during takeoff since you’ll be able to see the Earth from a whole new perspective. As you’re flying, take pictures of cool cloud formations and pretty sunrises or sunsets if you’re lucky enough to see them. And, of course, make sure to document when you’ve arrived at your destination. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Check your social media or surf the internet.",
      "content": "Check your social media or surf the internet. Just because you’ll be sitting on a plane for a few hours doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be totally off the grid. If your flight has an option to purchase WiFi, take that into consideration if you think you’ll be more entertained with access to the Internet. WiFi will also allow you to stream music, movies, shows, and play online games. [8] X Research source WiFi may only be offered on select flights on certain airlines. Be sure to check the inflight options for your specific flight before departure day so you know what will be available."

      "content": "Use your laptop to be productive and catch up on work. While it may not be the most exciting option for activities to do on a long flight, there’s no denying that so much free time presents a great opportunity to be a bit productive. Work on that project that’s due soon, write that report you’ve been putting off, or just organize your work itinerary for the coming weeks. [10] X Research source If you’re traveling for a business trip, this is the perfect way to get ahead and give yourself time to relax and explore when you land. Just remember that you likely won’t have (free) WiFi on the plane, so plan to do things that don’t require Internet usage. You may also use this time to make a to-do list of things you need to get done or create a calendar to lay out all the tasks you have left in a neat, tidy way."

Another option is to download an educational podcast or audiobook to learn something new, such as one about history, science, or technology."

      "content": "Learn basic vocabulary in the language used where you’re traveling. If you happen to be traveling to a country whose primary language is different from your own, use your flight as an opportunity to study up on the basic greetings and vocab that’ll make it easier to get around once you land. Purchase a pocket dictionary in your target language that can teach you the basics. Make sure to learn simple phrases such as: Hello/Goodbye. Where is (location)? Can I please have (item)? Please/Thank you. My name is (name). What’s your name? I’m sorry."

If you’re someone who likes to plan out the nitty gritty details of their trip (and haven’t done so yet), your flight is the perfect time to get a jumpstart on your itinerary. Consult a travel book and pick out museums, restaurants, shops, cafes, and tourist attractions you want to see. If you’re traveling with kids, get them involved and ask them about where they want to go and what they want to see. Another idea is to plan out your travel budget if that’s something you want to keep track of."

      "content": "Delete or edit photos on your phone. We’ve all been there—you have thousands upon thousands of photos in your camera roll and your storage is running low. Well, a long flight is just what you may have needed to sit down and go through your photos. Delete the ones you don’t really care for, organize the ones you love into folders, and edit the ones you want to post to your social media. You can get a lot done in a couple of hours. Feel free to also go through and organize the rest of your phone by deleting apps, music, and movies you don’t want anymore."

If you think you might get hungry during your trip, be sure to pack some of your favorite snacks to munch on, especially if you don’t get inflight meals. Avoid scarfing your food down and really savor it. It might not be a gourmet meal, but eating slowly can help pass some time and ensure you really get the most out of your food. [11] X Research source Meal prepping is also a great idea if you have kids who are a bit more picky with their food. Make sure you’re also staying hydrated . Purchase a water bottle in the terminal or ask your flight attendant for a cup of water to make sure you never get too thirsty."

      "title": "Get up and stretch your legs every 2 hours.",
      "content": "Get up and stretch your legs every 2 hours. After a while, sitting can get pretty uncomfortable. Sitting for long periods of time can also, in some cases, contribute to deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), which is when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins in your body. To prevent any discomfort, make an effort to get up every 2 hours or so and take a trip to the restroom, walk up and down the aisle, or just stand for a bit. [12] X Research source Always make sure that the fasten seatbelt sign is off before you unbuckle your seatbelt and get up."

      "title": "Do some breathing exercises",
      "content": "Do some breathing exercises to quiet your mind. If you don’t really feel like reading or watching something, meditating is a great way to get yourself to relax. Traveling can definitely be stressful, so taking some time to just clear your mind may be much needed. [13] X Research source An example of a deep breathing exercise is called pursed lip breathing. Sit with your neck and shoulder relaxed, then breath in through your nose for 2 counts keeping your mouth shut. Then, purse your lips as though you’re about to whistle, and exhale through your mouth for 4 counts."

      "title": "Prevent stiff joints and muscles by doing some yoga poses in your seat.",
      "content": "Prevent stiff joints and muscles by doing some yoga poses in your seat. Keep your body loose and relaxed so that you can be at maximum comfort throughout your flight. Some poses to try include: [14] X Research source Seated spinal twist: Place your right hand on your left knee and your left hand on your seat. Twist your upper body slowly to your left and look over your left shoulder. Hold the pose for a few seconds, come back to the center, then repeat on the right side. Seated cat pose: Sit on the edge of your seat and place your hands on your thighs. Push your pelvis and abdomen forward and allow your back to arch. Then, curl inwards, arch your spine outwards, and tuck your chin into your chest. Back-release pose: Sit upright and cross your right ankle over your left knee, leaving your left foot on the ground. Flex your right foot, breathe deeply, and focus on the stretch in your lower back. Hold this for 8-10 deep breaths and repeat on the other side."

      "title": "Get some rest to kill time or adjust to a new time zone.",
      "content": "Get some rest to kill time or adjust to a new time zone. If you’re traveling to a place in a different time zone, sleeping on the plane might be a good idea to help yourself get adjusted to the time change. Otherwise, sleeping is just a great way to knock out an hour or two of your flight. Even better, if you’re on an overnight flight, the lights in the cabin will likely dim so that everyone can get some shut-eye. [15] X Research source If the plane doesn’t dim the lights, be sure to pack a sleeping mask to block out the brightness. The inside of a plane can get a bit noisy, so bring some earplugs if you need the quiet to sleep."
