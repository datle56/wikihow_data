      "content": "Apply aloe vera gel gently with your fingertips. To get the full benefit of aloe vera gel on your face, dab it lightly. There's no need to deeply massage it into your face. If the gel is absorbed too deeply, it could have the opposite effect and cause your face to dry out. [2] X Research source Only use a thin layer of the gel. There's no need to slather it on. An extra thick layer won't provide any added benefits. For best results, leave the aloe vera gel on your face for about 10 minutes, then rinse your face with cool water and pat dry. Pure aloe vera gel may have a drying effect if you leave it on your skin for too long."

To make this scrub, pour a small amount of brown sugar into the palm of your hand. Add aloe vera gel into all of the sugar is well-moistened.

      "title": "Use aloe vera gel in moderation to get the most benefit.",
      "content": "Use aloe vera gel in moderation to get the most benefit. Aloe vera gel can help moisturize your skin and improve your skin's overall tone. However, because the enzymes in the gel act as exfoliators, frequent use can actually dry out your skin. Skin produces oil when it gets too dry. If you use aloe vera gel too frequently, you can send your oil production into overdrive. This can lead to clogged pores, inflammation, and acne breakouts. If you're just starting to use aloe vera gel on your skin, rinse it off immediately or leave it on for no longer than 10 minutes."

[4] X Research source Because both honey and cinnamon have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties similar to aloe vera, the mask may have increased benefits compared to using aloe vera gel alone."

      "content": "Combine aloe vera gel with tea tree oil to increase acne-fighting benefits. Mix 6 to 12 drops of tea tree oil for every 15 millilitres (0.51 fl oz) of aloe vera gel. Start with 6 drops, and gradually increase as long as the mixture doesn't cause redness or irritation. Use this mixture as a spot treatment after washing and drying your face to heal smaller pimples. You can buy tea tree oil online or in a local health and beauty store. The amount of tea tree oil you can use depends on how diluted the tea tree oil is that you buy. Store any unused mixture in an amber-colored, air-tight glass container. Keep the container in a cool, dark place. If you spread it over your entire face, the treatment may help prevent new pimples from forming. However, you shouldn't use it as a substitute for other treatments without first consulting a dermatologist. Please be careful not to swallow the mixture - tea tree oil can have severe negative effects when swallowed. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Choose the correct aloe species. There are many different species of aloe plants, only one of which is called aloe vera . Other species are frequently grown as ornamentals because they are relatively easy to care for. However, you can only harvest aloe vera gel from an aloe vera plant, not from any of the other varieties. In a nursery, check the tag to determine the species of the plant. [8] X Research source True aloe vera plants are not particularly ornamental compared to other aloe plants, and seldom bloom when housed indoors. An aloe vera plant has thin leaves that are pale green and heavily spotted."

      "title": "Use cactus soil potting mix in a medium to large planter.",
      "content": "Use cactus soil potting mix in a medium to large planter. A medium or large planter will give your aloe vera plant enough room to grow since they like to spread out. Choose a planter with good drainage so the soil will stay appropriately dry. Look for a planter with a single large hole in the bottom to drain moisture. If there is standing water in the planter, your aloe vera won't grow."

      "title": "Place your plant where it will get plenty of light.",
      "content": "Place your plant where it will get plenty of light. Aloe vera plants can be tricky about sunlight. While they need plenty of sun, if they get too much, they'll dry out. Continual indirect sunlight typically provides ideal growing conditions. In the northern hemisphere, place an indoor plant in a window that faces either south or west. If the leaves of your aloe vera turn dry and brittle, this may be a sign that the plant is getting too much direct sunlight. Try relocating it and see if the plant's health improves."

      "title": "Avoid overwatering your plant to keep it healthy.",
      "content": "Avoid overwatering your plant to keep it healthy . The potting soil should be damp to the touch, but not wet. Examine the leaves of your plant to determine if it's getting enough water. As long as the leaves are cool and moist to the touch, your aloe vera is getting enough water. Generally, you shouldn't water your aloe vera until the soil actually feels dry to the touch. These plants typically don't need to be watered more than once a week. During colder months, they don't need as much water. If your aloe vera leaves are dry and brittle, consider how much sunlight the plant is getting before you give it more water â€“ especially if the soil is still moist. Too much sunlight can cause the leaves to dry out."

      "content": "Cut thick, long leaves from the bottom of the plant. Using a sharp, clean knife or pair of scissors, snip off the leaves as close to the trunk of the plant as possible. Thicker leaves will have more aloe vera gel inside them. [9] X Research source Make sure that you only use healthy leaves! [10] X Expert Source Ritu Thakur, MA Natural Health Care Professional Expert Interview. 25 July 2019. Do not attempt to harvest aloe vera gel from a plant that has dry, brittle leaves. Relocate the plant and wait until it has regained its health. You can harvest aloe vera gel from a healthy plant once every 6 to 8 weeks by removing 3 to 4 leaves from the plant.

      "content": "Set the leaves upright to let them drain. Place the leaves with the cut side down in a glass or small bowl. After a few minutes, a red or yellowish liquid will begin to drain from the leaves. Allow the leaves to drain for 10 to 15 minutes. [12] X Research source This liquid is toxic and can cause stomach pain if ingested. Even if you're only planning on using the aloe vera gel topically on your face, it's still a good idea to let this liquid drain."

      "content": "Peel the outer layer of the aloe leaf. Using a clean, sharp knife, carefully slice away the spiky edges of the leaf. Then cut and lift the green part of the leaf away from the clear gel inside. It may take some practice, but you should be able to peel it away in a clean, smooth strip. Wash your hands before you begin this process. Work on a clean cutting surface to prevent contamination of your aloe vera gel."

Go slowly, taking care not to knick into the leaf as you go. With practice, you may be able to harvest all the gel from a leaf in a smooth strip. However, it isn't necessary for the gel to be in a single piece. Multiple pieces work just as well and may be easier to handle."

      "content": "Refrigerate unused gel promptly. You can use harvested aloe vera gel on your face immediately. If you're harvesting it for later use, refrigerate it in an air-tight container.
