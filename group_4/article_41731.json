The larynx contains muscles called “vocal folds” that are covered by a mucous membrane. For your vocal folds to vibrate properly and produce a clear voice, you must keep the mucous membrane hydrated. Systemic hydration means maintaining healthy hydration levels throughout the tissues of the body. Long-term hydration is far more important than short-term hydration, so chugging water the day before a performance will not help you Drink, at minimum, 8 glasses of pure water — not tea, not soft drinks — every day.

This will ensure consistent external hydration. Chew gum and suck on hard candies to keep our salivary glands engaged. Swallow saliva from time to time to clean out your throat without clearing it, which is bad for your vocal cords. Maintain a humid environment. If you live in a dry climate, you can purchase a personal steam inhaler at a pharmacy or hold a hot wet towel over your mouth and nose for a few minutes."

      "content": "Rest your voice consistently. You may love singing, but if you want to do it well, you need to take breaks from time to time. Just as athletes rest muscle groups for a day before working them out again, you need to rest the muscles that produce your voice to avoid injuring them through overwork. If you practice or perform three days in a row, take one day off. If you practice or perform five days in a row, take two days off. Avoid speaking unnecessarily on a day-to-day basis if you have a rigorous singing schedule."

      "content": "Don’t smoke. Inhaling any kind of smoke, whether first or second-hand, dries out the vocal folds. Smoking can also decrease saliva production, which is important for topical hydration, and increase acid reflux, which can irritate throat tissues. [4] X Research source The most important effects, though, are decreased lung capacity and function and increased coughing."

      "content": "Understand how breathing works. [8] X Research source The most important muscle to be aware of is your diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle that stretches across the bottom of the rib cage. Contracting the diaphragm (inhaling) pushes down on the stomach and intestines to make room for air, and lowers air pressure in your chest, allowing you to take air into your lungs. [9] X Research source To exhale, you can simply relax your diaphragm, which allows the air to leave your chest cavity at a natural rate, or you keep your diaphragm engaged against the stomach and intestines to control the rate of exhalation. The latter is very important for singing."

      "title": "Practice pulling your breath down into your body.",
      "content": "Practice pulling your breath down into your body. Many people take very shallow breaths that will not help you breathe, so you need to learn how to breathe in a way that makes best use of your lung capabilities. Inhale slowly and deeply, feeling the air move downward through your mouth and throat and into your body. Imagine that the air is very heavy. Visualize pushing it all the way down below your belly button before letting yourself exhale. As you go through repetitions, inhale more quickly. Continue to imagine the air being heavy and pushing it down into your stomach. Feel how your abdomen and lower back expand. Place one hand on your chest, and the other on your stomach. When you inhale, make sure the hand on your stomach moves more than the one on your chest — you should be pulling air down deep into your body, not shallowly into your chest."

After inhaling deeply and pulling the air down into your body, try controlling how long you can keep the air in your body without growing uncomfortable. Try to increase the length of time. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, making sure to draw your breath down into your abdomen like in the previous exercise. Try to hold it for a count of seven, then exhale. Repeat several times. Over time, try to increase the length of time you can hold your breath comfortably."

      "content": "Do exhalation exercises. Exhalation exercises are important for holding steady notes; without them, your voice might waver when you sing. Inhale deeply through your mouth, pushing the air deep into your abdomen. Instead of letting the air rush out at its own natural rate, keep your diaphragm engaged so you can control the rate of exhalation. Take eight seconds to expel all the air from your chest. Once you’ve exhaled, contract your abdominal muscles to push any remaining air from your lungs. One of the most important parts of improving our breathing is making sure we exhale completely."

You wouldn’t start running before you stretched out, because you could strain and injure the muscles in your leg; the same principle applies to the muscles involved with singing. Before you put your vocal cords through the stress of some serious singing, you want to make sure you warm up your voice so you don’t strain it. [12] X Expert Source Patrick Muñoz Voice & Speech Coach Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Humming is a good way to ease into full-throated singing. Before you begin singing, practice some scales in a hum. Lip trilling warms up the muscles involved with exhalation to prepare them for the controlled breathing required by singing. Keeping your lips pressed together, push air through them to create the sound we associate with being cold: brrrrrrrrr!. [13] X Research source Move through your scales in this manner."

This will help you gain control of your voice, stay on target with pitch, and move more easily between both adjacent and disparate notes.
