      "content": "Wrap a vertical section of your hair around a curling iron or wand. Spritz heat-protectant spray on your hair and brush it thoroughly to distribute the product. Starting at the back of your head, grab about a 1 or 2 in (2.5 or 5.1 cm) section of your hair. Take a hot curling iron or wand and hold it vertically. Then, wrap the section of hair around the wand or curling iron barrel. Be really careful not to burn yourself. [1] X Research source Curling irons have a curved clip that holds the hair against the barrel while a curling wand is just the barrel. It's totally fine to use whichever one you have or are more comfortable using. You can use any size curling wand or iron. Just keep in mind that a larger wand or barrel makes bigger, looser waves while a barrel that's 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less makes smaller, tighter waves."

      "content": "Hold the iron in place for 10-15 seconds before curling the next section. Although you could iron the hair for longer, this makes a tighter curl but you're going for a looser wave so shorter is better! Once you've finished a section, grab another segment of hair that's next to the one you just finished. Keep working from the back of your head to both sides of your head. [2] X Research source If you prefer working from the sides of your head to the back, go for it! It's totally a matter of preference. Try to leave the bottom 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of hair uncurled so it makes a more natural look."

      "content": "Spritz your hair with texturizing spray and scrunch it to enhance the look. Choose a texturizing sea salt spray to really embrace the beachy vibe and spritz it all over your hair. Then, take your fingers and scrunch the bottom of your hair toward your scalp. This works the product into your hair to give you a little volume. It also makes gives the style a slightly lived-in messy look. [3] X Research source If you want to set the look, you can finish with a texturizing hairspray, too. This keeps flyaways down although having loose, messy strands totally works with the beachy vibe."

      "title": "Part your hair to the side and apply heat-protectant.",
      "content": "Part your hair to the side and apply heat-protectant. You probably already have a good idea of which side your hair tends to part on. If you're not sure, flip your head to the side you want to part it on and use your fingers to tease it until it parts on its own. For a smoother part, comb your hair once you've parted it. [4] X Research source Then, spray heat-protectant product all over your hair and brush it in so the product coats your hair completely. [5] X Research source Going for old-Hollywood glam? Tuck the hair that's closest to your part behind your ear."

      "content": "Wrap a 2 in (5.1 cm) segment of hair around a hot curling wand. If you've got long hair, you may want to clip it up and away from the bottom when you start. Grab a wide segment of hair near your neckline and wrap it around a hot curling wand that's at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Hold the hair in place for about 10 seconds. [6] X Research source You can use a curling iron that clips the hair in place, too. Just use whichever tool you're more comfortable with. Want larger, softer waves? Use a curling wand with a barrel that's 1 1 ‚ÅÑ 4 inches (3.2 cm) or larger."

      "title": "Curl the rest of your hair in large segments.",
      "content": "Curl the rest of your hair in large segments. A lot of people find it easier to curl the hair along your neckline before working up toward the top of your hair. Don't forget to curl the hair at the back of your head, too! Then, carefully run a brush through your hair to soften the curls into dramatic waves. [7] X Research source If you want to set the look, feel free to use hairspray. This also smooths down flyaways. If you've got fine hair, spritz texturizing spray into it before you brush your hair. This gives your hair a little extra oomph."

      "content": "Apply curl cream to your wet hair. Start with damp hair that's not dripping wet and squeeze or scoop a dollop of curl cream onto your palm. Rub it between your hands and run your hands through your hair to distribute the product. [8] X Research source Curl cream is a styling product that reduces frizz and softens your waves or curls. Read the product labels to find one that delivers what you're looking for whether it's a bouncy hold or protection from frizz. You can find tons of curl cream options at beauty supply stores, grocery stores, or online."

      "content": "Scrunch your wavy hair and bangs with your fingers. Brush your bangs down with your fingers or a comb and part the rest of your hair as you usually do. Then, take wet hands and scrunch your damp hair from the bottom toward your scalp. Do this all over to help your hair and scrunch your bangs to get some wavy texture. [9] X Research source If you're worried that you're breaking up the waves or curls too much, spritz your hands with more water or hold them until the sink for a second."

      "content": "Fit your blow dryer with a diffuser and dry your hair using low heat. Turn the hairdryer on to the lowest heat setting and flip your head upside down. Gather a section of hair in the diffuser and hold it in place until it's dry. Repeat this till you've dried all over your hair and you're left with soft waves. [10] X Research source To diffuse your bangs, keep your head up but tilt your head forward. Cup your bangs in the diffuser and hold them in place for a few seconds so they dry wavy. In a hurry or just don't want to use a hairdryer? No problem! Wavy hair also looks great when you let it air dry and it's less prone to frizz."

      "title": "Clip your damp hair into 3 sections.",
      "content": "Clip your damp hair into 3 sections. If you've just washed your hair, towel dry it so it's not dripping wet, but it's not completely dry either. Run your fingers or a comb through your hair to detangle it. Then, section off the bottom half of your hair with clips and divide the top section into 2 equal segments. [11] X Research source It's completely fine to section your hair into more segments, especially if it's really thick. This way, you don't miss any spots when you're straightening. If you've got a pixie cut, you can still divide the hair on the top of your head into sections."

      "title": "Apply oil or heat-protectant spray to each segment as you straighten.",
      "content": "Apply oil or heat-protectant spray to each segment as you straighten. The heat from a flat iron can really dry out your wavy hair and make it frizzy. To moisturize your hair and protect it from damage, rub a little oil like olive oil or argan oil through your damp hair or spray a heat-protectant product onto each segment as you work. [12] X Research source Check the ingredient label on heat-protectant sprays and choose one that doesn't contain alcohol, which can dry out your hair."

      "title": "Run a flat iron through small sections of your hair until it's smooth.",
      "content": "Run a flat iron through small sections of your hair until it's smooth. Take a 2 inches (5.1 cm) horizontal segment of hair from the bottom portion of your hand and clamp it in between a hot flat iron. Try to start as close to your roots as possible without burning your scalp. Then, slowly pull the flat iron down toward the end of your hair. Do this a few times for each segment or until your hair is smooth. [13] X Research source It's usually easiest to straighten the hair around your neck before you work up toward the top of your hair. Unclip your hair as you go. Unfortunately, wavy hair that's been straightened can become frizzy. To prevent this and enjoy shiny, smooth hair, squeeze a few drops of hair serum onto your palm and rub it between your hands. Then, work your hands through your hair, taking care to avoid the scalp. [14] X Research source Look for ingredients like mallow extract, pantothenic acid, and phytantriol. These help smooth your hair and reduce flyaways."

      "content": "Try an inverted bob for a low-maintenance look. This is a good haircut for people with thick, wavy hair that tends to puff out into a triangle. By cutting most of the weight from the back of your head, this haircut styles like a dream and grows out easily. [15] X Research source If you've got thin wavy hair, ask your stylist to do choppy layers to add some texture."
