      "content": "Whimpering is a series of small, weak sounds. The most common use of whimpering is a dog or puppy. Whimpering is similar to a cry but shortened to tiny bursts. Animals typically make this high-pitched whining sound when they’re unhappy or in pain. [1] X Research source For example, a puppy may whimper at you while you’re eating when they want some of your food. Similarly, a dog might whimper if they’ve hurt their paw and you try to touch it. “Whimper” can also be a synonym for “whine.” If someone “whimpers” something, they’re talking in a high-pitched, whiny tone. For instance: He rolled his eyes and whimpered through tears, “I don’t care.” [2] X Research source"

      "content": "In music, whimpering is a vocal exercise. Many musicians or singers will “whimper” to warm up their voice before they sing. Vocal coaches recommend whimpering or crying like a dog to engage the vocal muscles and find tone. Specifically, whimpering allows a singer to work through the passaggio, or the transition space between vocal ranges, helping them use their chest, mixed, and head voices. [3] X Research source For instance, a singer may start whimpering in their comfort range (say around B flat). Then, they can take the pitch of the whimper up or down a higher or lower scale"

If you feel strained while doing this, you’re going too high. [4] X Research source You’ll likely feel a vibration toward the back of your throat—this means you’re doing it right! If you’re not sure if you’re making the right sound, look up a video of a puppy whimpering online. This can give you an idea of how high or low the hum should be. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Fade the hum with a low-pitched note. After you make a high-pitched noise, bring the hum down to a lower octave. Think of it this way: the less air in your chest, the lower the sound. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Whimpering can be flirtatious. Partners or lovers may whimper to one another to capture each other’s attention. Maybe they’re feeling frisky or simply want to cuddle.
