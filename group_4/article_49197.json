      "title": "Choose an essay style and topic if you haven’t already been assigned one.",
      "content": "Choose an essay style and topic if you haven’t already been assigned one. Check the specific criteria for your essay as provided by your teacher. Your teacher may have already told you what type of essay you need to write, as well as what topics you’re able to choose from. Once you come up with a topic and essay format, make sure you know the required length and deadline for your assignment and go to your teacher with any outstanding questions. While most high school essays follow a similar format, different requirements are needed for different types of essays —such as a persuasive, expository, narrative, or descriptive essay. [1] X Research source If you need help coming up with a topic , brainstorm or search for subjects related to your assignment’s focus."

      "title": "Do preliminary research on your essay’s topic.",
      "content": "Do preliminary research on your essay’s topic. Look through primary and secondary sources that are related to your chosen topic. Take notes and look for connections between the different pieces of information that you find. Organize and save this information so you can revisit it once you start writing your five-paragraph essay .

    {
      "title": "Create an arguable thesis statement for your essay.",
      "content": "Create an arguable thesis statement for your essay. The thesis statement summarizes the main idea or argument of your essay, and it’s needed to both guide your writing and help the reader understand your essay. Use the research and knowledge you have on your topic to come up with a thesis statement. Write the thesis in one clear and concise sentence, and make sure your point is arguable and not just a general thought or idea. [3] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source For example, the statement “Elephants are used to perform in circuses” does not offer an arguable point—this statement just presents a fact. Instead, you may try a thesis statement like “Elephants should not be kept in the circus since they are mistreated.” Since people may reasonably agree or disagree with this statement, you’ll be able to find supporting arguments for and against it to use in your essay. Keep in mind that some types of essay writing may not require an argument, such as a narrative essay. However, the standard high school essay structure typically requires a thesis statement."

      "title": "Make an outline for the paragraphs in your essay.",
      "content": "Make an outline for the paragraphs in your essay. Write an outline to plan out the overall structure and content of your essay. Your specific outline will depend on the type of essay that you’re writing, but most high school essays include a five-paragraph structure with an introductory paragraph, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. An essay outline that fits this general format might look something like this: [4] X Research source Introduction Paragraph Hook: Thesis Statement: Body Paragraph 1 Topic Sentence: Supporting Evidence #1: Supporting Evidence #2: Supporting Evidence #3: Body Paragraph 2 Topic Sentence: Supporting Evidence #1: Supporting Evidence #2: Supporting Evidence #3: Body Paragraph 3 Topic Sentence: Supporting Evidence #1: Supporting Evidence #2: Supporting Evidence #3: Conclusion"

      "title": "Find reliable sources that support your argument.",
      "content": "Find reliable sources that support your argument. Avoid using personal blogs or websites that are biased. Instead, look for scholarly articles, lab research, or general news sources for the most accurate information. Find books published by large publishers that support your arguments as well. [5] X Research source Talk to your school’s librarian for direction on specific books or databases you could use to find your information. Many schools offer access to online databases like EBSCO or JSTOR where you can find reliable information. If you need help, consult with your teacher. Wikipedia is a great starting place for your research, but it can be edited by anyone in the world, so it’s not a reliable source. Instead, look at a related Wikipedia article’s references to find the sites where the information really came from. Use Google Scholar if you want to find peer-reviewed scholarly articles for your sources. Make sure to consider the author’s qualifications when determining source credibility . If a source does not include the author’s name, then it might not be a good option."

      "title": "Write a hook that contains a relevant fact, quote, or question.",
      "content": "Write a hook that contains a relevant fact, quote, or question. An essay’s “hook” or “attention getter” draws readers in and gets them invested in your topic. Use a shocking statistic, quote, or hypothetical question in the first sentence of your intro to get the reader thinking about your subject. Then, use the attention getter to segue into the main topic of your essay. [6] X Research source However, make sure that your hook is both accurate and related to the subject of your essay. Example : Gender inequality has been an inescapable fact of life for as long as history can remember."

      "title": "Provide background and context for your topic.",
      "content": "Provide background and context for your topic. In the next couple sentences of the introduction, give the reader context that they need in order to understand your essay’s argument. Depending on the subject and style of your essay, this may involve providing background knowledge, defining important academic terms, or explaining any controversy or debate that surrounds your subject. This section should only be 2-3 sentences long—you’ll elaborate in the body paragraphs of your essay. Example: Women have been seen as inferior, and have been treated as such, for centuries. But to respond to such sexist ideas and treatment, the modern feminist movement arose. Feminism has become a prevalent theme in all forms of art, including literature. Feminist criticism examines works of literature in order to analyze their portrayal of the sexes."

      "title": "Introduce your thesis in one sentence.",
      "content": "Introduce your thesis in one sentence. Write your thesis statement in a clear and concise way at the end of your introduction—typically the last or second-to-last sentence. Make sure that your thesis statement clearly expresses your point of view to the reader and connects to all major points in your essay. [7] X Research source Example: In John Steinbeck’s short story “The Chrysanthemums,” the lens of feminist criticism provides insight into how the issue of gender inequality affects the main protagonist, Elisa Allen."

      "title": "For a longer essay, include an overview of your essay at the end of the intro.",
      "content": "For a longer essay, include an overview of your essay at the end of the intro. End the introduction by briefly describing what information you’re providing through the essay to support your thesis. You might mention the topic sentences of each of your body paragraphs and how they’ll guide the reader to your conclusion. [8] X Research source Mapping out this structure for the reader helps them know exactly what you’re discussing and what they should expect from the rest of your essay. However, this structural preview in the introductory paragraph is typically only included in longer, more advanced essays. If you’re not sure about including this segment, double-check with your teacher. When in doubt, leave it out and end the intro with your thesis. Example: This paper begins by exploring the limitations placed on Elisa due to her gender, then goes on to discuss the ways in which Steinbeck showcases Elisa’s struggles through symbolism and other literary devices. Finally, this essay will explore the modern-day parallels of Elisa’s story and the continuing ramifications of gender inequality."

      "title": "Example Introductory Paragraphs",
      "content": "Example Introductory Paragraphs William Shakespeare’s classic drama Othello centers around the two conflicting characters of scheming, manipulative Iago and the honorable, but oftentimes faithless, Othello. Both Othello and Iago use many of the same literary devices and much of the same figurative language to express not only their opinions of those around them, but also their general conceptions of the workings of the universe on a more spiritual level. Despite the fact that these men are completely opposite in character, Iago commands such persuasive powers that he literally starts to affect Othello’s thinking, altering the figures of speech he uses and his perceptions of those close to him. Gender inequality has been an inescapable fact of life for as long as history can remember. Women have been seen as inferior, and have been treated as such, for centuries. But to respond to such sexist ideas and treatment, the modern feminist movement arose. Feminism has become a prevalent theme in all forms of art, including literature.

      "title": "Determine how long your body paragraphs should be.",
      "content": "Determine how long your body paragraphs should be. The length of your essay’s body text depends on the type of essay you’re writing. As a rule, the body of your essay should comprise about 60-80% of your essay. Most commonly, a high school essay will feature three body paragraphs. However, a more advanced research paper may have body paragraphs that fill up 8-10 pages. Check with your teacher if you’re not sure how many paragraphs should be in the body of your essay."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a topic sentence, supporting evidence, and analysis in each paragraph.",
      "content": "Include a topic sentence, supporting evidence, and analysis in each paragraph. Remember that each sentence within the body paragraph must support its topic sentence, and each topic sentence must support your thesis statement. Start each body paragraph with a topic sentence that states the main point of the paragraph and relates directly back to your thesis. Then, write a few sentences with 2-3 pieces of evidence or quotes to support your topic sentence. Conclude the paragraph with your own interpretation of the evidence you’ve presented. [9] X Research source Don’t assume your reader will make the connection between your info and the thesis of your paper. Analysis also gives you a chance to include your own thoughts and interpretation of the facts you provide. Unless you’re writing a personal essay, avoid the use of “I” statements since this could make your essay look less professional. When quoting or paraphrasing specific pieces of information or evidence, don’t forget to cite your sources in-text based on the format required for your paper. [10] X Research source Many high school essays are written in MLA or APA style. Ask your teacher what format they want you to follow if it’s not specified."

    {
      "title": "Use transitional phrases between each of your body paragraphs.",
      "content": "Use transitional phrases between each of your body paragraphs. To ensure that your readers can smoothly move between your body paragraphs, use words or phrases to relate the paragraphs to one another. This will make it so your essay doesn’t seem disjointed and will keep your points succinct. [11] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source For example, if your body paragraphs discuss similar points in a different way, you can use phrases like “in the same way,” “similarly,” and “just as” to start other body paragraphs. If you are posing different points, try phrases like “in spite of,” “in contrast,” or “however” to transition."

      "title": "Example Body Paragraphs",
      "content": "Example Body Paragraphs Act I of Othello closes with Iago giving a soliloquy introducing his plan to make Othello lose faith in his wife. He concludes this speech by saying “Hell and night/Must bring this monstrous birth to the world’s light,” comparing Othello and Desdemona’s marriage to a “monster birth,” while equating himself and his deceptions to Satan. Iago hates that he must play an innocent underling in his own plot, but at the same time he realizes that the easiest method to achieve his goals is to hide his true intentions under a cloak of innocence. Trip Fontaine is another character negatively affected by the pressures to assimilate to American culture. Trip is a classmate of the Lisbon girls and fulfills the role of golden boy at their high school, after his emergence “from baby fat to the delight of girls and women alike.” Trip is constantly courted by girls and his young life fulfills every stereotype for the definition of the teenage American Dream. However, Trip’s later life is spent in detox and rehab, living off “the last of his ex-wife’s savings.” Trip is the definition of an American teen heartthrob, yet his need to conform to and maintain this image leads him down the path of drugs and alcohol, ending in a life riddled with addiction and disease (48). His eventual fate depicts the price that one must pay for living the idealized young American life."

    {
      "title": "Restate your thesis and summarize your arguments briefly.",
      "content": "Restate your thesis and summarize your arguments briefly. Remind the readers of the main focus of your essay and the arguments you posed. Don’t repeat your thesis word for word, but instead rephrase it along with your topic sentences. This helps the reader remember what you’ve discussed and it will stick with them for longer. [12] X Research source For example, if your thesis was, “The cell phone is the most important invention in the past 30 years,” then you may restate the thesis in your conclusion like, “Due to the ability to communicate anywhere in the world and access information easily, the cell phone is a pivotal invention in human history.” If you’re only writing a 1-page paper, restating your main ideas isn’t necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Discuss why the subject of your paper is relevant moving forward.",
      "content": "Discuss why the subject of your paper is relevant moving forward. Take the point of your essay and relate it to the real world and what information a reader can incorporate into their lives. This helps give reason to why you’ve written the essay that goes deeper than the prompt you’ve been given by your teacher. For example, if you write an essay discussing the themes of a book, think about how the themes are affecting people’s lives today."

    {
      "title": "End the paragraph with a lasting thought that ties into your introduction.",
      "content": "End the paragraph with a lasting thought that ties into your introduction. Close out your essay with another sentence that’s either a fact, question, or quote. Relate it back to your introduction so your essay comes full circle and leaves a sense of closure on the topic you’ve discussed. [13] X Research source Try to pick the same type of closing sentence as you used as your attention getter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include a Works Cited page if you need one.",
      "content": "Include a Works Cited page if you need one. Check with your teacher to see if they would like you to include the works cited and what format they prefer. Then, compile the sources you used on a separate page at the end of your essay. Organize your sources alphabetically by the authors’ last names. Make sure to follow the correct citation format depending on the style of essay you’ve written. [14] X Research source Including a Works Cited page shows that the information you provided isn’t all your own and allows the reader to visit the sources to see the raw information for themselves. Avoid using online citation machines since they may be outdated."

    {
      "title": "Avoid including new arguments, counter-arguments, or cliched concluding phrases.",
      "content": "Avoid including new arguments, counter-arguments, or cliched concluding phrases. To make your essay’s conclusion as strong as possible, don’t present any new arguments or evidence—you simply want to summarize the evidence you’ve already discussed so that it’s fresh in the reader's mind. Also, refrain from undermining your arguments with statements like “This is just one approach of many” or “There are other schools of thoughts that differ from this one.” At the high school level, most teachers dislike common concluding phrases like “To sum up” or “In conclusion,” so avoid using those in your final paragraph."
    },
    {
      "title": "Example Conclusions:",
      "content": "Example Conclusions: While Othello uses much of Iago’s own figurative language by the end of the play, he does so to achieve different results. Iago degrades every other character by comparing them to objects that can easily be manipulated, while Othello, when he dehumanizes people, somehow makes them out to be more than human. Despite their contrasts, Iago and Othello both represent the extremity of the same thing—human emotion. When Iago makes reference to heaven and hell, he always describes how hell comes out on top. Othello, on the other hand, knows that Heaven represents all that is good and right on Earth and so eventually throws himself at the mercy of his God, making him the tragic hero of the play. Feminism is the advocacy of women’s rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men. In Steinbeck’s “The Chrysanthemums”, the protagonist Elisa Allen experiences gender inequality. Society’s perception of her as inferior causes her to be unfulfilled and unchallenged with her life. Elisa, as a feminist, strives for equality with her male counterparts, yet she continually fails to achieve it. Through her character, the reader sees the broad issue of gender inequality and the toll it takes on individual members of society."
