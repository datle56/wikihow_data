      "content": "Sip water slowly throughout the course of the day. Drinking water is good for you to begin with, but it can help raise your blood pressure if it is too low. Keep a cup of water next to you at all times and sip on it slowly throughout the day. This may not have as pronounced of an effect if you’re younger than 40, but it’s still a healthy, risk-free way to raise your blood pressure a little. Aim to drink about 8–10 cups (1.9–2.4 L) of water daily. If you're active or feel thirsty, increase your water intake to stay hydrated. Excessive thirst is a common symptom of low blood pressure, so this should help alleviate the symptom as well. If you get sick of boring old water, go ahead and squirt some lime or lemon juice into the water to give it some flavor."

      "content": "Blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day so check a few times. When checking your blood pressure, the systolic reading, which is the top number, should be 90-120. The diastolic reading, which is the bottom number, should be around 60-80. If the systolic reading is lower than 90 or your diastolic reading is lower than 60, you have low blood pressure. [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure that is exerted on the arteries by the force of your blood being pushed through by your heart. Think of your body as a pipe. The systolic reading is how hard the water presses on the pipe when it’s flowing. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure that exists in your arteries when your heart rests between beats. If it helps, think of it as how hard the water pushes on the pipe when the tap on your sink is off. Keep in mind that everyone's body is different, and you will experience fluctuations over the course of each day. However, blood pressure numbers should be kept as close to these averages as possible."
