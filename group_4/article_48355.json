      "content": "Find the oil grade on the oil cap or in your user guide. Your car’s oil grade tells you what type of oil you can use in your car. In most cases, the grade will be etched onto your engine oil cap. If not, you can find it in your vehicle’s maintenance guide or by searching your vehicle’s year, make, and model online. [1] X Research source Your oil grade should be a hyphenate like “30-weight” or an alphanumeric like 5W-30, which is a common grade of engine oil. The 5W indicates how well the oil pours in winter weather (W = Winter). The 30 indicates how much the oil weighs at its normal operating temperature. The lower the first number (e.g., 5W), the better the oil will flow in cold weather. The higher the second number (e.g., 30), the thicker the oil will be when warm. If you find that your car has two different compatible grades, the lower number is meant for driving in cold seasons. For example, it may be recommended that your car use 5W-20 motor oil in the warmer months and 0W-20 in the colder ones."

      "title": "Choose between conventional, synthetic, and other oil types.",
      "content": "Choose between conventional, synthetic, and other oil types. All engine oils are made from crude oil and refined for use in motor vehicles. However, different oil types have different recommended uses, and one may work better than another for your car. Start by checking your car’s maintenance guide or consulting with a qualified mechanic—usually, you’ll easily be able to find out whether you should be using conventional, synthetic, or another oil type in your car. [2] X Research source Conventional engine oil is typically the minimum standard for naturally aspirated cars. If you’d like to do more to protect your engine, however, you may be able to upgrade to semi-synthetic or full synthetic engine oil. Semi-synthetic or fully synthetic engine oil is often required for cars that have a turbocharger or supercharger. The same applies to high-performance vehicles, including most vehicles from 2010 or newer. Conventional oil is not recommended for these types of cars because it is unlikely to protect their engines properly. High-mileage engine oil is less common but may be recommended for your car if your vehicle has more than 75,000 miles on it. These specialized oils include additional cleaning agents to reduce sludge build-up in older engines."

      "content": "If needed, consult a mechanic or use an online oil finder tool. If you’ve identified your oil grade and oil type and still aren’t sure, talk to a qualified professional or use an oil search tool on a reputable website. Any mechanic should quickly be able to tell you what type of oil you should be using in your car. Or, input your vehicle’s year, make, and model into this tool to get a list of recommended engine oil brands and types."

      "title": "Conventional oil",
      "content": "Conventional oil Conventional oil is made from crude oil that’s been extracted from the earth. The crude oil then has its impurities removed and detergents added before it’s ready for use in motor vehicles. Once added to the engine, conventional oil begins to become saturated with contaminants and particles that would otherwise degrade the engine. Slowly, conventional oil begins to lose its protective qualities—which is why you have to change your oil every few months or few thousand miles. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Full synthetic oil",
      "content": "Full synthetic oil Just like crude oil, full synthetic oil is made from crude oil that’s derived from the earth (so it’s not actually completely synthetic!). However, full synthetic oils are more refined and provide for better protection against damage inside the engine. Synthetic oil is more chemically stable, more resistant to rust and oxidation, and lasts longer before losing its protective properties. [4] X Research source Full synthetic oils may also work better at higher temperatures than the standard conventional oil. However, full synthetic oils are often sold at a high price point, which is why many car owners opt for a synthetic blend instead."

      "title": "Synthetic blend",
      "content": "Synthetic blend A synthetic blend or semi-synthetic engine oil is the minimum required grade for many vehicles, and it offers similar benefits to full synthetic oil at a lower cost. For instance, semi-synthetic motor oils may offer more protection against wear and contaminants than conventional oils. These blends are made from a mixture of synthetic and conventional base oils with higher-quality additives than those found in most conventional oils. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "High mileage oil High mileage oils are typically used for vehicles that have more than 75,000 miles. These motor oils are specially formulated with seal enhancers and additives that are designed to reduce leaks in a car, consequently lowering oil consumption as well. Switching to this type of oil may also reduce burning oil or leaking oil spots coming from the car. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Motor oil is a lubricant that keeps vehicle parts separated from each other. Although it has many different important purposes, the main function of motor oil is to provide a thin film of molecules between car parts. By lubricating these moving parts, the motor oil prevents friction and oxidation that could damage the vehicle and its components. [8] X Research source Motor oil also helps to dissolve any deposits that may accumulate inside the crankcase and neutralize any acids created during combustion. Refilling your oil tank also helps to circulate hot oil to the engine oil cooler, ensuring that all the oil in the car is at the correct operating temperature."

      "content": "Motor oil and oil filters should be changed every 3,000 to 7,500 miles. Conventional oil should usually be changed every 3,000–5,000 miles (4,800–8,000 km). A synthetic oil change, however, is usually only required every 7,500 miles (12,100 km) or more. Older vehicles may also need more frequent changes than newer ones. Check your maintenance guide or ask your mechanic to see if your car has a specific time frame in which your oil should be routinely changed. [9] X Research source Most mechanics recommend that your oil filter be changed every time you change your oil. However, it’s usually okay to only replace it on every other oil change. [10] X Research source To choose the right oil filter for your car, consult your owner’s manual for the manufacturer recommendation or search “oil filter + (your car’s make and model) ” in Google. If you ever see the oil light appear on your car’s dashboard, change your car’s oil at your earliest convenience or take it to an auto shop. You should also check your car’s oil level about once a month to make sure it isn’t contaminated or low. Simply lower a dipstick into your car’s oil tank—if the oil only reaches the “Add” part of the dipstick, it’s time for a refill . If the oil smells dirty or like gasoline, it’s time for a change.

      "content": "What is the difference between regular and synthetic oil? The main difference between conventional and synthetic engine oils is the size of the molecules. Synthetic oil has molecules with a consistent size and structure, while conventional oil has uneven molecules. As a result, full and semi-synthetic oils move more smoothly through the engine, giving it greater horsepower and efficiency. Synthetic oils may also provide better protection for wear and a longer time period between required oil changes. [13] X Research source"
