      "title": "Tame your hamster.",
      "content": "Tame your hamster. If your hamster is not tame enough to be handled, you will need to tame him before you can even think about trimming his nails. Be patient when working with your hamster. Remember that it will take time for him to get use to you, and to being handled. If you lose your patience, it will frighten him, prolonging the process even more. If your hamster badly needs his nails trimmed, but is too wild to be handled, take him to your vet where they can use a sedative to take care of the nails. Have plenty of treats ready during the taming process, too!"

      "content": "Practice holding your hamster in the “nail-trimming” position. Once your hamster is tame, and doesn’t mind when you hold him in your hand, spend a few minutes each day holding him in the position you will hold him in when trimming his nails. There is no right way to hold your hamster when trimming his nails. Find a way that is comfortable for both you and your hamster. You can try holding him upright in your hand so that his paws stick out above your fingers, or try holding him flat, so that you will be able to grasp his his paw between your fingers. Don’t hold on to his paws when first practicing this position. Get him comfortable with it before moving on to that. Give him a treat to reward him when he sits still in your hand. After practicing for a few times, you might also consider wrapping him in a small towel to keep him more contained, if you think it is necessary. If he sits very still in your hand, it may not be necessary."

      "title": "Practice holding his paw between your fingers.",
      "content": "Practice holding his paw between your fingers. Once your hamster is comfortable sitting in the nail-trimming position, spend time each day holding each of his paws between your fingers. Begin with a very gentle grasp, and when he becomes more comfortable (e.g. doesn’t try to jerk his paw out of your fingers) begin to grasp a bit more firmly. You want your grasp to be firm but gentle when you trim the nails. Remember to reward him after each training session! Either with a treat or some time spent running around in his ball, if he has one."

      "title": "Examine his nails carefully.",
      "content": "Examine his nails carefully. Once your hamster will allow you to grasp his paws, take time to examine them carefully. It is critical that you understand where the quick is. If you trim the quick, it will bleed and be very painful for your hamster. If you do trim the quick it is unlikely he will let you trim them again. Most hamsters have nails that are translucent, so when you look very carefully, you will see a part that is nearly clear, but closer to where his nail meets his paw, there will be a more cloudy part; this is the quick. The quick is the area where the blood supply to the nails ends."

      "title": "Consider having your hamster’s nails trimmed by a veterinarian.",
      "content": "Consider having your hamster’s nails trimmed by a veterinarian. If you have never done it before, it is a good idea to have your vet do it the first time. This way, you can watch the procedure, and see how it is done, as well as how long the nails should be. Do not try to trim your hamster’s nails on your own if he is not tame enough to sit still while you hold him in your hand. Ask your vet if you can watch him trim the nails, and if he can explain the process as he goes through it so that you can do it on your own."

      "title": "Gather your supplies.",
      "content": "Gather your supplies. You will need good lighting (a small desk lamp may work well), a pair of small pet nail clippers or human nail clippers (you can also use nail scissors as well), some styptic powder to use in case you cut one of the nails too short, and treats for your hamster. Styptic powder can be found at most pet stores or online. This powder is used to stem bleeding. Hopefully, however, you won’t need to use it. You might also consider wearing gloves if you’re worried your hamster might bite you, although this should not be the case if you have spent adequate time taming him."

      "content": "Hold one of your hamster’s paws. With the thumb and forefinger of the hand you are using to hold the hamster, hold his paw firmly. This way, you will be able to trim the nails of that paw."

      "title": "Look for the quick.",
      "content": "Look for the quick. This is why it is important that you have a bright light (or that you sit in bright sunlight). Hamsters nails are usually translucent, and with brighter light you will be able to see the quick. You should absolutely not cut this! If you do, it will be painful for your hamster and the nail will bleed. The quick is the area where the blood supply to the nails ends."

      "content": "Place the nail in the clipper. Make sure that you are trimming only the nail, and not the quick! Clip the nail. Your hamster may squirm at the point if he feels frightened. Offer him a treat, if necessary. On some days, your hamster may be too squirmy to trim more than one or two nails. If this is the case, don’t try to force him. Simply trim the nail that is the longest, and try again tomorrow."

      "title": "Continue trimming your hamster’s other nails.",
      "content": "Continue trimming your hamster’s other nails. If you were successful with the first nail, and your hamster is still calm and still in your hand, proceed to the next nail. You should only continue to trim the nails for as long as your hamster will sit still. If he gets impatient and squirmy, either take a break for a few hours or try again tomorrow. You should also try to choose a time of day where your hamster is least active. Hamsters are nocturnal animals, so they will be less active during the day."

      "title": "Reward your hamster.",
      "content": "Reward your hamster. Once you are finished with the nail trimming session, reward your hamster with a treat. Although nail trimming will not usually be a pleasant experience for either of you, if you consistently reward him with treats, he will learn to associate nail trimming with something good."

      "title": "Ask someone for help.",
      "content": "Ask someone for help. If you feel that you need some help trimming your hamster’s nails, you can have someone hold him for you while you trim. However, you should ask someone who has spent time handling your hamster rather than someone who has not. If the person who will help you has never handled your hamster, let them spend some time holding and petting your hamster for a couple of weeks before trying to trim his nails. This may be the best option if your hamster is very squirmy every single time you try to trim his nails. It will allow the person to hold the hamster to hold on more firmly because he/she will be able to use both hands, and it will allow you to hold the paw more carefully while trimming because you will also have two hands to use."

      "content": "Have your friend hold the hamster. Once your hamster is comfortable, you can ask your friend to hold the hamster in the correct position. Make sure you are underneath a bright light so that you will be able to see the nails easily. This will probably work best if you and your friend face each other. This way, your hamsters paws will be pointing out, directly at you. If you need to talk during the trimming, make sure you keeps your voices soft and relaxed. You may scare the hamster if you shout or talk very loudly."
