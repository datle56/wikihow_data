      "content": "Use half-size bra pads if you want a minor, natural boost. If you want to add just a little extra lift and definition but don’t need a full cup size difference, go for bra pads that line the bottom of your bust. They offer a natural appearance while still adding fullness. Typically, these come in 1 size, though you can also find them in sizes small, medium, or large. These are great for formal wear and day-to-day bras. You can also use these in sports bras if you want a little extra coverage. These are not recommended for bathing suits, as they aren't full size. These usually come in round or oblong shapes."

Then, bring your needle back through the top to repair the small hole you cut. Make your stitches starting at the beginning of the slit, and tie a knot at the end of your thread when you reach the end. While this is not required, it will help keep your insert securely in your top. This applies for both bathing suits that have openings and those that you cut yourself."
