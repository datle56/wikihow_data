      "title": "Rice does not transform into maggots.",
      "content": "Rice does not transform into maggots. Rice is a grain, so it cannot turn into a live insect. However, rice is an ideal breeding ground for insects. Insects lay their eggs on rice grains. [1] X Research source Once the eggs hatch into larvae (known as maggots), the larvae have an instant food source, they reproduce, and the cycle repeats. Most “maggots” found in rice aren’t actually maggots! True maggots come from fly eggs, but the most common pantry pest is the Indian meal moth. Since both insects have similar-looking larvae, Indian meal moth larvae are still referred to as maggots. Indian meal moth eggs hatch into small white caterpillars about .5 inches (1.3 cm) long. Fully-grown larvae can also have a green or pinkish hue. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Insect eggs hide inside grains when the rice is processed. It’s impossible to grow and process food that’s 100% pest-free. [3] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source When rice is processed, insect eggs hide in the grains. These eggs are nearly impossible to detect, so most maggots come directly from the manufacturer. [4] X Research source Depending on when the eggs were laid, you may purchase rice that already contains visible maggot larvae, or the eggs will hatch a few weeks later (if you store your rice at room temperature). Inspect rice packaging at the supermarket to avoid purchasing potentially infested rice. If there are any holes or tears in the packaging, choose another bag of rice!"

      "content": "Improper storage allows insects to lay eggs on your rice. Maggot infestation easily occurs from improper rice storage. It’s important to store your rice in an airtight container, preventing insects from laying their eggs in the first place. Avoid storing your rice in thin plastic bags or cardboard–maggots can chew through these materials! Keep all your pantry items, including rice, in a tightly-sealed container made out of metal, glass, or thick plastic. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "With proper cooking, you can eat rice that contains maggot eggs/larvae. In some parts of the world, maggot larvae are considered a delicacy (and a good source of protein). Maggots pose a greater health risk when they’re found in fresh or pre-cooked foods. [6] X Research source Since rice grains are boiled before consumption, the hot water kills the insect eggs/larvae. Just be sure to cook your rice for at least 5 minutes! [7] X Research source There’s a slim possibility that larvae can cause myiasis, a condition where surviving larvae enter the stomach and/or intestines. It’s typically not life-threatening, but it can cause vomiting, nausea, or stomach pains. [8] X Research source If your (dry) rice contains maggots, you don’t have to throw it out! Check the expiration date on the rice packaging to ensure it’s still fresh–spoiled food leads to food poisoning, rather than maggots."

      "content": "Spread the rice evenly on a sheet tray and heat it with a hair dryer. Make sure the sheet tray is large enough so there is only one flat layer of rice. On high-heat, run a hair dryer over your rice (2-3 times) to thoroughly heat the grains. Concentrate on spots that show discoloration or movement. [9] X Research source If you don’t have a hair dryer, pour boiling water over the rice to kill the maggots and wait 5 minutes. Maggots cannot survive extreme temperatures, so you can cook the rice after draining the water."

Add the boiling water and wait a few minutes for the maggot larvae to rise to the surface of the water. Use a small cup to scoop them out and immediately cook the soaked rice to avoid bacterial growth. [10] X Research source"

They preserve the shelf life of food by removing oxygen inside their packaging, but they’re also perfect to prevent insect eggs from hatching! [12] X Research source Oxygen absorbers are usually labeled with “do not eat” or “do not microwave” so make sure to remove them before cooking your rice."
