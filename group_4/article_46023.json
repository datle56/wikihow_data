Proper nouns are the names of specific people, places, and things. Titles, which are a type of proper noun, are the names of works of art (books, movies, plays, etc.), institutions, geographical areas, and much more. Titles can also be honorifics (Her Majesty, Mr. President, etc.). [2] X Research source Titles and proper nouns consisting of more than one word should have every word capitalized, except for small words and articles like \"the,\" \"an,\" \"and,\" etc. The first word of a title should always be capitalized (with the above \"brand name\" exception).

For instance, you might refer to a specific city by naming the city itself, followed by the state or province it is in, followed by the surrounding country. Each geographic name (except the last) is followed by a comma. Note that a comma is used after the last (largest) geographical area if the sentence continues.

[16] X Research source Here's an example of a semicolon being used correctly: People continue to worry about the future; our failure to conserve resources has put the world at risk. A semicolon takes the place of a period, and it is used in parallel construction. For instance, if you write I love bananas, and I love apples, instead of having an and, you can write I love bananas; I love apples.

It can also be used to add a parenthetical statement for further clarification, but this should still be relevant to the sentence. [24] X Research source Otherwise, use parentheses. Keep in mind that the rest of the sentence should still flow naturally as if the dashed material were not there. To judge whether a dash is appropriate, try to remove the words between the dashes. If the sentence appears disjointed or does not make sense, you may need to revise it instead of using the dashes. There should be spaces before and after a dash in British English.
