      "content": "This theory states that all relationships have at least 1 of 3 core qualities. In 1986, psychologist Robert Sternberg published his “triangular theory of love,” which states that all types of loving relationships (partners, loved ones, friends, etc.) can be defined by combination (or lack) of 3 specific traits: intimacy, passion, and commitment. Each of these traits represents a separate “point” of a triangle, with different types of relationships falling on different corners and edges of the shape. [1] X Research source Intimacy: A sense of emotional closeness, where one can find solace and support Passion: A physical and sexual connection to someone accompanied by romantic experiences Commitment: A resolve to stay with and care for someone over time, and to put in the work so a relationship lasts In Sternberg’s own words, this theory is designed to examine “the nature of love” as well as “loves in different kinds of relationships.” [2] X Research source Its enduring and wide-reaching message is still relevant and applicable today."

      "content": "There are 8 different types of love that fit in this paradigm. Picture an equilateral triangle, with the top point representing intimacy, the left point representing passion, and the right point signifying commitment. With this paradigm, each corner and edge represents a different type of love: [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Friendship: A loving relationship that revolves around intimacy rather than passion and/or commitment, like a friend you chat with online sometimes. Companionate love: A strong relationship built on commitment and intimacy without any passion thrown into the mix, like a close/best friend. Romantic love : A relationship that has lots of intimacy and passion without any commitment. Friends with benefits as well as casual/new partners experience this sort of affection. Fatuous love: A relationship that moves with a powerful combination of commitment and passion but lacks a strong sense of intimacy, like people who get engaged after just a couple of dates. Infatuation: A relationship that’s filled with passion but has no sense of commitment or intimacy, like a student crushing on their classmate. With infatuation, feelings can change very quickly—you might feel madly in love with someone one moment and then feel negatively about them very quickly. Empty love: A deeply committed relationship that doesn’t have any real passion or intimacy involved, like a married couple trying to avoid divorce. Consummate love: An amazing relationship that incorporates plenty of commitment, intimacy, and passion, like high-school sweethearts who are still going strong in college. Non-love: A relationship that lacks any type of intimacy, passion, or commitment, like what you’d feel for a stranger you drive by on the road. Non-love doesn’t exist on or around the triangle."

      "content": "This theory states that all people experience 3 loves in their lifetime. According to one version of this theory, we only experience 3 really groundbreaking romantic experiences, each at different chronological points in our lives. There’s the first, young love, the second, more tumultuous love, and the third, long-lasting love. [4] X Research source This theory explores how people learn and grow through their relationships, and invites you to take a more critical look at the people you’ve been intimate with (and may be intimate with in the future). An alternative version of this theory states how the brain experiences 3 types of love: lust, attraction, and attachment."

      "title": "The first love: young love",
      "content": "The first love: young love Also known as “the love that looks right,” this love seems to check off every box on paper. Your partner gets along well with your family, your personalities are super compatible, and it sometimes feels like your love story is straight out of a movie. Still, there’s a nagging feeling in your gut that this person isn’t quite The One, even if they match up society’s standards of an ideal partner. [5] X Research source Example: Two people start dating in high school. One person feels like the relationship isn’t quite meeting all their needs, but they stick with it because it’s what they know and expect love to be. A combination of time and meeting new people is a great way to get over your first love."

      "title": "The second love: tumultuous love",
      "content": "The second love: tumultuous love This love comes with its fair share of passion, but it also forces you to confront some ugly truths about what love can look like. As you continue to search for your perfect person, you end up with someone who hurts and frustrates you. The relationship may end pretty roughly, and you get a clear understanding that love has its fair share of highs and lows. [6] X Research source Example: Two people end up dating in college, but their relationship is pretty on-off and rife with conflict at times."

      "title": "The third love: long-lasting love",
      "content": "The third love: long-lasting love This love often comes out of nowhere, and it completely rewrites your expectations and assumptions about what a relationship can and should look like. With this third love, everything makes sense, and your compatibility is off the charts. For better or for worse, you know you’ve found someone who loves you for you. [7] X Research source Example: Two people meet at a party and experience a really deep connection. As they explore that connection, they find a harmonious and long-lasting relationship."

This gives people a lot more freedom to define and explore their relationships and the ways they connect with others. Many people only know 3 or 4 of these words—but believe it or not, there are actually 8 (though some of them have a bit of overlap). [8] X Research source"

While similar to philia, storge offers a more unconditional bias; for instance, a parent would be more inclined to forgive their young child throwing a temper tantrum rather than their adult friend.
