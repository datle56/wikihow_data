      "content": "Talk to your healthcare provider about your needs. Your doctor will discuss your symptoms, if any, as well as any environmental concerns about your home. They will also offer advice about appropriate next steps, like a vaporizer or humidifier. Sufferers of acute (short-term) respiratory illnesses, such as cold, flu, or bronchitis, might find temporary relief of symptoms while using a vaporizer. [2] X Research source Those with chronic respiratory diseases may find a vaporizer useful, though your healthcare provider may recommend more specialized devices. Vaporizers may also be useful in homes with very dry air or in very cold/dry climates, as they add moisture to the air for greater general comfort. Be sure to ask your doctor about potential side effects of steam use, such as increased bacterial growth or other problems with humid air."

      "content": "Choose a cool mist humidifier instead of a warm steam vaporizer if you have concerns about safety. The two devices work in similar fashion, but offer slightly different benefits for your health and home environment. You'll need to consider for whom and for what purpose you're purchasing one of these devices. Warm steam vaporizers use heat to turn water into steam to add moisture to the environment. Cool mist humidifiers emit a light mist of cool water into the air, also adding moisture. Note that the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against using steam vaporizers in children’s rooms.

If the vaporizer is for a child, make sure you have space in his/her room that will keep the machine out of reach. If you're purchasing the vaporizer to improve the atmosphere in your home in general, choose which room will mostly likely offer the most benefit for you and your family."

      "content": "Review the various types of steam vaporizers. Taking some time to read the package information and, possibly, looking at the actual vaporizer, will help you make a more informed decision about your health and comfort. Consider the amount of space that you have to keep and store the vaporizer. Larger varieties may be difficult to keep out of the reach of children, although smaller machines may not provide enough steam to be useful. Read the packaging and, if purchasing online, device reviews, to get a sense of how easy the vaporizer is to use and to clean. If you have a busy schedule or have health issues that make strenuous cleaning difficult, choose a machine with simpler operating instructions."

      "title": "Use the vaporizer at night.",
      "content": "Use the vaporizer at night. While you may use a vaporizer at any time, most users prefer to run the machine at night. As the machines ease dryness or stuffiness in nasal passages, users may experience a more comfortable sleep. Avoid running the vaporizer all day since you will fill the air with too much moisture doing so, which may cause increased mold or fungus growth in your home. These problems may lead to further respiratory issues. Never allow your home's interior humidity exceed 50%. [5] X Research source Purchase an interior hygrometer to measure the humidity in your home's air."

      "content": "Fill the container with distilled water. Tap water contains minerals, and some of these minerals can clog up the machine or spread dust and contaminants through the air in your home. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Most vaporizers have a \"fill line\" marking how high the water level should be. Don't overfill the tank, as doing so may cause spills. Some vaporizers will automatically shut off once the tank is empty, but you should plan to fill it each time you plan to begin using the device, such as at bedtime."

      "content": "Place the vaporizer on a flat surface at a safe distance from human contact. You should place the vaporizer about 4 feet (122 cm) away from direct contact with anyone’s skin. [8] X Research source The hot mist from a steam vaporizer can cause scalding if it comes into contact with skin, especially for an extended length of time. If using the vaporizer in a child's room or in a home with children, place it high up on a surface that the child cannot reach to prevent accidental scalding. You should also make sure that the surface is sturdy enough to withstand vibrations that might dislodge the vaporizer. Do not use or place the vaporizer in an area that would allow bedding, curtain, carpeting, or other fabric materials to get wet. You may want to spread towels out beneath the machine to prevent dripping water or condensation from damaging the surface of your furniture."

      "content": "Air the room out in between uses. [9] X Research source While a warm, moist environment can work wonders for congestion, bacteria and mold can start growing in a room that stays moist for too long. If bacteria or mold starts to grow, you and your family will probably experience more respiratory problems. Leave doors and, if possible, windows open during the day when the steam vaporizer is not in use. Run an electric fan, if necessary, to keep the air circulating inside the room."

      "title": "Read the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.",
      "content": "Read the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions. These instructions should indicate how often you should clean the device, as well as list the chemicals safe to use for cleaning. To clean most vaporizers, you will need cleaning solution, a bottle or vegetable brush, clean water, and a microfiber cloth or paper towels. Consider purchasing rubber gloves to protect your skin as you clean."

      "content": "Clean the vaporizer at least once every 3 days. Bacteria grow in moist environments, and if the vaporizer is not cleaned and dried properly, bacteria can actually begin growing inside the machine. If bacteria grow inside the vaporizer, it will be transferred into the air as the machine creates steam. [10] X Research source Change the distilled water every day and clean the machine at least once every 3 days. [11] X Research source Clean more often if you use the device during the day as well as at night. You may need to change the filter regularly as well. Check your machine’s instructions to be sure."

      "content": "Create or purchase a cleaning solution. A few squirts of antibacterial soap or mild dish detergent mixed into hot water is usually sufficient. For something stronger, use 3% hydrogen peroxide. [12] X Research source If the particular vaporizer you use specifies a cleaning solution you should use, follow the manufacturer's instructions and use the recommended type. For an especially deep cleaning, use 1% bleach solution: 1 part bleach to 99 parts water. Wear rubber gloves to protect your skin when cleaning with any variety of bleach."

      "title": "Take the vaporizer apart.",
      "content": "Take the vaporizer apart. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on disassembling the machine. Usually, the only part of the machine you need to take apart for cleaning purposes is the tank. Check the tank and base for signs of mold growth. If you need to clean the base, use care not to submerge any mechanical parts; use a wet brush dipped in cleaning solution and dry with a cloth instead. On some models, the machine is not designed to be disassembled. For these steam humidifiers, you will only need to open the lid or cover of the water tank and attempt to clean it while it is still connected to the rest of the machine. Use only gentle pressure to disassemble the machine. Use of too much force may damage the locking components and make the machine unsafe for use."

      "content": "Scrub the inside of the tank with a soft brush or cloth. A baby bottle brush or vegetable brush should suffice, but a clean, microfiber cloth works just as well. Dip the brush or cloth into the cleaning solution and thoroughly scrub the inside of the water tank, re-soaking the cloth in solution as necessary until the entire tank has been scrubbed clean. For hard-to-reach places, soak a cotton swab in alcohol and use it to clean out these areas."

Pour a little water into the water tank, swish it around, and dump it immediately to rid the tank of any soap or detergent. Rinse the tank thoroughly, then soak the components in white vinegar to fully disinfect the device. Use a toothpick to clean any visible mold from the narrower tubes and valves, as necessary."

      "title": "Dry the inside of the tank with a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel.",
      "content": "Dry the inside of the tank with a clean microfiber cloth or paper towel. The tank should be completely dry in order to prevent contamination of the machine with germs or minerals from the water. This is especially important when you are preparing to put the vaporizer back into storage. Paper towels are the most hygienic option, as they are fresh with each use, unlike towels, which can trap and spread germs. Let the tank fully air dry before reattaching to the base."
