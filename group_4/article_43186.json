      "content": "Soft spots Pick up the sweet potato and feel it for soft spots. If it feels squishy or mushy in certain areas, your sweet potato is likely past its prime. [1] X Research source Fresh sweet potatoes won’t have any soft spots or indentations, and they’ll be very firm to the touch. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrinkly skin If your sweet potato’s skin looks shriveled or wrinkly, this is a surefire sign of decay. [3] X Research source A wrinkly sweet potato will taste sour or “off,” and it can even cause sickness if eaten, so it’s safest to throw them away. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Discoloration",
      "content": "Discoloration Fresh sweet potatoes should have a uniform color without any dark spots or discoloration. [5] X Research source If you see brown or black spots on the sweet potato’s skin or inside the sweet potato, this is a sign of spoilage and possible mold growth. [6] X Research source Unfortunately, the sweet potato is no longer safe to eat and should be thrown out."

      "title": "Oozing liquid",
      "content": "Oozing liquid As sweet potatoes spoil, they will start to become softer and mushier, and their water content will rise. [7] X Research source When this happens, you may notice some mysterious liquid leaking from the potato before you cut it. This is a sign that your sweet potato has gone bad and should be thrown away. [8] X Research source Once you cut into your sweet potato, it’s normal to see a bit of white, milky-looking liquid. This liquid is called “sap,” and it’s not a sign of spoilage. Your sweet potato should still be safe to eat! [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Lots of sprouts",
      "content": "Lots of sprouts If your sweet potato only has a few small sprouts but seems completely fresh otherwise, it’s safe to cut off the sprouted areas and consume the potato. [10] X Research source If, however, your sweet potato has grown an excessive amount of large sprouts and it’s also soft or wrinkly, it’s time to toss it out. These sprouts contain compounds called glycoalkaloids, which have a bitter taste and can be toxic when eaten in large quantities. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "“Off” smell",
      "content": "“Off” smell If your sweet potato starts to have a musty, foul, sour, or intensely sweet odor, it has likely gone bad. [12] X Research source These smells indicate bacteria growth, which means your sweet potato isn’t safe to eat anymore. A fresh raw sweet potato should smell earthy, but it shouldn’t smell overly sweet until it’s cooked. As a sweet potato goes bad, bacteria will grow and convert to sugar, which causes this super sweet smell. [13] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Bitter taste",
      "content": "Bitter taste If a sweet potato has gone bad, it will likely have an unpleasant bitter taste. This comes from the sprouts that grow on the potato, which contain bitter-tasting compounds called glycoalkaloids. It’s dangerous to consume these compounds, so if you notice this taste, stop eating your potato and throw it away. [14] X Research source An overly sweet taste can also be a sign of spoilage, but this is harder to spot in sweet potatoes since they are naturally sweet-tasting. However, if you have a regular russet or Yukon gold potato, a super sweet taste is a sign that the starches are breaking down into sugars, which means your potato is past its prime.

You can place them on the kitchen counter (as long as they’re not under direct sunlight from a window), or you can store them in your pantry. [20] X Research source If your pantry is very cool (55 to 60°F), your potatoes may even stay fresh for up to 2 months! [21] X Research source Don’t place your sweet potatoes in a Ziploc or plastic bag—this traps moisture and leads to spoilage. Don’t wash your sweet potatoes until you’re ready to cook them. Washing sweet potatoes before storing them can lead to premature mold growth."
