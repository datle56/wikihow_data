However, spider web tattoos also have negative connotations associated with prison and white supremacy. [11] X Research source Spider web tattoos on the elbow, neck, back, hand, fingers, or behind the ears have traditionally been associated with racism and white supremacy, gangs, incarceration, and crime. Even if you avoid these areas, it’s still possible people may negatively stereotype you. You may not be associated with these things, but others have no way of knowing that. Make sure this is something you’re okay with before getting the tattoo. To make a spider web tattoo your own, incorporate other symbols like roses, flowers, or butterflies so the focus isn’t on the web itself."

      "content": "Choose a location that fits your aesthetic preferences. There isn’t a right or wrong place to get a spider tattoo on your body. If you have other tattoos, consider where your new ink would look best in comparison. If this is your first tattoo, consider whether you want the tattoo to be visible or if you need to hide it easily. Keep in mind, too, that some locations will hurt more than others. Here are some ideas of where to get a tattoo : [12] X Research source Arm or leg: Your arm or leg is a great location for any tattoo style, as there is a lot of space to work with. These locations also work well if you’re getting your first tattoo , as they aren’t as painful as some other locations and it would be easy to cover the tattoo with your clothing. Ankle or wrist: These locations are great for fine-line, minimalist designs, and they can be easily covered if you need to hide your tattoo for whatever reason. Chest or back: If you want a really large, complex design, consider going for the chest or back. These locations provide a huge canvas for your artist to work on, but they can be really painful, so make sure you’re ready to commit. Neck or hands: These locations are intense, both in pain level and appearance. A bold, traditional spider tattoo would work well on the neck or hands, but keep in mind these locations are often considered “job stoppers” since they can’t be hidden."
