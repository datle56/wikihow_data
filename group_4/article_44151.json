      "content": "Interpret price changes . The high, low and closing prices indicate how the stock performed in the previous trading day. They are the top, bottom and last price the stock traded at on that day. In contrast, the 52-week high and low columns indicate the volatility of the stock. The greater the difference between those latter two prices, the greater the opportunity for gain or risk of loss with that stock. Conversely, a narrow price range without major swings suggests a more conservative investment. Net change (or simply \"change\") represents the gain or loss for the stock on a given day. It’s determined by taking the previous day’s closing price and subtracting it from the current or next day’s closing price. For more, see how to read stock quotes."

      "content": "Look at dividends. The dividend column indicates how much the company may pay you to hold a share of its stock for one year. The dividend may be raised, lowered or eliminated depending on company performance. Examine how long the company has been paying dividends and if they have increased the dividend payout over time. Companies that consistently pay dividends, and increase them over time, are considered much more reliable investments than those companies that do not. Dividends are paid when the company’s net earnings (net profits) are paid out to all stockholders evenly. The other option is to reinvest these earnings into the company itself. Companies attempting to grow or change quickly need capital reinvested and tend to not pay dividends (higher risk = higher reward). Companies without as much of a plan for growth or change tend to use their more consistent earnings to pay back shareholders for their (financial) support. This means that growth stocks may not pay dividends but may still be profitable investments due to their growth plans. [5] X Research source Another way to understand dividend payouts is to calculate the dividend payout ratio. This allows you to see how much of the company's earnings are paid out to investors and if that number has changed over time."

      "title": "Understand the PE ratio",
      "content": "Understand the PE ratio . Price-to-earnings ratio information is the closing price of the stock divided by the earnings per outstanding share. Basically, it represents investor confidence that the price of the stock will increase in the future. A low P/E ratio may indicate an undervalued company (and a chance for a good investment). Another way to look at the PE ratio is to think of it as an earnings multiple. That is, the ratio represents how much an investor is willing to pay for $1 of current earnings. So, a PE of 18 represents that an investor is willing to pay $18 for $1 of current earnings. A \"good\" PE ratio is hard to discern directly. That is, a high PE ratio shows you that investors are confident about a company's growth and that the stock value might increase. However, a low PE ratio may represent good potential and might indicate an undervalued stock. The average PE ratio is 20-25. You should compare the company's PE ratio to those of other company in the same industry to get an idea of where this company fits in. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Look at trading volume. Volume is simply the number of shares traded each day. Unusual trading volume in excess of average daily trades may indicate that a stock is either on the rise or anticipating a slump. Generally, if there is a rise in the price accompanying the trading volume, this represents investor confidence. Similarly, increased trade volume accompanied by a reduction in price means that many investors are selling their positions in expectation of a slump."

      "content": "Look at the big picture. Stock prices can be volatile over the course of a day or week. To get a better idea of the stock's performance and growth (or lack thereof), you should look at a longer time period, like a month or year. In addition, try comparing its growth over these period with that of the market. You can use the S&P 500 for these comparisons. Check if it was up when the market was down, or vice versa. This can give you an idea of how the stock will perform over time.

      "content": "Understand the risks of day-trading . Day-trading is different from investing in that day-trading focuses on the short term and is very risky. A day-trader stands to lose significant amounts of money if the bets that they make on the market are wrong or if trading fees eat up all of their gains. In theory, a day-trader could identity patterns that lead to rises or falls in the price of a stock and then profit from these predictions. However, in practice this is very difficult and many day-traders end up losing money and exiting the market. Investors buy securities and hold them for long periods of time with the expectations that they will earn value slowly. Day-traders look for quick jumps and falls in value in the same day or week and trade quickly. Even if trend and pattern analyses are made properly and conservatively, there is still risk that you will lose money on your trades. Be warned that you stand to lose a considerable amount of money if you try to engage in day-trading. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Identify trends . If you do decide to day-trade, the simplest type of pattern you can identify is a price trend. Look for uptrends and downtrends in the price of a stock over daily and weekly periods. However, keep in mind that just because a stock is rising now does not mean it will continue to do so tomorrow, or even in the next few minutes. Another way to identify trends is to study the market itself and the global financial system. Look for relevant news that could move the price of a stock or affect the stability of an industry or economy. [11] X Research source Trend identification, along with the rest of the patterns mentioned, is part of what is known as technical analysis, which assesses market trends to help traders make trade decisions."

      "content": "Look for support and resistance. Support and resistance are terms used by traders to identify prices that a stock usually does not move below or above, respectively. That is, if a stock often gets close to surpassing $40 over a period of time, but never does, the stock has a \"resistance\" at $40. Identifying these levels for a given stock will help you identify prices that the stock will likely not surpass or fall under. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Identify head and shoulders patterns.",
      "content": "Identify head and shoulders patterns. Traders also use several other more complex patterns to identify shifts in price trends. One the most common of these is the head and shoulders pattern. This pattern is formed when a high is reached (the left shoulder) and then the price drops temporarily only to be replaced with a high even higher than the first one (the head). Then, after another temporary drop, another peak (the right shoulder) is reached that is not as high the head. This pattern identifies the end of an upwards trend in the value of the stock. After this pattern, the price is expected to decline. The lows between the head and two shoulders can also be used to draw a \"neckline\" that identifies the point at which you should certainly sell the stock. [13] X Research source"
