      "title": "Ask the subject for permission to write the biography.",
      "content": "Ask the subject for permission to write the biography. Before you dive into your research, make sure you get the okay from the subject to write their biography. Ask them if they are willing to be the subject. Getting their permission will make writing the biography much easier and ensure they are open with information about their life. [1] X Research source If the subject does not give you permission to write the biography, you may want to choose a different subject. If you decide to publish the biography without the subject’s permission, you may be susceptible to legal action by the subject. If the subject is no longer alive, you obviously do not need to ask permission to write about them."

[2] X Research source You may create research questions to help focus your research of the subject, such as, What do I find interesting about the subject? Why is this subject important to readers? What can I say that is new about the subject? What would I like to learn more about?"

      "content": "Conduct interviews with the subject and those close to them.

Interview the subject as well as people close to them, such as spouses, friends, business partners, family members, coworkers, and peers. Conduct the interview in person, by phone, or through e-mail. [3] X Research source For in person interviews, record them with a tape recorder or a voice recorder on your computer or phone.

Or you may have one chapter that focuses on the present and one chapter that focuses on the past, alternating as you go. [8] X Research source Flashbacks should feel as detailed and real as present day scenes. Use your research notes and interviews with the subject to get a good sense of their past for the flashbacks.
