      "title": "Place 1 tbsp (14 g) of filling in the center of a round dumpling wrapper.",
      "content": "Place 1 tbsp (14 g) of filling in the center of a round dumpling wrapper. Use a spoon to scoop out the filling of your choice. Pile it as close to the middle of the circular wrapper as possible. [1] X Research source You can use any type of filling you’d like, such as pork or veggies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Brush water around the entire outer edge of the wrapper.",
      "content": "Brush water around the entire outer edge of the wrapper. Dip a pastry brush in water, then run it around the outside edge of the wrapper. This moistens the edge so it sticks together better and the dumpling won’t fall apart. [2] X Research source If you don’t have a pastry brush, use your finger dipped in water instead. Use enough water so that the edge is moist but not completely saturated. If it’s too soggy, the wrapper will rip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold one side of the wrapper over onto the other side.",
      "content": "Fold one side of the wrapper over onto the other side. Line up the edges as you fold the dumpling wrapper in half over the filling. Make sure the edges are perfectly aligned and that one edge isn’t hanging over the other. This creates a half moon shape. [3] X Research source Don’t pull too hard on the wrapper or you’ll tear it. If you’re having trouble folding it over, you might need to remove some of the filling."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make pleats along the joined edges of the wrapper to seal it.",
      "content": "Make pleats along the joined edges of the wrapper to seal it. Start at one corner of the open side of the wrapper. To make the pleats, fold tiny sections of the dough over onto itself as you pinch the 2 edges together. This creates an effect that looks like a folded fan. Continue the pleating and pinching until the entire open side is sealed. [4] X Research source Pinch the dough tightly as you work your way around the edge so that none of the filling falls out when you cook the dumplings. You can make your pleats as big or as small as you’d like them."

      "title": "Pile 1 tbsp (14 g) of filling into the middle of a round dumpling wrapper.",
      "content": "Pile 1 tbsp (14 g) of filling into the middle of a round dumpling wrapper. Set a scoop of filling in the center of the wrapper and pack it as tightly as you can into a pile in the middle. If it’s too spread out, it will be difficult to fold the wrapper up. [5] X Research source Choose whatever type of filling you prefer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use a pastry brush to moisten the outer edge of the wrapper.",
      "content": "Use a pastry brush to moisten the outer edge of the wrapper. Brush water around the outside of the wrapper with a pastry brush. Avoid getting the wrapper too wet or soggy. Use just enough water so the dough is damp. [6] X Research source You can also dip your finger in water and run it around the edge if you don't have a pastry brush. Instead of water, you can also use an egg wash. Beat an egg yolk and brush it around the wrapper."

    {
      "title": "Press the opposite edges of the wrapper together halfway up the dumpling.",
      "content": "Press the opposite edges of the wrapper together halfway up the dumpling. Bring 2 opposite sides together and pinch them between your fingers to seal them. Stop when you get to the center of your filling so that half the wrapper is closed and half of it is still open. [7] X Research source If you're struggling to pinch the wrapper over the filling, remove some of the filling so you have more space to fold the dough."

    {
      "title": "Bring the middle of the open edge up to meet the fold at the top.",
      "content": "Bring the middle of the open edge up to meet the fold at the top. Pull the open edge up into the center of the dumpling so that it intersects the point where you stopped pinching the fold. As you do this, the wrapper will form 2 new open edges on either side of the middle. [8] X Research source Be careful not to stretch the wrapper too hard or it will rip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seal each of the 2 remaining open edges by pinching the dough together.",
      "content": "Seal each of the 2 remaining open edges by pinching the dough together. Find the 2 edges that form a \"Y\" shape with your original fold. Pinch the edges together on each open side, just like you did on your first fold, so that the dumpling is sealed in a triangle shape with a point at the center. [9] X Research source If the edges pop open, pinch them more firmly or brush a little more water onto them to help them stay sealed."

      "content": "Mix 2 cups (256 g) of flour and 1/2 teaspoon (2.8 g) of salt together. Pour the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Then whisk them together until they’re thoroughly combined. [10] X Research source Don’t substitute any other type of flour, like whole wheat, for the all-purpose flour. Otherwise, the texture of the wrapper will be too dense. You can use either a whisk or a spoon to mix the dry ingredients."

      "content": "Use your hands to knead the dough for about 3 minutes. Push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand, then fold it back over itself before rotating the dough and repeating the pushing and folding. Continue kneading until the dough is stretchy and smooth but not sticky. [12] X Research source If your dough is dry and cracking, sprinkle in a little more water to moisten it. You may need to let the dough cool for 2 to 3 minutes before kneading it if your hands are sensitive to heat."

      "content": "Cover the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for 30 minutes. Wrap the dough tightly with plastic wrap and set it somewhere that is room temperature. Wait at least 30 minutes to let the dough soften. [13] X Research source Use a kitchen timer or the clock app on your phone to keep track of the time."

Do this until the dough is the shape of a small ball. [14] X Research source For larger wrappers, pinch off more than 2 tbsp (28 g) of dough. For smaller wrappers, use less."

Then, roll it out using a rolling pin until it’s no more than 1 ⁄ 16 inch (1.6 mm) thick. Check that the entire wrapper is an even thickness. [15] X Research source To prevent the dough from sticking, sprinkle flour onto the flat surface before rolling your wrapper."

      "content": "Continue rolling and flattening spheres until you’ve used all the dough. Once you’ve shaped your first wrapper, pinch off another 2 tbsp (28 g) of dough, roll it into a sphere, and flatten it with the rolling pin before repeating again. When you’re finished, you’ll have about 30 wrappers. [16] X Research source Store the wrappers in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 7 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months."
