Start by simply opening the game, clicking \"Single Player,\" and then clicking \"Create New World.\" Note that these instructions are for the single-player mode. You can turn a single-player game into a multiplayer LAN game from the pause menu. However, hosting an online server is a little more complicated â€” see our relevant article for information about online play."

Type in any combination of letters and numbers here. Whatever you type in will be the \"seed\" that the game uses to generate your world. The text you type in doesn't have to be anything specific. For example, \"123456789\" is just as likely to give a good result as \"Cleveland.\" Note that you can use negative numbers (e.g., \"-10571284\") as well. [2] X Research source"
