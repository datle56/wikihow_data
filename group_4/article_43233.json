      "content": "Regular means you ride with your left foot in front. This is also called “normal footed,” says Bry. It’s the most common footing, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best—just popular! With this stance, your right foot goes in the back and does most of the stabilizing, while your left foot steers from the front. Often, people who are right-handed ride regular, but not always. If you’re comfortable riding with either your right or left foot forward, you’d say you ride switch ."

      "title": "Goofy means you ride with your right foot in front.",
      "content": "Goofy means you ride with your right foot in front. Bry tells us that people who ride with their right foot forward ride “goofy.” Here, your right foot does most of the steering, while your left foot stabilizes from the back. As a name, “goofy” isn’t rude or derogatory, it just means “different,” since goofy riders are less common than regular riders. Some say the term “goofy” originated from a Disney short film, where the character Goofy is featured riding a surfboard with his right foot forward. Others say it came from surfing culture, where right-footers were described as “goofy.”"

      "title": "Slide across a slippery floor in your socks.",
      "content": "Slide across a slippery floor in your socks. One common method, Bry says, is to “push [your] way across the floor and try to slide a little bit.” First, put on some slippery, non-grippy socks and find a slick surface, like hardwood floor. When you're ready, get a running start, then plant your feet and let yourself slide forward and come to a stop. Look at your feet—the one you put forward should be the one you put forward on your board. For example, if you put your right foot forward while sliding, you probably have a goofy stance. If you led with your left foot , you probably use a regular stance. This test has a small risk of slipping and falling, so only do it someplace that's clear of furniture, obstacles, and other people. If you're worried, you can always wear a helmet or try one of the other tests."

      "title": "Ask a friend to surprise shove you from behind.",
      "content": "Ask a friend to surprise shove you from behind. “The standard way,” Bry says, “is to push [someone] from the back when they don’t know what’s coming.” Tell a friend that you want them to come up behind you in a few minutes and surprise you with a gentle shove. Ask them to pay attention to which foot you step forward with. The foot that you stick forward to catch yourself should be in the front when you ride. For example, if you step forward with your left foot , you probably have a regular stance. If you step forward with your right foot , you probably ride goofy ."

      "content": "Play a game of tug-of-war with a few friends. Or, tie a rope or cord to a heavy object and pull. After a few seconds of pulling as hard as you can, look at your feet. The foot that you put forward should be the one that you put forward on your snowboard as well. [1] X Research source For example, if you tend to put your left foot forward while playing tug-of-war, you probably have a regular stance. If you put your right foot forward , you probably use a goofy stance."

      "content": "Climb a set of stairs and see which foot you start with. Walk to the bottom of a set of stairs. Stand close enough so that your next step will be on the first step. Now, start walking up the stairs. The foot you step with first should be in the rear on your snowboard. [2] X Research source This test is a little different than the others, because here, your starting foot is often your stronger one, and you want more power in the back of your board. For example, if you step with your right foot first , you probably have a regular stance. If you step with your left foot first , you likely use a goofy stance . Try not to focus too hard on the test so you don’t influence the results—wait for the next time you have to use stairs, rather than heading right to the bottom immediately."

The foot you use to kick should be in the rear when you're on your snowboard. [3] X Research source Again, this is because that’s your “power” foot, which you want in the back for stability. For instance, if you find that you naturally kick with your left foot, you probably have a goofy riding stance. If you kick with your right foot, you ride regular stance."

      "content": "Stand on the pedals while riding a bike. Next time you’re out pedaling around town, stop the pedals so that they’re at an even height and stand up as you ride. This emulates a snowboarding stance, and whichever foot is on the forward pedal will be the foot that’s forward on your board. [4] X Research source For example, if your left foot is in front, you probably have a regular stance. If your right foot is in front, you probably ride goofy ."

Bry tells us that if you skateboard or surf, the stance you use for these sports is almost always the same one that will naturally suit you when snowboarding. For instance, if you put your left foot forward when you ride your longboard, it's very likely that this regular stance is what you should use for snowboarding as well."

      "content": "Try different stances, and use whichever feels most comfortable. These are all just tests, and they don’t really match the experience of snowboarding. Even though they’re pretty reliable, you might find that your own stance doesn’t match your results. Start with the stance given to you by these tests and stick to it for your first 2-3 snowboarding sessions. But if it’s not working, switch it up! Some people who are right-foot dominant ride goofy when most right-foot dominant people ride standard, and vice versa. It’s more of a guide than a rule, so don’t hesitate to break the rule!"

      "title": "Find your stance width.",
      "content": "Find your stance width. Your stance width is how far apart your feet are when you stand on your board. Most boards come with a recommended width for new riders that matches the board’s dimensions, so use that to start. Otherwise, stand with your feet a little wider than your shoulders, so that you’re balanced and stable, then measure the distance between your feet, and write it down. [5] X Research source Measure from arch to arch for the most standard and reliable measurement. Keep in mind that, like many parts of snowboarding, stance width is totally up to you. There are guides and recommended widths, but whatever’s most comfortable is what’s right."

      "title": "Choose how far back on the board you want to ride.",
      "content": "Choose how far back on the board you want to ride. This is called your “setback.” Again, most boards come with a recommended setback indicated on a sheet or on the packaging. Generally, beginners stand in the very center of the board, so install your bindings that way if you don’t want to fuss too much. Pushing your stance back on the board is great for riding powder, but that’s a more advanced skill level. You’ll get there soon! [6] X Research source Meanwhile, a centered stance is great for all-mountain snowboarding , and riders who switch their stances on the fly. Almost nobody rides with their stance forward, unless they’re attempting some tricky stunts. It puts you way off-balance and makes riding a chore."

      "title": "Decide on the angles of your bindings.",
      "content": "Decide on the angles of your bindings. Most bindings have a disc on the bottom with ticks that indicate degrees, usually from -20 to +20, or more. This is for rotating your bindings. Generally, having your feet splayed a little outwards offers the most stability. Position the disc so that the 0 mark points directly to the edge of the board, perpendicularly. Then, rotate the actual bindings so that the arrow on the circular cutout points to your desired angle. [7] X Research source For now, we recommend starting with your back foot at -15, and your front foot at +15 (known as “duck stance”), which is a common learner’s stance. As you get comfortable, tweak your back foot’s angle first, so that it’s more inward, which gives you a more dynamic, front-looking stance."

      "title": "Mount your bindings to the board.",
      "content": "Mount your bindings to the board. Now that you have all your stats, it’s time to attach your bindings. Set them on the board as you’ve decided—make sure they’re the proper width apart, at the right angle, and as far back as you like. Make sure they align with the nearest mounting holes on the board—you’ll see these holes through the discs in the bindings. Set a washer then a screw into each binding hole, then use a screwdriver to tighten them until it’s tight, but not stuck. [8] X Research source As you fasten the screws, work in an “X” pattern on each binding, starting with the top left, then bottom right, then top right, then bottom left, to make sure the binding doesn’t shift too much. Make sure the ratchets of each binding face the nearest tip of the board, rather than facing inward. Then, give it a ride! When you hit the mountain, bring a screwdriver and leave it in your car so you can tweak your bindings after a run, if something feels off or comes loose."
