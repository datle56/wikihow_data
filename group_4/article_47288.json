[1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Hot water opens up your pores, which can cause more pain and irritation. Stick to lukewarm water to remove Icy Hot quickly without any pain. Some people have had success with dipping a cotton ball into olive oil and rubbing it over the affected area to neutralize the Icy Hot. While this isn’t an expert-backed method, rubbing olive oil onto your skin won’t make the pain worse, so it’s worth a try if soap and water doesn’t work. Similarly, some people use petroleum jelly to neutralize the burning sensation of Icy Hot after they’ve washed it off. If you’re still feeling pain after washing off Icy Hot, put a thin layer of petroleum jelly onto your skin."
