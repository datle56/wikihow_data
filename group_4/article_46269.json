Mix it into the dried ingredients like flour and sugar.

      "title": "Reconstitute buttermilk powder to use in a marinade for chicken.",
      "content": "Reconstitute buttermilk powder to use in a marinade for chicken. Buttermilk is naturally acidic, so it tenderizes chicken—no more tough or overdone meat! Reconstitute around 2 cups (470 ml) of buttermilk, but use 25% less water when you mix it with the powder so it's not too thin. Marinate your chicken breasts or tenders in the buttermilk for 10 to 20 minutes. Then, bake or fry the chicken any way you like. [6] X Research source Feel free to add seasonings to the buttermilk marinade. Try chopped chives, dried garlic powder, or a squirt of hot sauce for a little kick. Avoid marinating the chicken in the buttermilk for more than 1 hour because the acid in the buttermilk will cause the chicken to break down."

It's also delicious in frosting for vanilla cake or sugar cookies."

      "content": "Store unopened powdered buttermilk in the pantry for 2 to 10 years. Powdered buttermilk is incredibly shelf stable, especially if you store it in a cool dry place. The length of time you can keep it unopened in the pantry depends on its original packaging—store powdered buttermilk that comes in a non-airtight package for up to 2 years or store powdered buttermilk that comes in an airtight container for up to 10 years beyond the best-by-date. [9] X Research source If you don't want powdered buttermilk taking up valuable pantry space, put it into a bag and vacuum seal it. Then, stick it in the freezer and use it within 10 years of the best-by-date."

If not, transfer the powdered buttermilk to an airtight container and stick it in the fridge. It does start to degrade quickly after opening the package, so plan on using it quickly. [10] X Research source It's a good idea to label the package with the date you opened it—that way you know you need to use it within 4 to 5 days of that date."

If you didn't label powdered buttermilk when you opened it, or you're unsure if a new package that's past its sell-by-date is still good, open it and check it out. Discard the powdered buttermilk if it looks yellow or smells really sour—these are signs that the buttermilk has gone bad. [11] X Research source Don't be tempted to bake with the questionable powdered buttermilk. If you're really in a pinch, substitute yogurt for the buttermilk or sour a little milk to use in your baking recipe."
