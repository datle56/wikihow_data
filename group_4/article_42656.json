During this time, be as responsible as possible at home so your parents are more likely to listen to you. [1] X Research source For instance, you may want to go to a party this weekend but your parents don’t typically let you go out.

      "content": "Choose the parent most likely to understand. Depending on the topic, one of your parents might be easier to talk to than the other.

      "content": "Write a letter or email if a discussion will be heated. Maybe you tried to talk to your parents about this issue in the past, but they refused to hear you out. Remember that sometimes in-person chats are not the best route. Consider emails, texts, or letters if your parents are not good listeners or if you are afraid to talk to them. [3] X Research source For instance, perhaps you have been dealing with depression for a while, but your parents don’t “believe in mental illness.” Write them a letter talking about your experience and how it affects you. Include outside information from trustworthy sources as needed to help you explain your experience. Give them the letter late at night or right before you go to school so they have time to process it away from you."

      "title": "Schedule a time to talk.",
      "content": "Schedule a time to talk. If you would prefer to talk in person, plan the discussion in advance. Check in with your parents in the morning to see when would be a good time to chat.

[7] X Research source Know when tears are inappropriate. If you need to tell your mom that you’re pregnant, crying is understandable.

      "title": "Rely on someone you trust for help or advice.",
      "content": "Rely on someone you trust for help or advice. Your parents may be more likely to trust a knowledgeable third party who can back up your point and provide additional information.

[10] X Research source Say something like “I got a speeding ticket because I was about to be late for my curfew. I’m sorry. I know this will cost a lot of money, but I already talked to my supervisor and she’s going to give me extra shifts on the weekends. I understand if I need to be punished, though.”"

      "title": "Come up with some solutions.",
      "content": "Come up with some solutions. Brainstorm some potential fixes with your parents, and be willing to compromise if they are not fully on your side. Even if you can’t get your way, you may be able to come to a partial understanding. For example, if you want to get a tattoo and your parents can’t understand why, then suggest that if you still want the same tattoo in six months you can talk reopen the conversation again.
