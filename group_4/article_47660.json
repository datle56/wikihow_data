      "content": "Wash off any oil on your face if the nose clip won’t stay on. Makeup, lotion, and body oil are a few substances that can cause a nose clip to slide right off your face. Head to the nearest sink to splash a little water over your face. You could also wipe your nose with a damp cloth. If there is no sink available, dunk your head in the pool or swim around for a bit. [1] X Research source People with oily skin sometimes struggle with nose clips. Take some time to rinse any oil off your nose before heading out to the pool. If you wear makeup, wash your face clean in advance so you won’t have any problem wearing the clip."

      "content": "Turn the nose clip over so its bridge is faceup. The nose clip has a pair of rounded pads that are meant to fit over your nostrils. These pads are connected by a wire that fits against the bridge of your nose. Rotate the clip so the bridge is on top with the pads below it. This will allow you to slip the pads down over your nose without difficulty. [2] X Research source The base version of a Speedo nose clip has an exposed wire bridge. There is also a version where the bridge is covered by nylon like the pads are, making it a little more comfortable to wear."

      "title": "Push against the pads to open up the clip.",
      "content": "Push against the pads to open up the clip. Grip one of the pads in each hand. Gently pull them in opposite directions to spread them apart. Open them up enough so that you will be able to comfortably slip the clip over your nose. [3] X Research source Keep the pads spread apart while fitting the clip over your nose. If you let go of them, they will close back up and could possibly pinch your skin."

    {
      "title": "Lower the clip onto the bridge of your nose.",
      "content": "Lower the clip onto the bridge of your nose. Rest the bridge of the clip over the top part of your nose. Position the pads so they rest against the sides of your nostrils. The clip will most likely feel uncomfortable at first, but that is normal. You can adjust it a little bit so it doesn’t pinch your skin. [4] X Research source If the clip feels very uncomfortable, you could slide the bridge down so it’s closer to the tip of your nose. However, the clip will be a little more likely to fall off while you’re swimming. Note that you could also wear the clip upside down. The bridge would be underneath your nose. Since it isn’t resting on your nose, it will be even more likely to fall off in the water."

      "title": "Press the pads against your nostrils to close them.",
      "content": "Press the pads against your nostrils to close them. Squeeze the pads together until your nostrils are completely closed. Make sure they rest flat against your skin without pinching it. Although wearing a clip feels awkward at first, it shouldn’t distract you while you swim. If the clip feels painful on your nose, gradually pull it back open. [5] X Research source Make any final adjustments, such as lowering or bridge or repositioning the pads. However, keep the pads pressed firmly against the sides of your nostrils."

      "title": "Test the clip’s fit by attempting to breathe through your nose.",
      "content": "Test the clip’s fit by attempting to breathe through your nose. Take a deep breath, then close your mouth. Exhale gently. If you feel any air coming through your nose, then the clip isn’t positioned correctly. Squeeze the pads together until you have no choice but to breathe through your mouth. [6] X Research source Make sure that the clip keeps your nostrils shut. It won’t work if you are able to breathe through your nose! As of 2020, Speedo doesn’t sell nose clips with straps. You may be able to tie a string or something else around the bridge of the clip. Wear the strap around your head, keeping it underneath your eyes so the clip doesn’t come off."

      "title": "Take the clip off by pulling the bridge up from your nose.",
      "content": "Take the clip off by pulling the bridge up from your nose. Lift the clip straight up. In most cases, it will come right off, but if it doesn’t, pull apart the pads. Try to move the pads only slightly, just enough so that you can remove the clip. That way, you won’t have to readjust them as much next time you go swimming. Speedo clips usually retain their shape well. They don’t close unless you push the pads closed. That means you can keep them at the ideal fit between uses."

      "title": "Wash the clip with soap and water when you’re done wearing it.",
      "content": "Wash the clip with soap and water when you’re done wearing it. Fill a bowl with about 1 ⁄ 2 cup (120 mL) of warm water. Add 2 to 3 drops of a mild liquid dish detergent and mix until the water is soapy. Then, wipe the clip clean with a cloth dipped into the water. When you’re done, rinse the clip clean. The clip will come into contact with body oil, chlorine from pool water, and all sorts of other things. Rinse it off after every use to ensure it lasts as long as possible. If you happen to get anything on your clip, including when you’re not wearing it, just wipe it down with soap and water."

    {
      "title": "Dry the nose clip with a soft cloth or towel.",
      "content": "Dry the nose clip with a soft cloth or towel. You could use a dry corner of your swim towel, for instance. Wipe down the entire clip. If you’re able to take care of the clip right away, you won’t have to deal with a wet case when you get home. Dirty towels could have dirt, chlorine water, or other harmful substances on them. For example, if you’re at the beach, you could end up wearing out the clip by rubbing coarse sand into it. Make sure the clip is clean and dry before storing it so that you don’t end up with mold or moisture damage. If you aren’t able to finish cleaning the clip right away, wipe everything dry when you get home."

      "title": "Store the clip in a case when it’s not in use.",
      "content": "Store the clip in a case when it’s not in use. Speedo nose clips come with a case, so you can use that to keep your gear well-protected. The clip will be inside a clear, plastic case when you buy it. Make sure the clip is all dry before putting it back in. Close the case up, then slip it into your bag until you’re ready to go swimming again. [7] X Research source If you lose your case, you can buy another one or get a different resealable container to carry your clip."
