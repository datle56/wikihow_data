    {
      "title": "Examine the quality of the box.",
      "content": "Examine the quality of the box. Real Jordans come packaged in a sturdy box. The lid should fit tightly, with no gaps. There will be an Air Jordan “Jumpman” logo on the lid and also on the side of the box. The printed colors on the packaging should appear even and uniform, with no areas of fading or extra colors. The texture of the box itself will be consistent. [1] X Research source The boxes vary in color and style depending on the year and type of Jordans, so you may want to run a Google image search to see what the current boxes look like."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for spelling errors and logo imperfections.",
      "content": "Check for spelling errors and logo imperfections. Make sure all of the words on the box are spelled correctly. Ensure that the Jordan Jumpman logo appears complete, without any unusual looking proportions or fading. Everything on the box should be aligned properly, with nothing looking unusual or crooked. [2] X Research source If you are unfamiliar with the Jumpman logo, Google the image and make sure the logo on the box looks exactly the same."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for a manufacturing sticker on the outside of the box.",
      "content": "Look for a manufacturing sticker on the outside of the box. All Air Jordan boxes will have an official manufacturing sticker on the side. Check for the accurate style name of the shoe, the shoe size, color combination, and country of manufacture. The text should look uniform and the words will be evenly spaced out and properly spelled. [3] X Research source The sticker should be firmly attached to the box, with no air bubbles underneath. It ought to look complete and easy to read. Fake Jordans will often feature a misshapen or crooked manufacturing sticker. If it is sloppily placed or hard to read, this is a red flag."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm the nine digit style number on the manufacturing sticker.",
      "content": "Confirm the nine digit style number on the manufacturing sticker. All Jordans have a style number listed on the outside sticker. In almost all cases, it will be nine digits long. Check the Nike website for the style number of the shoes you’re interested in purchasing and make sure the style number on the actual box matches what you see on their website. [4] X Research source The style number is usually listed right below the country of manufacture on the sticker."
    },
    {
      "title": "Match the style number of the tag to the one listed on the box.",
      "content": "Match the style number of the tag to the one listed on the box. Locate the small tag on the inside of the shoe. All of the information listed on the manufacturing sticker should also be on this tag. Make sure the information is exactly the same as what’s on the box sticker, especially the style number. The stitching on the tag ought to look uniform and neat. Spelling errors on this interior tag are almost always an indicator of inauthentic Jordans."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the label under the tongue.",
      "content": "Examine the label under the tongue. Jordans have a very specific label under the tongue. Lift up the tongue and check out the underside. You should see the words “greatest player ever” embroidered there. The embroidery should be white, easy to read and look professional."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the proportions of the Jumpman logo.",
      "content": "Check the proportions of the Jumpman logo. Double check the details on the logo located on the back of the shoes (or sometimes on the tongue). The logo should appear crisp and uncompromised. Look at the hands, basketball and feet to ensure everything looks properly proportioned. Nothing should look blurry or smudged. [5] X Research source Fake Jordans may have an uneven or lumpy Jumpman, with poor stitching and unusual proportions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Inspect the detail around the laces.",
      "content": "Inspect the detail around the laces. The spaces between the shoelace tabs should be even. All of the shoelace tabs will be the same size and shape. Make sure they are all attached firmly, with the same amount of tension. Fake Jordans will often have some shoelace tabs that are looser than others. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for high quality stitching.",
      "content": "Look for high quality stitching. Inspect the shoes carefully for neat and professional looking stitching. Everything should look evenly spaced, with no unfinished edges or frayed threads. The stitching on the heel is often a giveaway – if it looks poorly done or uneven, question the authenticity of the shoes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check for a midsole point.",
      "content": "Check for a midsole point. This is where the side fabric transitions into the front of the shoe. It is usually a different fabric and color than the toe section. On real Jordans, the midsole point will be in front of the bottom lace hole. On fake Jordans, the midsole point will often match the bottom lace hole. [7] X Research source View the midsole tips. The “mountains” of the sole molding should be sharp tips, not curved edges."
    },
    {
      "title": "Research the known colorways for that particular type of Jordans.",
      "content": "Research the known colorways for that particular type of Jordans. Go to Footlocker.com or Nike’s own site to find the authentic colorways. Colorways are a color combination that is updated with each new style of shoe. Occasionally there are special edition colorways. If a site or individual seller is selling a colorway that is not listed on any direct Nike supplier site, it is a counterfeit product."

    {
      "title": "Be doubtful of any new Air Jordans that are sold for under $100.",
      "content": "Be doubtful of any new Air Jordans that are sold for under $100. Many of these shoes are limited edition and sell out quickly, so there is no motivation for a seller to drop the price below retail value. It is very rare to find Jordans for under $100. If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make sure the shoes are labeled “100% Authentic.”",
      "content": "Make sure the shoes are labeled “100% Authentic.” If you’re looking at a pair online that are listed just as “Authentic” you should be suspicious. Don’t buy Air Jordan shoes that are advertised as “custom,” “sample,” or “variant.” This indicates that Nike did not commission them. If you’re looking at Jordans online and no style number is included, email the seller to inquire about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm that the shoes come with the right box.",
      "content": "Confirm that the shoes come with the right box. Fake Jordans are often sold in boxes that list details which don’t match the shoes themselves. Real boxes will feature correct colorway descriptions and all style numbers should match. If the shoes you’re considering don’t come with a box at all, purchasing them is not recommended."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid online purchases unless the images are clear and detailed.",
      "content": "Avoid online purchases unless the images are clear and detailed. When buying shoes online , make sure multiple pictures are posted and you can clearly see the detail in each one. If a photo of the interior tag with the style number isn’t included, email the seller to request one. Stock photos of shoes are usually a red flag. The descriptions should be clear, not vague. If the images provided are extremely small, ask the seller for better ones. If they aren’t provided, avoid the purchase."
    },
    {
      "title": "Avoid buying Air Jordans from an overseas seller.",
      "content": "Avoid buying Air Jordans from an overseas seller. Unless you are sure of the seller’s authenticity, avoid overseas purchases. Nike may import from their overseas factories, but they supply from major hubs in the United States and Europe. Most fake Jordans are manufactured in Asia, especially China. Your chances of purchasing fake Jordans go up substantially if the shoes are shipped from Asia."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check seller feedback on sites like eBay.",
      "content": "Check seller feedback on sites like eBay . Look for established sellers with a lot of solid feedback. Avoid buying from sellers who have very little or no customer feedback; the merchandise is most likely inauthentic. Before you bid on a pair of Jordans, do your homework and make sure all of the information and pictures look right. [8] X Research source Trust your gut; if something feels off about the sale, it’s safer to avoid it and buy from someone else."
