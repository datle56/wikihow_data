Even if you’re not quite ready to ask your date to be exclusive, let them know that exclusivity and long-term commitment is your ultimate goal. Be sure to let your date know what you’re looking for early on—it’s important to be on the same page as you move forward together and fully understand one another’s expectations. [2] X Research source Be honest about what you want so that you can each make informed decisions about whether the relationship is right for you. For example, you might say, “The reason I’m interested in dating is ultimately to have a committed relationship with someone, and I feel like there’s a connection between us that I’d like to explore.” Be sure to ask what they want from a relationship so you know what to expect going forward. If you feel like there’s potential for something more to develop between you and your date, let them know. Again, you don’t have to ask them to commit right away—just tell them that you feel a connection and would like to see where things go."

      "content": "Express how you feel about them. Does your date know how much you like them? Make sure they do! If you haven’t made your feelings clear, they might not know that you feel strongly about them. Be transparent about your feelings ; tell your date how they make you feel and the traits you value most in them, and share all the little things they do that really make you smile. [3] X Research source For example, you might say, “I’m blown away by your creativity and talent. I think you’re incredible!” or “Being around you is so much fun. You’re always the best part of my week!” Express your feelings through physical affection as well. Lean close to them when you’re talking, hold their hand as you walk around together, or place a hand on their arm. If you’re unsure whether your date is okay with physical affection, ask. A simple “Is this okay?” is all you need."

Schedule one-on-one time for each other at least once a week, and take a weekend here and there to focus on one another and get to know each other better. Quality time strengthens relationships, so ask your date to spend a little more time with you! [4] X Research source Your time together doesn’t always need to be super elaborate. Rather, simply do everyday things together more often, like making dinner together or watching a movie on your couch. Once you get in the swing of spending more quality time together, ask your date if they’re open to a fun weekend getaway or something special. Don’t forget to unplug! Put your phones down while you’re together so you can give your date all of your attention."

      "content": "Call your date just to talk to them. When you want to be in a relationship with someone, it’s natural to want to hear from them more often. Since phone calls are more personal than texts, call your significant other up for a chat. While dating, you may only call when you’re trying to set up a date and time to meet—so, as you transition into a relationship, show them that you want to talk more. [5] X Research source This doesn’t mean you have to be on the phone all the time—just try giving them a call every so often to show them that you miss them. You might also tell them you miss them over text too!"

Rather than sticking to the same old date activities every time, plan things the two of you haven’t done together every so often. Use your knowledge about their likes and dislikes to plan date nights you know they’ll love. [6] X Research source Look for fun date ideas , like mountain biking or going out dancing in the city. The great thing about changing to a relationship is that you have someone to do exciting things with! When you go out to eat, try new restaurants and cuisines to keep things interesting. If you and your partner have different interests, compromise on the activities you do. Relationships are a two-way street where your opinions matter equally."

[12] X Research source Set aside a specific time for the two of you to talk to ensure that the talk happens and that you don’t have any interruptions. Share what you’ve enjoyed about the relationship so far to show your date that you’ve put thought into this. For example, say, “I think we have a lot in common, and I want to spend even more time with you going forward, so I’d love to make our relationship exclusive. Is that something you might want too?” Remember to gently ask if they're interested in exclusivity. It might help to reassure your date and say something like, \"It's okay if you're not ready yet; I'd just like to know how you feel.\""

If you feel like there’s potential for a long-term relationship, that’s great! [13] X Research source Just enjoy the ride and see where that potential goes. There’s no set amount of time that you need to wait before asking someone to be in a committed relationship, but generally, people wait around 2 or 3 months before asking for exclusivity. The amount of time you wait may vary; if you’ve only just met your date, waiting a couple of months is likely a good idea! If you were already good friends before dating, you might not wait very long before asking for exclusivity."

You’ll likely have to make time for your partner and be available to them when needed—which might be difficult if you have other conflicting priorities. Decide if you have extra time in your week for your partner. If you work 50 to 60 hours a week and barely have time to go on the dates now, moving into a relationship may not be the right move. If you really want to get into a relationship, but you’re too busy, it may be time to decide what you’re going to prioritize and then work on making more time for the relationship if that’s your priority."

Signs they’re interested include: They smile and laugh around you often. Their body language sends signals that they like you; they find excuses to touch you or be close to you. They go out of their way to spend more time with you. They tell you directly that they like you a lot (or even possibly love you).
