      "title": "Cut the gift wrap so that there is enough to go around all sides the card.",
      "content": "Cut the gift wrap so that there is enough to go around all sides the card. Lay the gift card facedown on your gift wrap of choice and then cut around the edges. The cut paper should slightly overlap with the other side when stretched over the surface of the card. [1] X Research source Use a flat surface to reduce crumpling and creasing in unwanted places. [2] X Research source Use sharp scissors to avoid tearing!"

      "title": "Wrap the long edges of the gift wrap around the card.",
      "content": "Wrap the long edges of the gift wrap around the card. Fold in the long edges of the gift wrap around the gift card and toward the middle so that they meet and overlap, and then tape the paper down to secure to the surface. [3] X Research source The tape will help hold the paper’s shape as you continue to wrap. You may use double-sided tape to ensure that no tape is evident on the outside! If using double-sided tape, place it just on the inside of the gift wrap edge and press down to secure onto the overlapping piece of gift wrap. [4] X Research source"

Tie a ribbon around the box to give this gift card an extra special presentation and further secure the lid, or place a premade bow on the top of the box.
