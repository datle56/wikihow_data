Therefore, I'm considering a platoon of monkeys. So that people will look at me and see how mellow and well-adjusted I am compared to these monkeys throwing feces around.” – Robert Downey Jr. “I think that the film was very deep.

      "content": "Get a quick laugh with a short and snappy line. A funny line or joke often relies on the element of surprise to make it funnier. [2] X Research source Short lines can surprise a laugh out of you because they do a lot with only a few words. Here are a few shorter, stupid funny lines to make you laugh: In politics, stupidity is not a handicap. What if there were no hypothetical questions? To err is human. To arr is pirate. Death is hereditary. I want to be unique! Just like everyone else. My favorite cookbook is a takeout menu. Don't sweat the petty things, and don't pet the sweaty things. 6:30 is the best time on the clock… hands down. If history repeats itself, I’m getting a dinosaur for a pet. Is it possible to cry underwater? Running in place will get you nowhere fast. No one will ever be as entertained by us as us. There are no stupid questions, just stupid people. Sausage puns are the wurst. If you’re too open-minded, your brains will fall out. If Cinderella’s shoe fit perfectly, then why did it fall off? Don’t believe everything you think. Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can’t see. I can’t brain today. I have the dumb."

[3] X Research source Her are a few stupid funny one-liners to make you bust a gut: I went to buy some camo pants, but couldn't find any. I used to have a handle on life, but then it broke. When life gives you melons, you might be dyslexic. My father has schizophrenia, but he's good people. The last thing I want to do is hurt you, but it’s still on the list. A dog’s favorite homework assignment is a lab report. They’ve been treating me like one of the family, and I’ve put up with it for as long as I can. A Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean your mother. You know it’s an emotional wedding when even the cake is in tiers. Last night, my girlfriend was complaining that I never listen to her…or something like that. I’m reading a book about anti-gravity, and it’s impossible to put down. I spent a lot of time, money, and effort childproofing my house… but my kids still get in. There’s a lot to be said in his favor, but it’s not nearly as interesting. Our child has a great deal of willpower—and even more won’t power. Russian dolls are so full of themselves. It takes a lot of balls to golf the way I do. I was wondering why the frisbee kept getting bigger and bigger, but then it hit me. I’ve failed math more times than I can count.

Best friends don’t get offended when you insult them. They smile and call you something even more offensive. We’ll be friends til we’re old and senile… Then we’ll be new friends. Real friendship is when your friend comes over to your house, and then you both just take a nap. Crazy friends are the best friends. True friends don't judge each other. They judge other people together. I'd take a Nerf bullet for you. People are like refrigerators: it’s what’s inside that matters. I am an example to others. A bad example.
