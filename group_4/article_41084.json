      "content": "Honey soothes your throat, reducing the severity of your cough. Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of honey to a cup of tea or warm water before drinking. By itself, honey can alleviate pain and help fight illnesses. When combined with warm drinks like tea, it’ll work quickly to suppress your cough and make an irritated throat feel less scratchy. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don’t like tea, you can also simply eat the honey on its own to get the same soothing effect. Taking honey (either on its own or in a drink) before bed can be especially helpful in reducing your cough and getting a good night’s sleep. Never give honey to a child under 1-year-old due to the risk of infant botulism."

      "content": "Gargling will help get rid of the postnasal drip that’s making you cough. Mix ½ teaspoon (3 grams) of salt with 8 fluid ounces (240 mL) of warm water, then gargle with the solution until it’s all gone. Saltwater can kill the germs causing your sinus issues and flush the mucus out of your throat, thus reducing the need to cough. It can also cut down the total duration of your cough! [2] X Research source You can gargle 2 to 4 times each day as needed to relieve your symptoms. It’s especially important to drink lots of water between gargling, so the salt doesn’t dry you out too much."

      "content": "Breathing exercises can calm an overly sensitive coughing reflex. Put a hand over your mouth and swallow. Then, take a small breath in and out. Hold your breath for 5 to 10 seconds before taking more small, careful breaths for 30 seconds, resisting the urge to cough. Finally, take a single slow and steady breath through your nose and repeat the exercise until the urge to cough goes away. Even when you’re not doing exercises, try to breathe through your nose as much as possible and swallow instead of coughing. This can be especially helpful if you’re out in public or class and want to stop coughing quickly. Many breathing exercises target chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but anyone with a cough can use them!"

Consider giving an over-the-counter cough medicine a shot, especially if you’ve already tried every other immediate cure. If you’ve been coughing up mucus, use an expectorant to help expel it from your airways. Otherwise, use an antitussive, which will suppress the urge to cough.

      "content": "Steam moistens your airways, easing your dry cough. When you have a bad cough, take a hot shower with the doors and windows of your bathroom closed. This allows steam to build up, and the humidity from the steam will instantly begin to clear out your sinuses and thin out the mucus there. [9] X Research source If you don’t want to take a bath or shower, just run the hot water and sit in your bathroom for about 15 minutes, breathing in steam. Not only will steam relieve your cough but it’ll also clear congestion and sinus pressure if you’re sick (or have allergies)."

Women should drink about 11 cups (2.6 L) of water daily, and men should drink around 15 cups (3.5 L). [10] X Research source If your throat is sore, avoid acidic drinks that might irritate it further, including orange juice, coffee, and alcohol.

      "content": "Humidifiers keep your airways moist to ease a dry, hacking cough. When the air is dry, it also dries out your throat—possibly even irritating your airways enough to cause a cough. To keep the air moist, set up a cool mist humidifier (or vaporizer) wherever you plan to spend most of your time. Using one in your bedroom at night can be especially helpful to ensure your cough doesn’t keep you up.
