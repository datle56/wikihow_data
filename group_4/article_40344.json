      "content": "Your mind frequently wanders toward that person. If someone is thinking of you sexually, you may find yourself thinking of them , too, either consciously or subconsciously. When someone thinks about you, they send out energy, and if you’re receptive to that energy, you’ll likely start thinking about them, too.

      "content": "Your sudden happiness or excitement is unexplainable. You may be going about your day as usual when you suddenly feel the urge to smile or laugh.

      "title": "You have a sudden, intense need to reach out to them.",
      "content": "You have a sudden, intense need to reach out to them. When someone is thinking of you sexually, you’ll feel drawn to them and crave their attention. You may wake up in the middle of the night and want to talk to them, even if this isn’t your normal behavior. This is likely because they’re already thinking about you, and if it’s late at night, their thoughts might not be that innocent."

      "title": "If you feel like they’re watching you, you may be picking up on their energy.",
      "content": "If you feel like they’re watching you, you may be picking up on their energy. Don’t worry—this isn’t as creepy as it sounds! If you feel like your person is watching you and you know they aren’t nearby, you’re likely picking up on the fact that they’re thinking of you. If there’s a strong connection between the two of you, you may feel their presence and their positive energy."

      "title": "Your energy is heightened when you’re with them.",
      "content": "Your energy is heightened when you’re with them. Even if you don’t know this person well, you experience intense, unexplainable feelings when you’re with them. You may literally feel their energy around you, and your own energy will be very high when you’re in their presence. When they leave, your energy level will plummet and you’ll miss them almost immediately. Your energy level may also coincide with theirs, so you may feel low or high energy depending on how your person is feeling at that moment. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "You experience positive physical sensations throughout the day.",
      "content": "You experience positive physical sensations throughout the day. When someone has sexual or romantic feelings for you, they open up a part of themselves to you and send positive energy toward you, intentionally or not. If you feel a warm, pleasant sensation in your chest, this likely means your heart is accepting those feelings. This sensation may come and go throughout the day, whether you’re thinking of that person or not."

      "content": "You can’t ignore the sexual tension between you two. When you have chemistry with someone, you feel it in your whole body. You don’t choose to be attracted to them; you’re just naturally drawn to them. When this happens, you’re likely picking up on the energy they’re sending out. You won’t be able to ignore the sexual tension between you. [4] X Research source Don’t be afraid to act on your feelings! If you notice the chemistry, they probably do, too. Feel free to flirt or take the next step and ask them on a date."

      "title": "You may feel overwhelmed when you pick up on their thoughts.",
      "content": "You may feel overwhelmed when you pick up on their thoughts. When your subconscious picks up on your person’s sexual thoughts, you may start feeling nervous or shy, even if you don’t consciously know why. If you aren’t normally shy around people, this could be a sign that they’re thinking of you, and your body is reacting. This nervous feeling may be accompanied by a burning sensation in your ears, which some people believe indicates someone has a crush on you . [5] X Research source"

      "content": "It’s like they’re talking to you in your mind. Just like you may feel them watching you, you can also sometimes hear your person’s voice when they’re thinking of you sexually. Depending on the situation, you might hear them say something specific, or you may just hear a faint echo of their voice. Listen to what they have to say, as this may help you figure out what they think of you. [6] X Research source"

In addition to hearing their voice or feeling them watching you, you may also feel physical sensations on your body as if they’re touching you.

      "title": "Erotic dreams are a strong indication of sexual attraction.",
      "content": "Erotic dreams are a strong indication of sexual attraction. Many believe that energy can be exchanged and balanced while dreaming. If you have an erotic dream about your person, they may also be thinking or dreaming of you sexually. This may be their way of communicating their feelings on a spiritual level. [9] X Research source Even if your dreams about them aren’t erotic, Cartagenova explains that it’s a way of energetically connecting with your person: “In a subconscious manner, you’re putting it out there to try to connect with the other person so that they might start thinking of you and becoming interested in you.”"

      "title": "Listen to your intuition about them.",
      "content": "Listen to your intuition about them. If you have a strong, unexplainable feeling that your person is thinking of you sexually, it’s probably true. Your inner wisdom is likely picking up on their feelings. This is especially true if you pick up on the feeling while doing something spiritual, like meditating . [11] X Research source Trusting your intuition can also help you figure out if you have a soul tie with someone. Psychic and spiritual director Jennifer McVey says, “If you have that connection, you’d know exactly where they are and what they’re doing. It wouldn’t be a question. It would be a thought… You would just absolutely know.”"

      "title": "Goosebumps often indicate an influx of energy.",
      "content": "Goosebumps often indicate an influx of energy. When someone constantly thinks about you (sexually or otherwise), their energy may start to merge with yours. When this happens, you may experience goosebumps or tingling out of nowhere. This may feel unpleasant or overwhelming at first because you aren’t used to feeling so much energy at once.

      "title": "Get a tarot reading to determine what they think of you.",
      "content": "Get a tarot reading to determine what they think of you. If you believe in divination, tarot cards can be a great way to figure out your current situation, like what someone thinks of you. Some cards, in particular, are often used to convey sexual content, like the Ace of Wands, Knight of Wands, the Star, Temperance, and the Four of Swords. If you keep drawing these cards, especially when asking about this person, it could mean they’re thinking of you sexually. [13] X Research source If you suspect someone is thinking about you sexually, you can also try asking the tarot cards what their intentions are, like if they want a relationship or just a hookup. This can help you decide if pursuing the person is worth your time."

      "title": "You and your person may have sex in the astral plane.",
      "content": "You and your person may have sex in the astral plane. When you’re deeply connected with someone, it’s possible to experience telepathic arousal. If you believe in the astral plane, you and your person may astral project and have sex through telepathic touch. When this happens, you may also feel the sensations in your physical body. [14] X Research source If you want to telepathically communicate with someone, McVey generally recommends visualizing them “unless you’re not a visual person and it frustrates you and it feels like you can’t do it.” In that case, she says to connect with them in any way you can."
