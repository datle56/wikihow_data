      "title": "“A ways to go” means a long distance.",
      "content": "“A ways to go” means a long distance. This phrase sounds similar to “way to go,” but it has a pretty different meaning. If someone says there’s “a ways to go,” this means there’s a long distance left to travel before arriving somewhere. It can also be used in a figurative way, meaning that there’s a lot of work left to be done before something’s finished. [9] X Research source Here are a few examples: “Did anyone bring any snacks? We’ve still got a ways to go before we get to the next gas station, but I’m so hungry.” “I’m writing a book, but I’ve still got a ways to go before it’s ready to be seen. It’s still a rough draft right now.”"

      "content": "If something “should be the way to go,” it’s the right call. People usually use this phrase to explain the right way to do something, point out the best course of action, or express their opinion about what the right decision is. For example, if you asked someone for advice on how to study for a test, they might say, “I would reread the chapters, then make a study guide and review it with a group of friends. That should be the way to go.” Or, if you were trying to decide between two things and asked for a friend's opinion, they might say, \"I think the first choice is the way to go. It sounds like the better option to me.\""
