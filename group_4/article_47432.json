      "content": "Travel to the Underwater City in the First Sea. To get there, start in the southern part of the First Sea area. Look for a whirlpool between the Frozen Village and the Prison; you’ll find it between three large rocks in the center. Once there, walk into the whirlpool to teleport to the Underwater City. You may need a boat to get there, and you can leave it at a dock attached to one of the large rocks. [1] X Research source You can actually get the Water Kung Fu fighting style in any of the seas (not just the first). If you don’t start looking for Water Kung Fu until you reach the Second Sea, simply travel to the Hot and Cold islands instead. Similarly, travel to the Castle on the Sea if you’re in the Third Sea."

      "content": "Water Kung Fu is worth getting for its power and upgrading potential. Many players recognize Water Kung Fu as one of the best First Sea fighting styles available; it’s good for farming and fighting groups (since all of its moves are area-of-effect). It also deals decent damage with a great range and hitbox as well. Additionally, all of its moves can damage the Sea Beast mini-boss. [10] X Research source Buddha Blox Fruits work well with this fighting style. You can also use the Heavy Water Punch move to dodge PvP and PvE attacks. Water Kung Fu is the most expensive fighting style in the First Sea, but it’s typically worth the money (and effort!)"
