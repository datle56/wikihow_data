      "content": "Look for a Sydney funnel web spider’s tarantula-like body. The highly aggressive Sydney funnel web spider resembles a glossy tarantula and is found in dark, moist environments in South-Eastern Australia. [1] X Research source A bite requires immediate professional medical attention since these spiders have a dangerous bite and symptoms will set in quickly. [2] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Initially the intensely painful bite will show little inflammation or blistering, but the person will sweat, have facial twitches, and may feel tingling around the mouth. Anti-venom does exist, and should be administered at a hospital as soon as possible."

      "content": "Notice the Brazilian wandering spider’s large, hairy body. Brazilian wandering spiders are large, aggressive nocturnal spiders found in South America. They are usually are brown and hairy, with a 2 in (5.1 cm) long body and a black marking on the belly. Wandering spiders build no webs, roam at night, and can be found in banana clusters or hiding in dark environments. [3] X Research source Their bites produce localized swelling and pain that radiates toward the torso, and may be accompanied by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypertension, breathing difficulties and, in males, an erection. Anti-venoms exist to help relieve symptoms, and deaths are rare."

      "content": "Look for a fluid-filled blister to indicate a brown recluse bite. Brown recluse spiders can be many different shades of brown, but they have a violin-shaped marking on their back and long, spindly legs. Their bite initially stings, then deepens into intense pain over the next 8 hours. A fluid-filled blister that turns into a steadily enlarging open sore appears, and permanent tissue damage is preceded by a blue and red “target sign” around the wound site. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Other symptoms include a fever, rash, and nausea. Brown recluse spider bites can produce scarring, but have caused no deaths in the United States. There is no anti-venom, but treatments of bite lesions exist via surgery and antibiotics. If you get a brown recluse bite, see a doctor. They might prescribe antibiotics and antihistamines to prevent infections and control itching and discomfort. You’ll also need a tetanus booster if you haven’t had one recently. If the bite is especially deep or infected, you might need surgery or more advanced wound care to help it heal properly."

      "content": "Keep an eye out for the red hourglass marking on a black widow. Black widows are large, glossy black spiders with a red hourglass shape on their belly. [5] X Research source They are found throughout North America. The bite may feel like a pinprick, and the site of the bite will be slightly red and swollen. Within 30 minutes to a few hours, however, intense pain and stiffness will begin. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Severe abdominal pain, nausea, fever or chills may develop. Black widow bites are generally not fatal to healthy adults because a vaccine is usually readily available. However, if left untreated, people can lose limbs. Black widows and brown recluses are the only 2 types of dangerously poisonous spiders in the U.S. They both reside in warm climates and prefer dark, dry places like closets and wood piles."

      "content": "Take note of the redback spider’s red abdominal stripe. Closely related to black widows, redbacks are found all over Australia, particularly in urban areas. Only female redback spiders are dangerous. These have a black (sometimes brownish) pea-sized body with a red stripe on the upper abdomen and an hourglass-shaped reddish orange marking on the underside of the abdomen. [7] X Research source A redback bite will produce sweating, vomiting, nausea, muscular weakness, and pain, which may be excruciating. Since the invention of redback anti-venom, no deaths have occurred as a result of a redback bite."

      "content": "Get immediate medical care. See a medical professional immediately for treatment, even if you think the bite isn’t serious. After all, it’s easy to incorrectly identify a spider bite. Go to the emergency room or call emergency services if you have signs of a severe reaction, such as severe itching, spreading redness around the bite, dizziness, wheezing, difficulty breathing, nausea and vomiting, or swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. [8] X Research source If you have signs of a severe reaction or anaphylactic shock, use an epi-pen immediately if you have one. If you don’t have your own epi-pen, emergency personnel will likely give you an epinephrine injection followed by antihistamines. It’s a good idea to get a large antihistamine injection as soon as you can, even if you don’t know the type of spider bite. While anti-venom is available in most ambulances, it might be a little while before the proper one can be selected and administered."
