Go to start menu and type “Run” command in the Search bar. Type “msconfig” in the dialog box and then press Enter. (This will open a window on the screen, which is called msconfig window.) In the appeared window, go to the “boot” tab, and check the “safeboot” box. Click “apply” and then close the window. Click “yes” on the system reboot option that appears on the screen."
