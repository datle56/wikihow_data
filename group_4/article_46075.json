      "content": "Complete the online application. The application process includes questions about your personal information, employment history, and countries you’ve visited in the last five years. The application process is fairly simple and straightforward. [1] X Research source The Global Entry application includes a $100 USD application fee which must be paid before you can move on to the interview stage. It’s possible that you may be eligible for a fee waiver if you participate in certain other programs or have specific types of credit cards. For example, the Business Platinum Card from American Express, the Citi AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard, and the Platinum Card from American Express all have fee waivers or discounts. [2] X Research source This fee must be paid once every five years when you renew your program membership."

      "title": "Schedule an in-person interview.",
      "content": "Schedule an in-person interview. You should get a response about your eligibility within just a few days after submitting your application. Once you’ve been notified of your approval, you will be able to schedule an in-person interview. You can choose the location of your interview – most of which are at international airports – though the waiting time can often be 6 months or more. [3] X Research source The actual interview is usually quite short – with just a few questions and then taking your fingerprints. If you get an interview that is months away, you might consider searching another nearby Global Entry office for availability. Some offices also accept walk-ins for interviews."

      "content": "Enter the TSA PreCheck line when going through security. Global Entry membership typically qualifies travelers for the TSA PreCheck benefits. “TSA PreCheck” should be printed on your boarding pass when you check in at the airport. If you don’t see this indicator on your boarding pass, you may need to see an airline agent for assistance. [4] X Research source TSA PreCheck benefits include shorter lines/wait times, being allowed to keep your outerwear on (like shoes, jackets, and belts), and being allowed to leave your computer and liquids inside your bag while going through security."

When you get to your destination airport within the United States, you should find a Global Entry kiosk to begin your customs security process. The kiosk will ask you to scan your passport, answer some questions about declaring goods, verify your fingerprints, and take your picture.

Be sure to keep this receipt in a secure location so you don’t lose it. Typically, the lines for the Global Entry kiosks are much shorter than the regular customs lines."
