      "content": "Review your syllabus. Figure out when all of your exams will be and how much of your grade they are worth. Put these dates on your calendar or planner so they don't sneak up on you! Plan review sessions beginning at least a week in advance of each exam. Ideally, you'll do several mini-reviews well in advance, gradually increase the time in which you study, rather than trying to cram everything into one mega session the night before the test."

      "title": "Pay attention in class",
      "content": "Pay attention in class . This seems like a no-brainer, but actually paying attention while you're in class will help you immensely once exam time comes. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you'll just \"absorb\" knowledge; be an active learner. Try sitting at the front of the class, this will make it easier to focus. [1] X Research source Listen carefully, because teachers often give hints like \"The most important thing about this topic is...\". Or they may just place emphasis on certain words and issues. This is the real key to testing well. The more you absorb the information early on, the less studying you'll need to do."

      "title": "Take good notes",
      "content": "Take good notes . This is easier said than done, but learning how to take good notes will help you immensely once it comes time to study. Write down everything your teacher writes on the board or puts up in slides. Try to record as much of what the teacher says as possible, but don't allow taking notes to distract you so much that you forget to listen. [2] X Research source Review your notes daily, right after class. This will help reinforce the information you just learned."

      "content": "Make studying a part of your habits. Too often, it's easy to view studying as something that only gets done at the last minute in a huge overnight cram session. Instead, try setting aside some time every day to study. Scheduling it just like another appointment or class may help you stay motivated to continue the habit.

      "content": "Turn on the light! Studying in a dark room is not recommended. Add lamps at night, or in the daytime, open the window coverings (open the window a little, too). People tend to study and focus better in a brighter, oxygenated room with little noise."

      "content": "Turn the TV off. While many students believe that they're good at multitasking, such as studying with the TV on or while chatting online with friends, research suggests that this is not true for the vast majority of people. [4] X Research source For better studying performance, eliminate distractions such as TV and loud music with lyrics. Rapidly swapping attention between studying and watching TV makes it more difficult for your brain to prioritize information acquisition."

      "content": "Decide if music is right for you. Music's effect on memory performance varies between individuals. Some studies have found music to aid the memory performance of individuals with ADD/ADHD, while reducing it in individuals without the disorder. Classical music appears to be the most effective in enhancing studying performance. You must determine whether you're better off with or without it. If you do enjoy listening to music whilst studying, make sure you're actually concentrating on the material you have to study for, and not the catchy tune that's playing in your head. [5] X Research source If you absolutely must listen to music, find instrumental music so that the words in the music don't interfere with your studying. Listen to background sounds from nature in order to keep your brain active and prevent other noises to distract you. There are several free background noise generators available online. Listening to Mozart or classical music won't make you smarter or keep information in your brain, but it may make your brain more receptive to receiving information."

      "content": "Focus on your work objectives. What do you intend to accomplish during this session? Setting a concrete study goal may help you. Creating study plans is also a good idea. If 3 out of 5 lessons are easy and can be finished fast, finish them first, so you can spend quality time on the difficult lessons without fretting. Also, keeping a folder for your exam reviews is a good way to keep organized."

      "content": "Reinvent your notes in other formats. Rewriting your notes is great if you're a kinesthetic learner. Mind mapping is the most effective way of doing this. Also, when you re-write something, you will probably think about what you are writing, what it's about, and why you wrote it down. Most importantly, it refreshes your memory. If you took notes a month ago and just found out that those notes will be relevant in your exam, rewriting them will remind you of them when you need it for your exam.

      "content": "Ask yourself questions about your material. This can help you tell if you have remembered what you just studied. Don't try to remember the exact wording from your notes in your answer to yourself; synthesizing that information into an answer is a much more useful tactic.

Cramming the night before is proven to be ineffective, because you're taking in so much information at once that it's impossible to memorize it at all â€” in fact, you'll hardly retain anything. Studying before and going over it multiple times really is the best way to learn the material. This is especially true with things like history and theoretical subjects. [10] X Research source Always study when you have the chance, even if it is only for 15 or 20 minutes. These short study periods add up fast! Study in chunks of 25 minutes using the Pomodoro Technique. After that make a break of 5 minutes; repeat the process 3x, then make a longer pause of 30-45 minutes."

Subjects in the humanities, such as history or literature, may require more information synthesis and memorization of things such as terms or dates. Whatever you do, don't just re-read the same set of notes over and over again. In order to actually learn, you need to take an active role in knowledge creation as well as information review. Try finding the \"big picture\" among what you've taken down or reorganizing your notes by theme or date."

Always remember to ask your teacher if you do not know what she is talking about or if you need more information. The teacher will probably be glad to help. There are often resources at schools and colleges that can help you cope with stress, answer study-related questions, give you study tips and other forms of guidance. Ask your teacher or visit your school's website to learn how to use these resources. Your teacher might let you record your classes if you struggle to focus.

Carefully structure your break and study time. [14] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Usually, 20-30 minutes of study and then a 5 minute break is the most effective method. If you have trouble bringing yourself to study, instead of long uninterrupted sessions, chunk your work into 20 minute periods, taking a 10-minute break at the end of every period. Make sure that you structure the chunks logically so that you're not breaking up concepts across chunks, as this may make it more difficult to remember concepts in their entirety."

Self confidence is important; focusing on how little you've studied or how badly you think you will do on the exam just distracts you from working on achieving success. However, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't study hard. You still need to work at it, even if you have confidence in yourself. Confidence just keeps away roadblocks to success."

It's also a great way to stay motivated. [15] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. If you ask for help from others, don't joke around.

Adolescents, on the other hand, typically require at least 10+ hours. Poor sleep has been found to accumulate (referred to as \"sleep debt\"); in order to make up for prolonged poor sleep habits, several weeks of daily optimal sleep may be required to return to optimal performance. [17] X Research source Don't consume caffeine or any other stimulating substance within 5-6 hours prior to sleeping. (However, if a doctor prescribed you a stimulant to take at a specific time, take it at that time regardless of when you fall asleep, and ask your doctor before changing anything.) Such substances reduce the efficiency of sleep, meaning that even with sufficient sleep time, you may not feel well rested upon waking."
