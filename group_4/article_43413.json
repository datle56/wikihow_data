      "content": "Look for a 3.5–4 ft (1.1–1.2 m) wingspan. While ravens and crows are both black, they differ in size significantly. Ravens are typically much bigger than crows, with a larger body and wingspan. In fact, typically ravens are twice the size of crows.

      "content": "Look for a large head and bill. Ravens usually have a much larger head than a crow, with a long, curved bill. Look for a bill that's equal to or larger than the bird's head. If it has a huge bill, it's most likely a raven. [4] X Expert Source Roger J. Lederer, PhD Ornithologist Expert Interview. 29 April 2021.

      "content": "Check if the bird is alone or in a pair. Ravens usually eat and fly solo or with one other bird, while crows usually fly around with a larger group of birds. Look at the bird and see if it is flying around with other birds or whether it solo or in a pair. [6] X Research source Two or more ravens grouped together is called an \"unkindness.\""

      "content": "Look for glossy and fluffy feathers around the bird’s neck. Ravens have large feathers with a blue, purple, and green sheen. The feathers around a raven’s neck are usually fluffy and beard-like, unlike the feathers around a crow’s neck which are usually more smooth and shiny. [7] X Expert Source Roger J.

      "title": "Listen for a croaking noise.",
      "content": "Listen for a croaking noise. Ravens make a low-pitched and guttural croak or noise that sounds like “gronk-gronk,” while crows make a more traditional “cawing” noise. If the noise that the bird is making is a lower pitched croak, it’s likely a raven. [9] X Research source Listen to raven calls on Youtube to help you identify the noise."

      "title": "See if you can hear a “whooshing” noise as the bird flies.",
      "content": "See if you can hear a “whooshing” noise as the bird flies. Because of the added wingspan, raven’s will often make a “whooshing” noise when they fly. Take notice of whether you can hear the bird when it takes flight. [10] X Research source Since crows are smaller, they are typically silent when they fly."

      "content": "Determine whether the bird is in a rural area. Ravens are scavengers and typically feed on animals found in rural or wooded areas. The birds usually stay away from cities and urban areas. If you’re out in the countryside, the bird is likely a raven. [11] X Research source"

      "content": "Determine if several birds are grouped together. Crows often fly around in larger groups rather than being solo or in a pair. If you see a group of birds flying or eating together, there’s a good chance they are crows. If the bird is solo or in a pair, it's probably not a crow.

      "content": "See if you can hear a cawing noise. Crows make a high-pitched cawing sound. Usually, a crow will call out repeatedly and other crows will often join in. This differs from the raven’s low-pitched croaking noise. [17] X Research source"

      "content": "Listen for a loud clicking noise when crows are defending their territory. This clicking sounds less like a bird call and more like someone clicking with their tongue.

If you see the bird in the city that resembles a crow or raven, it’s most likely a large crow rather than a raven.
