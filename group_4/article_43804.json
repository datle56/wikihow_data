      "content": "Tie the 2 ends of the thread together. A simple knot will suffice as long as the ends don't come apart (here's a quick one- remember the first knot you make when tying your shoelaces? just make that about 2-3 times with the two ends of the thread). [1] X Research source You can experiment with different thread lengths as you become more comfortable with the technique. Do all of this in front of a well-lit mirror."

      "content": "Ensure the wound bit lies in the center and wrap it around your fingers. Push the wound portion towards one hand by widening the fingers of one hand and simultaneously closing the fingers of the other hand (if you're doing this right, your hands will appear to be having a respectful, mock \"conversation\" with each other. When one hand \"talks\" the other will be quiet and vice versa). [2] X Research source Practice the motions until you feel fairly comfortable with the movements of your hands. Usually, a smaller length of thread is easier to work with when you are still practicing your hand movements. A good idea is to practice on your leg since most people have hair on their legs that can be seen/reached easily."

      "content": "Grab the unwanted hair with the thread and pluck out the hair. Open up the loop and hand in the opposite direction that you want to thread (left hand to thread to the right; right hand to thread to the left). Place the twisted section of the thread under the hair that needs removing. Make sure to thread in the opposite direction from which your hair grows. Be patient. This will require lots of practice! Once you are comfortable, move onto your upper lip or other parts of your face that need to be threaded. Avoid doing this on your eyebrows unless you are absolutely confident in your abilities. Remember, your eyebrows are less forgiving of errors than other body parts. Apply aloe vera gel or a cold compress to any areas that feel irritated."
