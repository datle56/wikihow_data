      "title": "Find the broiler.",
      "content": "Find the broiler. Older gas ovens have a drawer at the bottom of the oven that contains the broiling unit. This compartment is commonly called the “broiler drawer.” If your oven doesn’t have a broiler drawer, the broiler is inside the main oven compartment. In this case, the broiling unit will be attached to the top of the oven interior."

      "title": "Arrange the oven rack.",
      "content": "Arrange the oven rack. Most recipes ask you to place the rack 3-4 inches (7.5 to 10 centimeters) away from the broiler. To do so, move the oven rack to one of the top two rack positions. [1] X Expert Source Dorrenda Smith Personal Chef Expert Interview. 26 October 2021. Use a ruler to measure the distance from the rack to the top of the oven. If you’re oven has a broiler drawer, you will not be able to adjust the shelf height."

      "title": "Turn on the broiler.",
      "content": "Turn on the broiler. If you have a gas oven, the broil setting will be the last setting on the temperature dial. Depending on the model, an electric oven can have a “broil” button or a broil option on the temperature dial. To turn on the broiler, simply press the “broil” button or turn the dial to the word “broil.” [2] X Research source Some newer electric ovens have several broiling settings. If the recipe doesn’t specify a temperature, use the highest setting. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Preheat the oven.",
      "content": "Preheat the oven. Close the broiler drawer or oven door. Let the oven preheat for at least five minutes before cooking any food. [4] X Research source Some meat recipes will call for longer preheating times to help sear the surface of the meat."

      "title": "Use the right pans.",
      "content": "Use the right pans. Avoid putting glass or Pyrex dishes under your broiler. These materials may crack or explode when exposed to the high temperatures in a broiler. [5] X Research source Instead, use sturdy metal or cast iron pans. [6] X Research source For example: Cast iron pans are usually preheated with the broiler. These pans are great for searing meat. Metal baking sheets can be lined with foil and used to broil toast or vegetables. Slotted broiling pans have an extra tray underneath that circulates heat and catches draining fat. These trays can be used for any kind of food."

      "title": "Align your food underneath the flame.",
      "content": "Align your food underneath the flame. This method only applies to gas ovens. Once the broiler is on, look inside the oven to find the flames. When you place food in the oven, try to center it directly underneath these flames. [7] X Research source Electric ovens use heated coils instead of flames to broil food. These coils are usually evenly distributed along the top of the oven."

    {
      "title": "Leave the door cracked.",
      "content": "Leave the door cracked. Leaving the oven door or broiler drawer slightly open will allow air and heat to circulate evenly. However, not all oven units will operate with an open door. Check your oven’s manufacturer manual to find out. [8] X Research source If you have small children in your home, leave the oven door or broiler drawer closed to avoid any accidents."

      "title": "Monitor your food closely.",
      "content": "Monitor your food closely. Broilers use high temperatures to quickly sear food. Therefore, most recipes only ask you to broil food for 5-10 minutes. If you leave the food in too long, it could burn or even catch on fire. [9] X Expert Source Dorrenda Smith Personal Chef Expert Interview. 26 October 2021. This is especially true for dry foods such as toast. If your food catches on fire: Turn off the broiler. [10] X Research source Leave the oven door or drawer closed. If the door is open, close it. This will cut off the oxygen supply to the fire. Let the fire burn out on its own. Open a window to ventilate any smoke. Keep an eye on your oven. If the fire gets bigger or the flames start coming out of your oven, evacuate your home and call your local emergency hotline. [11] X Research source"
