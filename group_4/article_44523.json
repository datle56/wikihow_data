Even if the victim is conscious, you should call 911 if they have severe burns, a fast heartbeat, heart arrhythmia/cardiac arrest, a seizure, problems walking or keeping balance, trouble seeing or hearing, red or reddish black urine, confusion, muscle pain and contractions, or difficulty breathing.
