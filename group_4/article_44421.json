    {
      "title": "Wash your skin.",
      "content": "Wash your skin. Before you use the banana peel, you want to make sure that your skin is free from dirt and oils. Use a mild cleanser to clean the affected area, then rinse with cool water. Pat the skin dry with a soft clean towel. Don't scrub or rub your skin too harshly. This will inflame your skin and could make acne worse."
    },
    {
      "title": "Select your banana.",
      "content": "Select your banana. You'll want to pick out a banana that is ripe. It should be yellow with black spots. Avoid bananas that are under-ripe (bright yellow with green tips) or over-ripe (greasy and black). Using a ripe banana will also make it easier to wipe over the acne-affected area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Prepare the peel.",
      "content": "Prepare the peel. Remove the banana from its peel. You won't need to use it to treat acne, so eat it or save it for treating another skin issue. Cut the peel so that it's easy to hold a chunk in your hand. Banana peels contain vitamins A, B, C, E, and contain potassium, zinc, iron, and manganese. These nutrients can calm inflamed skin and reduce acne outbreaks."

    {
      "title": "Rub the banana peel over your skin.",
      "content": "Rub the banana peel over your skin. Use the interior part of the peel that appears white. Take the chunk of banana peel and gently rub or massage your skin with it for about 10 minutes. Every few minutes, you should check to see if the peel is still white inside. Once it's turned black, replace it with another piece and continue massaging your skin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let your skin rest.",
      "content": "Let your skin rest. Don't immediately wash your face once you've finished massaging it with the banana peel. If you can, wait until the end of the day to rinse your skin off with cool water. This will allow your skin to absorb the banana peel's nutrients. If you can't wait until the end of the day to wash your face, try rubbing the peel on your face before you go to bed. In the morning, rinse your face with clean water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Continue to treat your skin with banana peels.",
      "content": "Continue to treat your skin with banana peels. While you only need to rub your face with the banana peel once during the day, you should do this for several days in a row. [2] X Research source After a few days, you may notice your acne begin to clear up or at least appear less red. If you notice your skin becomes extremely irritated after using the banana peel, stop using it and give your skin a chance to rest. [3] X Research source Consider seeing a dermatologist if your acne continues or gets worse."

      "title": "Treat wrinkles or cracked heels.",
      "content": "Treat wrinkles or cracked heels. If you have wrinkles you'd like to treat or have very dry cracked heels, use a banana. Apply a mashed banana directly to the wrinkles or heels of your feet and let the puree sit. The bananas will moisturize your skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Specifically, the vitamin E in bananas can make your skin appear less wrinkled. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Create an exfoliating scrub.",
      "content": "Create an exfoliating scrub. Mash one ripe banana in a bowl until it's almost liquid. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of sugar or 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of oats. These will make it easier to apply to your skin and will slough off any dead skin cells. Rinse the scrub off with warm water and follow up with a moisturizer. Be gentle with exfoliating your skin. Never scrub your skin with rough movements, since this can damage your skin. Instead, carefully use your fingertips and apply the scrub in a circular motion."

      "title": "Try a moisturizing facial mask.",
      "content": "Try a moisturizing facial mask. For a quick moisturizing facial mask, take a ripe banana and mash it with a fork until it's somewhat liquidy. Smear this on your face and let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. If you want to add other benefits to the mask, try mixing in one of these ingredients: Turmeric powder: has antibacterial properties that can fight infection Baking powder: can open pores and remove excess oil Lemon juice: can lighten and tone the skin Honey: may kill acne-causing bacteria"

      "title": "Use banana in your hair.",
      "content": "Use banana in your hair. Don't forget that banana is also good for treating hair problems. Mash a banana or two and mix in a tablespoon of honey or a few drops of almond oil. Apply this to your wet hair and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then, rinse off it with water. The banana and honey or oil can moisturize dry and damaged hair."
