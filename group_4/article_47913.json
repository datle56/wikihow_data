Flatten is one of the many tools in Cricut's Design Space software, but you can only use it when you're trying to create a single image out of multiple cut layers.

You can also press Ctrl + Z on Windows or âŒ˜ Cmd + Z on Mac. Note that you can only undo a certain amount of times in Design Space, but it's not noted in Cricut's documentation how many times that is. This method is best if you immediately decide you want to unflatten your image."
