      "content": "Listen to the pronunciation of each word online so you hear how it sounds. Most online dictionaries offer an audio option where you can hear each word. Type the word into the search bar on the website and click on the small speaker icon to hear the word. This is how the announcer at the spelling bee will say the word. [3] X Research source Hearing the word while looking at the spelling will help you recognize how the letters are vocalized. If you're familiar with phonetic writing , you can find the correct pronunciation in the dictionary."

      "content": "Have someone announce the words so you can practice spelling them out loud. Pretend you're standing in front of a microphone just like you would at the actual spelling bee. When your friend or parent reads off the word, ask any questions you have, such as the definition or country of origin, or have them repeat the word. Practice spelling each word aloud. [5] X Research source Having someone read the words for you helps prepare you for being on stage as well as work on spelling under pressure.

      "content": "Familiarize yourself with common word roots to figure out definitions. Many words are made by combining 2 or more roots that give hints on what the word means. A majority of words in English are formed with Latin or Greek roots. Make a list of common roots you find in your words. When you hear a new word, think back to the definition and the root word to figure out the spelling. [6] X Research source For example, the word telephone is made up of the roots “ tele -” which means “at a distance” and “- phone ” which means voice. Knowing these roots can help you spell words like television, telekinesis, or phonograph based on their definitions."

      "title": "Look up the etymology of words online to learn the origins of words.",
      "content": "Look up the etymology of words online to learn the origins of words. Words originating from different countries may have specific rules or patterns that can help you spell the words. For example, words originating from Japan tend to end with a vowel sound or the letter N. Study words that come from various countries and regions of the world to familiarize yourself with their patterns. [7] X Research source Ask a librarian or English teacher to help you find a book to help you learn etymology. Many schools have access to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) that lists the entire history of a word. Ask your librarian if your school or university has an OED login."

If you come across a confusing word, try to guess what the word means based on the rest of the sentence, and then look it up in your dictionary. Make a list of the words you stop for to practice with. [8] X Research source For example, in the sentence, “I noshed on some pretzels,” you may be unfamiliar with the word noshed . Based on the context of the sentence, you can guess that nosh means \"to eat.\" When you look up the word, you'll find nosh means \"to eat a snack.\" Some e-readers have a built-in dictionary that lets you look up words just by tapping on them."

Listen to the announcer carefully so you hear each word. [10] X Research source Practicing spelling in front of your friends and family before the day of the spelling bee can help prepare you for standing in front of a larger audience."

      "content": "Spell words on your palm with your finger to help remember the spelling. Pretend your finger is a pencil and your other hand is a piece of paper. As you hear the word, start writing it out one letter at a time in your palm. This can help you visualize the word better and recognize any mistakes before you spell the word out loud. [11] X Research source Take your time when spelling the word. Once you start saying it out loud, you can't make any changes. Try writing the words with your finger when you're practicing for the spelling bee to get used to the motions."

      "content": "Ask questions about the word if you need clarification. If your spelling bee allows it, ask for the definition, country of origin, and what part of speech the word is so you know what patterns or roots you can expect from your word. If you have trouble hearing the announcer, ask them to repeat the word until you have a clear understanding of it. [12] X Research source Some spelling bees will allow the announcer to use the word in a sentence so you can hear it in context."
