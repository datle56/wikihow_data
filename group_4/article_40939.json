    {
      "title": "Print or sketch a simple design.",
      "content": "Print or sketch a simple design. Choose something with solid, dark lines, so that you can see it through the contact paper when you go to trace it. Even though you will be using clear contact paper, the paper backing will make the design harder to see. This method is suitable for intricate designs and reverse stencils/silhouettes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Trace your design onto a sheet of clear contact paper.",
      "content": "Trace your design onto a sheet of clear contact paper. Tape your design to a flat surface first, then tape your contact paper over that. Trace over the design using a permanent marker. If you are having trouble seeing the design, tape the whole thing over a bright window. Do not remove the paper backing from the stencil just yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut out your stencil.",
      "content": "Cut out your stencil. Remove the contact paper from the template, but don't peel the backing away. Place the contact paper onto a cutting mat, then cut out the designs using a sharp craft blade. If you have any inner designs, save those as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peel the backing off, then stick the contact paper to the t-shirt.",
      "content": "Peel the backing off, then stick the contact paper to the t-shirt. Figure out where you want the design to go first, then gently set the contact paper down. Start at one end, then smooth it down until you reach the other. Make sue that you flatten out any ripples or wrinkles. If you had any cutouts for inner designs, be sure to stick those down as well."

    {
      "title": "Place a sheet of cardboard inside the shirt.",
      "content": "Place a sheet of cardboard inside the shirt. The cardboard only needs to be a little bit bigger than the stencil. This will keep the paint from soaking through the fabric and staining the back of the shirt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply fabric paint over the stencil.",
      "content": "Apply fabric paint over the stencil. Squeeze out some fabric paint onto some sort of palette, then dip a foam brush or a pouncer into it. Gently tap the brush against the stencil; do not drag it past the edges. Avoid using too much paint, otherwise it will loosen the contact paper and leak underneath it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait until the paint dries, then peel the stencil off.",
      "content": "Wait until the paint dries, then peel the stencil off. As the paint dries, run your hand inside the shirt, between the fabric and the cardboard. This will prevent the paint from sticking to the cardboard as it dries. Some types of fabric paint need to be heat-set after they dry. Each brand will be a little different, so be sure to read the label on your bottle of paint carefully!"

      "content": "Trace your design onto the freezer paper. Tape your design to a table first, so that it doesn't move around, then tape the freezer paper on top of that, shiny-side-down. Trace use a pen to trace over your design once more. [2] X Research source If you are having trouble seeing the design through the freezer paper, tape everything to a light table or a bright widow. Make sure that you are using freezer paper, not wax paper or parchment paper."

You can also try using a small pair of scissors. Do not cut past the outline of your design. If your design has an inner shape, save that shape."

Iron the entire shirt using a hot, dry iron. The heat of the iron will cause the freezer paper to stick to the shirt. [3] X Research source Focus on the edges of the freezer paper. If your design has an inner shape, iron that shape to the shirt as well."

Dip your pouncer brush into the paint, then lightly tap it over the stencil. Do not drag it back and forth and do not over-saturate the shirt. [5] X Research source You can apply more than one layer of paint. Wait about 20 minutes before doing so. [6] X Research source You can also use fabric spray paint instead. This is great if you want to use multiple colors for an ombre effect."
