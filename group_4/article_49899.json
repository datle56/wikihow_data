This takes you to a blank design screen with a grid on it and all of your Cricut tools. [1] X Research source If you have other projects that you’ve worked on, these will show up on the screen as well before you select “New Project.” Download the Cricut Design Space onto your Windows or Mac computer, or even an Android, by going to the Cricut website and installing the plugin."

      "content": "Choose “Text” from the sidebar on the left. Click on the large “T” that stands for “Text” on the left side of the screen, right below “Images.” This creates a text box that will contain your writing. [2] X Research source Make the text box bigger or smaller by dragging the lower right arrow on the text box in and out, depending on your preferences."

      "title": "Type your desired text into the text box.",
      "content": "Type your desired text into the text box. Type whatever you’d like to write with your Cricut machine, such as “hello” or “Happy Birthday!” Make the sizing of the words bigger or smaller by dragging the arrow in the bottom right to expand or contract the lettering. [3] X Research source For example, if you're creating writing that will go on a 5 by 5 in (13 by 13 cm) piece of cardstock, you might want the length of your text to be 3 in (7.6 cm) long. The design space has a virtual ruler to help you decide how big or small to make your text."

Select the text box, then click on the dropdown menu in the upper set of tools, which likely says “Normal.” Scroll through the options and click on “Writing.” This tells the Cricut that you're writing something and ensures your text will be solid.

      "content": "Arrange your lettering so it's properly formatted. If you're using more than one text box, drag each one so it's properly spaced according to how you'd like it to look when it's written. Double check that the sizing is correct and that each word is spaced evenly so it can be read."

Once you’ve clicked on it, select the “Cricut” option to show available Cricut fonts, and then select “Writing” by clicking on “Filter” to see the fonts that you can use to write with.

Each time you click on a different pen color, the writing in your text box will change color to match. [8] X Research source Feel free to test out several different colors by creating several pieces of writing in different text boxes to see which one you like best. For example, you might create your text using a calligraphy pen and then another piece of text using a glitter pen to see which one works best."

Then select a different color for each word using the same dropdown menu under “Layer attributes.” [9] X Research source You might create one text box that says, “Get Well” in blue and then another text box with “Soon” in it in metallic gold. Purchase Cricut pens that come in lots of different options from a local craft store or online, such as fine point pens, metallic pens, or calligraphy pens."

Otherwise, select all of your text boxes once they’re in the desired layout and click “Attach” in the bottom right of your screen. This ensures that your layout isn’t changed when you go to create your writing. [10] X Research source To select all of your text boxes and group them together, click outside any of the existing text boxes and drag your mouse across the entire surface area including the boxes."
