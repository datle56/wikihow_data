[4] X Research source Plan in advance -- nothing will kill the mood like a messy room or a roommate who won't stop playing video games. Play some sexy music. Put on some R&B to get your girl in the right mood, or play some jazz in the background. Put it on softly, and don't even act like you had to turn the music on -- it was just always there. Dim the lights. Make sure the lights in your room are dim and soft. You can even light a few candles if it doesn't violate a fire code. There should be enough lights so you two can see each other, but they shouldn't be so bright that your girl feels self-conscious or vulnerable. Keep it fresh. Make sure your room smells nice and clean. Keep your window open the day you know your girlfriend will come over so the room won't smell musty. You can even light incense or a scented candle before her arrival. Keep it clean . Make sure there aren't any dirty clothes or fast food wrappers around -- if your place isn't clean, your girlfriend will be too grossed out to be turned on."

It depends on the girl -- either she'll feel better if you've removed some layers first, or she'll think you're too forward. Feel out the situation to see what she wants. Take off your girlfriend's shirt. Put your hands under her shirt and caress her breasts before you unbutton the shirt or slip it over her head. Take off your own shirt. Don't do more than that or she'll be freaked out, not turned on. You don't want to look too eager or she'll take it the wrong way. Take off your girlfriend's pants or skirt. Gently touch the girl over her underwear -- the key word is gently. Once you've carefully removed the pants or skirt, or have let her help you do it, you can take off your pants or have your girlfriend help you do it if she's comfortable with it.

Kiss her neck, her shoulders, her breasts, her belly, and even the insides of her thighs. Tell her how sexy she is. While you're hooking up, complement your favorite parts of her body or let her know that you like what she's doing. Touch her genitals very gently. Remove her underwear and touch her lightly with just one or two fingers. You can move your hand and then put it back to tease her a bit. Wait for her to tell you she's ready.

You should try not to stick to just one position but mix things up from time to time -- though not so much that she can't get comfortable and you don't have time to settle into a rhythm. Here are some other things to try: Start on top. Get comfortable, and after a few minutes, ask your girlfriend to get on top of you. She may be feeling too shy to do this, so if she doesn't want to, that's okay too. Find your sexual styles. If she's more gentle, slow down. If she's more aggressive, speed things up. Kick things up a notch by lightly biting her neck or her ears. Don't forget her breasts. Some men get so excited by sex that they ignore other parts of a girl's body -- don't forget to caress or kiss your girlfriend's breasts from time to time. Don't obsess over your own orgasm. Make sure your girlfriend has an orgasm too -- or at least try to give her one. If you lose interest after you orgasm, she won't be impressed."
