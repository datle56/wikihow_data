      "title": "Include your name, address, and a title at the top of your will.",
      "content": "Include your name, address, and a title at the top of your will. To make it clear that this is your official will, write a sentence that features all of this information at the top of the page. If this will is replacing a will you wrote in the past, add a statement that revokes all previous wills and codicils that you've written. [2] X Research source A codicil is an amendment to your will that changes your will's instructions. Write something along the lines of, \"I, Lana O'Connor, currently residing at 810 N 18th Street, declare this as my last will and testament, and I revoke all previous wills and codicils that I've written in the past.\""

      "title": "Direct your executors to pay for your funeral expenses and debts.",
      "content": "Direct your executors to pay for your funeral expenses and debts. Before you can list your assets, you're responsible for naming who is responsible for paying for your funeral (using the money you've left behind). You're also responsible for naming someone to see that any of your required outstanding debts are paid. This responsibility falls to your executor, which describes the person in charge of enforcing the guidelines and stipulations of your will. [3] X Research source You will officially name who your executor is later on in your will. This would read, \"My executor is responsible for seeing that my debts and funeral expenses are paid for.\""

    {
      "title": "Name your beneficiaries.",
      "content": "Name your beneficiaries. A beneficiary is someone you leave an asset to in your will. [4] X Research source Before you decide on who gets what, draft a list of all of your assets. Then, decide who will inherit what. Make sure to include each of your beneficiaries' full names and other identifying characteristics, i.e. \"my husband\" or \"my child.\" To simplify the process, you can also simply name your spouse or children as the sole beneficiaries of your entire estate. [5] X Research source Your assets account for everything you own, including your bank accounts, your house, your car, and things like jewelry, clothes, and family heirlooms. Assets can also refer to properly like stocks, royalties, and bonds. [6] X Research source An example of how to leave an asset to a beneficiary would read, \"I leave my jewelry collection to my daughter, Annette Langley.\" You might also say \"I bequeath my jewelry collection...,\" as this is another term for leaving an asset to someone. You don't have to list every single one of your assets if you don't want to. After listing everything you plan to include in your will, leave the rest of your assets to someone by naming them as the beneficiary of your residuary estate. An example of how to leave your entire estate to a sole beneficiary would read, \"I leave my entire estate to my partner Robert Langley.\""

      "content": "Choose a guardian and a conservator for your minor children. If your children are minors at the time that you're writing your will or you think you may have kids in the future, name a guardian who will be responsible for them upon your death. Include their full name and other identifiers to avoid any confusion. If you're leaving assets to your children, name a conservator (a person appointed to handle someone's assets) to manage the assets they inherit until they are 18. [7] X Research source To name a guardian, write, \"If my wife Suzanne Allen does not survive me, I appoint my sister Tina Rodriguez as the legal guardian of my minor children.\" To name a conservator, write, \"If my wife Suzanne Allen does not survive me, I appoint my brother Albert Rodriguez as the conservator of my minor children's assets until they turn 18.\" Talk to the people you name as guardians or conservators ahead of time so that they can consent to the role."

Make sure that this person is comfortable with the role before naming them, as it is a lot of work. [8] X Research source Include something like, \"I appoint my brother Ralph Harmon as executor of my estate.\" Just in case, you might include an alternate executor. Add an additional line, such as, \"If Ralph Harmon does not survive me or is ineligible for serving as my executor, then I appoint my friend Leila Simmons as executor of my estate.\""

They are also responsible for signing the will themselves to verify that they were present. To make sure your will is valid, opt for witnesses that are not beneficiaries in your will. They also need to be at least 18 years old under California law. [10] X Research source Make sure your witnesses add a date next to their signatures to make it valid. You don't need a notary under California law, just 2 witnesses. [11] X Research source"

If you get remarried or acquire new assets, write a new will to accommodate these important changes. As an alternative to drafting a new will, amend your current will with a codicil. To do that, you'll need the signature of 2 witnesses, your signature, and the day's date. [12] X Research source An example of a codicil would read, \"I, Kate Smith, currently residing at 5309 SE 78th Ave, declare that this is a codicil to my last will and testament.\" Include the date of when your original will was signed to make your codicil irrefutable."

Pick 2 witnesses and make sure to include their signatures if you go with this option! Be extra careful while you fill out these forms. Crossing out words or whiting out typos will make your will invalid. If you mess up, print out another form and start over."

To find a reputable estate lawyer, search online for one in your area or seek out a recommendation from your family and friends.

      "content": "Write a holographic will if you don't have any witnesses. A holographic will is a handwritten option that doesn't require witnesses. To make this will valid, handwrite your will in legible handwriting (typing it will make it invalid in California) and include your name and address on each page. [15] X Research source A holographic will might be more vulnerable to being contested in court. This is because there were no witnesses to attest to the fact that you were mentally competent and not under duress when you wrote it."
