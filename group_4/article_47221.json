      "title": "Start with a kitten heel or short chunky heel.",
      "content": "Start with a kitten heel or short chunky heel. Practice wearing a low heel that's no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) high. You can select either a slender or chunky heel as long as the shoes feel comfortable. Wear these frequently so you get used to wearing shoes with a slight heel. [1] X Research source Once you feel confident wearing the short heel, switch to shoes with bigger heels."

      "title": "Switch to wedges with a 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) heel.",
      "content": "Switch to wedges with a 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) heel. Begin to train your arches by wearing higher heels. Since you're still getting used to the height, choose wedges since they have a lot of support. This will help you keep your balance. [2] X Research source If you'd like even more support, choose wedges that have an ankle strap in the front."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear stilettos that have a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) heel.",
      "content": "Wear stilettos that have a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) heel. Instead of going for the tallest stilettos you can find, try to pick a pair that's just a little taller than then wedges you just got used to wearing. Then wear the stilettos for a few days or until your feet get used to them. [3] X Research source Even though you may be comfortable wearing kitten heels or wedges out of the house, practice wearing the stilettos at home since you won't be wearing them for long periods of time starting out."

    {
      "title": "Move up to a higher stiletto heel.",
      "content": "Move up to a higher stiletto heel. If you'd like to wear an even higher heel, look for a stiletto that has a 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher heel than the stilettos you just got used to wearing. Continue to train the arches of your feet and work your way up to higher stilettos. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stand up straight.",
      "content": "Stand up straight . Not only will standing straight and tall boost your confidence while wearing stilettos, but it will also help counter-balance your weight. This is important because wearing stilettos pushes your center of gravity forward. [5] X Research source If you pitch your weight forward, you'll put stress on the balls of your feet. This can cause back or knee pain."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your feet from heel to toe.",
      "content": "Place your feet from heel to toe. Position your feet so the heels touch the ground first, then the balls of your feet, followed by your toes. Try to arch your feet slightly as they hit the ground to keep your feet positioned in the shoes. Keep practicing to get into a heel-to-toe rhythm. [6] X Research source It's okay if you have to slow down a little in stilettos. Walking slower can make you appear more confident."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take small steps when you walk.",
      "content": "Take small steps when you walk. If you're used to taking long strides, make the effort to shorten your steps. This will support you in an upright position and make it easier to walk heel to toe. You'll probably also need to walk a little slower as you focus on your steps. [7] X Research source Heels automatically shorten your stride, so you'll have to get used to shorter steps."

    {
      "title": "Relax your hips and knees so they're not stiff as you walk.",
      "content": "Relax your hips and knees so they're not stiff as you walk. Instead of locking your knees and gripping your thighs as you walk in stilettos, try to keep your joints loose. Don't be afraid to sway your hips a little since this will help you balance and glide through your feet. [8] X Research source If you find that you're wobbly or your stilettos hit the ground very hard, you need to loosen up more so your joints don't stiffen up."

      "title": "Imagine walking in an invisible straight line.",
      "content": "Imagine walking in an invisible straight line. Ensure that you're not looking down and focusing on your feet as you walk. Look up and choose a point in the distance. Then visualize walking in a straight line to that point. [9] X Research source Focusing on where you're going instead of how your feet are looking will also make you feel more confident."

    {
      "title": "Check that the stilettos fit properly.",
      "content": "Check that the stilettos fit properly. Choose stilettos in your size and put them on. Try to raise your heels up 1 inch (2.5 cm). You should be able to do this comfortably if the shoes fit properly. Your toes shouldn't feel pinched and there should be no gap between the arch of the shoe and your feet. [10] X Research source If you're buying stilettos, place them on a flat surface and tap the sides. The shoes shouldn't wobble or fall over. Consider purchasing stilettos made of a material, such as leather, that will stretch slightly."

      "title": "Place insoles into the shoes.",
      "content": "Place insoles into the shoes. Before you break in a new pair of stilettos or while you're getting used to walking in your pair, place toe gels, moleskin insoles, arch supports, heel pads, or blister strips into the shoes. These will cushion your feet and prevent rubbing that could cause painful calluses. [11] X Research source If you're not sure where to put insoles or supports, wear the stilettos for about 5 minutes and pay attention to wear the shoes are hurting your feet."

      "title": "Tape your toes together to relieve pressure on your feet.",
      "content": "Tape your toes together to relieve pressure on your feet. Use duct or medical tape to wrap your third and fourth toes together. This will reduce the amount of pressure on the nerve between these two toes. [12] X Research source Remove the tape when you take your stilettos off and stretch your toes."

      "title": "Break in the stilettos at home before wearing them out.",
      "content": "Break in the stilettos at home before wearing them out. It's easy to think that once you get used to wearing high heels, you can purchase a new pair of stilettos and wear them right out. Since each pair of shoes is different, your feet need a chance to adjust to the material, fit, and feel of the shoes. Wear them around the house until they feel comfortable. Then you can wear them out. [13] X Research source It's fine to wear stilettos on carpet or rugs in your house. The point is to get your feet used to how the shoes feel."

      "title": "Keep a backup pair of shoes with you.",
      "content": "Keep a backup pair of shoes with you. If you're planning on wearing stilettos to the office or a social event, have a comfortable pair of shoes ready to change into if your feet start hurting. [14] X Research source You can also take breaks and change back into your stilettos throughout the day. For example, commute in comfortable flats and change into stilettos when you arrive at the event or office."

      "title": "Soak and massage your feet at the end of the day.",
      "content": "Soak and massage your feet at the end of the day. Rest your feet after wearing stilettos. Fill a small basin or bath with water and dissolve some Epsom salt in it. Then soak your feet for up to 20 minutes. Once you get your feet out of the water, dry them and massage moisturizer into your feet. [15] X Research source To massage your feet, use your thumbs to rub the balls of your feet using a circular motion. Then massage towards the heels of your feet. Do this as much as you like."
