      "content": "Stand 2–3 ft (0.61–0.91 m) behind the squatter. Get into position after they set their stance but before they lift the barbell off the rack. Stand in a wide stance with your feet a little wider than the lifter’s. [1] X Research source Or, if it feels more secure, use a staggered stance with your front toes between their heels—choose the way that makes you feel stable enough to support them if they need help. [2] X Research source Be sure to stay far enough back that the squatter won’t bump into you when they step back after picking up the barbell. [3] X Research source Also, their hips shouldn’t touch you as they squat down. You’ll use the same technique for back or front squats, although you might have to lower your arm position a little for front squats since the lifter’s elbows will be positioned differently. If the lifter is planning to do a set with a lot of reps, they might prefer that you stand back at first, then move into place once they give you a signal or start showing signs of fatigue. Talk about their expectations before you get started."

Stand close enough that your forearms are under their armpits, but not so close that your body touches theirs. [4] X Research source You can leave your hands open or closed. Some spotters prefer to use a closed fist, especially when spotting female athletes, since it’s a little less invasive. [5] X Research source Try to keep your arms in the same spot throughout the whole move. Don’t move them forward, backward, up and down, or out to the sides—this could throw off the squatter’s concentration and cause them to fail the lift. [6] X Research source Don’t hold your hands under the bar. Your goal is to support the squatter—trying to grab the weight if they fail is dangerous."

Try to keep the same pace so your body stays lined up with theirs and your arms stay in the same place. Once they hit the bottom of the move and start standing up, push up through your feet and stand with them. By keeping your body aligned with theirs, you’ll be in a better position to assist them if they need it. [7] X Research source Pay close attention during the upward movement of the squat, since this is when the lifter is most likely to need help. [8] X Research source"

If the squatter gets stuck at the bottom of the squat, their form starts to fail, or they struggle to stand all the way up, wrap your arms around their torso for assistance like you’re giving them a firm hug. Then, push up through your legs so you’re both lifting together. As you assist them, move at their pace so they can complete the rep. [9] X Research source If you prefer, you can hook your arms up into their armpits, pressing your hands into their shoulders as you lift. This can be especially helpful if it feels like they’re falling forward. If they fail completely, they may need to ditch the weights. Be sure you talk before the lift about how they’re going to ditch if they need to fail, which way they’ll drop the barbell, and what signal they’ll give you so you can get out of the way. Don’t try to catch the barbell if the lifter fails their rep—support the lifter, not the weight. [10] X Research source"

That way, if the lifter fails, the spotters can catch the barbell, sharing the weight and supporting it while the lifter gets out of the way. [12] X Research source Alternatively, the side spotters can hold one arm under the barbell, catching it in the crease of their arm if it falls. [13] X Research source If someone is squatting a really heavy weight, like an experienced lifter testing their one-rep max, it’s safest to have 2 or 3 spotters instead of just one."

The main spotter will follow the same technique as a single spotter above, moving with the athlete and supporting them if they fail.

It’s important to know beforehand what type of lifting the squatter will be doing so you’ll know what kind of support they might need. For instance, if they’re testing their one-rep max (1RM) or they’re new to lifting, they could fail on the very first rep. But if they’re planning to do a longer set all the way to failure, they might not need assistance until they’ve done a number of reps and start to get fatigued.

But in some cases, like sets with a lot of reps, the lifter might prefer that you wait to move in until they start feeling fatigue. Talk about this ahead of time, and if they want you to wait, establish what kind of signal they’ll give you when they’re ready for you to get in place.

It might be obvious when the squatter needs assistance if they get stuck at the bottom of the squat, but to be on the same side, talk to them about how they’ll let you know when they’re failing. Keep it simple—good options might be the words “Help” or “Spot.” [17] X Research source Avoid relying on non-verbal cues. A lifter might grunt because they’re straining, for example, but that might not be a signal that they need assistance. It’s also a good idea to clarify exactly what help you’ll give them if they need it. For instance, you might say, “Ok, if you give the signal, I’ll move my arms in, put my hands on your shoulders, and we’ll lift together. Are you comfortable with that?” [18] X Research source"

[19] X Research source Say something like, “I’d rather you not drop the weight at all if you can avoid it. But if you do have to, what signal will you give?” If they’re doing a front squat, where the weight is in front of them, they’ll need to drop the weight forward. Move backward quickly to clear the area. [20] X Research source If they’re doing a back squat, it will be dangerous for them to drop the weight backward since you’ll be behind them. Let them know they should avoid this—but if they do need to drop the weight, move backward quickly. As they drop the weight, they should move forward."

If someone asks you to spot them during a squat and you’re not sure that you’d be able to effectively assist them, it’s okay to say no. Similarly, if you’re not comfortable with the physical closeness involved—or even if you’re just focused on your own workout—you can politely decline. Say something like, “I’m not really comfortable with that right now,” or “Sorry, I’m new to lifting and I don’t think I could support that weight if you needed help.” You could also pose an alternate suggestion, like, “I’m not sure I’d be much help as a back spotter, but if you can find someone else, I’d be happy to team up with them as a side spotter.”"

Personal trainer Melody Sayers says “the proper way to do a squat is to take a nice wide stance with your feet hip-width apart and toes pointed straight ahead. Sit your butt back like you’re sitting in a chair, and keep all the weight heavy in your heels so you don’t fall forward.” Inhale as you lift the bar, take one or two steps back, then plant your feet into the floor to set up for your squat.

If it’s taking a lot more effort to finish a rep, you’re probably close to failure—try to stop before you reach fatigue so you don’t injure yourself or your spotter. If you decide to stop before your set is finished, signal your spotter that you’re done, then rack the weights."

They’ll be supporting your body, not the bar, so the weight could fall on you or them, leading to injury. If you feel yourself failing a rep, dig deep and allow your spotter to push you up to a standing position, then safely rack the weight together."

If you do have to let go of the weight, give your spotter the signal that you set up in advance so they’ll know to get out of the way. Wait until they’re clear of the area, then release the weight in the safest way for the type of squat you’re doing. [22] X Research source If you’re doing a back squat, the safest way to bail out is to let the weight roll backward and down to the floor while you move forward. If you’re doing a front squat, the safest way to bail out is to let the weight fall forward as you jump backward. Dropping weights is loud, which can be distracting to other athletes. It also risks damaging the equipment or gym floor. Whenever possible, try to finish your rep rather than bailing out."

It can be helpful to have a spotter if you’re pushing a new limit, like when you’re testing your one-rep max, or if you’re recovering from an injury. But if you can safely bail out of a squat, you don’t really need a spotter when you’re lifting a weight that’s comfortably within your range."
