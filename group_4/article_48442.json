      "title": "Express your sincere concern with a simple condolence.",
      "content": "Express your sincere concern with a simple condolence. It might sound generic, but it lets the grieving person know you’re sympathetic to what they’re going through. Keep it simple for acquaintances, or add more thoughtful support for someone closer to you.

Go to source “I’m so sorry to hear about your loss.” “I’m sorry to hear this horrible news.” “I’m saddened to hear about what happened. I’m keeping you in my thoughts.”"

      "title": "Show sympathy without comparing their feelings to your own experience.",
      "content": "Show sympathy without comparing their feelings to your own experience. “I know how you feel” can make someone feel less understood or more alone. Everyone grieves differently, and even if you’ve experienced loss, the grieving person’s circumstances and dynamics are different than yours were. [2] X Research source “I can’t imagine how difficult this must be for you.” “I won’t pretend to know how you’re feeling. I’m always here if you want to talk.” “I can’t even fathom how much this hurts. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.”"

      "title": "Use the word “died” to show you're OK to talk about death.",
      "content": "Use the word “died” to show you're OK to talk about death. Many people have an instinct to dance around what happened to avoid sounding insensitive. Be direct and show you’re open to talking about death and dying. Chances are the grieving person will open up more if you feel at ease with the subject. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source “I’m so sorry to hear your brother died.” “I’m so sad to hear Beverly died yesterday. I’m thinking about you!” “I just heard about your aunt dying. I’m so sorry.”"

      "title": "Acknowledge the gravity of the loss without offering the “upside.”",
      "content": "Acknowledge the gravity of the loss without offering the “upside.” Positive phrases like “At least they’re not suffering anymore” or “You have so much still to be thankful for” might seem comforting, but they do little to console a grieving person who wishes their loved one was still with them. [4] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source “This is so sad! Please know I’m always here for you.” “This must be devastating for you. I’m so, so sorry.” “I can’t believe this horrible news. I’m keeping you in my prayers.”"

      "content": "Ask how they feel to check in and gauge how to continue the conversation. It’s a simple way to start a conversation if you’re unsure what else to say. Notice how they respond—they might want to talk about light, distracting things, or they may be ready to talk about how they’re really doing. [5] X Research source “How are things going for you today?” “How are you holding up?” “I hope you’re doing OK today.”"

      "title": "Let the bereaved know they’re in your thoughts while they grieve.",
      "content": "Let the bereaved know they’re in your thoughts while they grieve. Many people in grief have a hard time reaching out and need others to put in the effort. Tell them you’re thinking about them when you hear the bad news, but also in the following weeks and months as they adjust to life without a loved one. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source “I’m thinking about you and your family.” “I’m keeping you in my thoughts while you find your way through this.” “I just heard what happened.

      "title": "If they’re religious, comfort the grieving person with a spiritual condolence.",
      "content": "If they’re religious, comfort the grieving person with a spiritual condolence. Someone’s church or faith can be a pillar of support for them during trying times like the death of a loved one. Let them know you’re praying for them or that God will help them through this trying time. [7] X Research source “I’m praying for you and your loved ones.” “May God be with you in this incredibly sad time.” “We’re praying that you find a way to get through this trying time.”"

      "title": "Support someone in grief",
      "content": "Support someone in grief by listening to their stories and feelings. A sympathetic ear goes a long way towards making someone feel better since many people need to talk or vent aloud to navigate their grief. Let them know you’re a safe space for them to let it all out and focus on listening non-judgmentally. [8] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source “I’m here for you, whether you need a shoulder to cry on or just someone to talk to.” “You can always hit me up to chat. Please don’t hesitate to reach out.” “I’m here to listen anytime. If you ever want to talk, just let me know.” It’s best to be a listener rather than a speaker to ensure you’re not saying anything offensive while letting them know you want to help them through the grieving process."

      "title": "Offer to do a favor or run an errand for the grieving person.",
      "content": "Offer to do a favor or run an errand for the grieving person. Asking “How can I help?” is thoughtful, but sometimes it puts pressure on the bereaved to figure out what they need when they’re not sure. Tell them what you’d like to do for them, or offer some assistance and ask if that’s something they’d like.

      "content": "Say kind things about the deceased to share their positive impact on you. It doesn’t have to be super specific if you didn’t know them well.

      "content": "Reassure the bereaved there’s no correct amount of time to grieve. Everyone processes loss differently, but many people feel pressured to “bounce back” quickly.
