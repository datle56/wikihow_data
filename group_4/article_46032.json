When you create a new blank workbook, you'll have a single worksheet called Sheet1 (you'll see that on the tab at the bottom) that contains a grid for your data. Worksheets are made of individual cells that are organized into columns and rows. Columns are vertical and labeled with letters, which appear above each column. Rows are horizontal and are labeled by numbers, which you'll see running along the left side of the worksheet. Every cell has an address which contains its column letter and row number. For example, the top-left cell in your worksheet's address is A1 because it's in column A, row 1. A workbook can have multiple worksheets, all containing different sets of data. Each worksheet in your workbook has a name—you can rename a worksheet by right-clicking its tab and selecting Rename. To add another worksheet, just click the + next to the worksheet tab(s)."

Entering data into Excel is as simple as typing values into each cell. When entering data, the first row of your worksheet (e.g., A1, B1, C1) is typically used as headers for each column. This is helpful when creating graphs or tables which require labels. For example, if you're adding a list of dates in column A, you might click cell A1 and type Date into the cell as the column header."

Or what if you want to fill a column with many of the same values that follow a pattern? As long as Excel can recognize some sort of pattern in your data, such as a particular order, you can use Autofill to automatically populate data into the rest of your column. [3] X Trustworthy Source Microsoft Support Technical support and product information from Microsoft. Go to source Here's a trick to see it in action. In a blank column, type 1 into the first cell, 2 into the second cell, and then 3 into the third cell. Hover your mouse cursor over the bottom-right corner of the last cell in your series—it will turn to a crosshair. Click and drag the crosshair down the column, then release the mouse button once you've gone down as far as you like. By default, this will fill the remaining cells with the value of the selected cell—at this point, you'll probably have something like 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. Click the small icon at the bottom-right corner of the filled data to open AutoFill options, and select Fill Series to automatically detect the series or pattern. Now you'll have a list of consecutive numbers. Try this cool feature out with different patterns!
