Germs on the stud could transfer straight to your nose, so make sure the stud is clean. It's a good idea to use a saline solution or a mild antiseptic solution to make sure the area is really clean but you can use hydrogen peroxide or plain soap too. Either way, make sure that the cleaner is washed off and the stud is dry before inserting it."

      "content": "Insert your L-shaped nose stud. An L-shaped stud is a simple piece of metal with a decorative end and a 90 degree angle at the other end. To insert it you will first need to find the hole in your nose. Push the end of the stud, the opposite end of the decorative end, in the hole making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole. When you're sure that the end of the stud is through to the other side (you can feel the inside of your nose to make sure that it is) gently push the rest of the stud in, angling the stud to get the bent part of the stud through the hole. Feel free to do this slowly, pushing only a little bit at a time. The L-shaped nose stud is fully in when the decorative end of the stud is up against the outside of your nose."

You should be able to see the end of the L-shaped stud inside your nose. The end that is inside your nose should be pointing straight up or down, depending on your preference, and you shouldn't be able to feel it. If you can feel it or its just uncomfortable, readjust it's position.

      "content": "Remove your L-shaped nose stud. Taking out your L-shaped nose stud is simple if you remember that inside your nose the stud is bent at a 90 degree angle. This means that as you pull it out of your nose, while holding onto the decorative end, you will need to angle it down to get the bent portion through your piercing hole. Once the bent portion is through, you can just remove your nose stud. Remember to take your time, as a nose piercing can be sensitive to pressure and force. Once again, make sure your hands and the area around the piercing are clean before handling your nose stud!"

It can be a little more difficult to insert than other types of nose studs because it is twisted in an unusual shape. To insert it you will first need to find the hole in your nose. Push the end of the stud, the opposite end of the decorative end, in the hole making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole. When you're sure that the end of the stud is through to the other side (you can feel the inside of your nose to make sure that it is) slowly push a little bit more of the stud in while simultaneously twisting the stud so the spiral of wire flows into the hole. The L-shaped nose stud is fully in when the decorative end of the stud is up against the outside of your nose."

      "content": "Insert your hoop nose stud, also known as a nose ring. A hoop-style stud is a simple piece of wire that has been shaped into a circle, with a small gap between the ends of the wire. To insert it you will slip the opening in the hoop over your nostril, taking one of the ends of the hoop and putting it in your nose. The goal is to put the end of the wire that is in your nose through the piercing, going from inside out. This may take a little bit of feeling around with the ring but you should be able to push it through the hole, making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole. Gently rotate the ring through your piercing until the opening of the circle is at the bottom of your nose. There are several styles of hoop nose studs, ones that close the gap with a bead and ones that have a ball at one end of the gap that keeps the hoop in your nose. Either way, inserting and removing the hoop is similar. If you have a bead attachment, this is when you will pop it into place between the two ends of the ring. If you have the other style, just simply keep rotating your nose hoop until the ball at the end is up against the inside of your nose."

Like when you put the stud in, remember to have clean hands and a clean area around the nose stud! When purchasing a hoop nose stud, remember that the diameter of the hoop needs to be at lease as long as the distance between your nose piercing and the bottom of your nostril, so that it will fit easily around your nostril."

Feel free to do this slowly, pushing only a little bit at a time. You will know when the end of the stud is through to the other side, as the decorative end of the stud will be up against the outside of your nose."
