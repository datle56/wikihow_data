Some people suggest cutting off the moldy sections and using the rest of the vegetable, but that isn’t a good idea.

Enjoy your carrots within 2-3 weeks after storing them in the refrigerator. [14] X Research source You can also transfer your baby carrots to a sealable container or wrap them up tightly with a piece of plastic wrap or aluminum foil. The key is making sure that they don’t dry out! Baby carrots are pre-peeled, which makes them more prone to drying out than whole, unpeeled carrots."

If you’re in a rush, stick the carrots in a cool water bath. Just be sure to drain and replace the water every 30 minutes so it stays cold! Keep an eye on the temperature of your carrots as they thaw. Bacteria tends to rapidly form in temperatures higher than 40 °F (4 °C)."
