For example, it cannot encourage members to contact politicians either in support or in opposition to legislation. The religious organization cannot participate in political campaigns. Although a church might invite a political candidate to speak, it should provide an opportunity for opposing candidates to speak as well. The organization’s purpose and activities cannot be illegal.
