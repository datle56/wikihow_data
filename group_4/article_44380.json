If your property has a lot of feral cats around and you want to get them spayed or neutered, you can start a regular and controlled feeding routine. Put food out at the same time and place daily. Food is usually the easiest way to get feral cats to come into your vicinity.

Instead, stay outside and sit quietly in a chair nearby after putting out the food. Stay extremely still and remain quiet while the cat feeds.

      "title": "Obtain a live trap.",
      "content": "Obtain a live trap. The safest way to trap a feral cat, or a wild animal of any kind, is to use a safe live trap, such as the Havahart brand. A medium-sized trap should be fine for most feral cats and raccoon-sized animals. Most brands of live trap work essentially the same way, but follow the instructions particular to the model you get. A live trap has openings at both ends and a basic trigger in the center on which to put food. When the cat enters the cage and triggers the trap, the doors shut, enclosing the cat inside the cage. It's easy to transport and comfortable for the cat. In some cities, spay and neuter organizations will provide live traps to borrow for people hoping to bring cats in. Research your options locally if you don't want to buy one yourself."

      "title": "Make an appointment to get the animal spayed or neutered.",
      "content": "Make an appointment to get the animal spayed or neutered. Set up the appointment a few days before you try to trap the cat to give the animal time to get used to the trap and give yourself enough opportunities to catch the animal. Make sure that the vet will use dissolving stitches, so that the cat will not need a return visit before you release it back to the colony. Let the veterinarian know anything you know about the cat, such as its sex, any health issues you might've noticed, and whether or not you have any idea about the cat's age."

      "content": "Feed the cat in the trap for a few days before the appointment. [5] X Research source Gradually move the food you are feeding the feral cat into the trap. You can open the doors of most live traps without setting them, allowing an animal to pass freely in and out of the trap without actually trapping it. You might consider setting out the food at the regular time to let the animal get used to the cage and let it get some of its scent and pheromones in the space to make it more comfortable."

      "title": "Prepare your holding area before setting the trap.",
      "content": "Prepare your holding area before setting the trap. You will need a quiet, protected spot to keep the trapped cat before the clinic appointment and after the surgery. It should be a place where the temperature is mild (anesthesia renders them with less ability to regulate their body temperature), protects them from other animals. Make sure it is also quiet and free of disturbance. A spare bedroom or any dark area of your house would be appropriate. Closets or finished basements would also do nicely."

      "title": "Withhold food for 12 hours before the appointment.",
      "content": "Withhold food for 12 hours before the appointment. To make sure the cat will be enthusiastic for the food you put out in the trap, as well as not overfed before undergoing surgery, skip a feeding. It might be hard, but resist the urge to put food out before you're ready to trap the cat. While you can withhold food, don't withhold water! Be sure to continue to give the feral cat water even the night before the attempted trapping."

    {
      "title": "Set the trap.",
      "content": "Set the trap. At the appropriate feeding-time (ideally 12-24 hours before the appointment), fold a lightweight cloth lengthwise and insert it to cover the wire bottom of the trap and the trip plate. Put about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of canned cat food (or tuna, mackerel, or some other strong-smelling enticing food) at the very back of the trap. Set the trap and put it on a flat surface where it won't shift or tip prematurely. You can drizzle some juice or oil from the food in a zigzag pattern from the back of the trap towards the front if you want some extra attraction. Alternately, sprinkle a few grains of dry food leading into the back of the trap, but not too much. Consider putting an empty lid or cup in the cage to fill later with water after the cat's been trapped. Make sure the container doesn't have any sharp edges that the cat could get cut on. You can use a turkey baster to fill the lit from a comfortable distance."

      "title": "Wait and watch.",
      "content": "Wait and watch. Don't leave the trap unattended but you don't have to spring into action immediately after the cat is trapped. It can, however, calm the cat down considerably to cover the trap immediately with a blanket or tarp after you see the trap has sprung effectively. Either way, bring the trap inside to your holding area as soon as you notice the cat's been trapped inside. It might thrash considerably, so be careful to keep your fingers out of the openings. The cat may whine and make otherwise terrible sounds that can be heartbreaking. Remember: You're doing the right thing."

      "content": "Carry the cat slowly and gently. When it's time for the appointment, carry the cat very gently and slowly, making smooth movements and keeping your hands far from the openings and gaps in the cage. Drive the cat to the appointment and let the vets take control of the situation. Make sure the veterinary office knows the cat is feral. Speak gently to the cat in a soothing voice and keep the situation calm. Don't play loud music or drive with the windows down."

If this is something that must be done, contact your local animal shelter for tips on other options, or research no-kill shelters in your area if it comes to that."
