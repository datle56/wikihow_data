      "content": "Identify the source of the nausea. Chronic nausea that coincides with monthly menstruation suggests that PMS is the culprit. But there are other causes for nausea, some more serious than others. If your nausea symptoms do not go away after menstruation or become more serious, then see a doctor. Some common causes of nausea include: Medication Inducement : People with sensitive stomachs often have to take medications or vitamins with a small meal or a glass of milk to prevent nausea. If you are currently taking a new medication, consider whether your discomfort is related to that medication. Emotional stress : Are you experiencing a serious personal tragedy or period of intense stress? This can often cause nausea symptoms and absence of appetite. Gastrointestinal infection, or “Stomach Flu ”: These are normally short term and produce nausea, diarrhea, cramping, and vomiting as the primary symptoms. If these symptoms are intense and last for more than 24 hours, it could be a sign of something more serious."
