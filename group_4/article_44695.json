Be sure to get in between your fingers and under your nails! Rinse the cleanser away thoroughly and dry your hands off on a clean towel.

An alcohol-based cleanser is a good option if you want to be certain that you've killed all the bacteria on your hands."

If the gauze sticks to the wound, gently dampen the area with warm water and try again. To prevent the spread of bacteria, put the old dressing into a plastic bag immediately, seal it up, and throw it away quickly.

      "content": "Dab gently around the wound with the gauze or cloth to clean the area. Wipe away any blood, pus, and drainage from the wound and the surrounding area. Go slow and dab gently since tunnel wounds can be painful. If you have a deep tunnel wound, your doctor will instruct you to irrigate it with saline solution when you change the dressing. [5] X Research source Do not irrigate the wound unless your doctor tells you to. Hold the saline irrigation tip 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) from the wound. Squeeze the bottle or plunger to release a steady stream of saline. Sweep the tip from 1 end of the wound to the other and then back again to flush loose tissue, debris, and bacteria out of the wound. Aim to use at least 100 ml of saline fluid.

      "content": "See your doctor immediately if you develop a tunnel wound. You can easily identify a tunnel wound by its “sink-hole” appearance near a primary wound. The “tunnel” appears as the infection eats through the top layers of skin and develops into a curved or S-shaped hole. Tunnel wounds are serious and require medical treatment, so it’s important to see your doctor right away. [12] X Research source Tunnel wounds are notoriously difficult to treat and can take weeks or months to fully heal. Don’t attempt to treat a tunnel wound on your own. [13] X Research source"

Clearly explain to your doctor how you got the primary wound, when the tunneling began, what dressings you’ve been using, all of your current medications, and how much pain you’re in. Use as much detail as possible. If you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or anemia, it’s crucial that you tell your doctor about them. [14] X Research source For example, conditions like diabetes can inhibit the healing of wounds. Your doctor won't be able to properly treat your wound without this information."

      "title": "Allow the doctor to irrigate the wound and diagnose the cause.",
      "content": "Allow the doctor to irrigate the wound and diagnose the cause. The doctor will irrigate the wound with a saline solution to clean it out and examine the wound closely for symptoms that help them make a diagnosis. For example, tunneling caused by infection will be inflamed and continually ooze fluid. Measuring the wound's width and depth helps the doctor fully assess the severity of the tunneling. Your doctor may need to order a CT or MRI to complete the assessment. Then, they will diagnose the cause of the tunneling and prepare a tailored treatment plan for you. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Common causes of tunneling are infection, improper dressing, diabetes, and prolonged use of antibiotics. The type of treatment you need depends on the cause of the tunneling. If your doctor suspects infection, they may perform a swab to identify the type of bacteria present. They can then prescribe the best antibiotic for that type of bacteria. They’ll need to swab the inside of the wound to avoid picking up other bacteria on the surface of your skin. Blood testing is common, especially if you're diabetic or if your doctor suspects you might be. X-rays and ultrasounds can be helpful when diagnosing wounds that won't heal, especially for diabetics or people with chronic bone issues. In addition to irrigating the wound, the doctor might wish to debride it (remove any damaged tissue or foreign materials) with a scalpel or other surgical tools.

      "content": "Watch the doctor dress the wound so you can do it at home. The type of dressing your doctor uses depends on the wound’s size, location, and cause. It’s typical to pack the “tunnel” with sterile gauze to fill the empty space and absorb fluid before applying a covering to protect the wound. However, your doctor may use another kind of dressing, like a hydrogel, foam, collagen, iodine-based, or hydrocolloid dressing, depending on the situation. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Pay attention to how your doctor dresses the wound and ask any questions you have since you’ll have to apply fresh dressings at home. Use the type of dressing that your doctor recommends and apply a fresh dressing when your doctor tells you to. You may need to apply a fresh dressing daily or every 48-72 hours. You may need to pack a tunnel wound for a few days or even a few weeks, depending on how fast the wound closes. You may need to keep the wound covered for 1-6 weeks, or possibly even longer, depending on how quickly and well it heals.
