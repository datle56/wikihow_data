      "content": "Lay the handkerchief with the top two corners horizontal. If it has been recently washed, or has been folded for a long time, you may want to iron it so you can start with it unwrinkled. You can lay it on your dresser if you are in your bedroom, or the kitchen table or countertop. Make sure the surface you lay it on is clean and dry so you don’t mess up the handkerchief. Pay attention to the fabric type and follow guidelines for ironing that particular fabric."

      "title": "Fold the handkerchief in half lengthwise again.",
      "content": "Fold the handkerchief in half lengthwise again. If you are using a small handkerchief or pocket square, you may not need to perform this second fold. It depends on the size of the handkerchief and the size of the pocket you will place it in. If folding it in half a second time makes it too narrow, you can try folding it just a third of the way across on the second fold. If you fold it a second time and it is still too wide for the pocket, then you should consider using a smaller handkerchief."

      "title": "Fold the bottom up almost to the top.",
      "content": "Fold the bottom up almost to the top. You don’t want the part you have folded to stick out of the top of the pocket, so pay attention to how much you should fold it.

      "content": "Stuff the handkerchief fold-first into your pocket. You’ll want to look at yourself in a mirror, or get the help of a friend, to make sure the pocket square is sticking out of your pocket just the right amount. You want roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) or less to be peeking out of the pocket. This look is best for formal, black-tie attire. A white pocket square with a black suit is the perfect look."

      "title": "Stuff the handkerchief into your pocket.",
      "content": "Stuff the handkerchief into your pocket. Gently stuff the flat part of the handkerchief into your pocket, leaving 1-2 inches of the point sticking out the top of the pocket. When you place it into your pocket, the folded parts should be against your chest. Ideally, the bottom of the handkerchief will rest on the bottom of the pocket, but it depends on the relative size of the pocket and handkerchief. This style works best with a solid color pocket square. The one point fold is good for formal or semi-formal occasions."

      "content": "Stuff the handkerchief into your pocket. As you fit the puff into your pocket, it may take a little more adjusting than other pocket square folds. Stuff it to the bottom of your pocket, then gently pull out a couple of inches. Adjust the shape to your taste. The puff fold is not good for formal occasions. Use it to add a touch of classiness to a casual suit in non-formal settings. Feel free to use a patterned handkerchief as this fold is casual anyway."
