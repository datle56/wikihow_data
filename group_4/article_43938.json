      "content": "Choose your rope. If you're only tying your hands, you will need at least four feet of rope . You may find that thin, smooth ropes—even string or twine—are the easiest to work with, but can pinch and really aren't suitable for tying yourself or anybody up. Consider cotton clothesline. If you don't already have rope, you should be able to find something suitable at a hardware store. [1] X Research source Cut the rope to the length that you need. Rope and twine are generally sold in increments much larger than what you'll need to tie yourself up, and you'll be able to do a cleaner job if you buy them cut to size. If you don't want the rope to chafe your wrists, consider avoiding a thin, smooth rope. The thicker and rougher the rope, the more you risk hurting your wrists, cotton clothesline is best for beginners. Some people are allergic to nylon, so make sure that the rope won't irritate your skin."

      "content": "Tie your hands in front of you. Wrap the rope around each of your wrists, and leave the ends of the rope free so that you can make a knot. Be sure to cinch or knot the rope between your wrists so that you can't wriggle free. Imagine that you are using the rope to make a pair of handcuffs : your hands should be tied into separate \"cuffs,\" not one single, easy-to-slip-out-of wrap. When your wrists are wrapped up, tie a square knot , make a double-tied bow, or use another simple, sturdy knot . [2] X Research source Your left palm should be facing down. You should see the rope crossed just beneath your left palm. Place your right palm against the palm of your left hand so that your wrists line up."

      "content": "Put your hands behind your back. If your hands are tied behind your back, it may look more like someone else tied you up. Once you have tied your hands in front of you, bring your bound hands low enough that you can step over them. Lift your legs over the knot so that your hands are bound behind your back. Some people find it easier to tie their hands together when their wrists are already behind their back. Try clasping your wrists behind your back, then attempting to tie the same knot that you would tie with forward-facing hands. Consider using a mirror so that you can see yourself tying the knot. To bring your hands back to the front of your body. To do this, simply bend down, holding your bound hands as low as they will go, and step backward over the knot. You may find it easier to escape from the knot if your hands are in front of you."

      "content": "Consider tying your hands to a fixed object. Tie your wrists together as normal, but also loop the rope around a pole, chair, or bedpost. It may be difficult to tie each wrist separately without someone else's help. You can, however, tie your legs to separate fixtures, then bundle your hands together."

      "title": "Wrap the rope around your torso and your non-dominant arm.",
      "content": "Wrap the rope around your torso and your non-dominant arm. Make sure that it's just a little loose—the rope shouldn't hurt you, but it should be tight enough that it won't slip off. You must wrap the rope with both ends going around you instead of one. When you are holding less than a foot of loose rope in each hand, pull the rope tight. Hold it tight until you are able to tie it."

      "title": "Tie the rope.",
      "content": "Tie the rope. Tie the ends of the rope together using a square knot, a double-tied bow, or any other simple, sturdy knot. Squeeze your free arm into the wrapped rope, as deep as it will go, until you appear stuck. Try wrapping the rope around the area with one hand, then using the other to grab the rope and help out. Tie the ends of the rope with a tight double-knot bow. Consider puffing your chest or stomach out as you pull the rope tight and tie it. This way, all you need to do to loosen the rope is empty your lungs of air and make your torso more compact. You can also flex your arm muscles to make the wrap slightly larger than your natural form. To escape this trap, squeeze the arm that you used to tie the knot. This should loosen the rope so that you can slip out of the wrap."

      "title": "Consider binding yourself in several places.",
      "content": "Consider binding yourself in several places. Use a separate rope for each knot. Try knotting your feet together (with a 2-3 feet of long rope) using the same technique that you'd use for your hands. Consider binding your legs together in the same way, but bear in mind that the rope is likely to slip down your legs. Finally, tie your wrists together, making sure to tie a knot or cinch between them so that the rope doesn't slip off."
