      "content": "Try immobilization. The doctor may put a brace or splint around the joint near the cyst to prevent you from moving that joint.

[15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source There are two equally effective surgical procedures that are used. Open surgery — During this procedure, the surgeon makes a cut about 2 inches long over the cyst and removes it. Arthroscopic surgery —This is a type of keyhole surgery. The doctor makes a small incision and inserts a camera and other instruments through the incision. Using the camera as a guide, the surgeon removes the cyst. Both procedures can be done using either local or general anesthesia, depending upon the recommendation of your surgeon."

[18] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you must wear closed-toe shoes, you should tie the laces or straps looser than usual so the cyst does not get irritated when you walk.

      "content": "Do not thump or drain the cyst yourself. There is an old remedy for ganglion cysts that consists of hitting or thumping the cyst hard with a heavy object. Avoid doing this, as it will likely only damage the tissue around the cyst.
