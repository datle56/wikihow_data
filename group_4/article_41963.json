Look into sports teams or leagues, running clubs, or sewing groups. Do what piques your interest! Start cooking your meals, go to the gym after work or school, or spend more time with friends. If it's too tempting to be in the house, get yourself out of the house during any vulnerable times. Go grocery shopping, visit a friend, or do some volunteering."
