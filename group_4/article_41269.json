      "content": "Remove rings before you shower, swim, or wash your hands. Take off your rings any time you’re doing these activities or any other activity that involves getting your hands wet, such as washing dishes. Try to avoid bringing rings into the bathroom as much as possible because bathrooms are full of moisture and humidity. [1] X Research source Exposure to moisture is the leading cause of rust and tarnish, so keeping your rings as dry as possible is one of the best ways to prevent these reactions. Always try to avoid exposing your rings to humid and damp areas. Naturally, it won’t always be possible to remove your rings before you go into a public restroom or something of the like, but you could take them off and put them in your pocket to keep them dry while you do your business and wash your hands."
