      "content": "Dark brown spots Onion skin is supposed to be one color throughout. A sure sign that your onion has sat out too long is if it has dark brown or black spots anywhere. [1] X Research source While it is safe to cut off brown spots and eat the rest of the onion, if you spot mold (black or green spots), throw the onion away. Your onion might also be bad if it’s soft, mushy, or sprouting. Eating a moldy onion can be dangerous, so if you’re not sure, don’t risk it."

      "content": "Squishy texture Feel your onion: does it feel mushy or like the center is hollow? That likely means that it’s rotting. Fresh onions will have a firm texture that gives slightly but springs back after you touch it. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Sprouting",
      "content": "Sprouting When whole onions sit for too long, they tend to sprout, or grow, out of the top. If you take a look at your onion and see a green leafy sprout up top, it’s probably a bit past its sell-by date. [3] X Research source While sprouting does mean that your onion isn’t super fresh, many people choose to cut off the sprout on top and eat the rest of the onion. However, when an onion sprouts, it tends to taste slightly bitter."

      "content": "Moisture Fresh onions will never release moisture of any kind. If you pick up an onion and it feels wet to the touch or there’s a puddle beneath it, it’s time to throw that onion away—moisture is a sign of rotting. [4] X Research source The liquid will likely be clear or brown in color."

      "content": "Bad smell Pick up your onion and do a sniff test: does it smell sharp and fresh like an onion normally does? Or is there a moldy, rotten odor? If your onion smells off, it’s best to ditch it and grab a new one. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep whole onions in a well-ventilated container. An airtight container will actually make whole onions go bad faster. Instead, keep your onions in a brown paper bag, a wire basket , or a perforated plastic bag. [6] X Research source Onions need airflow to keep them from rotting. If you close them in an airtight container, it’s likely that your onions will get moldy."

      "content": "Store them in a cool, dry spot. Whole onions do well in a kitchen pantry that stays at or below room temperature. If it’s going to be particularly warm in your home, move the onions to the fridge. [7] X Research source Keep onions out of direct sunlight, as the sun will make them go bad faster."

Make sure the airtight container keeps out moisture, then throw them in the freezer with today’s date. [11] X Research source When you’re ready to use your frozen onions, don’t worry about thawing them. Simply throw them into a hot pan or a hot soup and they’ll thaw pretty much immediately. Frozen onions are best eaten cooked, not raw."
