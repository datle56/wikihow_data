[1] X Expert Source Maggie Mitchell Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2021. That way, they’ll have plenty of time to make other arrangements. The news may be disappointing, but it’s more considerate than letting them find out only after they show up on your doorstep. [2] X Research source Try cushioning the blow with a caveat: “As much as we’d love to have you at the house, we’ve just got too much going on this weekend.” Don’t mince words or beat around the bush trying to avoid the topic. This will only come as more of a blow when you finally break the news. [3] X Research source Be clear with your boundaries and expectations: \"I’m so glad you want to come and visit. Here is a list of hotels that are close by and our other visitors have really enjoyed.\" [4] X Expert Source Maggie Mitchell Life Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2021."

      "content": "Drop hints that your home is unavailable. If you just don’t have the heart to refuse your relatives outright, you can take the less direct route. When they first call or write to inform you of their visit, innocently ask them where they plan on staying, or mention how much work you have to do around your place. With any luck, they’ll get the message without it becoming an issue. [5] X Research source You could also try leaving things vague by saying something like “it’s too bad there’s no way for us all to stay together.”"

      "content": "Be ready to give them a good reason. Obviously, it won’t do to tell your overbearing in-laws that you just don’t want them around. Have an explanation lined up for why your home isn’t the best option. It should be something believable and (ideally) at least partially true so that they’ll be more accepting of your circumstances. [6] X Research source Perhaps you’re busy taking care of a newborn, or you’re in the process of remodeling your only guest room. Avoid lying outright. Not only is it dishonest, but there’s a good chance that the truth could come out later if someone were to stop by."

      "content": "Act unprepared. If your family surprises you with a visit, it’s okay to tell them that you’re simply not in a position to receive company. They might even be anticipating this response, since they decided to make the trip on little or no notice. In this scenario, they’ll more than likely already have a backup plan in place, which means you’ll be off the hook. Explain to unexpected guests you have too much going on to show them the attention they deserve. Stay one step ahead by recommending a nearby hotel before they ask to stay with you.

      "content": "Choose your words carefully. Someone less understanding might take offense if they feel like you’re trying to wash your hands of them. Let them down as easily as possible. Emphasize that your request is being made out of necessity rather than preference. You don’t want it to sound like your reasons are personal in any way. [8] X Research source Try to broadcast genuine sympathy and regret in your tone. Chances are, your family knows you better than almost anyone, so they’ll be able to see right through a flimsy apology. [9] X Research source Never make someone feel unwelcome because of their personality or behavior. Depending on your relationship with the person, you could even use some self-deprecating humor to lighten the mood, like “The house is so chaotic right now, you’d probably feel like you’re staying in a zoo!” Reader Poll: We asked 690 wikiHow readers who’ve had to kick someone out, and 54% felt that you should evaluate the situation and the person before using humor to ease the tension.

      "content": "Make sure they enjoy their stay. The last thing you want is for your family to be in a sour mood after going out of their way to come see you. Once everyone has arrived and gotten situated, go out of your way to see that they have a good time. Show them fun things to do around town, share meals together and catch up on the details of everyone’s lives. Make them feel like honored guests, not like an unwanted nuisance. Even if the visit isn’t going well, remember that it’s only temporary and try to power through with a positive attitude. [10] X Research source Successfully talking your relatives into getting their own room shouldn't be used as an excuse to ignore or neglect them. If anything, you should be more eager please since they won’t be around as often."

If you fear that your reluctance might cause conflict, it may be best not to put either of you in the hot seat. Consider coming to them instead, or finding a more neutral way to get together, like a family vacation or reunion dinner somewhere public. Reschedule the visit for a date that’s more convenient for you. If nothing else, this will give you more time to mentally prepare. There may be times when you just have to bite the bullet and make the most of it. After all, family comes first! [11] X Research source"

Make sure the place you select is close enough to your home to allow you to easily meet up. Compile a list of potential options that you can recommend later. [12] X Research source Try to find a place that’s centrally located and surrounded by essential conveniences, like restaurants, banks, gas stations and supermarkets.

Bring up pressing concerns like space, noise or privacy as a way of selling your suggestion. If they agree, it will be a win-win: family will take in family and you’ll be in the clear.

Sponsoring your relatives’ stay will ease some of the financial burden of their travels. It may also help defuse any resentment they may feel toward you for turning them away. Surprising your visitors with free lodging is a good way to make up for you asking them to stay somewhere else. Helping with the cost of your family’s trip can also serve as a kind of unspoken apology—“Since we couldn’t make it work at the house, this one’s on me.”"
