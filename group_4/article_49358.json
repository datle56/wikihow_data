      "content": "Know the various types of cinquain. The Crapsey cinquain structure is more restrictive than an American cinquain. While an American cinquain requires a specific number of syllables per line, the Crapsey cinquain takes it a step further and requires a certain number of stressed syllables per line. [3] X Research source The Crapsey structure goes like this: Line 1 = 2 syllables (1 stressed); Line 2 = 4 syllables (2 stressed); Line 3 = 6 syllables (3 stressed); Line 4 = 8 syllables (4 stressed); Line 5 = 2 syllables (1 stressed). The American cinquain structure goes like this: Line 1 = 2 syllables; Line 2 = 4 syllables; Line 3 = 6 syllables; Line 4 = 8 syllables; Line 5 = 2 syllables."

      "title": "Know what a syllable is.",
      "content": "Know what a syllable is. Syllables are units of pronunciation having one vowel sound. Each word is made up one or more syllables. [4] X Research source The word “it” is only 1 syllable. The word “hello” is 2 syllables (hel-lo). The word “happily” is 3 syllables (hap-pi-ly). If you’re unsure of how many syllables are in a word, there are online services that can help you. The website How Many Syllables is useful. You just type in your word and it breaks it into syllables for you. [5] X Research source Be aware that you only need to worry about syllables if you’re writing a classic American cinquain or a Crapsey cinquain. For instance, a “Word Cinquain” only requires you to count the words in each line, no matter how many syllables are in each word."

      "title": "Scan the poem",
      "content": "Scan the poem to check for meter. Most poetry has a rhythm to it. This is called its “meter” and can be measured by counting the number of stressed and unstressed syllables in each line. Keep in mind that you only need to pay attention to the meter if you’re specifically interested in writing a Crapsey cinquain. William Shakespeare famously used iambic pentameter in his plays and sonnets . Iambic pentameter comprises 10 syllables, with 5 of those syllables stressed. Here is a sample line from Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 73”, with the stressed syllables capitalized: “That TIME of YEAR thou MAYST in ME beHOLD.” [6] X Research source Notice how in iambic pentameter the syllables alternate between unstressed and stressed. You do not have two stressed syllables together in iambic pentameter, although this is possible with other types of meter (for example, spondaic meter). [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Learn how to count stressed and unstressed syllables.",
      "content": "Learn how to count stressed and unstressed syllables. To count the stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry, read it out loud. As you read, clap your hands together each time a syllable feels longer than the others. As an example, think of the noun “rebel” versus the verb “rebel”. In the noun, the first syllable is stressed, like this: REbel. In the verb, the second syllable is stressed, like this: reBEL. As you pronounce the words you should be able to feel which are longer (stressed) and which are shorter (unstressed). If English is not your first language, you can look up the word in an online dictionary to hear the proper pronunciation."

      "content": "Decide on your poem’s theme. This could be anything you want to write about. It could be playful, funny, serious, or sad — it’s up to you. However, remember that an effective poem tells a story, so think about what type of story you want to tell. In this example, the topic will be an evil cat who has fallen asleep on you and just woken up from his nap. Maybe this is a metaphor for someone who feels great anxiety when they wake up each day. Perhaps the cat is a metaphor for the sunlight shining in through the curtains in the morning as you lie in bed."
