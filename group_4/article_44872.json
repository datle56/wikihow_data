      "title": "Consider if you should drain the blister.",
      "content": "Consider if you should drain the blister. Usually, you should leave an unpopped blister alone to prevent aggravating it and making the infection worse. But, if your blister is on a joint and places pressure on it, you may want to drain it. [1] X Research source Draining the pus can relieve the pressure and reduce pain. Keep in mind that you'll need to monitor the blister and keep it bandaged and clean after you drain it."

      "title": "Clean the blister area.",
      "content": "Clean the blister area. To prevent the spread of infection, wash your hands and clean the blister. Wipe the area around the blister with rubbing alcohol or an iodine solution to kill off any bacteria on the skin. You should also disinfect a needle by swabbing it with the rubbing alcohol or iodine solution or holding it in a flame for about a minute."

    {
      "title": "Pierce the blister.",
      "content": "Pierce the blister. Take the disinfected needle and pierce the skin at the base of the blister. This should be near the bottom of the blister. Make several holes so that the fluid can drain out of the blister. Avoid applying a lot of pressure which could cause the blister to burst open. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source You might want to take a cotton ball or piece of gauze to dab or wipe up the fluid or pus that leaks out of the blister. Wash the infected area out with either hydrogen peroxide, saline or soap and water. Do not use alcohol or iodine as they will irritate the wound."

      "title": "Apply an ointment.",
      "content": "Apply an ointment. Once you've drained the blister, you may notice that the overlying skin of the blister looks saggy. Don't pick at this skin which could damage the blister and make the infection worse. Instead, leave the overlying skin as intact as possible. Apply an antibiotic ointment to the drained blister.

      "title": "Cover the blister with a bandage.",
      "content": "Cover the blister with a bandage. Since the wound is technically open, you need to apply a bandage. You could also tape a gauze pad onto the blister. Change the bandage or gauze pad every day so the blister has a chance to heal. [4] X Research source Always wash your hands before and after you change the dressing. Remove the dressing daily before bathing, and allow the water to clean it out in the shower. Pat it dry after the shower and reapply the bandage."

      "content": "Apply garlic paste. Crush a single clove of garlic into a paste. You can also purchase garlic paste, but make sure there aren't a bunch of other ingredients added. Apply the garlic paste directly to the blister. You can also mix the garlic paste with a few drops of castor oil to make it easier to spread. Garlic has natural antibiotic properties which can kill bacteria or viruses that could be infecting your blister. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Use aloe vera gel. Apply a few drops of aloe vera gel directly onto the blister. If you're using gel directly from the plant, you may need to squeeze it out of the leaf and gently rub it over your blister. If you purchase aloe vera gel, choose a product that lists aloe vera as the first ingredient and doesn't contain other fillers. Aloe contains natural anti-inflammatory and antibiotic substances that may help treat the infected blister while moisturizing the skin. [6] X Research source"

It may be easiest to drop the oil onto a cotton swab and gently dab it on your blister. You can also choose a blister ointment that contains tea tree oil and apply it to your blister. Tea tree oil has antibacterial, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. More research is needed to determine how effective tea tree oil is against bacterial, fungal and viral infections.

The skin around the blister will look red and could be swollen or tender. If you have more than three or four infected, don't try to treat them at home. You may need medical attention.
