      "title": "Tell her the truth.",
      "content": "Tell her the truth. Honesty is probably the most important thing to a Scorpio woman. While it's true that honesty is important to pretty much anybody, a Scorpio woman takes it to the next level. For her, a lie is an unforgivable sin. If you want to make the Scorpio lady in your life happy, start with an easy one—never, ever lie to her. This applies to good things as well! A Scorpio woman loves to be admired as much as the next person, but she can smell empty flattery a mile away and she won't be impressed. There's another reason you never lie to a Scorpio woman—she's known to be intuitive, observant, and curious. Chances are she already knows the truth anyway (or will find out soon enough). Eyedealism advises that you \"look her straight in the eye... be accountable, be upfront, be solid, so that there's no room for reproach and there is literally no evil plot.\""

      "content": "Encourage her to pursue her passions. Scorpio women have a reputation for being pretty obsessive about the things they're into. If she's self-conscious about that, she might worry that she's too intense or overwhelming and try to tone herself down. If you express interest when she starts talking about something she's passionate about, she'll definitely notice. Scorpio women also tend to crave understanding, so ask her about her passions. If she's into something you don't know much about, learn about it! She'll be thrilled that you're interested and able to contribute to the conversation. Let her know that her passion is one of the things you love the most about her and that she never has to tone down her excitement for you. Support her with strong follow-up questions about things she's mentioned in the past. She'll appreciate it that you've made the effort to remember something that's important to her."

      "title": "Open up to her so she feels comfortable with you.",
      "content": "Open up to her so she feels comfortable with you. Scorpio women are notoriously private—it can take her quite a while to open up to anyone. But if you open up to her first and show that you trust her and are willing to be vulnerable with her, she'll feel more comfortable opening up to you. She'll see that you trust her if you tell her something that you don't easily admit to anyone else—especially if it's something unflattering about you. At the same time, take care not to push a Scorpio woman to reveal anything about herself before she's ready. You might have to be comfortable with her knowing more about you than you know about her for a while."

    {
      "title": "Show her that you're loyal to her.",
      "content": "Show her that you're loyal to her. A Scorpio woman tends to be pretty cautious about who she lets into her inner circle—but once you're in? She's ride-or-die, and she expects the same from you. Any time you can demonstrate loyalty , she'll know that she made the right choice to stand by you. For example, if you hear someone say something unflattering about her, you might speak up and correct that person's impression or mention something positive about her to focus on instead."

    {
      "title": "Respect her need for alone time.",
      "content": "Respect her need for alone time. Scorpio women frequently need time to recharge, especially after spending a lot of time in public or socializing. It doesn't necessarily mean she's mad at you or that there's anything wrong—it just means her batteries are drained. If you leave her alone when she asks you to, she'll see that you understand her. Ridout notes that Scorpio women tend to value privacy and personal space. If she feels as though you're intruding upon her privacy or personal space, she's likely to distance herself from you. For example, if you text her because you want to hang out and she says she's taking some time to recharge, let her know that you respect her need for that and tell her to text you when she's down to hang. If the two of you live together, you might arrange to go out with friends or work in the library every Sunday afternoon so she has the house to herself to recharge."

      "title": "Express curiosity in her thoughts and feelings.",
      "content": "Express curiosity in her thoughts and feelings. A Scorpio woman's innate curiosity means that she just can't understand someone who isn't curious. And if you're not curious about her? She's going to take it to mean that you're not interested in her. When you ask her questions about her feelings, she'll know that you really like her. Scorpio women tend to have a lot of pride in their opinions, beliefs, and preferences. Look for commonalities rather than insulting her preferences or belittling her taste. For example, if she mentions that she likes metal music and you can't stand it, instead of launching into a rant about how terrible metal music is, you might mention that while you're not a fan you do like a particular song or band."

      "title": "Do your research before you choose a date spot.",
      "content": "Do your research before you choose a date spot. Scorpio women tend to live on the edge—whatever's currently the biggest trend is something they were already over a month ago. That means if you want to impress her on date night, you just need to find the next big thing before anybody else does. No pressure! But seriously, if you do a deep dive on her tastes you can usually find something that she would think was pretty cool, even if it is something she's already seen or done before. For example, if she mentions that she likes sushi, you might compare different lists to determine the best sushi restaurant in your city, then take her to dinner there."

      "content": "Offer her a small, thoughtful gift. Here's what she likes: Something that only you could have gotten for only her. If you can't quite reach that admittedly high bar, look for something with some kind of special meaning that will make her smile. The thought and meaning is the most important part of any gift to a Scorpio woman. She'll also love it if it's something you made yourself or something she can definitely see you in. For example, if you're an artist, you might draw or paint something for her. Look for something interesting, rare, or one-of-a-kind. Scorpio ladies also tend to like things that are a little dark or macabre. Vintage and occult shops are great places to look for little gifts for a lady scorpion."

      "content": "Create space for spontaneity. Scorpio women can have a hard time letting go and taking risks, but in the right circumstances you can unleash her adventurous side. As long as she feels safe by your side, she'll be willing to step out of her comfort zone. Unstructured dates allow you to take advantage of things you happen to see (which you may or may not have planned in advance). For example, you might go out for a walk in the park. While at the park, you see a pottery shop and decide to make your own pottery together. Even though it seems spontaneous, it could be something you'd already planned. Having these little moments on a date can play right into everything a Scorpio woman loves and make her feel as though it was somehow fated for the two of you to be together."

      "title": "Take things slow and let her take the lead.",
      "content": "Take things slow and let her take the lead. It might seem like she's commitment-phobic, but the truth is she takes relationships really seriously—maybe too seriously. She's holding out for the perfect partner she's created in her head and it's going to take her some time to see if you measure up. If you keep pressuring her or trying to move too fast, she'll just get bored and head off in the other direction. Scorpio women are known for having defensive walls up and masking their true thoughts and feelings, especially at first. Have patience and don't take it personally if she's slow to let go of her defenses. It can take her a while to trust you with the most sensitive parts of herself and if you push her to reveal too much too fast, you could push her away. Instead, focus on helping her feel safe and secure with you."

If you have both feet firmly planted on the ground and avoid flights of fancy, you'll get along well with her. A Scorpio woman typically looks for a partner who more or less has their life together. It's not necessarily about you having a lot of money, she just wants her partner to have control over their life as much as possible. Scorpio women also tend to prefer partners who are relatively stable mentally as well. They look for people who have a good grip on their emotions and are fairly even-keeled. They don't want someone who's going to fly off the handle at the slightest provocation."

Regardless of anything, it's likely to take her some time to trust you—throw in even the smallest bit of dishonesty, and it'll take her even longer. You can't have a relationship without trust, and a Scorpio woman can't have trust without honesty. This isn't to say that she won't look the other way when it comes to little white lies that are meant to preserve a good surprise or avoid upsetting someone. But when you're dealing with a Scorpio woman, you need to know that she prefers the truth, even if it will hurt."

[1] X Research source For this reason, Scorpio women tend to look for a partner who's a sexy, sensual person. Passion is never far from her mind, and she wants a partner who also revels in the sensual moments of intimate connection. Scorpio women tend to embrace the spiritual aspects of sexuality as well. For them, sex incorporates all aspects of the mind, body, and spirit. Show your passion for her by kissing her sensually and giving her plenty of physical affection."

They also tend to be very well read, especially since they tend to obsess about anything they're interested in and want to learn everything there is to know about it. Stands to reason a Scorpio woman is going to be looking for someone who is also intellectually curious and enjoys pondering the deep questions. A Scorpio lady likes a partner who she can have deep conversations with and ponder all the biggest questions about life and love together. Scorpio women can also get into the darker side of deep topics and tend to enjoy talking about spirituality, death, and the afterlife."

      "content": "Loyalty and commitment When a Scorpio woman loves, she loves with her whole being—that's an emotional water sign for you—and she tends to expect the same in return. She wants a partner who isn't going to hold back and is always going to be in her corner no matter what. Scorpio women like to know that they can count on their partner no matter what happens. Because they're so slow to trust, they want to know that they're investing in someone who's going to be there for them for the long haul. Demonstrate that you're ready to be there for her by showing up when no one else does (or be eager when everyone else is reluctant). Help her move, go with her to take her dog to the vet, or go meet her on the side of the road and help her change a flat. She'll definitely know you're committed."

When it comes to compatibility , Scorpio ladies typically vibe best with emotional, imaginative fellow water signs (Scorpio, Cancer , Pisces ). As a fixed sign, Scorpio also matches well with the down-to-earth, practical earth signs (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn ). Ridout emphasizes that Scorpios and Cancers in particular are \"highly resonant with one another,\" noting that \"they will understand each other intuitively and emotionally,\" although Scorpio can be slower to express emotional vulnerability.\" Scorpio and Taurus can be a great match because both signs are known for their loyalty and possessiveness.

Air signs (Aquarius, Gemini, Libra) might seem too flaky or take things too lightly for a Scorpio woman to ever feel secure enough to be vulnerable around them. Fire signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius), on the other hand, can be so passionate that they overwhelm her. Of these, she might have the best odds with an Aries partner because the two can bond over sex and power. Leo and Scorpio can also have an intense, sensual relationship, but over time, Leo is likely to make Scorpio jealous."
