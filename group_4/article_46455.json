      "content": "Break disposable wooden chopsticks apart before using them. Take the chopsticks out of their packaging and hold one chopstick in each hand. Pull one chopstick toward you and push the other one back away from you until they snap apart. To avoid hitting any dishes or other objects on the table, lower your chopsticks toward your lap when you break them. [1] X Research source If there are splinters in the chopsticks after you break them apart, rub the chopsticks together to smooth them out. However, keep in mind that this is considered rude in some cultures since it implies that the quality of the chopsticks is poor. Avoid rubbing wooden chopsticks together that have a higher quality than disposable ones, such as ones made of bamboo or lacquered wood. Don’t break off the wooden block at the end of the chopsticks since this could cause them to splinter."

      "content": "Balance one chopstick between your thumb and pointer finger. Take one chopstick and rest it on the webbing between your thumb and pointer finger on your dominant hand. Press your thumb against your pointer finger to tighten your grip and keep the chopstick still. Then, rest the center of the chopstick on your ring finger. This will be your bottom chopstick, and it’ll stay still when you pick up food. Position the chopstick so that only about 2 inches (5 cm) extend past your hand at the top. Holding your chopsticks too low will make it harder to open them wide to pick up food."
