Elevating your head and neck prevents mucus from collecting in your sinuses, which can contribute to a nighttime cough. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cedars Sinai Hospital Website of one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Propping your head up can also be a helpful way to manage a dry cough (a cough that doesn’t produce mucus). [2] X Research source If you’re managing Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), place wooden or concrete blocks under the head of your bed to lift it by 6–9 in (15–23 cm). This angle will help to keep acids down in your stomach so they won’t irritate your throat.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Just make sure that your home humidity levels don’t go over 50%, since this can create mold and dust build-up.

Once your bedding is clean, slip dust-proof covers over your pillows and mattresses to prevent dust mites from collecting on your bedding. [12] X Research source Keeping your bedding clean is important if you have a persistent night cough and are prone to allergies. Dust mites, tiny creatures that eat dead flakes of skin, live in bedding and are a common allergy trigger. If you have an allergy or asthma, you may be at risk for dust mites. You can also wrap your mattress in plastic to keep dust mites away and your bedding clean, or get anti-allergen mattress and pillow covers."

      "content": "Eat a spoonful of honey before bed. Pour out 1 tsp (4.9 mL) of honey and eat it raw, or stir it into a mug of tea or warm water. Since honey has sugar in it, limit yourself to 4–5 tsp (20–25 mL) each day. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Honey is a great natural remedy for an irritated throat, as it coats and soothes the mucous membranes in your throat. Honey also has antibacterial properties; so if your cough is due to a bacterial illness, honey can help to fight off bad bacteria. Never give children less than 12 months old honey, since they could contract botulism, a bacterial infection.

Take a cough expectorant if you’re hoping to cough up more mucus—this type of medication helps to loosen mucus and phlegm in your throat and airways. If you’d rather stop the cough altogether, try a cough suppressant —this blocks your body’s cough reflex and reduces your body’s urge to cough. These are better for dry or non-productive coughs.
