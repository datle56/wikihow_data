      "content": "Do follow the dress code. You’ll most likely get a dress code to follow with your invitation. Many brides-to-be will explain exactly what they expect you to wear at their party with one simple word: casual, semi-formal, cocktail, or formal. Here's what each dress code actually means: [2] X Research source Casual: Think dressing up your everyday look.

      "content": "Do accessorize for the weather and time of day. Before you walk out the door, make sure you check the forecast, so you can style your look to be comfortable all afternoon or night. For instance, leather jackets can add a casual yet formal edge to any look in cooler weather, hats are practical and stylish in the fall and spring, and sunglasses are great for when the sun’s shining. If you’re on the fence about a weather-related accessory, keep it in your car, just in case you want to put it on later."

Ladies, consider bringing a pair of foldable flats you can tuck them into your purse or clutch and change into them whenever."
