      "title": "Hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen during a chemical reaction.",
      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen during a chemical reaction. The chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2. When peroxide encounters an enzyme called catalase, it releases oxygen in a process called oxidation, which causes the fizzing you see. Once the oxygen is released, you’re left with water. Since blood, damaged skin cells, and some bacteria contain catalase, hydrogen peroxide bubbles when you pour it on a wound. [1] X Research source What all contains catalase? Blood, damaged skin cells, certain bacterias, fungi, metals, and organic matter like food and plants.

      "content": "No, peroxide foam doesn’t mean your wound is infected. Hydrogen peroxide bubbles because of a chemical reaction, not an infection. It’s possible that there’s bacteria or a fungus in your wound, but the peroxide can’t diagnose an infection. [3] X Research source If you’re worried about your wound, visit your doctor to get it examined. To check your wound for infection , watch for pain, swelling, redness, and pus. You may also have a fever. [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"

      "title": "The bubbles lift out dirt and dried blood.",
      "content": "The bubbles lift out dirt and dried blood. As hydrogen peroxide oxidizes, the released oxygen naturally irrigates any debris that’s caught in your wound. Then, the water left on your skin from the chemical reaction washes away the debris. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria and fungal spores.",
      "content": "Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria and fungal spores. The peroxide actually breaks down the cell walls of bacteria and fungi. Because it kills germs, hydrogen peroxide may help prevent an infection. [6] X Research source You can actually clean your home with peroxide because it sanitizes and disinfects."

      "title": "No, hydrogen peroxide isn’t recommended for wound care.",
      "content": "No, hydrogen peroxide isn’t recommended for wound care. In the past, hydrogen peroxide was a staple in every family’s medicine cabinet. However, we now know that hydrogen peroxide kills healthy skin cells along with germs. Additionally, peroxide kills a type of connective tissue called fibroblasts that help your skin mend. Because of this, peroxide slows down wound healing and may increase your risk of infection.

Then, apply an antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly before putting on a bandage. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "The peroxide may be expired.",
      "content": "The peroxide may be expired. As it turns out, hydrogen peroxide is a very reactive compound. Over time, it’ll oxidize, releasing oxygen to become oxygen and water. That means the bottle of hydrogen peroxide in your cabinet will eventually just be plain old water. [9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is likely the case if your peroxide has been open for a while. To extend the life of your hydrogen peroxide, store it in a cool, dark space. Never ingest hydrogen peroxide, even if it’s old. It’ll cause gastrointestinal distress, which can be severe.

      "content": "There may not be a substance for the peroxide to react with. If you pour peroxide on clean, unblemished skin, it won’t fizz. That’s because catalase must be present for the reaction to happen. [11] X Research source The lack of bubbles doesn’t mean anything is wrong."
