      "content": "Create a folded turban look for short, long, or no hair. If you have long hair, tie it into a bun or ponytail. Fold a square scarf in half so you have a large triangle. Lay the pointed end at the front as you wrap the flat edge around the back of your head, bringing the 2 ends up to the front. Make a \"U\"-shape with one end and pass the other end through the \"U,\" creating a \"U\"-shape on that side, too. Wrap the ends around to the back again. Tie the ends together at the nape of your neck. [1] X Research source To completely cover your hair, you may need to pull up the edges of the triangle at the front to tuck them under the \"turban\" folds. Tuck the ends of the fabric underneath the tight edges of the turban at the back and flatten out the portion on the crown of your head by gently pulling it down into the knot below. Tuck in any stray hairs that might be sticking out of the scarf."

      "content": "Tie the scarf around a top knot for a fun, elegant look. Start by tying your hair up into a bun on top of your head. Place one of the long edges of the scarf around the back of your head. As you do, lay the rest of the scarf over the top of your head. Draw up the back edge from the back to the front of your head on both sides. When you reach the front, gather the back edge and the rest of the scarf all together at the top of your forehead. Twist the scarf around itself to pull it into a tight, long cord, then wrap the twisted piece around your top knot several times. [2] X Research source Secure the scarf by tucking the end under another part of the wrapped scarf. You can use a long, rectangular scarf for this look."

      "content": "Gather a scarf at the back of your head with a hair tie to create a back knot. Place the middle of the long edge across the top of your forehead. Lay the rest of the scarf over your head like hair. Tug the long edge and the rest of the scarf taut to gather it in the back. Pull it through a ponytail holder to hold it in place like a ponytail. You can now leave it as is or wrap it into a bun and secure it with another ponytail holder. [3] X Research source You'll need to use a rectangular scarf for this look. This style works great if you have long hair, short hair, or no hair!"

      "content": "Wrap a square scarf around your hair and tie it under your chin for a vintage look. Fold a square scarf in half to create a triangle. Loosely cover your head with the scarf, placing the point of the triangle in back. Cover the top of your head with the middle of the long edge and draw the ends of the triangle under your chin to tie it. This look definitely has a 1950s vintage feel, and it works for all lengths of hair, from long hair to no hair."

      "content": "Use a long, skinny scarf to make a headband. Wrap the scarf around the front of your hair, starting just behind your hairline. If your scarf is a little thicker, you may need to gather it together a bit to form the headband by scrunching it up width-wise. Bring the scarf ends around to the back of your neck and tie a knot there. Let the ends trail for a fun, elegant look. You can make the headband as wide or as skinny as you want. You can even twist it for a different look."

      "content": "Wrap the scarf around your head from front to back for a skinny turban. Use a long, thin scarf. Start with the middle of the scarf at the back of your head, halfway between the nape of your neck and the crown. Pull the ends around to the front. Make a \"U\"-shape with one side and feed the other end through the \"U,\" effectively making a \"U\"-shape on that side, too. Tighten up the slack and pull the ends around to the back again. Securing it with a knot, tuck the ends underneath the scarf.

Wear it over your hair instead of under it."

      "content": "Create a bow with a square scarf. Fold the scarf into a triangle. Holding the ends, make a 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm) fold across the length of the scarf. Fold it over itself again and keep going until you have a long band. Put the middle of the band (where the triangle corner is) at the back of your neck. Pull the ends around to the front to a tie a bow at the top of your head. You can place the bow at the center, to the left, or to the right. It's your choice! You can also use a short, decorative scarf for this look."

      "content": "Create a simple look by wrapping the scarf over your head and around your neck. Start with the middle of the long edge of the scarf across your forehead. The rest of the scarf should cover the back of your head. Let the 2 ends come around the front and dangle down. Pass one end over the other and wrap both around the back of your head, going opposite directions. Bring the ends back to the front to finish it. [5] X Research source You can tie the ends in a loose knot in the front to help secure the scarf. It helps to fold a square scarf in thirds to create a longer, skinnier scarf."

      "content": "Pin the scarf under your chin for a secure look. Place the long edge across your forehead but arrange the scarf asymmetrically, so that one end hangs only slightly below your chin and the other side is much longer. Pull the edge of the long end up next to the short edge under your chin. Then, pin the edges together with a safety pin, securing them tightly under your chin. Wrap the long edge around your head without twisting it. [6] X Research source At this point, you can either continue wrapping the long end around your head and secure it at the back with a safety pin or tuck part of the edge into the circle around your face, just on the opposite side of your chin from the direction you're wrapping from."

      "content": "Wrap the scarf loosely and put it over your shoulder for a simple, breezy look. Place the middle of the long edge of the scarf across your forehead. Throw one end over your shoulder, going over the end that's hanging down in front. With the end that's still hanging down, wrap it around itself to tie a decorative knot, and you're done! [7] X Research source The knot will also help weight that end of the scarf down, holding it in place."
