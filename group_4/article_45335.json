Static dimples, though, are always visible, even when the face is resting. [2] X Research source Usually, static dimples are created through surgery, but they may also be natural."

      "content": "Dahlia dimples Dahlia dimples are a more recent social media trend. People claim to have dimples near where their cheeks crease when they smile (a.k.a. “smile line”). Some people call this a “Dahlia dimple.” While it’s possible to have a small dimple near your smile line, in most cases, this is actually just a smile line. To check, smile in the mirror. If the crease is where your cheek folds to meet the area near your mouth, that’s a smile line. If the dimple is on a flat area of skin, it may be a Dahlia dimple."

These dimples are caused by a jaw bone that hasn’t completely fused, and the skin clings to the depression formed by the small gap. They’re also totally natural and harmless and sometimes considered very attractive. [5] X Research source This is also sometimes referred to as “fovea mentalis.”"

You might have shoulder dimples where your shoulder muscles overlap and connect, or elbow dimples where the bone pushes past the muscle. Or, maybe you have some muscle scarring that causes indents on your thighs, biceps, or anywhere else. Those are dimples, too!"

In fact, most people don’t. Dimples come in all different shapes and sizes and can occur in many different places on the body. [10] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Most people with dimples were born with them. That said, dimples can also develop for many different reasons. Sometimes, dimples can be a sign of a health complication or condition, especially when the dimple is new or appears suddenly."

      "content": "Many researchers think dimples are a genetic trait. Like your hair color or your height, many doctors believe that dimples are a dominant genetic trait, meaning that if one of your parents has dimples, you’re likely (but not guaranteed) to also have dimples. That said, not every researcher or doctor is convinced, and some say they may have other causes that aren’t hereditary. [11] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source There’s a surprising lack of research on what exactly causes dimples to form, which is why there isn’t much of a consensus. That said, dimples are not considered birth defects , and are completely normal and natural.

      "title": "Most dimples are the result of a split muscle or bone gap.",
      "content": "Most dimples are the result of a split muscle or bone gap. This is especially true of cheek dimples. With cheek dimples, the muscle that controls the edges of your mouth, the zygomaticus major , can split in two before someone is born. The result of that split is a dimple, or a depression where the top and bottom of the muscle has separated. [13] X Research source There’s rarely any downside to a dimple caused by a split muscle, and usually that muscle functions perfectly normally. Other dimples, like a cleft chin, are caused by an unfused bone beneath the surface of the skin. The skin hugs this cleft, creating a depression."

      "content": "Dimples are often considered attractive, and sometimes lucky. In many cultures, dimples, and especially facial dimples, are considered an attractive trait. They’re considered interesting, cute, handsome, and rare. Some cultures consider them lucky or a sign that a baby will have good fortune, while others consider them the mark of a hero or a morally good person. [14] X Research source Of course, that’s mostly superstition and tradition! Having dimples doesn’t necessarily make you luckier or better than other people."

Again, there’s not a whole lot of research, but experts estimate that anywhere from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 people have dimples, meaning most people don’t. [15] X Research source And that’s just facial dimples—there aren’t many reliable numbers for body dimples, which are probably much more rare, since body dimples are often covered, and people may not even realize they have them. Dimples on a single cheek are rarer than pairs of dimples, but there aren’t many reliable research sources that give solid numbers for this statistic."

      "content": "Yes, dimples can develop or disappear as you age or change weight. A baby with dimples might lose their dimples as it grows and the fat in its face is redistributed. Or, someone who didn’t have dimples before can develop them later as their body changes. Some say dimples can be tied to your weight or muscle definition, but again, there’s not much research to verify these claims.

      "title": "Dimples can also be gotten through surgery.",
      "content": "Dimples can also be gotten through surgery. Modern medicine is able to create dimples through cosmetic surgery. In most procedures, a simple stitch is inserted under the skin to tether the cheek to the underlying muscles, creating a dimple. [17] X Research source Licensed esthetician Jessica Lu tells us that sometimes, this procedure is supplemented by facial fillers to make the new dimple more noticeable. Some say you can do face exercises or use products to get dimples naturally , but these are mostly folk remedies, and results don’t often last more than a few minutes."
