      "content": "Wash your hair with cold water. Have you been washing your hair with hot water for years and years? High temperatures can really do a number on hair that's already rough and dry; the hot water causes the hair shaft to get frayed. Instead, go as cold as you can stand. When your hair is dry, it'll look sleek and shiny. If you hate taking cold showers (who doesn't) try washing your hair separately, in the sink. That way you can use ice-cold water without getting chilled."

      "content": "Dry your hair with care. Here's the routine you want to avoid: roughly toweling your hair, violently brushing out tangles, then blasting it with the hair dryer. Hair that is already dry does not respond well to this rough treatment. [3] X Research source Instead, use the following routine to dry your hair: Pat it dry with a soft towel. Don't wring it out or twist it up in the towel; gently squeeze out the excess water, then pat it dry.

      "title": "Use sulfate-free shampoo.",
      "content": "Use sulfate-free shampoo. You may have a collection of shampoos that are meant to tame frizz, define curls, and smooth waves. What they probably all have in common is a few chemicals that actually make dry, rough hair worse: sulfates. Buy shampoo that is completely free of this chemical. [5] X Research source Commercial shampoos are made with sulfates because they act as an effective cleanser. They strip the hair of its natural oils to give it that \"squeaky clean\" quality. The problem is they make hair too clean, and it damages the hair. In fact, the same chemicals are used in dishwashing and laundry detergents. Health food stores and natural beauty product stores sell shampoos without sulfates. Look for a bottle labeled \"sulfate-free\" to be extra sure it doesn't contain the chemical. Some people with curly hair choose to forego using shampoo entirely. They find that their dry hair doesn't need to have its natural oils washed away, and water alone does the trick for washing out dirt."

      "title": "Buy silicone-free conditioner and styling products.",
      "content": "Buy silicone-free conditioner and styling products. Since sulfates wash the oils away from out hair, conditioners resupply moisture and shine by adding silicones to the mix. The problem is that silicones build up in the hair over time and cause it to start looking dry and dull. Buy a new conditioner that doesn't contain silicones; you may see results the first time you use it. Hair balms, creams, gels, and other products also often contain silicones. Examine all of your products and toss or donate the ones that have ingredients that could be harmful to your hair."
