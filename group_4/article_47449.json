      "content": "These simple options are just general enough that any player should be able to come up with something good when they’re the psychic, but they’re not quite as general as the easier cards that come with the base game. [1] X Research source Zesty vs. bland Whimsical vs. stoic Quiet vs. bombastic Quirky vs. mundane Lively vs. boring Loud vs. quiet Explosive vs. unreactive Durable vs. fragile Annoying vs. entertaining Simplistic vs. complex"

      "title": "",
      "content": "If you want to incorporate a few more laughs at the table, draw a random category from this list and see what the psychic comes up with.

    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Feel free to incorporate your own musical categories based on what everyone at the table listens to. “Drake vs. Kendrick” might work if everyone at the table loves hip-hop, but a game full of country fans might not enjoy that one. [2] X Research source Tupac vs. Biggie Dylan vs. Springsteen Miles Davis vs. Elvis Wu-Tang Clan vs. One Direction Sabrina Carpenter vs. Whitney Houston Drake vs. Kendrick Underground/Indie vs. mainstream Vinyl vs. mp3 The music video was better vs. the song stands alone Hardcore mosh pit vs. quiet listening party"

    {
      "title": "",

    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "History lovers rejoice! The base Wavelength game doesn’t come with anything even remotely history-themed, so this is a fun addition. Summer of Love vs. Salem Witch Trials First Flight vs. the Hindenburg Disaster Dawn of Man vs. Fall of Man Boston Tea Party vs. Boston Marathon The Pyramids vs. Stonehenge French Revolution vs. American Revolution Would hate royal life vs. secretly want to be a king Samurai vs. ninjas New World explorer vs. staying on the shore Ancient Athens vs. Ancient Sparta"

      "title": "",
      "content": "This is a good general category that all players should be able to make sense of.

    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Any foodies at the table will appreciate the opportunity to guess clues in these categories. This is another area where the base game doesn’t include any good categories, so these are a phenomenal addition. [3] X Research source Deep dish vs. thin crust Fast food vs. vegan cuisine Italian vs. Mexican Pizza vs. tacos Keto vs. Vegetarian Master Chef vs. Top Chef Going out vs. eating in Dive bar vs. fancy cocktail joint Medium vs. medium-rare Gordon Ramsey vs. Guy Fieri"
    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "Feel free to slot in your own favorite celebrities so long as everyone at the table knows them. These categories are also a lot of fun if the psychic picks clues that either aren’t people at all (is a hot dog more like Betty White or Martha Stewart?) or people who also happen to be celebrities (is Kevin Hart more of a Joan of Arc or Alexander the Great?). MLK Jr. vs. Malcolm X Steve Jobs vs. Bill Gates Taylor Swift vs. Marilyn Monroe Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson vs. Vin Diesel Einstein vs. Oppenheimer Emma Stone vs. Emma Watson Genghis Khan vs. Julius Caesar Andy Warhol vs. Jackson Pollock Lady Gaga vs. Katy Perry"

    },
    {
      "title": "",
      "content": "These categories represent another good general set of spectrums that make sense to basically anybody. We’re still open to alternatives to “serious platypus” if you happen to have a better animal to serve as the opposite of a silly goose, so get creative! Dogs vs. cats Energetic vs. lapdog Night owl vs. morning lark Serious platypus vs. silly goose Orange cat vs. black cat Humans are better vs. dogs are better Cats and dogs vs. exotic pets Hedgehog vs. groundhog King of the jungle vs. queen of the tundra Bird vs. fish"

    {
      "title": "",

      "content": "If you want to use Wavelength as a jumping-off point for some deeper conversations at the table, these are great categories to provoke interesting discussion. Eternal life vs. mortality Time travel vs. fixed timeline Causality vs. randomness Free will vs. determinism Life is meaningless vs. life has cosmic meaning Humans are evil vs. humans are good Objective reality vs. subjective reality Suffering is meaningless vs. suffering is valuable Civilization always improves vs. history is random Technology is good vs. technology is bad"

      "title": "",
      "content": "Just get weird with it, you know? Wavelength is a great party game because it’s extremely funny while also generating strong and interesting convos among players. What’s better at getting a laugh and generating discussion than semi-nonsense? Alien technology vs. human innovation Cheese vs. cows Magical first dates vs. magical divorce hearings Chickens vs. roads Shadow demon vs. haunting ghost A loud noise vs. a confusing sentence Things you can smoke vs. things that smoke you Dream logic vs. fairy tale logic Lasers vs. actually using lasers Plague doctors vs. an actual plague"
