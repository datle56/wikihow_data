      "content": "Take it easy and lie on your back to see if you feel better. If you’re feeling pain in your liver, you can often relieve some of it by positioning your body differently. Lie down or stretch your body out in a reclined position. If you’ve had any physical injury to your liver or you’ve got a GI virus, you should feel relief in no time. If you raise your legs when you lie down and you feel pain in your left shoulder, you don’t have liver pain—your spleen is rupturing. Get emergency medical help immediately.

If you don’t have coffee or tea in the morning and you have a condition that cause chronic liver pain, now is the time to start. Coffee and tea lower the liver enzymes that cause inflammation, so a daily cup of caffeinated (non-sugary) beverages like coffee and tea will reduce pain throughout the day.

      "content": "Make it easy on your body by eating a fresh, healthy diet. Fatty, greasy, or fried foods can increase liver pain because they force the liver to work harder than it should. One of the liver's functions is to process fat, so stick to a light, healthy diet to give your liver time to recover and heal. [8] X Research source Foods that are uniquely good for your liver include: chicken, fish, olives, olive oil, nuts, berries, and leafy vegetables. [9] X Research source Unproductive foods for your liver include: Anything deep fried, pizza, fast food, sugar, and high-fructose corn syrup. Your body processes sugar the same way as alcohol, so avoid candy, sweets, and soda. [10] X Research source Don’t overdo it on the protein. Excessive consumption of protein can contribute to fatty liver disease.

Many of the “liver health” supplements out there contain herbs or ingredients that are toxic to your liver if your liver isn’t functioning correctly. It’s reasonable to want a natural solution for your liver pain, but herbal supplements aren’t regulated the same way medication is and your body may not be able to process them. [14] X Research source Natural ingredients that are known to be toxic for the liver (even when it’s healthy) include: chaparral, comfrey tea, kava, skullcap, and yohimbe. Diet pills and muscle builders are also dangerous for the liver."

Your doctor will discuss your symptoms with you and will do a physical exam. The physical exam will typically include testing your basic vital signs and feeling the liver for inflammation.

Your doctor may be able to prescribe you a pain reliever in the mean time. [21] X Research source It is likely that you will need both medication and lifestyle changes, such as weight loss or a special diet, to treat your liver pain. Your doctor may tell you to take over-the-counter pain relievers. Be sure to follow their recommendations for dosage, as exceeding recommended doses could tax your liver. Your medical treatment will vary depending on what is causing your pain. If you have a less serious illness, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, it may be managed exclusively by making your diet healthier and reducing your cholesterol. [22] X Research source"
