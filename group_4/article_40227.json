The 5 Ilocano vowels sound as follows: [2] X Research source The letter \"a\" makes an \"ah\" sound, similar to the \"a\" in the English word \"father.\" The letter \"e\" makes an \"eh\" sound, similar to the \"e\" in the English word \"bed.\" The letter \"i\" makes an \"ee\" sound, similar to the \"ee\" in the English word \"beet.\" The letter \"o\" makes an \"au\" sound, similar to the \"au\" in the English word \"author.\" The letter \"u\" makes an \"oo\" sound, similar to the \"oo\" in the English word \"boot.\""

      "content": "Pronounce most consonants the same as in English. Since most consonants in Ilocano make the same sound as they would in English, you don't have to worry about practicing these letters if you speak English. However, a couple of letters that make sounds that might be unfamiliar for English speakers. [4] X Research source The letter \"ng\" is considered a separate consonant in English. It sounds similar to the \"ng\" in the English word \"sing.\" However, it can also appear at the beginning of a word, which can cause trouble for English speakers. The letter \"r\" is trilled, similar to the Spanish \"r.\" Ilocano also has the \"-\" character, which represents a \"glottal stop.\" This sound is made when you rapidly close your vocal cords with a short exhale. If you speak English, think of the sound in the middle of the phrase \"uh-oh!\" The letters \"j,\" \"g,\" and \"r\" only appear in words of Spanish origin, and are pronounced in Ilocano the same way you would pronounce them in Spanish.

      "content": "Listen to native speakers to determine where to place the stress. In Ilocano words, the syllable that is stressed is relatively unpredictable. The easiest way to learn how to pronounce words correctly is to pay attention to where a native speaker places the stress. However, there are a few patterns that can also help you. [7] X Research source In most words, the primary stress falls on either the last or next-to-last syllable. If the next-to-last syllable ends with a consonant, the stress falls on the last syllable. The only exception is if the next-to-last syllable ends with \"ng\" and the last consonant starts with a \"k,\" as in the word \"bibingka.\" There, the stress falls on the next-to-last syllable. In Ilocano words that are derived from other languages, the stress is the same as it is in the language of origin. Most of these are Spanish-origin words, but some also come from English."
