      "title": "Dark yellow candles symbolize prosperity and protection.",
      "content": "Dark yellow candles symbolize prosperity and protection. While all yellow candles promote divine intuition and learning in some way, the shade of the candle makes a big difference in what you’re trying to manifest. Candles with darker yellows (gold, mustard, dandelion) promote wealth, good fortune (hence the gold), and are great at stimulating ideas for achieving financial success and security. [2] X Research source Try lighting dark yellow candles before important business meetings or investments to manifest your best financial outcome."

      "title": "Bright yellow candles stand for clarity and communication.",
      "content": "Bright yellow candles stand for clarity and communication. Lighting a candle with a brighter, more vibrant shade of yellow (lemon, pineapple) helps declutter the mind of negative energy, and makes it easier to convey your ideas to people. Light a bright yellow candle to help cleanse your mind and focus. [3] X Research source Most people light bright yellow candles during meditation, since they help center thoughts and open up the channels of spiritual communication to higher powers. Also consider lighting a yellow candle if you and a loved one are struggling with miscommunication. The communicative energy it promotes can help you work through your differences."

      "title": "Yellow candles help you focus.",
      "content": "Yellow candles help you focus. Use a yellow candle to meditate deeply and more effectively. By concentrating all of your energy on the lit flame and complementary bright colors, you can help silence confusing, negative, and stressful thoughts and be more centered throughout your day.

      "title": "Lighting a yellow candle cleanses negative energy.",
      "content": "Lighting a yellow candle cleanses negative energy. Yellow candles draw exclusively positive frequencies. Burning one in a space that’s been heavily affected by negativity (a traumatic event, a difficult conversation, or just the compounding stresses of day-to-day life) can help remove despair and attract prosperity, joy, and knowledge instead. [5] X Research source You can also light a candle to cleanse your own headspace of bleak or taxing thoughts and feelings."

      "title": "Yellow candles attract energy in the third eye chakra.",
      "content": "Yellow candles attract energy in the third eye chakra. Because they draw their spiritual strength from the sun, which brings power to the third eye, yellow candles can help you dive deeper into your own consciousness. To attract the sun’s powers, light a yellow candle somewhere comfortable where you can see the sun. Close your eyes, breathe, and, with your eyelids shut, move your gaze up to your third eye chakra point (between your brows). Then, visualize the sun’s light entering you and enhancing your intuition. [6] X Research source After you’ve lit a yellow candle to meditate on your third eye chakra , journal how you feel and any thoughts that became front-of-mind during the process."

      "title": "Yellow candles enhance communication with the divine.",
      "content": "Yellow candles enhance communication with the divine. Some people believe drawing enough spiritual energy from the sun can help you enter the astral plane (the spiritual realm of souls) and communicate with ancestors or the dead. While there’s no hard science to prove this, doing some candle magic can definitely make you feel more open afterwards. This makes you more perceptive and willing to listen to signs from the universe. [7] X Research source If you see an angel number or have a new gut feeling shortly after lighting a yellow candle, this might be a sign that spiritual beings are trying to talk to you."

      "title": "You can expand your network with some yellow candle magic.",
      "content": "You can expand your network with some yellow candle magic. Spiritually, yellow is a highly social color. Yellow candle spells don’t only attract prosperity and insight; they also attract lots and lots of new friends. If you’re looking to make more powerful connections at work or simply widen your circle of friends, consider setting a bright yellow candle ablaze. [8] X Research source Be specific when setting your goals. For example, instead of a vague “I want more networking opportunities,” try saying “I want to meet people with a background in charity financing who can take my non-profit to the next level” or “I want a mentor who can guide me towards a promotion within the next year.”"

      "title": "Cast your spell around noon when the candle’s energy is most powerful.",
      "content": "Cast your spell around noon when the candle’s energy is most powerful. Yellow candle spells draw the most effective energy from the sun when they’re carried out between 12 and 1 PM each day (when the sun is highest). Perform your yellow candle spell during these hours and/or on Wednesdays and Sundays: the days of the week that correspond with yellow’s playful, intellectual, and illuminating frequency. [9] X Research source To draw even more energy in your candle spell, wear a bright yellow shirt or pants if you’re trying to enhance your communication and wear some gold jewelry if you’re searching for prosperity."

      "title": "Set and state your intention.",
      "content": "Set and state your intention. Your words are your wands. Take some time in a quiet room with lots of natural light and determine what you’re trying to attract with this candle spell. Financial success? Enhanced intuition? A more fun lifestyle? Once you’ve set the intention you wish to manifest, state it out loud or write it on a piece of paper and place it under your candle. [10] X Research source Be specific with your intention. For example, instead of stating “I want to travel more,” you might try “I want to have a fun, life-altering trip to Thailand next summer.” The more precise you are with your intention, the easier it is to be guided in that direction. If you want, you can write a song/speech or chant a mantra that includes your intention to get your creative juices flowing and intensify the power of your spell."

      "title": "Dress your candle with crystals and essential oils for a stronger effect.",
      "content": "Dress your candle with crystals and essential oils for a stronger effect. While this step isn’t essential, gems and serums carry their own spiritual vibes that can complement or attract more energy to your candle. Plus, they smell and look divine! Cover your hands in a few drops of healing oil and slowly rub the oil into your candle from the wick down. Then, place your candle next to a crystal of your choosing before you burn it. [11] X Research source Each essential oil attracts a slightly different energy. Peppermint and cypress are good for purification. Sandalwood and rosemary promote enlightenment, and jasmine invites gratitude. [12] X Research source Good crystals for dressing your candle include opal (which brings inner peace and enhances communication), aquamarine (which is a good luck symbol for travel), and selenite (which improves intuition and signals for divine wisdom)."

      "title": "Light your candle and visualize your goal.",
      "content": "Light your candle and visualize your goal. Once you’ve prepared all the necessary materials for your candle spell, light the wick of your candle with a lighter or matches and close your eyes. Spend a few minutes picturing yourself manifesting your intention . Then, let the candle burn all the way through. [13] X Research source During the time your candle burns, avoid leaving the room you conduct your spell in. Try not to clutter your mind or space with stressful, negative energies (by sending business emails, reading or watching depressing things, etc.) If you’re pressed for time, use a smaller candle so it burns through more quickly. Put a plate or drip protector under your candle so the wax doesn’t ruin your surfaces."

      "title": "Watch the flame to determine results.",
      "content": "Watch the flame to determine results. After you’ve spent a few minutes, take a look at how your candle is burning. The size and color of the fire can offer you insight into how your spell has been received by higher powers: A steady, bright flame is a sign your spell has been received successfully and good fortune is headed your way. A flickering flame shows the message is wavering and you may need to perform another spell. Dress your candle more thoroughly or use different oils for the next one to ensure a better result. A sparking or crackling flame is a sign your message has been received by higher powers, but they’re sending you a new message of their own that might not match your spell. Don’t worry, though; it will be for the better. A jumping flame shows power and emotion. It’s a sign the intention you set is deeply personal and cuts right to your core (whether you realize it or not) A dancing flame is a sign your message has been received, but it may take slower than usual for your spell’s effects to carry out."

      "content": "Leo can use yellow candles to connect with higher powers. Because yellow candles are tied to the sun, Leo’s ruling sign, Leo can easily channel creativity and confidence by lighting one. Plus, since Leo is already guided by the energy that feeds yellow candles, the channels of communication are wide open for more speaking with more divine energies. [14] X Research source If you’re a Leo , light a yellow candle during Leo season (July 23rd to August 22nd), when your energy is most powerful to gain clearer insights on your true self."

      "title": "Yellow candles match Sagittarius’ natural luck and growth.",
      "content": "Yellow candles match Sagittarius’ natural luck and growth. Spiritual expansion and prosperity are two very Jupiterian traits and Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter. By lighting a dark yellow candle, Sag can help manifest joy, protection, and new wisdom on their many journeys (they overlook the 9th house of travel). On the other hand, since they inherently possess a lot of the good fortune that comes from dark yellow, Sagittarius can light a bright yellow candle to challenge themselves and expand their communication skills (something they struggle with, since their Mercury is in detriment)."
