      "title": "Knead the dough.",
      "content": "Knead the dough. You may knead by hand or with a dough hook attached to a low-speed electric mixer. Knead until the dough is glossy and tacky, but not sticky. You should be able to pinch a small piece and pull it thin enough to let light pass through. This is a sign of a strong, high-gluten dough that will stay together when tossed, and make a chewy, tender crust. Results can vary with humidity and other unpredictable factors. Add a little flour if the mixture is sticky, or a little water if the dough is dry. This usually takes 5–15 minutes by hand, or 2–4 minutes in an electric mixer."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let rise overnight.",
      "content": "Let rise overnight. Brush the dough with olive oil and store, covered, in the refrigerator. Leave overnight (or for at least 5 hours) to allow gluten to develop further. The cold temperature of the fridge slows yeast activity, preventing excessive rising from the long waiting period. [4] X Research source Cold dough is also easier to handle. Place the dough in an airtight container with enough room for the dough to double in size. Alternatively, leave covered with a warm towel for 40–60 minutes at room temperature, or until dough doubles in size. Chill for one hour in the refrigerator."

These will be more convenient to handle and fit in a home oven. For the instructions below, use one dough ball at a time. Make sure that your pizza dough is room temperature before you start working with it. [5] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 18 October 2021."

      "content": "Flatten the dough. Slap the ball of dough flat with your hand, kept as flat as possible. Don't press too hard, or you'll squeeze out the air and create a hard, dense crust. Just press until it is relatively flat, but still squishy."

      "content": "Define the outer crust. Hold your fingers straight and together. Press into the dough about 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge. Repeat this motion around the whole circle, forming a groove and a raised outer crust."

      "title": "Push the dough outward.",
      "content": "Push the dough outward. Keep your fingers straight and together. Hold your hands flat, just above the dough, with your fingers pressing into the groove you just made. Fan your fingers outward a little, pressing against the crust. Bring your fingers together and rotate the dough a little, then repeat this fanning motion around the whole edge. [9] X Research source This will make the outer crust edge thinner, and the pizza a bit larger. Don't press your palms against the base of the dough. This can lead to uneven crust or tears. Beginners can use a rolling pin when starting out. This is easier, but usually results in a denser crust."

Press your fingertips against the edge, and push one hand outward to gently stretch that small area of the pizza. Rotate the dough and repeat, moving around the dough several times. With practice, you can use a fluid, fast motion, moving your hands in small circles. [10] X Research source Stop when the dough is getting thin, and approaching the size you want. Never move your hands in completely opposite directions, as this will create a thin center. Move at an angle instead to stretch just the outer area, leaving a small hump in the center of the dough. [11] X Research source You can instead press the side of your hand down into the groove, then push directly outward to stretch the edge. Use your other hand to rotate the dough as you go.

      "content": "Slap the dough between your hands (optional). Slapping is an easier way to hand shape your pizza. Some chefs slap, some toss, and some start with slapping and finish with a toss or two. None of these methods are more correct than another. If you decide to slap, here's how it goes: [13] X Research source [14] X Research source [15] X Research source Drape the dough over your palm and forearm. The more of your arm you use, the less likely the dough is to break. \"Slap\" the dough onto your opposite palm, letting it drape over your other hand and forearm. If your dough is in danger of tearing, let it drape gently instead of using force. Repeat this motion back and forth. Each time you \"slap,\" the dough should rotate about one quarter turn. This rotation is vital for making the dough wide and even."

      "content": "Drape the dough on a fist and palm. If your dough looks strong and hasn't yet reached the desired size, it's time to adopt the tossing position. Extend your dominant hand as a flat palm, with fingers together. Keep your other hand in a fist to \"anchor\" the dough. Drape the pizza dough over both hands, supporting opposite sides of the dough.

      "title": "Rotate your arms toward your body.",
      "content": "Rotate your arms toward your body. Rotate your arms inward to get ready for the throw. (If you are using your right palm, rotate your arms to the left.) This allows more rotation during the throw, imparting the spin that shapes the dough in the air."

[18] X Research source Follow with your fist to continue supporting the pizza, but focus on your palm, which will do the tossing. Practice this motion without tossing the pizza first, then try again with moderate speed during your toss. Start with a more gentle throw than you think you need. Too little force, and the pizza doesn't leave your hand. Too much force, and the pizza flies across the room."
    },
    {
      "title": "Release the pizza.",
      "content": "Release the pizza. Bring the upward motion of your palm to an abrupt stop when it comes in front of your face. This will send the pizza flying upward a short distance. In the air, it should spin at the same speed your hands rotated. The force from spinning pushes the dough flatter and wider, without pressing out the air."
    },
    {
      "title": "Follow through.",
      "content": "Follow through. Although your hand stops moving upward, it should still complete the arch of its movement after the pizza is released. Follow through by moving your palm around and out, as though swatting a fly in front of your face. A smooth follow-through ensures that your hand is rotating at the moment when you release the pizza. Don't worry too much about this for your first few tosses. It's more important to catch the falling pizza than to get the right hand shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Catch the dough.",
      "content": "Catch the dough. Catch the dough with both fists and forearms. Use as much of your forearm as you can, to avoid puncturing it. If you have a strong dough, you may be able to catch it on one fist, but this is risky for most recipes. If you tossed with your right palm, catch the dough mostly on your left arm. Expert dough tossers \"catch\" the dough on their fingertips, sending it spinning again without letting it rest. This is a complex technique that involves sending the dough in multiple trajectories and angles. [19] X Research source It's best not to try this until you're a more experience pizzaiolo ."

    {
      "title": "Repeat as necessary.",
      "content": "Repeat as necessary. If you slapped the dough or hand-stretched it heavily, you may only need one toss to get your pizza to the size you need. If you only used light hand-stretching, you may toss it several times. Once the pizza reaches the desired size, place the dough on a pizza screen, pizza stone, or baking sheet. You're ready to add the toppings. [20] X Expert Source Ollie George Cigliano Private Chef & Food Educator Expert Interview. 18 October 2021. The dough is ready when you say it's ready. The size of your oven and personal preference for crust thickness are the only criteria you need when cooking at home."
