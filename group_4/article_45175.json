The key has a \"Power\" icon, which is an open circle that contains a vertical line at its center. If you're using a MacBook with Touch Bar and/or Touch ID (such as some MacBook Pros and MacBook Air models from 2018 and later), the power button is a solid black touch key at the top-right corner of the keyboard."

Try putting your ear close to your Mac to listen for the whir of a fan or the spin of a hard drive—if you hear your Mac but don't see anything on the screen, skip to Step 4. If the Mac has no power, test the outlet by plugging in a lamp or some other powered appliance. You can also try plugging your Mac into a different outlet. Make sure the part of the power cord that plugs into your computer is also securely attached. It shouldn't jiggle around or have any frayed cables. If you're using a power strip, plug directly into the wall outlet instead. Sometimes power strips have burned-out outlets or fail entirely. Some wall outlets are controlled by light switches, meaning that if you flip off a switch, it'll also turn off the power outlets. Try the light switch(es) in the room to see if they need to be in different positions for the outlet to work."

[5] X Research source Most Mac keyboards have two keys with suns on them—one lowers the brightness and the other raises it. It's the larger sun on the right that raises the brightness. If your keyboard has F keys at the top, it's usually F2 . Some keyboards do not have keys that control the brightness of the display."
