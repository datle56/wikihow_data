      "content": "Psychologically, women wear makeup to cover insecurities. Over the years, psychologists have uncovered a common theme amongst those who wear makeup: women often use makeup to cover something perceived as “undesirable” to appear more attractive. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Women are held to high standards from a young age and are raised to believe that changing their appearance can make them “better” or appear “healthier.” [2] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Makeup gives them the ability to conform to societal beauty standards and hide disfavored parts of themselves. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Makeup can be an intense confidence booster. For instance, if you’re insecure about a pimple or mole, you can instantly cover it with foundation and concealer."

      "content": "Women also wear makeup to appear more confident or alluring. Along with hiding insecurities, women accentuate their features to look powerful. This may be in an attempt to seduce a potential lover or appear dominant in the workplace. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Think of makeup as an enhancement. When a woman puts on a bold lip and luscious lashes, she becomes a new woman who’ll most likely be perceived differently than when she’s bare-faced. Women often wear makeup to job interviews or first dates because of this—the artistic coverage allows them to become a heightened version of themselves."

      "title": "Women choose to wear makeup because they like it.",
      "content": "Women choose to wear makeup because they like it. On a less serious note, many women put on makeup because they like the routine or how it makes them look. Dabbing on some eye shadow or painting on a lip gloss doesn’t necessarily have to be as deep as becoming more likable by societal standards—some men, women, and non-binary pals simply enjoy the creative expression makeup provides. [5] X Research source Many women also use cosmetics for artistic expression, as a calming ritual, or simply to change up their appearance for variety. Reader Poll: We asked 174 wikiHow readers where they find new fashion and beauty trends to try and 74% of them said they follow their own personal style and creativity. [Take Poll] Many women wear makeup because it’s a part of their personal style."

      "content": "Wearing makeup may affect how you're perceived on a first date. Studies have shown that when faced with the choice to talk to a woman wearing makeup or a woman who's not, men approached the woman wearing makeup more. Societal beauty standards, confidence, and personal preferences all play a part in attractiveness. [6] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source While there’s nothing wrong with not wearing makeup on a first date, it could impact how your date perceives you. This also applies to online dating. In a social experiment, 3 dating profiles were created. The only difference between them? The first had bare-faced profile pictures, the second featured minimal makeup, and the third had full glam makeup. Other profiles reacted as followed: [7] X Research source The first profile received friendly attention. The second profile got the most flirtatious interactions. The third profile received sexual and promiscuous advances."

For instance, a positive conversation starts if someone comments on your makeup, saying something like, “I love your eyeliner! How did you do it?”"

      "title": "Wear foundation and concealer.",
      "content": "Wear foundation and concealer. Studies have shown that the first thing people notice about a woman’s face is her complexion, which is why foundation and concealer leave the biggest impact. Women are often perceived differently if they have discoloration, under-eye bags, or blemishes. While this is entirely unfair, it is, unfortunately, a societal norm. So, if you’re hoping to make a good impression, science says to always apply foundation and concealer. [10] X Research source If foundation and/or concealer aren’t your thing, that’s entirely okay. Beauty standards are superficial, and it’s even more attractive to feel confident in your own skin. So, if you’re comfortable, go ahead and rock your bare face! As a general rule, do whatever makes you feel confident and comfortable. If that includes wearing makeup, awesome! If that means going bare face, that's equally epic. Well-cared-for skin can make a significant difference in overall appearance. The key to a flawless complexion is: a consistent skincare routine, primer to create a smooth canvas, foundation or tinted moisturizer for an even tone, and concealer for targeted coverage. Start with a solid skincare routine, then apply a primer for a smooth base. Depending on your preference and desired coverage level, follow with either foundation or a tinted moisturizer. Use concealer to address specific areas like under-eye circles, blemishes, or discoloration. Remember: without proper skincare, even the best makeup may not look its best. Well-hydrated, cared-for skin provides the ideal base for any makeup application."

Science shows that people gravitate towards those with larger eyes because they’re “cuter” and “more endearing.” Lining your eyes and putting on a coat of mascara can draw more attention to your eyes and enhance their natural color.
