During a panic attack, your body goes into a natural fight-or-flight response, just as if you were in a truly terrifying and dangerous situation, only no dangerous situation is actually occurring. [3] X Research source Symptoms that are commonly experienced during a panic attack include: Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness or faintness Fear of dying Fear of losing control or impending doom Feeling of choking Feeling of detachment Feeling of unreality Nausea or upset stomach Numbness or tingling in the hands, feet, or face Palpitations, fast heart rate, or pounding heart Sweating, chills, or hot flashes Trembling or shaking"

      "title": "Control your breathing.",
      "content": "Control your breathing. Most panic attacks cause rapid and shallow breathing which fuels the attack, causing the symptoms to linger. By controlling your breathing, you can help to return your heart rate to normal, lower your blood pressure, slow the sweating, and re-establish a feeling of being in control. [4] X Research source One method to slow your breathing is to take a deep breath and hold it for as long as you can. This balances levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide and reduces the feeling that you cannot breathe. After holding your breath, then begin deep, diaphragmatic breathing. Breathe in slowly and deeply, then exhale even more slowly. To practice diaphragmatic breathing, try sitting in a chair with 1 hand on your chest and the other a little below your rib cage. Sit comfortably with bent knees, and relaxed shoulders and neck. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Next breathe in slowly through your nose and let your stomach expand, keeping your upper chest as still as possible. Slowly exhale, tightening your stomach muscles, and keep your upper chest still. The hand on your stomach area should move out as you inhale, then back in as you exhale, with the hand on your upper chest remaining as still as possible. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Another method is the 5-2-5 method. Inhale with your diaphragm for 5 seconds. Hold your breath for 2 seconds. Then exhale for 5 more seconds. Repeat 5 times. [7] X Research source Breathing into a paper bag is not routinely recommended anymore. It may not be as beneficial as was believed in the past, and may even be detrimental."

      "title": "Take prescription medication.",
      "content": "Take prescription medication. One of the most effective ways to stop a panic attack is by taking oral agents classed as anti-anxiety medications, usually benzodiazepines. [8] X Research source Common drugs used to treat panic attacks that are classed as benzodiazepines include alprazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam. These agents have a fairly rapid onset and can help to relieve symptoms within 10 to 30 minutes. Other agents prescribed that fall in the group of benzodiazepines start to work a little slower but stay in your blood stream longer. Examples of these agents include clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazepam. These agents are often prescribed in low doses to take regularly until the panic attacks become more manageable by using other types of medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or participating in cognitive behavioral therapy."

[9] X Research source Continue talking, moving, and keep your thoughts focused.

[11] X Research source By staying where you are, and taking control of your symptoms, you are taking steps to train your brain in recognizing the absence of real danger in the grocery store. [12] X Research source If you run away, your brain begins to associate that place, and maybe all grocery stores, with danger, and may create feelings of panic each time you enter a grocery store.

[14] X Research source Examples include drinking something either warm or cold, taking a short walk, singing along to a favorite song, talking with a friend, and watching TV. Additional things to try in order to focus on something other than the panic include stretching exercises, doing a puzzle, changing the air temperature, rolling down the window if you are in a car, going outside for some fresh air, or reading something that is interesting to you."

      "title": "Distinguish between a stressful experience and a panic attack.",
      "content": "Distinguish between a stressful experience and a panic attack. While both types of experiences are similar in that physical reactions occur, such as elevated blood pressure, sweating, and increased heart rate, they are distinctly different events. Stressful experiences happen to everyone at one time or another. The bodyâ€™s natural fight or flight instinct may be activated during a stressful or anxious situation, just as it is during a panic attack, but there is always a trigger, event, or experience that is directly tied to the reaction. Panic attacks are not tied to an event, are unpredictable, and the severity of an attack can be extreme and terrifying."
