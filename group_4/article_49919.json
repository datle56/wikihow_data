      "content": "“Yapping” is when someone talks non-stop about unimportant topics. People who “yap” tend to talk for a long time about things only they find interesting or important. It can be an annoying trait for sure, but also a fun personality quirk (depending on the person speaking and your relationship with them). This more positive meaning evolved on TikTok, where creators film themselves speaking on niche interests, going on political rants, or sharing personal updates for several minutes at a time. “I yap on TikTok for a living.” “Yapping with my friends is my favorite hobby!”"

      "content": "Originally, it meant to talk non-stop in a high-pitched, “whiny” voice. Before TikTok made it cool, people used “yapping” negatively to refer to someone who drones on and on about boring subjects. Typically, “yapping” also implied a high-pitched, whiny voice. [1] X Research source It was often used in a misogynistic way, with men using it to describe talkative or opinionated women. The more modern usage is much friendlier in tone and can apply to both women and men. “He just won't stop yapping about that new lawn mower!” “All she does is yap about the drama at her job every time I see her.” A “yap” is also a derogatory word for “mouth.” For example, someone might say “Shut your yap!” when they want someone to stop talking."

      "content": "“Yapping” has been reclaimed by TikTokers as a fun activity. TikTok is a video sharing app where creators record themselves explaining, ranting, or just chatting about any topics that interest them. Many TikTokers, especially women, have embraced the term “yapping” and are proud to be yappers, even if some of their viewers call them that as an insult. They see yapping not just as a fun activity they can do with their followers and other yappers, but also as their livelihood. [2] X Research source You might also see some TikTokers use \"yapping\" as a way to compliment other people. A great example is this TikTok by @lovelaila.not.her which features the caption, “me once they start yapping cause i love ppl that actually talk.” Some TikTok creators use the term “yapping” when they're poking fun at other people who talk a lot (like in this video from @dom_cov where she jokes about her math teacher yapping at her 8 AM class). Others use it to mock themselves and the way their friends and family stop listening when they talk too much, as in this TikTok posted by @tylajune_spam ."

      "title": "No, but some people may find being called a yapper offensive.",
      "content": "No, but some people may find being called a yapper offensive. “Yapping” isn't a curse word, so it isn't “bad” in that context. However, it does have a negative meaning, especially considering it’s historically been used to put down women for talking too much. So, it's not usually a compliment to tell someone they yap or to be called a yapper! On the other hand, some people good-naturedly label themselves as “yappers,” especially if they know they have a habit of talking a lot, and may not mind being called a yapper at all. Talkative people may even view “yapping” as a fun activity to do with friends who also love to talk. For example, you might hear them say to a friend, “Let's get coffee and yap!” or “It's been a while since we've had a good yap session.”"

      "content": "The first mention of the word “yap” is from the 1600s. The original formal definition of “yap” is “to bark in high, quick sounds.” The word has been used as far back as the 17th century to refer to the high-pitched barks or yips of small dogs. [3] X Research source Chihuahuas and dachshunds, for example, are famous yappers and are sometimes even referred to as “yappy dogs” because of their frequent and shrill barking. Eventually, this high-pitched definition expanded to include humans speaking with high, shrill, or “whiny” voices. Some cities, like Sedona, AZ, hold regular Yappy Hour events at local parks so sociable dogs and dog owners can safely mix and mingle. All dogs, including the yappiest ones, are welcome!"

      "content": "Use “yapping” to describe an annoying person who won't stop talking. It can be irritating when a person drones on about subjects you're not interested in and you have other things you need to do. While you should avoid being unkind and telling them they're a yapper to their face, you can always express your frustration to yourself or close friends and family. “She keeps yapping and I just want to get away.” “He's such a yapper! I can never get a word in edgewise.” “They just yap and yap and yap. Like, bro, I've got places to be!”"

      "content": "Say you're a “yapper” if you love to talk and you're not ashamed of it. There's nothing wrong with being talkative, as long as you're not keeping your listeners from something important or dumping your problems on them. In fact, if you can find someone who loves to talk as much as you do (or at least loves to listen), yapping can be a rewarding form of quality time! Declare yourself a yapper loudly and proudly (and maybe even poke a little fun at yourself) with lighthearted expressions like: “I love to yap, it's so much fun!” “I'm a certified yapper, so let me know if I'm boring you!” “Once I get started on my favorite subject, I'll yap for hours if you'll let me.”"
