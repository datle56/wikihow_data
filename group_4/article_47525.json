      "content": "Put on jeggings for a casual outing or a night on the town. Jeggings are a great choice for casual, everyday wear, but you can also dress them up a little if you want! Put them on whenever you want to combine the comfort of leggings with the fashionable, classic look of jeans. [1] X Research source For instance, you might wear jeggings with your favorite baggy t-shirt and sneakers for a trip to the grocery store, then put on a nice blouse and pumps and wear them out for a date night."

      "content": "Throw on a loose, tunic-style top to balance your look. While jeggings are great for showing off your legs, they’ll also show off everything else below the waist! For the most flattering look, pair them with a top that’s a little loose and flowy, and also long enough to cover your butt. [2] X Research source A long, loose top will help cover up any bumps or bulges around your hips, thighs, and midsection to create a flattering silhouette. For example, you could put on a tunic, a flowy blouse, or a slouchy, long sweater. Tops with asymmetrical hems create an interesting visual line. They also let you show off a little bit of your shape while still leaving something to the imagination!"

      "content": "Pick a colorful or patterned top to contrast with your jeggings. Like their cousins, jeans, most jeggings come in neutral colors like dark blue, black, or gray. To add a fun and eye-catching element to your outfit, match your jeggings with a more colorful top. [3] X Research source For instance, you could pair some dark blue jeggings with a bright yellow tunic or a jewel-toned, patterned shirt dress. Not all jeggings are plain, though. Mix it up by wearing a solid-colored top with some brightly colored floral print jeggings."

If your jeggings are dark or neutral, add some excitement with some bright or jewel-toned footwear. [6] X Research source For example, pair gray or dark blue jeggings with a solid teal tunic and yellow polka-dot flats for a fun and springy ensemble. If your jeggings are patterned or brightly colored, stick with shoes in a neutral shade, like black, white, brown, gray, or nude."

      "content": "Wear jeggings when the weather is cool so you don’t overheat. In general, jeggings are tight like leggings and thick like jeans, so they can be pretty unforgiving in hot, humid weather. Save them for the autumn, cool spring days, and mild winter weather. [7] X Research source You can get jeggings that are thinner and stretchier, more like regular leggings. Look for jeggings specifically made for active use if you want to wear them on hot days or while jogging or working out. For really cold weather, get a pair of extra thick or fleece-lined jeggings to keep your legs nice and toasty."

      "content": "Get cozy with a slouchy sweater. Jeggings pair wonderfully with long, comfy sweaters and sweater tunics. Grab your favorite long or oversized sweater and put it on over jeggings to stay warm and stylish. [8] X Research source For instance, if you’re heading out for the afternoon on a chilly fall day, put on a chunky, thigh-length cable knit sweater over a pair of fleece-lined jeggings."

      "content": "Put on a sweater dress for a dressier look. Sweater dresses are great for dressing up in cooler weather, but they tend to leave your legs out in the cold. Fortunately, they look fantastic over leggings or skinny jeans—and jeggings, of course, are the best of both worlds! [9] X Research source Pair a short sweater dress with your favorite pair of jeggings for an outfit that’s sexy but won’t freeze your knees off. If your dress is colorful, stick to dark or neutral jeggings so they don’t distract attention from the dress."

      "content": "Layer on a long jacket or cardigan if it’s chilly out. Jeggings look fantastic with layers, which means they make a great part of a chilly weather ensemble! Keep warm and flatter your figure with a long jacket or cardigan over jeggings on crisp autumn or mild winter days. For example, put on a pair of jeggings with a long blouse and a duster jacket for a cozy but put-together look."

      "content": "Throw on some boots to keep your feet warm. Jeggings work even better than skinny jeans for tucking into all sorts of boots. [10] X Research source In the autumn or winter, wear them with ankle boots or even a sexy pair of thigh-highs! Slouchy or chunky boots make a nice contrast with the slim, form-fitting line of the jeggings. For example, brighten up a winter day by wearing black jeggings with a slouchy red turtleneck and matching ankle boots, then bundle up in a long gray jacket."

Have a short dress or skirt that you’ve been dying to wear, but don’t want to put your whole thigh area on display? Jeggings to the rescue! Put on your favorite pair of jeggings under a miniskirt or an above-the-knee dress for a slightly dressed-up look. [11] X Research source Stick to plain and simple jeggings in a neutral color to pull off this look. This will help focus attention on the dress rather than the pants. Jeggings and their close relatives, skinny jeans, look especially cool and classic when paired with a button-up shirt dress. [12] X Research source"

If your workplace is really formal or conservative, skip the jeggings and stick to traditional dress pants or slacks."
