      "content": "Dab raw honey onto the ulcer up to 4 times a day. Unpasteurized or unfiltered honey contains tons of wound-healing enzymes that can reduce the healing time of mouth sores. Use a clean finger to dab a drop or two of honey onto the ulcer. If the ulcer is on your lip, resist the urge to lick the honey off. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Look for a bottle or jar of honey that says “raw” or “unfiltered” on the label. Don't use regular honey because it's often heated before bottling, which removes its antioxidants and antibacterial properties."

      "title": "Avoid overly acidic or salty foods to avoid irritating the ulcer.",
      "content": "Avoid overly acidic or salty foods to avoid irritating the ulcer. Bland foods are best when you have an ulcer because too much spice or acidity can irritate the open wound and slow down the healing process. Citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes, hot sauce, and spicy peppers will have to wait until the ulcer has healed. [13] X Research source Beer, wine, liquor, and caffeinated or carbonated drinks may also irritate ulcers inside your mouth. If you choose to have these kinds of foods and drinks, rinse your mouth out with water afterwards to minimize irritation."

      "content": "Eat soft foods and avoid hard, crunchy foods. Hard or crunchy foods can irritate the ulcer, increasing the time it takes to heal. These foods may also cause you to chew more, pulling on the skin around the ulcer and making it worse (especially if you have one located on your inner cheek or tongue). Opt for soft foods like oats, rice, potatoes, yogurt, cottage cheese, soup, well-cooked pasta, and well-cooked vegetables. [14] X Research source If you have an ulcer on your inner cheek or tongue, chop up foods like bread and meats as much as possible to decrease the amount of chewing you need to do. Serve chewy or tougher foods with gravies or sauces to make them easier to eat. Use a food processor to mash up fruits and vegetables to make them easier to eat. Avoid eating things like chips, popcorn, crispy pizza, toast, raw vegetables, and nuts until your ulcer has healed."

Check the label on the packet or bottle of lozenges to see how many milligrams are in each lozenge. Most varieties recommend up to 4 lozenges per day. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For women, the daily recommended amount of zinc per day is 8 mg. Men should get 11 mg. It’s safe to take up to 40 mg per day. If you choose to take zinc long-term, you will also need to take a copper supplement. Taking zinc over a long period of time will deplete your body’s natural copper stores. You can buy zinc lozenges at most grocery or drug stores."

      "content": "Increase your intake of vitamin B-12 to speed healing and prevent future ulcers. B-12 helps your body make DNA and keeps your blood cells healthy. A diet low in this essential nutrient puts you at a higher risk of developing mouth ulcers. If you follow a plant-based diet, you're more likely to have a B-12 deficiency. If allergies or dietary restrictions prevent you from getting enough B-12 from food, talk to your doctor about taking a supplement. [17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Vegan sources of B-12 include fortified nutritional yeast, fortified plant milk (almond, soy, coconut), fortified cereals, faux-meat products (fortified seitan, tempeh, and tofu), and nori (seaweed). Animal products like fish, poultry, meat, eggs, milk, and milk products are all good sources of B-12."

      "content": "Go to your doctor if your mouth ulcer worsens or lasts longer than 3 weeks. If you notice the ulcer is getting painful or red, or if it lingers longer than 3 weeks, it could be a symptom of a larger condition. You may have a nutritional deficiency that requires a doctor’s supervision and treatment, a viral infection, or (less likely) Crohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease. [18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your dentist can assess the ulcer and suggest a course of treatment. However, it’s best to visit your doctor in case they need to take blood or perform other tests to determine the cause of the ulcer. Bleeding and white patches around the ulcer are signs of an infection. Recurring mouth ulcers can also be a symptom of Celiac disease. [19] X Research source Talk to your doctor about this possibility, especially if you also have symptoms such as chronic diarrhea or constipation, bloating, gas, abdominal pain, nausea, or pale, foul-smelling stools.

      "title": "See your dentist about defective fillings or ill-fitting mouth pieces if necessary.",
      "content": "See your dentist about defective fillings or ill-fitting mouth pieces if necessary. If you suspect friction from a faulty filling or poorly fitting dentures or retainers has caused the ulcer, see your dentist. Replacing or refitting the filling can stop sharp edges of your teeth from irritating your sensitive mouth tissue. Likewise, getting refitted for a retainer or dentures will ease pressure on your gums and allow the ulcer to heal without further irritation. [21] X Research source For instance, if the ulcer is located on your inner lip directly in front of where a filling has fallen out, it’s wise to assume that the sharp edges around the cavity have caused the ulcer."

It will show up as a white, lacy pattern on the insides of your cheeks. Your doctor or dentist may give you a corticosteroid gel or injection to clear it up.
