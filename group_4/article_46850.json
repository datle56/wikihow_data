      "title": "Hold the axe tightly.",
      "content": "Hold the axe tightly. Your body should be loose and relaxed, while your hands need to firmly grip the axe itself. Make sure your hands are a few inches apart on the axe handle before you start chopping. [1] X Research source Grab the axe by placing your non-dominant hand 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) above the end of the axe handle. Position your other hand approximately 25% down the handle below the blade of the axe. If you are right-handed, your right hand should be the one closest to the blade. If you are left-handed, the opposite is true."

      "title": "Chop the wood in a cautious, controlled manner.",
      "content": "Chop the wood in a cautious, controlled manner. Accuracy is more important that power, so there’s no need to overswing. Glide the hand that is closest to the blade down towards the end of the handle as you swing the axe. The top hand should come down the handle and meet the bottom hand by the time you have finished the swing. [2] X Research source To help with accuracy, make a chalk mark where you want to chop the wood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swing the axe to chop into the wood at a 45-degree angle.",
      "content": "Swing the axe to chop into the wood at a 45-degree angle. Stand directly over the wood as you do this. Always leave part of your axe blade exposed and not touching the wood. This will ensure that your axe does not get stuck. [3] X Research source Aim your swing for the top, middle and bottom portion of each side of the spot where you are cutting the wood."
    },
    {
      "title": "Alternate swinging the axe from the left and right sides of the target on the wood.",
      "content": "Alternate swinging the axe from the left and right sides of the target on the wood. Bring the axe up over your left and right shoulder, switching from one side to the other as you bring the axe down on each side of the target spot on the wood. [4] X Research source Not only does this technique help you chop the wood faster, it puts less stress on both sides of your body and allows you to chop for longer periods of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat this swing pattern until you have chopped through the wood.",
      "content": "Repeat this swing pattern until you have chopped through the wood. Stay consistent with the placement of your strokes. The more accurate you are, the quicker the job gets done! [5] X Research source It is smart to do all of your chopping either right or left-handed, whichever is your natural swing. In the long run, it is important to learn how to chop with both your right and left hand. This will make you a more efficient chopper and save lots of time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set up the wood on a chopping block.",
      "content": "Set up the wood on a chopping block. A chopping block could be the base of a tree or a sturdy table. It should be right in the middle of the chopping area. Take time to mark out a clear chopping area that is free of obstructions and trip hazards. The distance from the chopping block to the edge of the chopping area is roughly the distance of an outstretched arm plus the length of three axes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower yourself onto one knee next to the chopping block.",
      "content": "Lower yourself onto one knee next to the chopping block. Putting yourself on one knee helps balance your body as you go to chop. Don’t crouch like a baseball catcher or go down on both knees, since that can throw off you’re your balance. If you’re a righty, your right knee should be on the ground. If you’re a lefty, your left knee should be on the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use your off hand to steady the wood.",
      "content": "Use your off hand to steady the wood. Hold the axe firmly with the other hand. Keep your off hand near the base of the wood you’re about to chop. Under no circumstances should you steady the wood by placing your hand near the top of the piece of wood. Keep your off hand as far away from the axe as possible to avoid accidents."
    },
    {
      "title": "Swing down in the same spot every time when chopping.",
      "content": "Swing down in the same spot every time when chopping. Bend at the elbow to swing while keeping your wrist and hand straight. Aim carefully and chop the wood until you have cut it into two pieces. Alternate bringing the axe down onto the right and the left sides of the targeted area on the wood. A “V” will emerge in the wood. Keep your eyes on the target area on the wood as you swing. Do not chop straight down, as this will cause the axe head to bounce and could lead to serious injuries."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sweep the chopping block to remove excess wood.",
      "content": "Sweep the chopping block to remove excess wood. Sweep the wood chips off of the chopping block with your hand. You can use the chips as kindling, as a hatchet is the perfect size for splitting kindling for a fire. [6] X Research source To avoid splinters, wear gloves when clearing off your chopping block."

    {
      "title": "Place the ends of the log on stands.",
      "content": "Place the ends of the log on stands. Then, put a wedge on both ends of the log to lock it in place. These stands should be tall enough to have the log sit close to hip-level, but no taller than that. You should be able to sit astride the log and have your feet flat on the ground. [7] X Research source Sitting astride means placing your legs on either side of the log and sitting on the log itself. If your feet are not flat on the ground, the stands are too tall. You will need to replace them with shorter stands if this is the case."

    {
      "title": "Grip the part near the head of the axe with your dominant hand.",
      "content": "Grip the part near the head of the axe with your dominant hand. The thumb of your dominant hand should lay on the shoulder of the handle. If you have your thumb around the handle, you risk injuring your thumbnail. [8] X Research source Your off hand should be right underneath your dominant hand. Have the bottom of your dominant hand touching the top of your off hand for maximum axe control."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the log to see which direction you need to chop.",
      "content": "Examine the log to see which direction you need to chop. If the log has cracks in it going downward from left to right, you must hew away from you on the upper part of the log and towards the lower part. If the log has cracks that go upward from left to right, you’ll have to hew in the opposite direction. [9] X Research source Doing this avoids conflicting with the structure of the wood and gives you the cleanest chop possible."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move backwards slowly to check your progress.",
      "content": "Move backwards slowly to check your progress. This lets you check the quality of the surface you’ve hewn. Chop as evenly as possible to repel water as best as you can. [10] X Research source Flakes of wood can create pockets for rainwater, so place the log upside-down before you hew it."

      "title": "Try a Double Bit axe for throwing.",
      "content": "Try a Double Bit axe for throwing. This type of axe used to be very common in the forest, where workers would use one side for felling trees and the other side for limbing them. Nowadays, these tools are used for the sport of axe throwing. Contestants aim for a target about 20 feet away and try to hit the center of it. [11] X Research source If you are going to do this activity, make sure you are with people who have experience throwing axes. Never attempt a throw unless you are absolutely sure no one is within three meters behind you, eight meters to the side of you, or 15 meters behind your target."

      "content": "Utilize an ice pick for mountain climbing. Ice picks have been used for centuries to help climbers scale and descend mountains. To use it as a walking stick, hold the center of the head. It also works for cutting out steps in icy slopes and catching yourself if you slip. [12] X Research source Ice picks used to be made with a wooden handle, but now they are required to have a metal handle."

      "title": "Break out a fire axe in case of an emergency.",
      "content": "Break out a fire axe in case of an emergency. Fire axes are used to chop down doors and windows when an emergency occurs. The top hand should be right below the axe head, while the bottom hand should be near the base of the handle. Swings should be short, compact, and accurate. Make sure your hands are comfortably spaced on the axe handle. This gives you better control of the axe."

      "content": "Work with a meat cleaver when cooking big meals. Meat cleavers are perfect for large ingredients, such as whole lobsters, whole chickens, or big squashes. If you make a lot of stock, using a cleaver is great because it lets you expose more of the bone and meat to the water for premium flavor extraction. [13] X Research source Cleavers are good for other tasks as well, like mincing raw meat, crushing garlic, or cracking coconuts."
