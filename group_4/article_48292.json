      "content": "Men often don't have enough physical affection. This can become a very serious need for men in relationships, as sex and intimacy coach Shelby Devlin emphasizes: \"We just don't get enough nurturing touch. And in our culture, especially with heterosexual men, all the touch they receive is sexual or punitive.\" Here are ways to give him the affection he needs (both physical and emotional): Be naked together. Devlin notes that \"just being naked together in general, taking a bath together, taking a shower together, giving each other massages,\" are all ways to show physical affection. Talk to him about the kinds of affection he likes and then surprise him with spontaneous acts of affection. For example, you might walk up and give him a hug from behind as he's washing dishes or squeeze his arm as you pass him in the hall. Compliment him at least once a day. Focus on something you like about him as a person, not something he's done for you. Men are taught that their value is in their ability to do stuff, but deep down they just want to be loved for who they are. [4] X Research source Send him a sweet text message or cute love note .
