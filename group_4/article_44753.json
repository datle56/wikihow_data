      "title": "Keep your child hydrated.",
      "content": "Keep your child hydrated. A lot of liquid is lost through vomiting. You should strive to keep your child hydrated for the duration of their sickness. Water is the best liquid, but varying drinks will help encourage fluid intake. Encourage your child to take small, slow sips of liquids frequently, every five to 10 minutes if possible. Try to have a beverage by them at all times. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stick to clear liquids for the most part. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some sour, carbonated drinks like ginger ale and lemonade could also help. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Ice pops, Popsicles, Italian ices, and other ice-based treats can take the place of liquids. These should be water-based frozen treats, not ice cream (the milk solids will often irritate sore stomachs). While these should not be the sole intake of liquids, many children will happily enjoy these treats. Also, because they cannot slurp or gulp down these items, they tend to go at a pace more friendly for the stomach. Soups can help hydrate, too. Choose clear, broth-based soups and avoid tomato, potato, and cream based soups. Soups like the classic chicken noodle soup is an excellent choice. Be careful with sports drinks. While they contain water, electrolytes, and taste good, they are highly concentrated. This can actually make things worse. A pediatric re-hydration fluid or water is usually better."

      "content": "If your child is actively vomiting, keep your child off solid foods for 24 hours. For the first 24 hours of an illness that causes vomiting, your child should not eat solid foods. Use electrolyte solutions for children, asking your pediatrician for a recommendation. Other than that, give your child things like gelatin, sugar water, and popsicles instead of solid food. [4] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source Most children who are actively vomiting will not want to eat anyway. A few children will really want to eat while nauseous; they usually confuse stomach cramps with hunger pains. If your child has a habit of this, be aware and wary."

      "content": "Avoid strong odors and other nausea triggers. Some children (and people in general) find odors a nausea trigger. The smells of food and cooking, perfume, smoke, heat, humidity, and flickering lights can all worsen symptoms of nausea. However, this varies from person to person. But if they do complain, keep them in a comfortable, well-lit room where strong smells do not reach.

      "content": "Have the child rest. Usually a child who is nauseous will be fairly lethargic anyway. But sometimes children will ignore symptoms if they are excited or absorbed in an activity. Some children will become a bit hyperactive when feeling sick. But too much physical activity can make your child's symptoms worse.

Ask your doctor or a pharmacist for a recommendation for an over-the-counter medication that might help a child with an upset stomach. Make sure to follow all instructions on the package when giving your child the medication.

      "title": "Give your child bland foods.",
      "content": "Give your child bland foods. After 24 hours, you can start giving your child solid foods if the vomiting has resolved. Foods with little taste or texture might be easier for a child to keep down. Many pediatricians used to recommend what is the BRAT diet. This stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods were believed to be easier to digest, allowing the gut a chance to rest and recover. Modern pediatricians feel the diet lacks enough nutrients to promote healing. However, for the first few days a child is sick the BRAT diet may help. Such foods may be easier to keep down due to nausea. Try feeding your child these foods and after a day or two resume a normal healthy diet filled with healthy carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. Gelatins (such as Jello) and crackers may also be easier for a child to keep down. If they are able to eat such foods, try cereal, fruit, and salty or high protein foods. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source High fat and spicy foods should be avoided as they can worsen symptoms. You should not try to feed your child solid foods until at least six hours after vomiting.

      "title": "Know when medical care is necessary.",
      "content": "Know when medical care is necessary. Nausea is usually the result of a mild bug or flu and does not require medical attention. However, under certain circumstances you should make an appointment with a pediatrician. Your child should see their doctor if the vomiting lasts more than 24 hours, or 12 hours in a baby under one year old. Babies and small toddlers are much more prone to dehydration than older children. An infant who has been constantly throwing up may need medical intervention far quicker than a teen. If your child shows signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, no tears when crying, weakness or dizziness, or decreased urination or activity, they should see the doctor. If your child appears to be vomiting blood or has bloody stools, take them to the ER immediately. This could be a sign of a serious medical condition. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If your child has a high fever with vomiting or diarrhea, or has severe abdominal pain, they should be seen by a doctor. If your child cannot keep clear liquids down, they may need an IV to rehydrate or a prescription medicine for nausea and vomiting. If you believe the cause is something that your child ate, you should take them in to rule out food poisoning or a nasty illness.

Your doctor will take a basic medical history and perform an exam. The doctor will also ask about existing medications and health conditions.

[13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Preventative therapies are designed to reduce or eliminate bouts of vomiting and diarrhea.

Stress management training can help address underlying factors that may cause vomiting. Stress management training helps a person become aware of early signs of stress reactions. Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, are usually taught early on. A therapist may also teach your child behavioral strategies to reduce stress.
