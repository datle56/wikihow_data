      "content": "Stand to the edge of the street, and look for an unoccupied cab. When you're ready to hail a taxi, stand at the edge of the sidewalk away from oncoming cars. Make sure you're at a spot where cabbies can see you, like at a street corner with great visibility. If you make it easy for drivers to see you, you will hail a taxi faster. Stand on the side of traffic moving in the direction you want to go."

      "title": "Keep an eye out for the taxi's vacancy sign.",
      "content": "Keep an eye out for the taxi's vacancy sign. Cabs usually have a light or sign on the roof to indicate whether they are occupied. Unoccupied taxi signs will light up or otherwise indicate that they're ready for service. Signs vary based on the area. If you're not sure what the cab signs mean, ask a local for help.

      "title": "Raise your hand in the air as the cab approaches.",
      "content": "Raise your hand in the air as the cab approaches. Do not wave your hand frantically. Raise your hand firmly and confidently so cabbies know you want to be picked up. Keep your hand raised until a taxi driver spots you and pull over. Step back onto the curb once you have caught a driver's attention, and wait for them to park before approaching."

    {
      "title": "Make eye contact with the driver when your taxi pulls over.",
      "content": "Make eye contact with the driver when your taxi pulls over. Once your driver has stopped, approach the taxi and make direct eye contact as you do so. Open the backseat door and enter the taxi, where you can tell the driver your destination. Have your address ready (either memorized or on a piece of paper) so you can communicate with them clearly. If you're traveling, you and your taxi driver might not speak the same language. Writing down your address is important so they know where to take you. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Find a taxi stand, if you cannot find an unoccupied taxi.",
      "content": "Find a taxi stand, if you cannot find an unoccupied taxi. Taxi stands are spots where cab drivers wait for passengers in an orderly line. Stand in line with other customers to wait for an oncoming taxi. When your turn arrives, approach the taxi and let the driver know where you want to go. [3] X Research source Usually, taxi stands are located in places with lots of traffic, like airports, hotels, or popular tourist attractions. Cabs working with taxi stands are a safe option because they have to be authorized by the stand company."

    {
      "title": "Call for a taxi instead of hailing one.",
      "content": "Call for a taxi instead of hailing one. If you cannot find any taxis in your area, search online for a local cab company. When you've found their number, call the taxi company and give them your current address. Wait outside until your cab arrives, and let the cabbie know where you want to go as you enter the backseat. Call the taxi company 15-20 minutes before you plan to leave, especially during times of high traffic. Although most cab companies are available 24/7, some are not. Always check their company policies before you call."

      "title": "Download a cab-hailing app for quicker service.",
      "content": "Download a cab-hailing app for quicker service. Most cities have cab-hailing apps available in your area. Download one for your city and order a cab. Make sure your phone's location-sharing services are on so your cabbie knows where to pick you up. Stay where you are until your taxi driver arrives. Most cab-hailing apps allow you to pay via the app using your credit card."

      "title": "Keep food and drinks to a minimum.",
      "content": "Keep food and drinks to a minimum. Ask your driver about what their food and drink policies are. If they have a no eating or drinking policy, adhere to their rules. Some taxi drivers prefer to have a strict policy to prevent spills. Alcohol is a big \"no-no,\" as passengers drinking from open alcohol containers is illegal in many areas. Do not bring and pungent foods with you into the taxi, as smells tend to linger in cars. Clean up after yourself before you exit the cab, and take any wrappers or trash with you."

      "title": "Don't ask drivers to take on more passengers than they have room for.",
      "content": "Don't ask drivers to take on more passengers than they have room for. When traveling in a group, don't ask the cabbie to accommodate more than three people. Every passenger must have a seat belt. Cramming more people than the taxi has room for can get your driver in trouble. Split into several groups if you have four or more people."

      "title": "Be polite when talking to your driver.",
      "content": "Be polite when talking to your driver. If your driver tries to make conversation, be kind and agreeable. Let them know if you're tired or don't feel like talking. In most cases, your driver will accommodate and give you space. Do not insult the taxi driver if traffic puts you behind schedule, and avoid disruptive behavior like yelling, insensitive comments, or vulgar jokes. Never ask your taxi driver to speed or break the law in any way. Driving safely is an important component of their job, and driving recklessly puts their employment status at-risk.

      "title": "Leave a tip.",
      "content": "Leave a tip. Beyond the overall fare, tipping a cabbie is polite. 20 percent is standard in most areas, but feel free to give more if your driver was especially helpful. Late at night is a common time for passengers to forget, so pay extra attention to tipping if you hailed a taxi at night. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Ask a local what taxis look like in the area.",
      "content": "Ask a local what taxis look like in the area. Taxis within a certain city often have similar makes/colors. Taxis in New York City, for example, are often yellow so city-goers can see them from a distance. But taxis in Munich are sleek and cream-colored. Generally taxis in London are black, as are taxis in Japan. A unique-looking taxi isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but you may want to check other indicators of authenticity, like a meter or your driver's ID badge. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Look for a radio or meter.",
      "content": "Look for a radio or meter. Authorized taxis will usually have a meter for determining the charge. Usually, the meter is located on the cab's hood or in the car, near the driver's seat. Taxis are also often equipped with radios to take calls from dispatchers. If you can't see a meter or a radio, do not get in the car. [7] X Research source Sometimes, especially in new car models, taximeters can be hard to spot. If you're not sure, ask your cabbie to point it out."

      "title": "Check for your driver's ID badge.",
      "content": "Check for your driver's ID badge. Taxi drivers are required to carry and display their ID badge in most countries. Their badge should have their name, a recent photo, and the company they work for. In most cases, the ID badge will be visibly hanging inside the video. If this is not the case, ask your driver to see their ID. Do not enter the car under any circumstances if they refuse. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep your bags close.",
      "content": "Keep your bags close. Illegitimate taxi drivers may try to steal from their passengers. Do not put your bags or luggage in the trunk. Instead, ask to keep them on the floor by your feet if there's room. If you're carrying expensive items, make sure you know where they are at all times."
