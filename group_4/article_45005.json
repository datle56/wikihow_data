      "title": "This will give you a smoother look.",
      "content": "This will give you a smoother look. When you’re ready to tuck, lie down on your back and pull the penis and testicles back between your legs. You might find it helpful to have your underwear pulled partway up before you start. Use one hand to hold the penis in place while you pull your underwear the rest of the way up with your other hand. [1] X Research source If the testicles are in the way, gently push them out to either side and position the penis between them."

      "title": "This method is totally optional.",
      "content": "This method is totally optional. However, some people find that it gives them a smoother, more secure tuck. To start, lie down on your back with your underwear or gaff pulled halfway up. Use 2 or 3 fingers to gently guide the testicles (balls) up into the inguinal canals—a pair of holes or sockets inside your body, behind your pubic bone. When you’re done, pull the penis and scrotum (ballsack) back between your legs. [2] X Research source If it hurts or you start to feel nauseated, stop and take a break before trying again. The testicles may naturally pull up into the inguinal canals when you’re cold. It may help to sit in a cold bath or shower for a few minutes before you start."

      "title": "Sometimes a tight pair of undies is enough.",
      "content": "Sometimes a tight pair of undies is enough. Look for underwear made of a stretchy material, like spandex or nylon. To make sure you get a snug fit, start with a pair that’s 1 or 2 sizes smaller than you’d normally wear. You can layer on a second pair for an even more secure tuck. [3] X Research source Pull your underwear up firmly to make sure everything stays in place. If regular underwear doesn’t give you the support you want, look for control-top briefs or shapewear. These types of underwear are made to smooth out bumps and bulges under formfitting clothing."

      "title": "A gaff is underwear designed for tucking.",
      "content": "A gaff is underwear designed for tucking. Look for this type of underwear online or in specialty stores that sell trans-friendly attire. Just like control briefs, gaffs are made of stretchy material and are designed to hold everything in place. However, they also offer extra support and features that you might not get from undies designed for cis women. [4] X Research source For example, some gaffs have simulated camel toe or built-in rings to help keep your junk contained. You can usually buy a gaff in the same size as your regular underwear. If you’re not sure, though, check the seller’s sizing information before you buy a pair."

      "title": "This is an affordable alternative to store-bought gaffs.",
      "content": "This is an affordable alternative to store-bought gaffs. To make your own gaff, cut the elastic waistband off a pair of nylons. Then, cut the cuff off of a crew sock to create a tube. Slide the elastic band from the nylons through the sock tube so that a loop of elastic sticks out on either side. The sock material will form the crotch part of your gaff, while the loops of waistband on either side will become leg holes. Tuck your junk like you normally would, then firmly pull up your homemade gaff. [5] X Research source If you need more support, slip on a tight pair of underwear over the gaff."

Check out trans-friendly companies like Rebirth Garments, Rubies, Outplay, or Tomboy X to find a swimsuit designed to support your body. Tuck like you normally would, then pull up the swimsuit. [6] X Research source You can always reinforce the tuck by wearing a tight thong or gaff under your swimsuit."

      "content": "Dance belts hide a bulge without tucking. Dance belts are designed to fit under a dancer’s form-fitting attire and keep their tights looking nice and smooth in front. These belts support your bits a little differently from a gaff. Instead of tucking the penis back, position it so it faces up, towards your belly button. The belt will keep it pressed flat against your belly. Pull the testicles forward so that they sit at the front of the belt pouch instead of back between your legs. [7] X Research source Look for a dance belt online or at a local dance supply store. This is a great alternative option if you find tucking uncomfortable."

      "content": "You might need to re-tuck from time to time. If you feel things slipping out of place, look for a private spot where you can check your tuck. Take a few moments to readjust your tuck and pull your underwear or gaff firmly back into place. [8] X Research source This is also a good opportunity to go to the bathroom or just give your junk a chance to “breathe” a little!"

      "title": "Tucking shouldn’t hurt.",
      "content": "Tucking shouldn’t hurt. Pain can be a sign that your tuck is too tight or that something is getting twisted or compressed in a harmful way. If you start to feel pain or discomfort—either while you’re tucking or after you’ve been tucked for a while—stop and give yourself a break. [9] X Research source Let your body rest for a bit until it feels better before you re-tuck. After you tuck, always examine your genital area and look for any spots that look pale, blotchy, purple, or blue. This kind of discoloration is a sign that your tuck is too tight and has cut off blood flow to the area. If you see it, untuck right away and try again. To minimize the chance of hurting yourself or getting an infection, it’s best not to stay tucked for more than a few hours at a time. Take frequent breaks if you plan to stay tucked all day. Be careful not to tuck for too long. Staying tucked for more than a few hours at a time can increase your risk of health problems such as bladder infections, skin irritation, circulation problems, infertility, or torsion (twisting) of the testicles.

      "content": "Not peeing enough puts you at risk of infections. It’s hard to pee once you’re tucked. Even when you don’t use tape, it can be a pain to untuck everything and then put it back in place again. But it’s important to go when the urge hits, so that you don’t damage your bladder or get a urinary tract infection. To minimize the risks: [11] X Research source Go to the bathroom right before you tuck. Take pee breaks at least once every 3 hours, or as often as you feel the need to go. [12] X Research source Spend time untucked as much as possible to give your body a break. For example, avoid staying tucked when you’re at home or when you’re sleeping. You might be tempted to drink less when you tuck so you don’t have to go as often, but drinking too little can cause dehydration. Stay healthy by drinking about 4–6 cups (0.95–1.42 L) of water per day—even when you tuck.
