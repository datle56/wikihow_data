      "content": "SB typically means “Snap Back” when sent on Snapchat. Maybe you’re currently on a hot Snapstreak with a friend, or someone just sent you a Snap. The person may message you “SB” to encourage you to send a Snap in reply. [1] X Research source “Ayyy you gotta SB or we’ll lose our streak 🔥” “You gonna SB? It’s been like 2 hours LOL” This abbreviation means the same thing when it’s spelled with all capital (SB) or all lowercase letters (sb)."

      "title": "SB often stands for “Somebody” over text.",
      "content": "SB often stands for “Somebody” over text.

[2] X Research source “SB at work told me about your little adventure this weekend 😜” “Do you know sb who could fix up my deck? 🔨”"

This 100-day streak isn’t going to advance itself 😝” “Could you SB? I’m sooooo bored 😂”"

      "content": "Text about someone in a vague sense using SB. “SB” is a great abbreviation to have on hand if you don’t feel like name-dropping someone, or if you just don’t know a lot about who you’re referring to. “I heard from sb that you don’t like coffee. Explain?? ☕” “SB online claimed that these celebs broke up, but I’m not buying it 🤔”"

You look amazing in any color 😤🌈”"

You might come across the word SB, which refers to the total number of bases a person has stolen in a game. [8] X Research source Example: That player has 4 SB in the current season. Some people may use SB as shorthand for a “sacrifice bunt,” a move where a player lets themselves be struck out so another player gets further on the bases. However, the official MLB glossary abbreviates sacrifice bunts as “SH.” [9] X Research source"
