      "title": "Drink more water.",
      "content": "Drink more water. Symptoms of dehydration are easily mistaken for hunger. If you haven't been drinking enough water throughout the day, you might confuse your body's thirst signals as signs of hunger. If you know you had a sufficient meal an hour ago and your next meal isn't for a few hours, there's a good chance you're just thirsty. [1] X Research source Drink a glass of water as soon as you wake up in the morning. Any time you feel yourself getting hungry, try drinking a glass of water before you reach for a snack. Then, if you're still hungry in a half hour or so, eat a small, healthy snack."

      "title": "Satisfy your oral fixation.",
      "content": "Satisfy your oral fixation. Some people feel compelled to snack because the basal ganglia in your brain urges you to put food in your mouth and chew. In this case it's more of a matter of habit and oral occupation than actual hunger. [2] X Research source The best way to determine if you're experiencing this kind of fixation is to rule out other possibilities by drinking more water and checking if you still feel compelled to chew. Instead of snacking, try chewing gum. If you don't like gum, you can try chewing on ice chips. Just be careful not to damage your teeth by biting too hard on too much ice. If you know you have an oral fixation, whether from previous smoking habits or your own observation, try satisfying your need to chew before you reach for a snack."

      "title": "Have some coffee or tea.",
      "content": "Have some coffee or tea. If you're trying to break out of your compulsive snack habit, you may want to drink more coffee or tea between meals. Caffeine is a natural appetite suppressant which, in moderation (and without a lot of cream and sugar), can help control your cravings for snacks. [3] X Research source Caffeine should always be consumed in moderation. Don't drink coffee all day, or you may end up feeling jittery and sick and it could keep you up at night. In order for coffee or tea to be helpful in curbing unhealthy eating habits, it's important to keep your caffeinated beverage plain. Adding cream or sugar will only tack on extra, empty calories."

      "title": "Avoid eating while watching TV.",
      "content": "Avoid eating while watching TV. Watching television while you eat is a guaranteed way to end up indulging in mindless snacking. Studies show that despite your best efforts, you won't be able to pay much attention to what you're eating or how much you eat. This leads to both poor choices in food and overindulgence in snacking. Resist the urge to snack while you watch a movie or TV show. Eat in the kitchen, instead of eating in front of your television set. If you really must snack while you watch TV or a movie, use a pre-measured serving (make sure you use the portion size indicated on the label as your guide) and limit yourself to that serving. Bringing a small handful of popcorn from the kitchen will make you less likely to overindulge than having a huge bowl or bag of snack food in front of the TV."

      "title": "Distract yourself.",
      "content": "Distract yourself. If you're prone to compulsive snacking, you may need to distract yourself until you break the habit permanently. Any time you feel compelled to mindlessly snack, go for a walk, take a bike ride, or try picking up a hobby. Keeping your brain occupied will help you forget about your craving until it passes. [4] X Research source Exercise is a great way to distract your brain while also improving brain function and releasing satisfying endorphins. [5] X Research source If you're at work and can't squeeze in a full workout, try little mini routines like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or taking a walk around the building on your coffee break. Engaging in a hobby like knitting or puzzle assembly when you're at home can help keep your hands and brain occupied while watching TV. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Get rid of temptations.",
      "content": "Get rid of temptations. Many experts agree that it's generally easier to avoid temptation than resist it. That means that when you're at the grocery store, it's easier to exercise the kind of willpower that leaves chips and cookies out of your shopping cart than it is to resist snacking on that junk food once it's in your home. [7] X Research source Don't tempt yourself by looking at or smelling sweets, chips, and other forms of junk food. Avoid walking down the snack food aisle altogether when you're at the grocery store. Rid your fridge and cabinets of unhealthy snack foods. You can give them away to a friend who isn't trying to watch his weight, or simply throw them in the garbage. Once junk food is out of your house, don't bring it back in. Avoiding unhealthy food is the best way to prevent yourself from giving in to temptation."

      "content": "Recognize when you're stressed . Many people eat compulsively to soothe stressful situations. This sets up an unhealthy cycle of relying on food for comfort, and it can cause weight gain and other health problems. [8] X Research source Remember that stress eating won't actually fix any of your problems. If anything, it creates new problems that you will have to face. Causes of stress generally fall into one of four categories: general stress, life stress, work stress, and internal stress. [9] X Research source Recognizing your source of stress and what category it falls under can help you identify stress eating habits."

      "title": "Rethink the way you exercise.",
      "content": "Rethink the way you exercise. Many people fall into the trap of believing they deserve a \"treat\" for working out. This can effectively undo all the progress you've made with your exercise routine. Studies show that when people think of exercise as work, they're more likely to indulge in unhealthy snack habits. In contrast, those who saw exercise as an enjoyable routine were more likely to eat healthy and avoid unhealthy snacks. [10] X Research source Try to think of exercise as a regular part of your day, instead of something unpleasant that you need to do. Find ways to spruce up your workout routine. If you're not enjoying it on any level, try a different workout approach. Go for a bike ride instead of jogging, or take a long, scenic walk in a park or forest. Try a dance class, like Zumba. Listen to music or podcasts while you work out. If you have a podcast you really like, keep it restricted to your workout time so you'll be motivated to work out longer and more often."

      "title": "Recognize actual hunger.",
      "content": "Recognize actual hunger. Reducing your snack intake doesn't mean starving yourself. If anything, you should focus on eating nutritious, satisfying meals at breakfast, lunch, and dinner time so that you don't experience cravings between meals or before bed. Make sure you're getting five to nine servings of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. [11] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Practice portion control. Using a smaller bowl/plate can trick your eyes and brain into thinking that you're eating more because your plate looks fuller. You'll still be just as full, and will avoid overeating. Do not skip meals. Studies have shown that people who skip meals — especially breakfast — are more likely to snack later in the day, resulting in significant weight gain and a reduction in energy.

      "content": "Stick to a meal schedule. Eating three square meals a day may not reduce your desire to snack as a coping mechanism, but it will help you feel fuller and healthier. Staying on a schedule can help condition your body to only eat at meal times, and to fill up on healthy, nutritious foods that sustain your energy levels throughout the day. [13] X Research source Try to eat each meal at the same time everyday. Bring healthy snacks like carrots, broccoli, and fresh fruit to work with you. That way you won't be tempted to hit the vending machine. Pack a lunch to bring to work or school. That way you can control your portions, as well as what you're actually eating."

      "title": "Keep a food journal",
      "content": "Keep a food journal . Studies have shown that keeping a food journal can help you reduce mindless snacking and monitor your overall diet. By taking the time to inventory everything you eat, you force yourself to consciously think about the food choices you're making. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Use a pocket-sized notebook, or download a smartphone app that will help you keep track of meals and snacks on the go. Write down everything you eat, how much you eat, and when you eat it. You may also want to make note of whether you were actually hungry, or just stressed/tired/bored. You can also write down in a separate column all the dates/times you felt like snacking but didn't. Look for patterns in your snack cravings. If they tend to happen at the same time everyday, perhaps you need to adjust your meal times accordingly. If it happens at work or school (or shortly after), you may be stress eating without realizing it."

      "title": "Slow down your eating.",
      "content": "Slow down your eating. A lot of mindless snacking ends up taking place when you eat fast or engage in other distracting activities (like watching television). Eating slowly without any distractions, and with adequate water to help satisfy your thirst, can help reduce your desire to snack later on. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Practice eating at the table, even if it's just a snack. Devote your full attention to eating. Savor the taste, and try to notice other sensory experiences like texture, smell, and appearance. Don't rush through meals or snacks. If you eat slowly, you're more likely to recognize when your body is full, thus preventing overeating."

      "title": "Eat at the right time.",
      "content": "Eat at the right time. If you must snack, it's a good idea to time your snacking so it will fill you up just enough until your next meal. Additionally, it's important to choose a snack that is healthy and will satisfy your hunger while giving you energy and nutrients. [16] X Research source The ideal snacking time is approximately two to three hours before your next meal. That way the snack will power you along until meal time. Keep snacks small and healthy. An appropriate portion for a snack is either a piece of fruit or four to six crackers. Keep your snacks between 150 and 300 calories."

      "content": "Eat a well-rounded, nutritious snack. If you must indulge in a snack, it's important to choose foods that are low in calories, fat, and added sugar. By selecting foods from the USDA food guide, you'll be sure to get a more well-rounded and satisfying snack. [17] X Research source Peanut butter and apple or banana slices makes an excellent snack. Try dipping raw carrot sticks in a low-fat dressing. Stir fresh fruit into a cup of fat-free yogurt for a refreshing, delicious treat. Mix fruits and veggies together in a blender to make a delicious smoothie. Whole-wheat crackers with hummus or bean dip are a healthy, satisfying snack."

      "title": "Opt for solid snacks instead of liquid.",
      "content": "Opt for solid snacks instead of liquid. Eating a solid snack will help satisfy your hunger longer than liquid snacks, even if they have the same number of calories. That's because it takes your body a longer time to digest a solid than it does to digest a liquid, and a solid snack feels more like a meal to your brain. [18] X Research source"

      "content": "Substitute healthy alternatives. If you're used to a specific type of snack, finding a healthy alternative can help trick your brain into feeling equally satisfied without all the calories and guilt. Try finding foods that have similar textures or flavors to replace your unhealthy snack habits at home. Eat salted, unbuttered popcorn instead of potato chips. Try freezing low-fat greek yogurt and eating that instead of ice cream. If you're used to the crunchy sensation of certain snack foods, opt for fresh baby carrots instead."
