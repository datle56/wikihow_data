Transportation: Is your new home accessible by public transit or only by car? Do you need to get an International Driving Permit (IDP) before moving? Laws: Review the basic laws in your new country, especially ones that are notably different from the rules in your home country to avoid making any costly mistakes. History and politics: Study the general history of your destination country. Countries with especially fraught political histories require special attention, as ignorance may lead you to unintentionally offend someone. Cost of living: Use a cost of living estimate service like Numbeo to get an idea of how much food, entertainment, and housing will cost you on a daily basis. Culture and customs: What holidays does your country observe? What’s the dominant religion? What are the cultural norms and codes of conduct that you must respect?"
