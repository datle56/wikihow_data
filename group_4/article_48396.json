      "title": "A packed calendar tells him he has to work for your time.",
      "content": "A packed calendar tells him he has to work for your time. If he’s been busy a lot lately or his week is filling up, just brush it off. Any time you learn about a party, sport, or get-together you want to be part of, book it. You’ll have so much entertainment in your life that it will be easier to keep him off your mind. While you’re having a blast, he might wonder what you’re up to. If he does invite you out but you made plans, keep what you already scheduled. He’ll realize to give you some advance notice if he wants to hang out. Set your RSVPs public on social media. One day, he could run across them and learn about events you like to attend. In the future, he might just pop up or invite you to an activity you seem interested in."

You’ll also be able to enjoy your own adventures while keeping him hooked.

Take the lead and introduce him to all your friends at a party if you usually let him mingle on his own. He'll notice a change and want to uncover more of who you really are. Think about what you wish he knew about you. If you’re a whiz at trivia, for example, but he’s never seen you in action, innocently invite him to a game night. You can also consider what you already want to work on. Have you always wanted to be more silly? Crack more jokes when you’re around him. You can also blend traits he has seen before with a whole new goal. If he’s sure you binge-watch movies at home, you can switch to organizing a local film festival."
