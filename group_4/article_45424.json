      "content": "Close the supply valve by turning the handle clockwise. Schuelke says, “The supply valve is directly below the toilet tank. It usually comes out of the wall or floor and a supply line connects it to the tank. Turn this valve to the right, clockwise. And then when that valve is off, give it a little bit of a snug to the right when it stops. You always want to go maybe a quarter turn more to make sure that it's completely off.” [1] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. In the odd event that the water doesn’t shut off for some reason (or if you can’t find the valve), shut off the water to your home. Go to your basement or the back of your home and locate the valve in between your water meter and the outside of your home. Close this valve to shut off water to your entire home. If the water level is high but your toilet isn’t actually overflowing, you don’t need to shut the water off."

      "content": "Drain the excess water out if the bowl is full. If you shut the water off mid-overflow, you’ve probably got a bowl full of water splashing around. Remove some of the water to make unclogging the tank less of a headache. Schuelke explains, “Take a wet shop vac and vacuum the remaining water.” If you don’t have a wet shop vac, he says you can just use a bucket to transfer the water to the tub or sink. [2] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. You don’t need to drain the bowl completely, so don’t worry about getting every drop of water out. Just remove enough of the water that you won’t make a mess by plunging or working on your toilet."

      "content": "Warm up a plunger under hot water for 2 minutes. Turn the hot water in your sink, then let the rubber, suction cup end of the plunger soak in it. This loosens the rubber so it fits better over the toilet’s opening. You will get more suction powder when you use it. [3] X Research source Be sure to use a funnel plunger . This type of plunger has a rubber ring hanging down from the suction cup. Sink plungers have no rubber flange on the bell end. This type of plunger may still work, but it isn’t as effective as funnel plungers. When to use a plunger: If you have access to a plunger, this is the best way to clear a traditional clog."

      "title": "Fit the plunger over the toilet’s exit hole.",
      "content": "Fit the plunger over the toilet’s exit hole. Put the rubber end of the plunger in the toilet bowl. If your plunger has a flange, the flange piece fits directly into the hole. Push the plunger down slightly to stick it in place. You want the plunger’s bell end to create a nice seal over the hole. [4] X Research source You can test the seal by lifting the plunger. It will feel stuck in place at first, releasing air once it pops off."

      "title": "Push the plunger down gently to release air in the bell end.",
      "content": "Push the plunger down gently to release air in the bell end. The air in the plunger’s bell end can cause an unpleasant amount of water to splash back at you! Avoid this by releasing the air before operating the plunger. Push the plunger down once, then pull it back up. [5] X Research source Once the air is released, you can safely use the plunger without the risk of serious splashback."

      "content": "Plunge in and out 15 to 20 times at a fast pace. Work at a fairly rapid pace to keep water flowing around the clog. Push the plunger down hard to send water into the pipes, then pull it back with the same force to draw the water back out. Avoid lifting the plunger off of the exit hole after each thrust. [6] X Research source Moving the water into and out of the drainage pipe with equal force increases the chances of the clog breaking up. Schuelke says that if you don't have a plunger, you can instead use a toilet brush you'd normally clean with.

      "title": "Alternate steady plunging with stronger pushes.",
      "content": "Alternate steady plunging with stronger pushes. Plunge the toilet at a constant pace for most of the time. Every few strokes, push the plunger down with as much force as you can muster without breaking the seal over the exit hole. This will push more water into the drainage pipe. Afterward, go back to plunging at an even pace once again. [8] X Research source The extra force may dislodge the clog or at least weaken it to make steady plunging more effective."

      "title": "Fill the toilet bowl with more water as needed.",
      "content": "Fill the toilet bowl with more water as needed. Water has to be in the bowl in order for plunging to be effective. You can flush the toilet or open the flapper in the tank to refill the bowl. The clog may even disperse as you add the water."

      "title": "Repeat plunging as needed until the clog clears.",
      "content": "Repeat plunging as needed until the clog clears. You may need to go through a few rounds of plunging to fix your toilet. Plunge the toilet about 15 to 20 times each time, adding more water as needed to fill the bowl. Be patient to avoid splashing water as you work. If you don’t seem to be making progress after regular plunging, you may need an auger or a professional plumber."

      "title": "Take the lid off of the toilet’s tank.",
      "content": "Take the lid off of the toilet’s tank. The lid will be behind the toilet bowl, on top of the water tank. Accessing the water tank allows you to stop the water flow, so you no longer have to wait and hope the water level stops short of the toilet's rim. Lift the lid up with both hands and gently place it on the ground somewhere out of your way. Be careful, since the lid can be heavy and may break if you drop it. When to use soap and hot water: If you don’t have a plunger or snake drain, soap and hot water should help you out in a pinch. This is also the best option if you want to put a minimum amount of strain on your pipes."

The water needs to be hot, not boiling, so it shouldn't be bubbling. Pour the water into the bowl from about waist height. The heat can help melt clogs caused by organic material. [10] X Research source Boiling water can crack porcelain, so avoid it at all costs! In an emergency, you can empty out a trash can, then use it to carry water to the toilet."

      "content": "Wait up to 30 minutes to see if the water level goes down. If you can, wait the full 30 minutes to give the soap and water plenty of time to do their work. If the soap and hot water are working, the water level should begin to lower in the toilet bowl. [11] X Research source The water may not drain. Check how high the water level is in the bowl to see if you have room to try the treatment again."

      "content": "Repeat adding soap and water to the bowl if possible. If you are sure the toilet won’t flood your bathroom, pour more soap into the bowl. Heat up more water, then add it to the bowl as well. You can do this several times as long as you have room in the bowl. If the water looks like it’s about to overflow, stop and consider trying a different treatment. If the water is about to overflow and you don’t want to try something else yet, wait.

      "title": "Flush the toilet if the water level isn’t high.",
      "content": "Flush the toilet if the water level isn’t high. Flushing forces the water down into the pipes, which may wash away the clog if the soap and water loosened it. Be careful when doing this, since the toilet will be close to flooding if the water didn't drain at all. Keep the lid off the tank so you can access the water controls. If the toilet seems likely to overflow, you may want to avoid flushing. Instead, wait and see if the water level drops or try using a plunger."

      "title": "Cover the tank’s water valve if the toilet is about to overflow.",
      "content": "Cover the tank’s water valve if the toilet is about to overflow. Sometimes when you flush the toilet, the clog will stay in place. You can stop the water from flowing by locating the flapper inside the toilet’s tank. It is a rubber valve at the bottom of the tank and is usually colored red or black. Push it down so it fits snugly in the hole at the bottom of the tank. [12] X Research source The flapper will most likely have a metal chain attached to it. Pull on the chain to lift or lower the flapper. The water inside the tank is clean, so you don’t have to worry about protecting your hands."

The corkscrew end is the part that goes in the toilet. Lower it into the exit hole, pushing it as far as it will go. [13] X Research source Any type of plumbing snake works, but the best type to get is an auger. It is designed for toilets and doesn’t scratch porcelain. When to snake your drain with an auger: If you’ve already tried plunging or using soap and water and the water still won’t drain, use an auger."

      "content": "Turn the crank until the snake stops moving. Hold the snake steady with 1 hand. Use your other hand to spin the auger’s handle clockwise. This extends the auger’s wire end so it either breaks the clog or latches onto it. Crank the handle until you cannot extend the snake any further. [14] X Research source If your snake doesn’t have a crank, rotate it by hand to push it into the clog."

      "content": "Pull the snake out of the toilet. If the clog was caused by a cloth, toy, or another object, the snake may drag it out the pipe. It may also bring back some waste or toilet paper if those were responsible for the clog. At least you can look at the end of the wire to see if it made contact with the clog. [15] X Research source If the wire is clean and empty, it may not have reached the clog. Lower it back into the hole slowly to make sure it goes down the drain."

      "content": "Plunge the toilet if the clog isn’t completely gone. Put your plunger over the toilet’s drainage exit. If there is no water in the toilet, you will need to flush the toilet or open the flapper to add some. Make sure the plunger fits over the whole, creating a good seal before you begin using it. [16] X Research source The plunger should be able to force water down the pipe, lowering the water level in the bowl as it breaks up any clogs still in the pipe. If the water completely drains from the bowl, plunging is optional. However, plunging 2 to 5 times is recommended to force out any clogging material still lingering in the pipes."

      "content": "Flush the toilet to clear out the exit pipe. Give the toilet a good flush to make sure it works correctly. You may need to do this a couple of times before the water drains normally. Any remaining material from the clog will likely be swept away as the water flows. If the toilet is still clogged, try snaking the drain and plunging again. If you can’t clear the clog at all, it may be deeper in the drain. You will have to call a plumber."

      "content": "Turn your water supply back on to see if the water cuts off. Schuelke explains that once your clog has been dealt with, you may still need to address the toilet’s water issue. A clog on its own shouldn’t cause overflowing, so the odds are high you still have some work to do. Turn the supply valve counterclockwise all the way to open the water back up and see what happens. [17] X Expert Source James Schuelke Professional Plumber Expert Interview. 1 October 2019. If the tank fills like normal and then the water automatically shuts off you’re good to go. You were just unlucky with the timing of the clog. If the tank begins to overflow again , close the supply valve again. You have an issue with your toilet’s flapper or fill valve and the tank will just keep filling until it overflows again."

Then, look at the rubber flange covering the drain at the bottom of the tank (called a flapper). If it appears damaged, you can see it opening and closing on its own, or water is obviously flowing through the edges, replace the flapper . [18] X Research source Purchase a replacement flapper that matches the style of the old flapper and fits the diameter of your drain pipe. Shut off the supply valve, flush the toilet to empty the water, and unhook the old flapper. Connect the new flapper to the handle assembly and you’re good!"

If you’re using a ton of toilet paper, you’re flushing feminine hygiene products, you use flushable wipes, or you use the toilet like a garbage can, you’re likely causing the clogs—the toilet should only be for human waste and toilet paper. If you aren’t flushing inappropriate things, it’s a sign you’ve likely got a deeper clog and need to call a plumber. [20] X Research source Despite the name, flushable wipes aren’t actually flushable—they don’t decompose in your pipes like toilet paper. Never flush them in the toilet if you use them."

      "content": "What causes toilets to overflow? You need two things to happen for a toilet to overflow: you must have a clog and your toilet flapper or fill valve must be broken (or stuck). A clog alone won’t cause a toilet to overflow usually; the water level may rise as the tank has nowhere to go, but the water supply should cut off once the tank refills. [21] X Research source If you have a septic tank, your toilet may overflow if the septic tank is full and needs to be emptied."
