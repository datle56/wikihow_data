In most instances, add an ‘s’ to the end of the singular noun to make it plural. [2] X Research source When teaching basic rules, mention that there are exceptions. But you don’t need to go into them at this point."

      "content": "Teach how to conjugate verbs . Conjugating verbs is an essential skill to understanding how to make sentences match up. This involves making a verb match the subject. For example, when you have the verb “jump,” it will be conjugated as: “I jump,” “you jump,” he jumps,” and so on. [4] X Research source Start with the present tense first and give the student lots of practice using this tense. Move onto past and future tense one at a time."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Start with teaching the present tense first. Irregular verbs can be tricky. In addition, “to be” serves as a foundation for many other types of verb phrases. It’s important to master it before moving on."

      "content": "Teach how to respond in the negative. If the student wants to disagree with something or say she did not do something, she will need to know how to construct that sentence. Show the student where to add “not” in a sentence. For example, you might say, “I am not jumping” or “I am not eating.”"

      "content": "Give quizzes that test students’ understanding. Periodically, assess your students’ learning with quizzes. This will give them a chance to put their knowledge to the test.

      "content": "Correct students in a positive way. Do not discourage your students by correcting their grammar in a way that reduces their desire to speak. Instead, correct errors by continuing the conversation and asking questions using the correct grammar. For example, your student says, “I catched the ball.” Don’t respond with “You mean, you caught the ball.” Instead, say, “You caught the ball? Did you score a point?” Continue the conversation with a gentle correction and an added question or comment."

      "title": "Know who your students are.",
      "content": "Know who your students are. In order to teach effectively, you need to know who your students are. You should also know what they want or need to learn from you. This will affect your teaching approach, as well as what you actually teach. For example, if you are teaching elementary school kids, you might focus on basic grammar rules that are easy to grasp. If you are teaching adults who are learning English as a second language, you might find these students to be older and highly motivated. They also may need immediate language skills."

Think about different styles of learning as you begin to plan how to teach grammar. Some of these learning styles include: [12] X Expert Source Jai Flicker Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 20 May 2020. Visual learning: These learners prefer reading and want to see what they’re learning. Auditory learning: These learners prefer to listen to instruction. Conversations and interactions are effective ways of teaching this learning style. Tactile learning: These learners prefer to touch and manipulate objects in order to learn about something. Kinesthetic learning: These learners move around a lot and benefit from getting up from a desk frequently."

      "content": "Use the deductive approach if you want to explain quickly. The deductive approach of teaching grammar focuses on teaching certain grammar rules and then giving examples of that rule. [14] X Research source It can be useful if you want to quickly explain grammar. It may be more useful with adult students. This approach can minimize student interaction and involvement. Clearly state what the rule allows and limits. Give a clear and brief explanation about what the grammar rule allows. Also describe what the rule does not allow. For example, always use “you were” and never use “you was.” Then follow up with an example of the rule. Illustrate the grammar rule with an example. You can use a simple sentence to illustrate it once. Then you might choose a more complicated sentence to demonstrate how the rule applies. Describe the rules with simplicity. Boil down the grammatical rules to simple terms. Try not to point out too many exceptions to the rule when you first introduce the rule."

      "title": "Choose the inductive approach to allow students to explore language.",
      "content": "Choose the inductive approach to allow students to explore language. The inductive approach allows students to discover how language and grammar works. Students learn grammar by making connections with their pre-existing understanding of language. For example, students learning English as a second language will learn to link English grammar rules to their native language grammar rules. This approach may allow for better memory retention of grammar. In addition, students are more autonomous learners. Don’t choose the inductive approach if you don’t have lots of time. Students need to work out a rule on their own by going through examples. Figuring out the rule may be at the expense of using the rule in practice. Give sentence examples that demonstrate differences. In order to help students pick out the rules, start with two sentences that have slightly different meanings. [15] X Research source For example, write: “I have read every Stephen King book,” and “I read Stephen King’s latest book last week.” Ask the student to identify the difference between these two sentences."

For example, what will they need to know so that they can go grocery shopping? How will they greet someone? [16] X Research source Beginning students can learn complex concepts and use them in conversation. In this approach, it can be difficult to determine what aspects to focus on first."

      "title": "Teach grammar through texts, stories and songs.",
      "content": "Teach grammar through texts, stories and songs. Use examples of literature and popular writing to illustrate how grammar is used. This can be an effective way to teach grammar. [17] X Research source Students can choose their own texts or stories that they’d like to use. This will make the lesson more interesting for the students. Students will also benefit from increased vocabulary. The texts can be difficult if they are too advanced for the student’s language level."
