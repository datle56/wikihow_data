Log into your account, if you haven't done so already. Make sure that you've logged into the account where the debit card is attached - if you have more than one PayPal account."

      "title": "Tap the \"Wallet\" tab.",
      "content": "Tap the \"Wallet\" tab. The Wallet tab can be found to the right of Deals in the bottom right corner. Here you'll find a convenient place for all the cards and a listing of your PayPal balance account."

      "content": "Look towards the bottom of the screen. On the top line, you can Copy the card number details with the copy button. On the next line, you'll find the card's expiration date (given in ##/##) format and Security Code (given in ###) format. You will have to remember your PIN. That's not given anywhere on the app. Keeping it displayed would make your PIN insecure, and that's something that needs to be avoided at all costs."
