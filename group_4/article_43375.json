      "content": "Soft or mushy texture Fresh potatoes are firm and not tender to the touch. If you pick up a potato and it feels soft or mushy inside, that likely means that it’s rotten. This is especially true for sweet potatoes. Since sweet potatoes have a high moisture content, when they go bad, they get mushy very quickly. [1] X Research source If the potato only has a small soft spot but the rest is firm, cut off the soft area before eating the rest."

If you have a sprouted potato that you still want to eat, just use a knife or a peeler to cut the sprouts off. [6] X Research source However, if your potato has very long sprouts, the potato likely has very little nutritional value left, and you’re better off throwing it away. As the potato sprouts, it pulls nutrients out from the potato itself. This means that eating a sprouted potato won’t be as nutritious as eating a fresh one. Cutting the sprouts off first is essential. Potato sprouts are mildly toxic, and can make you sick."

If you only notice a slight tinge of green in 1 area, cut the green parts off and enjoy your potato. [7] X Research source If the potato is bright green or green all over, don’t eat it. The solanine inside of the potato that causes the green color can be toxic in large quantities, and it doesn’t taste very good, either. [8] X Research source Never feed green potatoes to small children. Since they are smaller than adults, kids have a higher chance of developing a bad reaction to the solanine in the potato.
