Engineer Jakow Trachtenberg, whom the method is named after, created this system during his time in a Nazi concentration camp. Because Trachtenberg did not have a paper and pencil in hand, all computations had to be done in his head. While many math students now use paper for Trachtenberg equations, the method is still taught as a much faster way to solve math problems. Trachtenberg’s techniques can be used for addition, multiplication, or division. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place all your numbers in rows, adding 00s so the digits are all equal. The best way to begin using the Trachtenberg Method to add large numbers is to place all the numbers you wish to add in rows. If certain numbers have higher place values, add 00’s to the beginning of smaller ones so the amount of digits in each number is the same. [2] X Research source For example, if you were trying to add 93, 472, 65 and 3551, you would add a 0 to 472 and a 00 to 93 and 65, so that each of these numbers had the same amount of columns. This would give you 4 rows. Row 1 would have 0093, row 2 would have 0472, row 3 would have 0065, and row 4 would have 3551."

When adding the initial values of your digits using the Trachtenberg method, remember that values should never exceed 11. If they do, immediately subtract 11 from the value. Make a mental note how many times you subtract 11 in each column. This rule of 11 stops applying after you begin using your initial added value to calculate your final total. [3] X Research source"

Add up the numbers in each column, starting with the smallest place value, to get the first step of your added value. [4] X Research source For example, in the units or ones column of 0093 + 0472 + 0065 + 3551, add 3 from 0093, 2 from 0472, 5 from 0055, and 1 from 3551.

Once you’ve used addition to create your added value (the first total sum of your numbers), add another row below directly this total. This new row is where you'll include the final tally of all of the 11s you subtracted in each column during the previous step. [5] X Research source Using 0093, 0472, 0065, and 3551 as an example, this would tally up to one 11 subtracted in the ones column, two 11s subtracted in the tens column (9 + 7 = 16 - 11 and 5 + 6 = 11- 11), xero 11s subtracted in the hundreds column, and zero 11s subtracted in the thousands column. So add a row with 0021 below the added value of 3950 (since 3 + 2 + 5 + 1 - 11 = 0, 9 + 7 - 11 + 6 - 11 + 5 = 5, 0 + 4 + 0 + 5 = 9, and 0 + 0 +0 +0 = 3)."

Use this L pattern of addition for the remaining columns. [7] X Research source For example, with the numbers 3950 and 0021, add the L shape patterns of 5, 2, and 1; 9, 0, and 2; and 3, 0, and 0. Then, final total in your tens column would be 8 (5 + 2 + 1), it would be 1 in the hundreds column (9 + 0 + 2, which equals 11, carry the 1 because the rule of 11 now no longer applies) and it would be 4 in the thousands column ( 3 + 0 + 0 +1 the carried one).

The first step in using the Trachtenberg method to multiply numbers with two or more digits is to add 0s to your multiplicand (the number you’re trying to multiply; usually the one with a higher value or more digits) equal to the amount of digits in your multiplier (the number you’re multiplying your multiplicand by). If there are 2 digits in the multiplier, add 2 0s to the beginning of your multiplicand. If it’s a 4-digit number, add 4 and so on. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to multiply 972 by 18, add 2 0’s before you do any real mental multiplication so your multiplicand is now 00972."

[9] X Research source If you were multiplying 00972 by 18, your first outer pair would be 8 and 2, your second outer pair would by 8 and 7, your third outer pair would be 8 and 9, your fourth outer pair would be 8 and 0, and your fifth outer pair would be 8 and 0."

After you’ve created your “outer pairs,” create “inner pairs” connecting the tens column of your multiplier with the digits in the multiplicand. The first inner pair will always start with the column directly to the right of the first outer pair (which is the ones place value), meaning the first pair is never technically a pair, since the number is connected to nothing. [10] X Research source Your first inner pair of 00972 x 18 would be 1 and nothing, your second pair would be 1 and 2, your third pair would be 1 and 7, your fourth pair would be 1 and 9, and your fifth pair would be 1 and 0. (1 would not be paired with the final 0, since it always has to be to the right of the outer pair.) If your multiplier is 3 digits or more, no problem! Just know you’ll have 2 inner pairs, the first 1 digit to the right of the outer pair, and the second 2 digits to the right. Both inner pairs will remain unpaired at first and you’ll add up the total of all three digit pairs each time."

Multiply the first outer pair and the first inner pair, then add these multiplied totals together. (Your first inner pair value should always equal 0 since there is no number in the multiplicand for your first inner pair.) Place the ones value of your added pairs’ sum in your final total and carry the tens value to the next addition of pairs. Repeat this process until the outer pair reaches the final 0 in your multiplicand. [11] X Research source For example, the first number (the number in the ones column) of your final total value for 00972 x 18 would be 6, because 8 x 2 = 16 and 1 is not yet paired. Add the 6 (the ones value) to the final total, and carry the 1. The number in the 10s column would be 9 because 56 (8 x 7) + 2 (1 x 2) + 1 (carried) = 59, the number in the hundreds column would be 4 because 72 (8 x 9) + 7 (1 x 7) + 5 (carried) = 84, the number in the thousands column would be 7 because 0 (8 x 0) + 9 (1 x 9) + 8 (carried) = 17, and the number in the ten thousands column would be 1 because 0 (8 x 0) + 0 (1 x 0) + 1 (carried) =1.
