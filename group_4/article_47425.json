You'll find Spotify's green icon with three curved black lines on the home screen or in the app drawer. Canvas videos are enabled by default. If you play a song that has a Canvas video, the video will play automatically unless you've turned off this feature or enabled Spotify's Data Saver. Not all songs have Canvas videos, and there's no way to search for Canvas videos in the app. To test out Canvas, try playing Beyoncé's \"Hold Up\" from her album Lemonade. Tap the song once it starts playing to expand it full-screen. If you see an angry Beyoncé walking down the street, Canvas videos are already enabled."
