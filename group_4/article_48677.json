      "content": "Instagram may have marked your account as spam. When you try to follow a lot of people in a short period of time, your account may get flagged. While there's no official way to get your account unflagged immediately, some users have reported the issue solving itself after their account has been inactive for a week or two. This includes not liking posts , sending chats , or interacting with the app. Other reasons include being blocked by the user you're trying to follow, internet or server issues, and even software bugs with the app or your device. If you don't think your account has been marked as spam, see our troubleshooting section for more fixes. If the ability to follow isn't restored after a few days of inactivity, you can try reporting the issue to Instagram."
