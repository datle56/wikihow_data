      "content": "Slimy texture Look at the mushrooms to see if they have a coating of slime. If you can’t tell by looking at them, feel the mushrooms to see if they’re wet and slippery. As Cigliano explains, if they don’t feel dry, then throw them away. When the mushrooms are slimy, they have lost their flavor and nutritional volume, and there’s a bigger chance there are bacteria on the surface."

Mushrooms and other perishable items should be stored at temperatures under 40 °F (4 °C). Store mushrooms on one of your fridge’s shelves rather than keeping them in one of the produce drawers.

      "content": "Store loose mushrooms in a slightly opened paper bag. This is Cigliano’s go-to method for storing mushrooms. He advises putting all of the mushrooms in a brown paper bag and loosely folding the top of the bag over. Your mushrooms are able to breathe, and the paper bag helps absorb any moisture and prevent mold from growing. Alternatively, put your mushrooms in the smallest plastic container they fit in and cover the top with plastic wrap. Poke a few holes in the plastic wrap so the mushrooms can breathe. [5] X Research source Avoid putting your mushrooms in any tightly sealed containers with a fitted lid, as these can cause moisture build-up and lead to mold growth."

Pick out what you need, then cover the opening with a sheet of plastic wrap. [6] X Research source The plastic wrap on the original packaging already has holes in it to let the mushrooms breathe so moisture and mold don’t develop inside.

[8] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Keeping mushrooms away from raw meat and seafood is especially important if you don’t plan on cooking the mushrooms.
