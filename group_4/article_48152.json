      "content": "Using cannabis may help you get to sleep faster and stay asleep longer. In some studies, participants who used THC before bed reported that they had less trouble getting to sleep. Many patients also reported longer durations of sleep while they were high. This suggests that marijuana use before bed may be an effective sleep aid, especially in people with certain disorders, like anxiety, PTSD, depression, or chronic physical pains. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source There’s still a lot of research to be done on how cannabis affects people with sleep disorders like insomnia. Some studies suggest it may aid those who suffer from insomnia, while other studies find no concrete evidence."

      "content": "Being high may affect the quality of your sleep. Some studies find that those who use cannabis before bed have shorter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycles. [2] X Research source REM sleep is the phase of sleep in which you dream, solidify new memories, and process subconscious emotions. [3] X Research source REM sleep is vital to waking up refreshed and alert. Consistently shorter REM cycles may lead to certain diseases, like dementia, or generally poor brain activity.

      "title": "Marijuana may suppress your dreams.",
      "content": "Marijuana may suppress your dreams. Since marijuana use before bed results in shorter REM cycles, which is when your brain experiences dreams, that may also mean that you experience fewer dreams, or have trouble remembering them. In addition, once you stop using marijuana before bed, you “rebound,” or experience a heightened REM cycle, which may result in even more vivid dreams. [5] X Research source Dream suppression may be a benefit for patients with PTSD or disturbing dreams, but research into these areas is still ongoing. Much of what we know about dreams and dreaming is conjecture or extrapolation, and results may vary based on how much you smoke, your experience with marijuana, your tolerance, and many other factors."

      "title": "You may be drowsy or fatigued the next day.",
      "content": "You may be drowsy or fatigued the next day. Regular marijuana users may be familiar with the “weed hangover”—when you wake up the morning after smoking or taking an edible and feel slow or drowsy. In fact, one study shows that even 9 hours after using marijuana (and even after sleeping), your brain and motor functions may be impaired significantly. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For this reason, it’s best not to use marijuana the night before a big day, or before you have any important tasks to perform. You won’t perform your best, if you’re able to perform at all. Also, sleep has very little impact on whether or not you’re high, which means it’s not technically possible to “sleep off” a high."

      "content": "You may develop a dependence on cannabis to help you sleep. In a study that examined the sleep patterns of regular marijuana users, some participants were observed having a lower quality of sleep after they stopped using marijuana. They took longer to get to sleep, had shorter REM cycles, and sleep didn’t have the same refreshing effects on their brains. [7] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source This suggests that regular marijuana use before bed may affect your ability to sleep if you eventually stop using it. If you believe you have a dependency, consider quitting weed and turning instead to other natural sleep aids, like melatonin."

      "content": "Start with a small dose an hour before bed. Diving right into the deep end may have adverse effects, like upping your anxiety or giving you troubled sleep. If you’re new to marijuana use, go low and slow. [9] X Research source Only take a couple of puffs off that pipe, or start with a 5 mg edible. Using cannabis an hour or two before bed, rather than right before, may help you dodge the weed hangover (though it isn’t guaranteed). Just be sure you don’t have anything important to do in that hour before you hit the hay. Also, beware the beginner’s mistake of taking more if you don’t feel the effects. While smoking may result in an immediate high this isn’t always the case, and edibles typically take 30-90 minutes to take effect."

      "title": "Use indica to promote relaxation.",
      "content": "Use indica to promote relaxation. It’s widely believed that indica strains are more mellowing and relaxing, while sativa strains are energizing and promote creativity. For best results, try erring on the side of indica. That said, many experts believe that there’s no meaningful distinction between the two, save for placebo. The real sticking point may be THC versus CBD—the former is a known sedative, while the latter may be energizing in moderate doses. [10] X Research source Try a THC-heavy strain, and avoid CBD. Also, some strains have high amounts of myrcene, a compound that contributes to sedative effects, while others have limonene, which contributes to uplifting effects. These aren’t often advertised on weed packaging, but may be the cause of the indica versus sativa debate."

It’s available over-the-counter at many grocery stores and pharmacies, and is a common sleep aid. Experts recommend taking 1-3 mg an hour before bed, and to avoid upping the dose if you don’t feel it—too much may cause adverse effects like headaches or dizziness.

All are effective, so choose the form that’s most comfortable for you. Avoid taking melatonin along with prescription medications, as it can alter your medication’s effects While melatonin is a safe substance in controlled amounts, its long-term effects are still being studied. Avoid taking it as a daily supplement (stick to 1-2 times a week), and talk to a doctor to address chronic sleeping issues. [14] X Research source"
