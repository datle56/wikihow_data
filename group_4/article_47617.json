      "content": "Go with a headband that matches your hair color for a casual look. Choose a headband that is either the same color as your hair or would look good next to your hair color. This way, your headband becomes a versatile accessory that you can wear with any outfit. If you’re a brunette, try wearing a headband made of small tan or brown crystals for a touch of subtle sparkle. If you aren’t sure what colors will look best, stick with neutrals. Neon green or lavender aren’t as easy to match as black or white."

      "content": "Wear a simple, thin headband for everyday versatility. Try out a thin, subtle headband that lies flat against your head if you plan on wearing it to most of the places you go. [1] X Research source Pick a headband that’s made of metal, fabric, plastic, or a combination. Thin headbands are classic, and can be worn to work, out to dinner, or even to the gym. Try to keep embellishments and patterns simple. Go for a thinly braided solid-colored headband or a headband that has a thin stripe of pearls or rhinestones across the top."

      "content": "Pick a unique, bold headband to wear on a night out. If you’re looking for an accessory to wear on special occasions, headbands that are made of unique materials or have unique structures look great with short hair. Try a thinner headband that has a larger embellishment on it, such as a feather or flower. Wear a thicker headband made of leather if you’re going for an edgy look. [2] X Research source They also tend to stay in place better."

      "content": "Wear a headband that’s 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less in width. Both thick and thin headbands can look great with short hair, but try not to go too much wider than 1 inch (2.5 cm). The wider your headband, the more your hair and head will be covered up, which may not be as flattering if your hair is only a few inches long."

      "content": "Create volume by curling and teasing your short hair. Create body with a curling wand. Separate your hair into small, workable sections and then wrap one section around the wand. Hold it for a couple of seconds and then let the strand go and move onto the next one. After curling all of the sections, separate your curls and tease them by combing your hair towards the root. This will give you even more volume. If you want wavy hair, only wrap the top half of the strand around the wand."

Continue doing this for most of the hair along your hairline. This way, you can wear the headband solely for decoration and not rely on it to hold your hair back. [4] X Research source Choose bobby pins that match your hair color so they don’t stick out."

While you can pull all of the hair on your hairline back with your headband, it may look better if you leave some pieces out. Pull all of the hair in front of the headband out and let it frame your face. If you have bangs, pull everything back except for your bangs. Try it a few different ways to figure out what looks the best to you."
