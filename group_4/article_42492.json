It usually comes in a powdered form, and it’s one of the few fitness supplements on the market that has scientific evidence backing its usefulness. While you don’t ever need pre-workout to get a good workout, studies have shown that it can increase strength and power for both inexperienced and experienced lifters, as well as help during other kinds of athletic activity.

A good diet will give you much more energy and help you reach your fitness goals far more quickly than any pre-workout. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Start with a dose of 150 mg of caffeine. A scoop of pre-workout has around 200 mg of caffeine, but it’s a good idea to start taking it at a smaller dose, unless you’re already a heavy coffee drinker who is used to the caffeine. When 150 mg (about ¾ of a scoop) doesn’t seem effective anymore, you can start taking the standard dose. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Studies have shown that the effective dosage of caffeine for athletic performance is 3 mg per 1 kg of bodyweight (2.2 pounds). So, if you weigh 160 pounds (72.5 kg), your eventual dosage might be around 217.5 mg of caffeine. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can slowly move up your caffeine consumption until you reach the level recommended for your bodyweight. As you stop feeling the effects of your pre-workout, move your dosage up by around 10 mg of caffeine until you feel the energy boost again. Public health officials recommend that adults should limit their caffeine intake on any given day to 400-500 mg. Avoid exceeding this amount. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pre-workouts have different recipes, but the key ingredient is caffeine. There’s plenty of scientific evidence that caffeine can improve your performance during athletic activity by as much as 20% if taken before a workout. Pre-workouts will also generally have some of the following ingredients, but scientists aren’t sure if the amount present in pre-workout is enough to actually help your performance: [9] X Research source Beta-alanine: This amino acid is believed to reduce fatigue during exercise. Branched-chain amino acids: Also known as BCAAs, they’re said to improve muscle repair and growth. Creatine: In large and regular doses, creatine is a chemical compound that improves muscle size and strength. Green tea: Green tea extract is argued to reduce body fat.

But if the product doesn’t have its other ingredients listed in exact amounts, it’s best to skip it. If you’re looking for recommendations, we’ve got you covered here: [17] X Research source Ascent Pre-Workout : This pre-workout comes in a variety of flavors, none of which have a single artificial ingredient. Ladder Pre-workout : Not only does this pre-workout have a great taste without artificial flavorings, it’s also been NSF-certified, which means it doesn’t contain any banned substances for sports competitions. BeetElite : If you’re caffeine-sensitive, try out this beet-based product, which substitutes caffeine for nitric oxide based energy. Regular coffee: Drinking a cup of coffee 30 minutes before a workout can give you the same benefits as a caffeine-loaded pre-workout. If you’d like to keep things simple, try incorporating coffee into your workout routine."
