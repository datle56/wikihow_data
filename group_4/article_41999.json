      "content": "Wear a suit without a tie when the dress code calls for slightly formal attire. \"Slightly formal\" is also known as \"business casual,\" and the typical etiquette for these events is usually to wear well-fitting, professional clothes, like button downs or blouses. It’s best to wear a suit with no tie at the following events since business casual attire is generally expected: [1] X Research source Summer weddings: Summer weddings, especially outdoor ones, are a great place to wear suits without ties, as they’ll allow you to stay cool in warm weather without ditching the formal look. Cocktail parties: Cocktail parties require attire that mixes formal, casual, elegant, and comfortable looks. That gives you a wide range of options to choose from, with the suit and no tie combo being one of them. Art gallery openings: Art gallery openings are both creative and professional, which makes them the perfect place to wear a suit without a tie. Film premieres: Film premieres are more upscale than casual movie outings, but they’re still casual enough for a suit without a tie. It’s the perfect blend of formal and relaxed. For some job interviews and impromptu meetings: It can be acceptable to wear a suit with no tie in less formal business situations. But, if you’re unsure, put a tie on to be safe. Consider the location and occasion when choosing not to wear a tie. The dress code for an outdoor summer event will be different from that of a business seminar. Wearing a suit without a tie tends to look best when the suit is lighter in color, like tan or blue. Black and navy suits tend to look better with ties."

      "content": "It’s not acceptable to ditch the tie if you’re attending a highly formal event. If the dress code is black tie or you know the event will be attended by business owners, CEOs, and other high-value people, wear a tie. Not only will the dress code likely require it, but it’s also a way to show respect for the event and people attending. [2] X Research source If you choose to forgo the tie at an event like this, it may come off as too casual or inappropriate. It’s best to wear a tie if your suit is black or navy, as the look feels incomplete without one."

      "title": "Choose a shirt that complements the suit.",
      "content": "Choose a shirt that complements the suit. A t-shirt or loud flannel may draw attention to your outfit, but it will create a jarring look. For something more clean and sleek, wear a solid-colored dress shirt made out of cotton or polyester. If you want an eye-catching, dynamic look, wear a striped dress shirt. To polish your look, wear collar stays or button your shirt all the way up to keep your collar bold and crispy. A flat collar or cascade collar work well with this look, as they create a flair that draws attention away from the lack of a tie. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Know the environment before you begin to put the outfit together. Different places have different expectations. When styling a suit without a tie, make sure you know those expectations. If you’re attending a beach event, you’ll have more leeway with how loose you wear the suit. If you’re attending an interview, though, you’ll want to have a well-fitting suit that’s fully buttoned."

      "content": "Make sure the colors complement each other. Whether you’re experimenting with the dress shirt or throwing on a scarf, make sure the colors match. If you’re wearing a light grey suit, a bright red dress shirt may not be the best choice. Instead, opt for a charcoal or white dress shirt to better match the suit."

To keep your look clean and stylish, avoid mixing different suit pieces, as they can clash."
