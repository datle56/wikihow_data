      "content": "Study any other documents or reports filed. If issues have been raised in other documents filed with the court, read them so you have an understanding of the points you need to raise in your letter. For example, if the other parent alleges that the child is afraid of you, or upset at the thought of being with you, you would want to present to the court situations in which the child was happy and relaxed in your company. In addition to documents filed, review the factors the courts in your state consider when determining the best interests of the child. [1] X Research source You may be able to use those factors as a rough outline of the points you need to mention in your letter."

Making a basic outline of your letter before you start writing will help you stay on topic as you write and also give you an idea what documents or other evidence you might need to back up any statements you make. [2] X Research source Stick to the facts when you're explaining your side of the story. Although you do want to counter points made up in other reports filed, or issues raised by the other parent, you also want to make sure you don't get emotional or ramble. Instead, provide concrete examples that counter or tend to disprove the accusation. For example, if the other parent alleges that you don't pick up your child from school on time, you might note that you don't get off work until 5:30, but you made arrangements for the child to participate in an after-school program until you could pick her up from school."

If you have documents that support your statements, such as check stubs to back up the wages you claim to earn, those should be included with your letter. Your declaration gives you an opportunity to present evidence to the court, even if you anticipate testifying in court. This documentary evidence can serve to introduce the case to the judge or any appointed mediators. [3] X Research source"

Focus on your day-to-day interactions with your child, and why the parenting plan you've proposed is in your child's best interests. [4] X Research source Keep in mind that the court will evaluate your case according to the child's best interests, not necessarily whether you or the child's other parent is a better person. For this reason you should refrain from making accusations about the other parent, especially as it regards your relationship with him rather than your relationship with your child. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Start by introducing yourself and describing briefly the custody option you believe is best. The body of your letter will provide some reasons to back up your belief. If there are any urgent issues that hold key importance, address them first, then follow up with any other facts or circumstances. [7] X Research source Write truthfully without speculation or exaggeration. If you don't remember something exactly, indicate that by using words such as \"approximately\" or \"typically.\" [8] X Research source Make sure anything you describe is something you personally saw, not something someone else told you. [9] X Research source Try to be as objective as possible when you recount facts. [10] X Research source As emotional as you may be, you should avoid disparaging or insulting the other parent."

If a parent asks you to write a character reference letter, have a formal conversation with him and find out precisely what issues are being contested and what he needs from you. Character reference letters can become essential pieces of evidence in custody cases, so you want to make sure that the information you include is relevant to the matters at issue. [15] X Research source For example, if there is no dispute over the parent's sterling work record and reputation, there's no need for you to go on and on about how great she is at her job. Brainstorm with the parent about instances you've witnessed in which she interacted with her child.

Keep in mind that courts generally use the \"best interests of the child\" standard to determine custody arrangements. [18] X Research source Keep your letter focused on the child and his best interests. Begin your letter by introducing yourself and explaining your relationship to the parent and how long you've known her. Then, spend two or three paragraphs explaining why you think she should be awarded custody. Use your final paragraph to summarize the points you've made in the body of your letter.
