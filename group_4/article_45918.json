Then, paint your nails with the color of your choice—just don’t cap the free edge (you’re going to gel this later). [1] X Research source For a more vibrant or opaque color, add multiple layers of polish. Wait a few minutes between layers so the nails are dry before adding new layers. Make sure your nails are cut and filed before you clean or paint them. If your cuticles need work, push them back and scrape away dead tissue. [2] X Research source If you’re worried about UV damage, apply SPF 30 sunscreen to your hands or put on opaque gloves with the fingers snipped off before painting.

[4] X Research source If you applied multiple or thick layers, wait 24 hours for the polish to dry completely (that’s how long it takes for the liquid ingredients to evaporate away). The gel topcoat won’t adhere to the polish very well if it’s still wet. [5] X Research source If the regular polish is still too wet, the top coat might peel or slide off. The regular polish might also wrinkle or crack underneath the gel, too. [6] X Research source"

Check the instructions on your product for the exact amount of time—many LED lights only take 30 seconds, while UV lights usually take 2 minutes. At-home LED or UV lights are available online or at most department and beauty stores. Get a large one that can do a whole hand at once, or a mini one designed for one nail at a time. [9] X Research source Paint and cure your thumbs separately since the angle of the thumb when you place your whole hand under the light makes it hard to light the whole nail.

Pour 91% isopropyl alcohol onto a lint-free wipe or pad (or use disposable alcohol wipes) and wipe away the sticky layer remaining on each nail. Use a new wipe for each nail to avoid transferring the tacky residue from one nail to another. [12] X Research source Stick to lint-free wipes rather than cotton balls—they can leave fuzz on your fresh manicure. Apply cuticle oil to your cuticles if they’re feeling dry. Just wait 1-2 minutes for the alcohol to dry before putting it on."

Use smooth strokes and make “X” shapes with the buffer to slightly toughen up the surface—this will make your gel base coat stick better. [13] X Research source Alternatively, use a very fine nail file and go over each finger with just a few light strokes. Err on the side of buffing too little rather than too much to avoid wearing down your nails."

This gets rid of the dust from your buffing as well as any other debris lingering on your nails. [14] X Research source If the alcohol is too drying, try a non-acetone nail polish remover instead. Skip the cotton balls for cleaning your nails—they might leave behind fibers or fuzz.

If you don’t have a specific polish to gel transformer, try using a gel topcoat instead. Alternatively, apply several thin coats of regular polish to the gel base.

Once your nails are painted, cure them under the LED or UV light again. Check the gel transformer instructions for timing—it’ll probably be 30-60 seconds. Add a second coat and cure again. If the color is not as opaque as you want it, keep adding layers and curing in between until you’re satisfied with the look. If you opted to use regular nail polish, wait several hours (up to 24) for it to thoroughly dry before adding a gel topcoat. [22] X Research source"

Brush from base to tip and cap the free edge of your nail to seal it all in. [23] X Research source Wipe off any topcoat that gets on your skin or cuticles with a clean alcohol wipe.
