      "content": "Plug the laptop in. [1] X Research source If power the LED (typically on the side or back of the unit near the power port) does not come on when you attempt to turn on the unit, there may be an issue with your laptop battery. Connect the laptop to a power source with the AC (power) adapter if you’ve not already done so. Leave it plugged in for several minutes before turning it back on."

      "title": "Try it without the battery.",
      "content": "Try it without the battery. With the laptop unplugged, remove the battery. Reconnect the power cable and try turning on the computer. If the computer turns on without the battery, you’ll need to buy a new laptop battery. If it still won’t power on, unplug the power cord from the laptop, then hold down the power button for 5 to 30 seconds. Next, attempt to turn the computer back on—first with no battery, then with the battery installed. If it turns on without the battery this time (but not with the battery installed), buy a new battery."

      "title": "Test the power outlet.",
      "content": "Test the power outlet. First, if you’re using a power strip or extension cord, remove it and plug the laptop directly into the wall. Both extension cords and power strips can fail. If the computer still won’t turn on with those items out of the equation, rule out problems with the power outlet by plugging in a different electrical device, such as a lamp that you know works."

      "title": "Gently jiggle the power cord where it plugs into the laptop.",
      "content": "Gently jiggle the power cord where it plugs into the laptop. [2] X Research source As you do this, watch the power LED light. Lightly jiggle the connector back and forth, up and down. If the LED flickers, the issue is either with your AC adapter or the power port in your computer. Even if it doesn’t flicker, one of these components could be the issue. Look inside the power port of the laptop to see if anything appears loose, broken or missing. If you can, try to jiggle the connector inside the port (gently) with your finger. Abnormalities indicate that the port will need to be repaired. If something is off, call your manufacturer’s support line to see if you qualify for a free repair. Another option is to replacing the power jack in the laptop yourself. Like going to a repair shop, replacing the power pin yourself could void your warranty."

      "title": "Try a new AC adapter.",
      "content": "Try a new AC adapter. If the power jack appears normal, or if you’re simply unable to determine whether or not it’s defective, try a new power adapter. It’s crucial to remember that the adapter must be the exact model recommended by your computer manufacturer. Using the wrong power cable can fry your computer. See How to Check the Compatibility of an AC Adapter and Your Computer for tips on finding the right adapter."

If you feel comfortable doing so, remove the case of your computer and locate the power supply (consult your computer manual for instructions for your specific model). Make sure you are properly grounded to avoid damaging the components inside your computer. When the case is removed, locate the power supply in the back of the PC in front of an air grate. There are many colorful cables connected to the power supply that lead to other components of the PC, such as the CD Rom drive and motherboard. Remove every cable plugged into the power supply except for the one that connects directly to the motherboard (the large flat component that everything is connected to. Try booting the computer. If the computer turns on, the power supply is functional, but one of the other devices in the computer is not. Turn the computer off and plug one of the devices back into the power supply, and start the computer again. Repeat this with every device until you find the one that prevents the computer from turning on. Replace the offending hardware (or call your manufacturer for support). You can also use a power supply tester to check your computer. If the computer still doesn’t turn on, your power supply is defective."

Also, remove the new RAM and then plug it back in. See How to Upgrade RAM on a MacBook Pro, How to Install RAM in a Mac Mini, or How to Install RAM in an iMac. Three beeps followed by a 5 second pause indicates that the RAM installed is faulty and should be replaced.
