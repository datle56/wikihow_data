      "title": "Drive until your gas tank is ¼-full.",
      "content": "Drive until your gas tank is ¼-full. Cleaners work more effectively when you have less fuel in your tank, so drive for a little while if you recently filled up. Once your tank has about 4 gallons (15 L) or drops to ¼-full on the gas gauge, then you’re ready to unclog your catalytic converter. [1] X Research source Alternatively, drain your gas tank with siphon until it’s only ¼-full."

      "title": "Pour catalytic converter cleaner into your gas tank.",
      "content": "Pour catalytic converter cleaner into your gas tank. Get a bottle of catalytic converter cleaner made for the type of fuel your vehicle uses. Check the instructions on the cleaner to find out how much to add to your tank. Unscrew the gas cap on your vehicle, and stick the bottle inside to pour in the cleaner. Once you add the proper amount, take the bottle out and screw your gas cap back on. [2] X Research source Catalytic converter cleaner usually costs between $15–20 USD. Put a funnel in the gas tank nozzle and pour the cleaner through it to prevent spills. While they’re generally safe, many vehicle manufacturers don’t recommend using catalytic converter cleaners since they could potentially damage the internal components."

      "content": "Jack up your vehicle on jack stands . Wait for about 30 minutes after you drive for your vehicle to cool down. Then, find the flat jack point along the car’s frame in front of or behind the tires. Place a jack against the frame and raise your vehicle . Position jack stands under the frame and lower your vehicle back down. Then, repeat the process on the other side of your vehicle. Avoid getting underneath your vehicle while it’s on the jack since it could slip off and cause serious injuries. Removing and cleaning your catalytic converter may be difficult if you don’t have experience with automotive repairs. If you don’t feel confident doing it on your own, take your vehicle to a mechanic instead."

      "title": "Loosen the bolts to remove your catalytic converter.",
      "content": "Loosen the bolts to remove your catalytic converter . Your catalytic converter looks like a rectangular box near the middle of your exhaust system. Spray the bolts on either end of the catalytic converter with penetrating oil and then use a socket wrench to turn the bolts counterclockwise until they’re loose. Carefully set your catalytic converter down once you remove it so it doesn’t get damaged. If your catalytic converter is welded to your exhaust pipe, then cut it off of your exhaust line with a reciprocating saw. Tap on your catalytic converter with a rubber mallet and listen for a rustling sound. If you hear anything moving around inside, then it’s a sign your catalytic converter is damaged and should be replaced instead. Full replacements can cost anywhere from $300–3,500 USD depending on the parts. Once you remove your catalytic converter, avoid driving your vehicle since it will let toxic chemicals into the air and may be illegal in your area."

      "content": "Spray inside the converter with a pressure washer on low. Rent a pressure washer from your local hardware store and set it to the lowest possible setting. Point the pressure washer into the catalytic converter and flush out all the debris and buildup that’s inside. Spray the washer into both ends of the catalytic converter until you don’t see any more residue come out. [7] X Research source Avoid using high pressure since you could break the components inside the catalytic converter. If you don’t have access to a pressure washer, use a garden hose with a nozzle attachment. It may not break up as much of the clog as a power washer, but it will still help loosen it up."

Connect a vacuum test gauge to the port and start your engine to get a baseline reading. Have a friend rev your engine up to 2,000 RPMs and check the measurement again. If the gauge measurement drops significantly and continues to go down, then your catalytic converter is clogged. [18] X Research source It’s normal for the gauge reading to dip slightly when you first rev your engine, but it will return to the baseline reading if your catalytic converter is getting enough airflow. If you’re not sure if the port is a vacuum intake, start your engine and hold your finger over the port. If it lightly sucks your finger closer, then it’s the right port."
