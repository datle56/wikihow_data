      "content": "Observe when your dog barks. Dogs have a wide variety of barks, and they're usually triggered by specific situations. Look for what may be causing the barking behavior when it happens. The following are some common reasons for dogs to bark: [1] X Research source [2] X Research source Fear/Alarm. When dogs are startled or afraid, they may bark. Nervous dogs tend to bark at any unfamiliar sight or sound, regardless of where they are. Territorial protection. Dogs protect what they perceive as “their” territory. Practically speaking, this could be anywhere that your dog associates with you: your house or yard, the car, or even your “personal space” around your body. Dogs also consider places or routes they travel frequently as their territory, so if you take your dog on the same walk every day, he's likely to consider everything along that route “his.” Attention. Many dogs will bark when they want attention. These barks may be very short and focused. This is especially common if you reward the behavior by responding to the barking. Greeting. Dogs bark to say hello. They may bark at other people or other animals. They also may bark to invite some playtime. Anxiety. Dogs may bark due to separation anxiety. These dogs can't stand being alone and will bark compulsively when they are left on their own. Frustration. Dogs may bark when they're frustrated. If your dog is tied up, can't get at his favorite toy, or wants to go and play with the dog next door, he may bark to signal that he's frustrated with the situation. A dog may also bark if he's bored. [3] X Expert Source Jaimie Scott Dog Owner Trainer Expert Interview. 16 June 2020."

      "content": "Read your dog's body language. Barking communicates your dog's emotional state. Reading your dog's body language can provide clues as to how your dog feels. For example, if your dog is afraid, she may bark while hunched down. Once you know what's behind the barking, you can help quiet your dog. Here are some signs of your dog's various moods: [4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Afraid. When dogs are afraid, they make themselves smaller to appear as less of a threat. They hunch over, tuck their tails, and flatten their ears to their heads. They may yawn or lick their lips as a way of comforting themselves. Happy. When dogs are happy, their muscles are relaxed. Their mouths are loose and may look like they're smiling. They may pant. Their ears and tail are in the natural positions, and the tail may wag from side to side or in a circular movement. Alert. Dogs go on the alert if they perceive something could be a threat. Their ears are perked up and their gaze will focus on whatever they're looking at. Their tails may be upright or over the back, but they are usually still. The hackles (the fur on the shoulders and upper back) may be raised. Playful. Dogs who are feeling playful are all over the place. They're very energetic, with bouncy movements. They may jump, run in circles, or bow to invite you to play. Playful dogs may look like they're smiling. Dominant. Dogs who feel confident about the interaction display assertive body language. They stand very tall, arch their necks, and appear slightly tense. Their tails are usually upright and still. They may make eye contact. Aggressive. Dogs who feel confident and aggressive about the situation make themselves look bigger by raising their tails, pricking up their ears, and holding their heads high. They may lunge or look ready to pounce. Their lips are often retracted to show the teeth, although sometimes they may pucker their lips forward. Aggressive dogs who are feeling defensive combine fearful and confident body language."

Studies have shown that humans are fairly good at deciphering the overall emotion behind the tone of dog barks. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source [8] X Research source Happy barks are usually high-pitched. Barking as a greeting may also include other noises, such as whines and growls. Barks demanding attention are often short, focused barks. Lower-pitched or harsh-sounding barks usually indicate a disturbance of some kind, like fear or alarm. Separation anxiety barking sounds are often shrill. They sound despairing and miserable. Compulsive barking is often a monotone barking. It sounds repetitive and is often accompanied by movement that seems compulsive. [9] X Research source"

These reactions reward the dog with attention and are to be avoided. Shouting is also ineffective. Instead, completely ignore any barking. [11] X Research source Telling the dog to be “Quiet” could be counter-effective. In some cases, spritzing your dog's with a spray bottle full of water can be an effective and harmless way to startle her out of barking.

If he has a toy in his mouth, he's less likely to bark when guests arrive. Train your dog to sit quietly before allowing others to pet him when you're out.

For example, if your dog barks at a neighbor's dog, ask if your neighbor will help you. Move the stimulus a little bit at a time toward your dog. Praise her and give her treats for staying quiet. As the stimulus approaches, feed your dog some treats. If she barks, stop the treats. As the stimulus disappears, stop feeding your dog treats. Start small. Gradually increase the time spent around anything or anyone that might make your dog bark. Practice until your dog becomes more and more comfortable. Be patient.
