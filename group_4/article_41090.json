      "content": "You might be feeling angry, fearful, stressed, or upset. It’s perfectly normal (and natural) to cry when someone yells at you, especially since you’re being triggered by a harsh environment. Whether you feel attacked, embarrassed, or overwhelmed in response, being yelled at increases your stress hormones, leaving you more vulnerable and susceptible to tears. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If someone yells at you at work, for example, you might cry because you feel like you’ve disappointed them, or because they’re blaming you and you believe it’s unfair. On the bright side, crying is great for your health! When you cry, your body releases oxytocin and endorphins—feel-good chemicals known to lower your heart rate and ease emotional and physical pain.

      "content": "You may be a highly sensitive person. Highly sensitive people (HSP) tend to cry more easily than others because they get overstimulated quickly and process their emotions on a deeper level. [3] X Research source This can makes it difficult for them to control their emotions in social situations, especially if they feel threatened, angry, or uncomfortable. [4] X Research source High sensitivity isn’t classified as a mental health disorder, but it is a trait that exists in people to varying degrees. Someone can become highly sensitive because of their genetics or childhood environment. If they were frequently yelled at as a child, crying might be a way to help them cope with past trauma as an adult.

Give the web of your hand a good, hard pinch so you have something else to focus on. Just make sure you don’t squeeze too hard and bruise yourself.

I need to step away for a moment to process my emotions, but we can keep talking when I return later.” At work, the restroom is usually the safest place to escape to; prevent yourself from crying by splashing cold water on your face or washing your hands. If you go outside, take a quick walk to clear your head, get in a little exercise to release feel-good endorphins, or grab a snack to boost your mood."
