      "content": "For new players, mushrooms are the better pick. Mushrooms are rare finds, especially during the early part of the game, and having access to Life Elixirs is very important if you want to explore the mines. Even if you don't want to mine, you can always use mushrooms to craft Life Elixirs to sell. Mushrooms are a more consistent source of income if you want to sell them instead of craft elixirs with them, as they show up with more regularity than fruit."

Fruit can sell for more than mushrooms, and you have a chance of getting higher-quality fruit from the cave. If you make artisan products like wine or jam with your fruit, they sell for more gold than the base fruit."
