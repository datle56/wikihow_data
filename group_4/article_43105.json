      "title": "Mold growth",
      "content": "Mold growth Mold on blueberries typically looks like white and/or fuzzy spots. If you catch it early enough, moldy blueberries should not affect the entire bunch, so it’s important to be very careful when initially washing your produce before storing. You can usually pick out the moldy berries and the rest should still be safe to eat. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Mushy texture",
      "content": "Mushy texture Blueberries should be plump and firm with smooth skin. Wrinkling or shriveling is another sign that the blueberries are no longer good to eat. Your blueberries should not be mushy either, as this is another indicator of spoilage. This means the blueberries have lost their moisture, usually meaning that they’re past their prime. [2] X Research source Mushy blueberries may still be used in certain recipes, like pies or smoothies, as long as there is no visible mold."

      "title": "Discoloration",
      "content": "Discoloration Fun fact: blueberries are actually purple, and that’s the color they should stay in your fridge. Any discoloration, dullness, or “lifeless” appearance is a sign of spoilage."

    {
      "title": "Sour or off-putting smell",
      "content": "Sour or off-putting smell Blueberries naturally smell sweet, so if you notice a sour, bitter, or otherwise off-putting smell, it’s time to throw them in the trash. The bad odor may be a result of mold growth or the fruit’s sugars breaking down. Either way, if it doesn’t smell tempting to eat, don’t eat it."

    {
      "title": "Unpleasant taste",
      "content": "Unpleasant taste Tasting your batch of blueberries to determine whether they’re still good or not should be your last course of action. If you do pop one in your mouth and it tastes sour, then either the blueberry was harvested before it ripened, or it’s spoiled. No matter what, eating a whole bunch will be unpleasant at best and unsafe at worst. Avoid it! [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Fresh blueberries can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. If you have short-term plans for your blueberries, for example, and want them to be on hand, you can store your berries at room temperature for about two days. It’s best if you keep them in the ventilated container they come in, out of the heat and humidity. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Fresh blueberries can last up to 2 weeks in the fridge. Freshly picked or store-bought blueberries typically last up to 14 days in the fridge as long as they are properly washed and stored. The sooner you eat them, however, the fresher they’ll taste. Try to eat your blueberries by the 10-day mark, as they should still be ripe but firm and tasty. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Frozen blueberries can last up to 10 months in the freezer. If you’ve harvested way more blueberries than you can stomach—literally—freezing your leftovers is a great idea. They’ll be good to eat for about 10 months, although they tend to peak in flavor at the 6-month mark. You can toss frozen blueberries into smoothies and yogurt bowls, bake them into pies and muffins, or heat them up on the stove to make jams, jellies, and syrups. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wash your blueberries before storing.",
      "content": "Wash your blueberries before storing. Once you’ve returned home from blueberry picking or the grocery store, thoroughly wash your blueberries under cool water, careful to pick out the mushy or split ones. Then, pat them dry and find a suitable airtight container for them."

      "title": "Refrigerate your blueberries in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.",
      "content": "Refrigerate your blueberries in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Once you’ve selected your airtight container, line the bottom with a paper towel. Then, add one layer of blueberries, followed by another paper towel. The paper towel acts as a barrier between each layer, helping the berries to retain their moisture. [7] X Research source Store the blueberries in the center part of the refrigerator instead of the crisper drawer for better airflow."

      "title": "Freeze blueberries on a baking tray, then store in a freezer bag.",
      "content": "Freeze blueberries on a baking tray, then store in a freezer bag. If you’ve washed the berries, pat them dry. Then, line a baking sheet of your choice with parchment paper and spread the berries out in a single layer. Space the berries out so they don’t clump together during the freezing process. Place the baking tray in the fridge and allow the blueberries to freeze for a few hours or overnight. Make sure the berries are completely frozen and then transfer to ziplock bags, squeezing out as much air as possible for optimal storage. [8] X Research source Personal chef Jennifer Levasseur says, “It’s best to label your bag with the date and description of its contents.” Those who wash the berries before freezing should make sure they’re as dry as possible before storing. Those who choose not to wash them will have to wash them later on, but allowing them to keep their waxy coating while in the freezer can help prevent freezer burn."

When it comes to thawing your frozen blueberries, Levasseur advises to, “Place them in the refrigerator so they will thaw naturally to eat later. Or, you can run them under room temperature water through a strainer and place them in a bowl in the fridge.”"

      "title": "Do I have to wash blueberries before eating them?",
      "content": "Do I have to wash blueberries before eating them? Yes, you have to wash your blueberries before you eat them. Washing your blueberries helps to remove dirt, debris, bacteria, and pesticides. You can either wash them when you first buy them or wait until you’re ready to eat them. For extra cleanliness, you can soak your blueberries in a solution of water and a spoonful of vinegar. Make sure you dry them carefully so they don’t get mushy. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Do bad blueberries sink or float?",
      "content": "Do bad blueberries sink or float? In general, rotten blueberries tend to float, since they’ve lost their sugars and moisture, and are therefore naturally lighter. Ripe, juicy blueberries tend to sink because they’re more dense and weighed down by sugars. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Do you have to throw the whole container away if one blueberry is bad? No, one moldy blueberry does not render the entire batch inedible. If you notice only a couple of mushy and/or moldy berries, you should be fine to toss those out and eat the rest. On the other hand, if over ¼ of the berries appear mushy, it’s best to toss them all out. [11] X Research source"

It’s fine to pick out the moldy berries of the bunch and eat the rest, but only if the large majority of the berries look and smell good. You can choose to wash them before you store them so you don’t have to wash them later, or you can wash them right before you decide to eat them. It’s up to you!"
