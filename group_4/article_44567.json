      "content": "Get an accurate diagnosis from your doctor. Herpes blisters are small, red, and filled with a yellowish fluid. Small blisters can cluster together and grow into a larger blister. To rule out other causes, have your doctor examine the blisters and, if necessary, take a viral culture. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Herpes virus type 1 usually causes blisters around the mouth, and herpes virus type 2 usually causes genital outbreaks. Blisters are often painful, burn, or itch. You may also experience moderately enlarged lymph nodes. You might feel tingling or pain in the affected area just before an outbreak. Fever, swollen glands, flu-like symptoms, and decreased appetite often occur, especially during the first outbreak. It's important that you doctor does a thorough examination, as there are other conditions that can cause similar bumps around your genitals, anus, or perianal area. These include syphilis, chancroid, carcinoma, trauma, or psoriasis."

      "title": "Manage your first outbreak with a prescription antiviral.",
      "content": "Manage your first outbreak with a prescription antiviral. The first outbreak is usually more severe and lasts longer than subsequent outbreaks. Because of this, doctors typically prescribe an oral antiviral medication to manage an initial infection. The medication may be administered either episodically or continuously with suppressive therapy, depending on what your doctor prescribes. Medications for oral and genital herpes include acyclovir (better known by the brand name Zovirax), valacyclovir (better known as Valtrex), and famciclovir (better known as Famvir). These don't cure herpes, but they help relieve symptoms and shorten the outbreak's duration. The treatment is most effective when it's begun within 1 day of the outbreak onset. If the doctor prescribes an episodic treatment, the patient should be given the medication or a valid prescription for it so that they can administer it at the first sign of a new outbreak. Within 12 months of their first outbreak, about 90% of patients report at least one recurrence."

Side effects don't usually occur, but can include fatigue, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Taking a tablet with food can help prevent an upset stomach.

Apply a prescription ointment as directed. To prevent spreading the outbreak, apply the ointment with a cotton swab, and wash your hands after tending to the affected area. [3] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Don't let the swab touch anything after it's come into contact with your skin. If you need to apply more ointment, get a new swab instead of adding more medicine to the used swab. Throw the swab away promptly after applying the ointment. Ointments are usually only recommended for oral herpes. If you experience oral and genital herpes, don't apply medication intended for oral herpes on your genitals. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Ask your doctor if they recommend medication for recurrent outbreaks. Most people experience multiple herpes outbreaks, which can occur weeks or months after the first outbreak. Subsequent outbreaks are usually mild, and many people don't seek medical treatment. However, you should ask your doctor about taking antiviral medication if painful, itchy blisters affect larger patches of skin or if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms.

Depending on the type of medication prescribed, you'll take 1 to 2 tablets with a glass of water daily. Daily suppressive therapy can reduce the number of outbreaks by 70 to 80%. If you have a partner who doesn't have herpes, taking a daily medication can also reduce the risk of spreading it to them."

Episodic therapy involves taking an antiviral medication as soon as you feel tingling and burning, which are the first signs of an outbreak. For best results, you'll need to take the first dose within 24 hours of experiencing the warning signs of an outbreak. You'll then continue taking medication for 5 to 7 days.
