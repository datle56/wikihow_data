      "content": "Try to identify the source of the feeling. Is it a particular relationship that is making you feel useless? Are you feeling useless because of a certain situation you have no control over? Do you feel useless because you don't feel like you're contributing to society in all the ways that you could? Identifying the cause of the feeling is the first step towards changing your life. One way to explore your feelings is to write in a journal. Think about these questions as you write, and try to figure out what's bothering you. Alternatively, try talking over your problems with a trusted friend. Sometimes saying what you're feeling out loud can help you figure out what's wrong."

Seek out what makes you happy and what you can contribute with those skills so that you're offering something to the world. [1] X Research source One way to explore interests is to take community college classes. These classes are relatively cheap, so you can spend a semester deciding if you really are passionate about an interest. Many community colleges offer night and weekend classes if you work full time. Alternatively, try classes at your local museums if you're interested in art or history. Another way to explore interests is to pick up a book from the local library. The books are free, and you can take your time learning about your interest. If you want to meet other people with the same interest, look on social media websites like Meetup and Facebook to find people in your area with the same interest."

[5] X Research source One way to build yourself up is to use your mirror to your advantage. Every morning, look yourself in the eye, and say something positive about yourself out loud. Post affirmations on your refrigerator so you can see them every day. Write a phrase like “I am a good, worthwhile person” or others to boost your self-esteem."

However, it could be that you are just not compatible with the other person, not that you have failed to contribute to the relationship. Maybe the other person has issues he or she needs to deal with before she is in any kind of relationship, so you shouldn't place the blame on yourself. [10] X Research source"
