      "content": "He’s attracted to you. This is the most common reason why a guy would look you up and down: he likes what he sees, and he wants you to know it. He might linger on areas of particular interest, but it all boils down to the same thing—he thinks you’re hot. [1] X Research source You might see him make eye contact with you, and then “dip” his eyes down to scan the rest of your body. This is a clear sign that he’s interested in you and he wants to see more."

      "content": "He’s too shy to come and talk to you. Guys get shy sometimes, too! Maybe he thinks you’re really pretty, but he’s way too nervous to tell you that. Scanning your body is his way of taking in the view and (hopefully) working up the courage to approach you. [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When a guy is shy, he might not make a ton of eye contact with you. However, you’ll definitely notice him checking you out, even if it’s from afar. Landing a shy guy might be a little different than landing a super extroverted guy. Typically, they like it when you make the first move."

If your arms are uncrossed, if you’re facing toward him, and if you’re making eye contact and smiling, you’re sending him cues that you’re into him .

[5] X Research source Try to take stock of your own look today: are you wearing something colorful and eye-catching? If so, he might not be hitting on you, and he may just have an appreciation for your taste."

This guy might be taking you in because he thinks he knows you from somewhere. If he ever figures it out, he’ll likely come strike up a conversation with you.
