Place your diffuser near the center of your chosen room to let the oil distribute evenly around the space. Keep it on a flat surface to prevent anything from spilling or falling over while your diffuser is running. [1] X Research source Put a towel down underneath the diffuser to catch any excess water while the diffuser runs. If the towel remains dry after the first few times using it, it probably isn’t needed. You’ll also need a power outlet nearby if your diffuser needs to be plugged in."

      "content": "Lift the top off of your diffuser. While it may differ slightly between different types of diffusers, most will have a top casing that can be lifted off to reveal the reservoir. Try rotating, popping, or even just lifting the top of your diffuser to open it and get access to the internal water tank. [2] X Research source If you’re unsure how to open your diffuser, check the manufacturer's guide for instructions specific to your diffuser. Some diffusers may have two tops that need to be removed to access the reservoir. One will normally be decorative, where the other is used to trap excess moisture. If you remove the top of your diffuser and see another casing instead of a tank, remove this interior casing as well."

[4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Julie Brow-Polanco Master Herbalist & Certified Aromatherapist Expert Interview. 12 April 2022. Rather than a line or marker, some diffusers may come with a measuring jug that holds exactly the right amount of water for the reservoir. Fill this up with water and pour it into the tank. Room temperature is around 69 °F (21 °C). Put a finger in the water to test it, looking for water that is slightly cool but not cold."

[7] X Research source You can combine different types of essential oils, but you should only put a maximum of 10 drops into your diffuser. Use a few drops of each oil that you want to prevent an overpowering aroma when you turn your diffuser on. Keep track of how many drops of oil you use for each operation so you can get a better sense of how much you need. For a smaller room, you might only need 3 or 4 drops.
