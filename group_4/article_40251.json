      "content": "Acknowledge their depression is real. The first step to talking to someone with depression is acknowledging it's real. Depression is a chronic medical condition that is different from everyday sadness. Validate that person is experiencing feelings that are real instead of trying to minimize it. [2] X Research source For example, avoid phrases like, \"Everyone feels down sometimes.\" While this is true, depression is different from normal sadness. It's more complicated and chronic. Instead, say something like, \"I know depression has to be very difficult. I'm really sorry you're experiencing it.\""

      "title": "Listen more than you talk.",
      "content": "Listen more than you talk. People with depression often do not want advice or even insight. Sometimes, they simply want emotional support. Try to listen more than you talk and, rather than offering feedback, simply respond with support. Use non-verbal cues to show you're listening. Nod and make eye contact. Give verbal cues as well, by saying things like, \"Yeah\" and \"Uh-huh.\" It can also help to reiterate the person's feelings to clarify you understood. For example, \"I hear that you're feeling very tired lately all the time, and that's very frustrating for you.\" Be careful to avoid seeming like you are pitying the person. Aim to show empathy for the person rather than sympathy. Empathy means you are attempting to see what they're going through, rather than feeling sorry for them."

I promise.\" After stating as much, remind them you'll see it through with them.

A person may feel mad at themselves for failing to keep up with daily tasks. Letting them know you believe in them can mean a lot.

However, depression can interfere with a person's ability to handle daily tasks. Let the person know you're there to help, and ask them for any specific things you can do. Start off by saying something like, \"What can I do for you?\" Make it clear you mean more than just listening with this statement. Follow up with something like, \"I know you haven't been keeping up with chores. I'm willing to do your dishes if you need that.\" Always follow up. If you say you can help with something, make sure you actually provide the help you offered."

To help get the person out of this cycle, invite them to join you for activities, such as going on a walk, taking a trip to a museum, going to see a movie, or even just going for a cup of coffee. Keep in mind that they might say no, and it is important for you to honor their decision. Don't try to pressure them or make them feel bad for not wanting to do something. Activities that take place in nature can be especially helpful for depression, so you might consider inviting them on a hike, bike ride, or kayaking. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Do not give advice. If someone is depressed, they are probably already handling it the best they can. Depression is a confusing, frustrating disorder, and requires professional treatment. Do not try to give advice, as it's unlikely you will be able to solve someone's depression. For example, do not ask them if they've tried something like a specific exercise routine or a certain medication. The person is probably handling the depression with a therapist. You should also avoid telling them to change their mentality. Do not say things like, \"Why don't you practice rejecting or replacing negative thoughts?\" This can easily come off as condescending."

Be grateful for what you do have.\" Positive thinking may be difficult for someone who is depressed."
