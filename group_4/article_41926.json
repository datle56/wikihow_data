If you try to style your hair wavy after you have already styled it another way, it may be more difficult. Use a shampoo and conditioner that enhances wavy hair. When you visit your local cosmetics or grocery store, look for a shampoo and conditioner that is suited for wavy or curly hair.

Using a shampoo specifically designed for your hair will help you enhance your natural wave. If you can, refrain from washing your hair every day. Waiting two or three days to wash your hair will allow the natural oils in your hair to be restored, resulting in less dry, frizzy hair.

After you get out of the shower you can squeeze out your hair, but refrain from towel drying it. It will be easier to style your hair if it is mostly wet, and towel drying your hair can add frizziness. Use a wide tooth comb and start at the ends of your hair, working out any tangles you may have. It's important to use a wide tooth comb here as other tools can cause your hair to snag or pull, which will damage your hair. Using a brush will most likely do this, so avoid brushing your hair when it is wet. A regular comb (not wide tooth) is less likely to pull your hair, so you can use that if it is what you have. However, a wide tooth comb is the best choice."

      "content": "Apply styling product to your hair. After you have combed through your hair, you can now apply a product to enhance waves. Try to choose a product with little or no alcohol (as this can create that crunchy feeling in your hair). You can use a mousse, paste, or spray (whichever you prefer). Squirt the mousse or paste into your hand and apply it to your hair by scrunching from the ends of your hair towards your roots. You can also put the product directly in your hair. Squirt it into your hand and finger comb it through your hair. Then scrunch your hair as previously described. If you have spray, spritz it evenly throughout your hair and proceed to scrunch your hair. Look for a product that is described as curl enhancing or wave enhancing. [4] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Avoid using hairspray as this can create a crunchy, frizzy look. Try not to add product to your roots as this will create build up and can make your hair look too stiff. You will achieve the most natural wave if you apply product closer to the ends of your hair, as waves generally tend to be looser at the top and tighter at the end."

Do this until you've scrunched all of your hair, and you have your desired waviness. Avoid scrunching your hair with a towel as this can create frizziness. If you don't have a microfiber cloth, you can use an old cotton t-shirt. You want to avoid using your hands too much as they can also create frizziness in your hair."

      "content": "Blow dry or air dry your hair. You can dry your hair naturally or with a blow dryer. Drying your hair naturally will take longer, but it will prevent your hair from damage caused by heat and may help avoid frizziness. If you are going to blow dry your hair, make sure you use a diffuser. Turn the temperature on a lower heat and gently blow your hair dry with your diffuser attachment, setting the ends of your hair in the diffuser and pushing the diffuser upwards to your roots."

      "content": "Repeat all the steps from the previous method. Before you begin using heating tools, you'll want your hair to already have some wave in it. You can create this natural wave by applying product to your hair, scrunching it and drying it with a diffuser. Or, to make it simpler, simply wash, and condition your hair and let it air dry naturally. You don't have to apply styling product and scrunch it into your hair for this method -- it just may help you attain better waves. However, before your hair dries, try applying some curl or wave enhancing serum or spray. You don't have to scrunch this through your hair, but simply spritz it in your hair and comb it through with a brush or your fingers. This will give your hair a little extra wave, making it easier to curl."

      "title": "Section off your hair.",
      "content": "Section off your hair. Section your hair in about three or four sections (depending on the thickness and length of your hair). You can section it by the bottom third, middle third, and top third of your hair, or you can section it off by splitting it down your part and pulling it in front of your shoulders. Use a clip to loosely pin up the hair you aren't working with. If you are able to leave your hair down, do so. Pinning it up may cause some of the curl to fall out, or it can create creases in your hair. If you are going to clip it up, do so loosely, so that the hair is in a very loose bun or loop."

      "title": "Curl sections of your hair.",
      "content": "Curl sections of your hair. Use a one inch curling iron, or a wand, and begin to curl sections of your hair. Instead of clamping your hair in the curling iron, wrap your hair around the curling iron. Point your curling iron or wand down, and start at the root of your hair, wrapping a one inch section of your hair around the curling iron until you reach the ends of your hair. Then, hold for five or so seconds. The reason you want to wrap your hair around the curling iron instead of clamping it in the iron is because this will give you a more wavy hair look. Curling your hair like usual can create bouncy curls that look less natural. Wrapping your hair around the curling iron also creates a looser look at the top of your hair and a tighter wave at the bottom, which gives you a more natural wave look. To create waves that curl backwards, meaning they curl away from your face, place the curling iron or wand behind the strand of hair that you are curling. For example, grab a piece of hair about one inch (you can do less or more if you want tighter or looser waves) and hold it out. Then, take your curling iron, pointing downwards, and stick it behind that section of hair. Begin to wrap your hair around the curling iron or wand, starting at the top and wrapping it until your ends reach the tip of the curling iron."

Don't spray too much, though. You don't want your hair to have that crunchy feel. Try to spray closer to the ends of your hair rather than your roots."

      "title": "Comb through your waves.",
      "content": "Comb through your waves. Now that you've curled all of your hair, you may want to comb your waves or curls out a little bit. Look at your waves and decide if you want them looser. Then, take your fingers and run them through your hair. Comb them through each wave gently until you have your desired wave. Then, use your fingers to fix any fly aways. [6] X Research source If you brushed some of your pieces out a little too much you can always re-curl them. You can do this with your wand or curling iron, or you can simply take your fingers and twist your hair back into the curl. If you used hairspray it will hopefully twist back pretty easily. Try not to use a brush or regular comb on your hair while it is wavy. These can brush out your waves making your hair look bushy, and then you'll likely have to restyle your hair. If you wake up with a lot of tangles in your hair, simply run your fingers through your hair and consider re-curling some of the pieces that have fallen. You can also use an anti-frizz serum to help prevent any fly aways."

      "content": "Wash your hair in the evening. Use a wave or curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner and wash your hair as usual. Make sure you do this in the evening, shortly before you go to bed, as your waves will set overnight as your hair dries. The benefit of this styling technique is it requires little work! [7] X Research source If you normally shower in the morning, you can do this routine as you get ready. However, your braid needs time to dry and an hour or so may not be enough time to allow your braid to dry and to create waves in your hair. To speed up the process use a blow dryer on your hair while it is braided. Ultimately, doing this at night will give you the best results."

If your hair is dripping wet you can squeeze out some of the moisture with an old cotton t-shirt or microfiber cloth. [8] X Research source It's important to brush your hair before you braid it, because you don't want to brush it after you take the braid out. This will likely brush some of the waves out. To comb your hair, start at the ends of your hair and work out any tangles. Then, move your way up through your hair until you reach the roots."

      "title": "Create a braid in your hair.",
      "content": "Create a braid in your hair. Now, take your hair and braid it into one long braid (or you can do two braids -- this will create tighter waves). You can do a loose braid or a tighter braid -- it all depends on how tight you want your waves to be. [9] X Expert Source Christine George Master Hair Stylist & Colorist Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Also, remember that you will be sleeping on this braid so do what feels most comfortable to you. If you want waves that start higher up your head, french braid your hair. Keep in mind that a tighter braid may make your hair look more crimped than braided, so doing a looser braid is the safer option. If your hair isn't very wavy once you take your braid out, you can always try it again another night. You can also touch up your waves with a one inch wand or curling iron. To braid your hair, separate it into three equal sections. Then, take the left section and place it over the middle section. Then, take the right section and place it over the left section that is now the middle section. Finally, place the middle section (now the left section) and place it over the right (now middle) section. Continue to do this until you reach the ends of your hair. It's best to braid your hair while it is wet so the braid dries in your hair. However, some people have such thick hair that it won't dry completely in a braid overnight. If this is the case with your hair, try air drying it a little bit before you go to bed and before you put it in a braid. Then, once it is somewhat dry, braid it and go to sleep. When you wake up your hair will hopefully be completely dry."

      "title": "Take your braid out after you've slept.",
      "content": "Take your braid out after you've slept. The key to this hairstyle is allowing your hair lots of time to dry in the braid. Go to bed and then don't remove the braid until you wake up the next day. Once you wake up, undo your braid. Your hair should be somewhat wavy. Then, spritz your hair with a little bit of hairspray to help hold your waves and you're done! [10] X Research source If you are disappointed with the waviness in your hair, you can always touch it up with a curling iron or wand. You can also spritz your hair with water and apply a styling product to your hair to help add bounce to your waves. Another option you have is to straighten your braid once it is dry. Simply leave your braid in, making sure it is completely dry. Then, take a flat iron and run it slowly over your braid a few times. It's helpful if you have braids small enough to fit in a flat iron, so if you need to, take your braid out and re-braid your hair into five or 10 braids. Once your braids have cooled, take them out and spritz them with a little bit of hairspray."
