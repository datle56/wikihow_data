      "content": "Wringing your hands means twisting and rubbing your hands together. It’s typically a nervous gesture, signaling that you’re anxious, worried, or upset about something. [1] X Research source If you're reading somebody's body language and notice hand-wringing, there's a good chance they are experiencing these distressed feelings. Here are some examples of how the phrase is used: “She was so nervous before her big speech that all she could do was sit in the corner and wring her hands.” “I knew he was stressed when I saw him wringing his hands while he was waiting to get his grade back on the final exam.” “As time passed in the doctor’s waiting room, I realized that I couldn’t stop wringing my hands because I was so anxious.”"

      "content": "The term “hand-wringing” means expressing fake sorrow about something. It refers to someone who is putting on a display of sympathy or distress about a problem, without actually doing anything to fix it. [2] X Research source The term usually has a negative connotation, but context is important to determine this. Here are a few examples of this usage: “There was a lot of hand-wringing and empty apologies when I filed a complaint, but no one actually offered any real solutions to the problem.” “The school board has done a lot of hand-wringing about how hard things have been for the teachers this year, but no one is actually taking any action to fix things.” “People are tired of the politician’s public hand-wringing about this issue without any real plans to make things better.” An example with a less negative connotation might be, “I’ve been so anxious about this problem, but I’m done hand-wringing. I’m ready to take action!”"

      "content": "Agitated depression Restless behaviors like hand-wringing can also be a symptom of Agitated Depression (AD). AD isn’t an official diagnosis—it’s a term used to describe the agitation some people experience as a symptom of depression. In addition to hand-wringing, AD behaviors include fidgeting, nail biting, picking at skin, pacing, rocking, and racing thoughts. [10] X Research source If you’re dealing with AD, here are some tips to help calm your symptoms: Channel your restless energy into something active, like jogging, hiking, or cycling. This can distract you from any racing thoughts while also reducing anxiety and stress. Take 5-10 minutes daily to write down any racing thoughts that have been causing you distress. This cathartic practice can help you process and release these thoughts. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Wringing your hands is a normal behavior when you’re worried or anxious.",
      "content": "Wringing your hands is a normal behavior when you’re worried or anxious. Excessive or repetitive hand-wringing can sometimes be a sign of mental health problems like OCD or agitated depression, but this would only be the case if you’re experiencing other symptoms of these disorders, as well. Occasional hand-wringing alone is unlikely to be an indicator of these conditions, and it probably just means you’re stressed out. If you’re feeling anxious or stressed, be kind to yourself, and try out relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. These things can help reduce your stress, which will in turn help you stop wringing your hands."
