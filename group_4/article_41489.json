      "title": "Sip on warm water, decaffeinated tea, or broth.",
      "content": "Sip on warm water, decaffeinated tea, or broth. Warm liquids can temporarily relieve cough, itchy throat, runny nose, and sneezing. Heat your beverage until it’s warm but not too hot to consume. Then, slowly drink it. Most herbal teas are naturally caffeine-free, so they're a great option. You can drink warm fluids several times a day to get relief. Don’t gulp your warm drink, as you could accidentally burn yourself. If you have ragweed allergies, avoid chamomile tea."

      "content": "Mix 2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of honey into a cup of warm water or tea. Honey is a traditional home treatment for cough. It’s easiest to consume honey in a hot drink, so stir your honey into warm water or tea. Then, drink honey water or tea twice a day for cough relief. Never give honey to a child that’s younger than a year old, as their gut bacteria isn't developed enough to fight the bacteria that are naturally present in honey."

Insert the nozzle of the nasal spray, such as nasal saline, into one nostril, then use your finger to close up the other nostril. Spray the nasal spray up into your nostril, inhaling as you do. Then, repeat on the other side. A post-nasal drip is when mucus drains from your sinus cavities down the back of your throat. It's natural for some of this draining to take place, but allergies can make it worse. Your body will either swallow or cough up the mucus, so treating your post-nasal drip can help you relieve your cough.

Talk to your doctor before using a nasal spray."

A nasal swab to see if you have an upper-respiratory infection. A breathing test to listen to you inhale and exhale. An imaging test, like an X-ray or CT-scan , to look at your lungs."
