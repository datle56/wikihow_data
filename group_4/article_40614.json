    {
      "title": "\"Hey, we need to talk.\"",
      "content": "\"Hey, we need to talk.\" Hearing this phrase will immediately tell them \"something's wrong\" or \"something's not working out.\" A simple and straightforward sentence like this lets them know that what you're about to say is serious and requires their undivided attention. [1] X Research source Here are some other phrases you can try: \"I want to talk to you about our relationship.\" \"Can we meet up tonight? There's something I need to tell you in person.\" Use one of these conversation starters in person or via text. Either way, the other party will know that you have something urgent you want to discuss."
    },
    {
      "title": "\"This relationship isn't really working.\"",
      "content": "\"This relationship isn't really working.\" You're breaking up with this person for a reason. Even though you don't necessarily have to tell them everything , it's important to tell the truth. This conversation starter opens the floor for you to gently explain why you want to break up without outwardly blaming them.

    },
    {
      "title": "\"My heart isn't in this relationship anymore.\"",
      "content": "\"My heart isn't in this relationship anymore.\" An open and honest starter can lessen the breakup's toll. When you're breaking up with someone, try to steer clear of cliches like \"It's not you, it's me.\" Statements like this can actually hurt the other party more, as they're left wondering what went wrong. Instead, be truthful about your feelings and let them know what's going on. [3] X Research source Another way you could say this could be, \"I don't have romantic feelings for you, and I wanted you to know.\" Try to keep excuses and condescending language out of the conversation. This way, you can both leave the conversation and relationship without any question or lingering resentment."
    },
    {
      "title": "\"I feel like we have a hard time communicating.\"",
      "content": "\"I feel like we have a hard time communicating.\" This \"I\" statement can help them process the breakup. Starting a conversation with this phrase is a respectful way to get the ball moving while voicing your concerns. By putting your thoughts and feelings out there, there'll be no question as to why you want to break up. [4] X Research source Some alternative ways to say this are: \"I want to be a bigger priority to someone I'm in a relationship with.\" \"I need to feel secure in a relationship.\" Being upfront about your concerns without being accusatory is one of the nicest things you can do during a breakup."

    {
      "title": "\"I don't think we're a good fit for each other.\"",
      "content": "\"I don't think we're a good fit for each other.\" Using \"I\" statements and choosing your words carefully can help you create an easy-going conversation that doesn't put anybody down. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You could also say: \"I don't see this relationship going any further.\" \"I think we're moving in different directions.\" Practice what you'd like to say during the breakup in front of a mirror. This can help you find the right words and ease your nerves."
    },
    {
      "title": "\"I think it would be best if we ended the relationship.\"",
      "content": "\"I think it would be best if we ended the relationship.\" You've made your decision, and it may be best to just go for it. Sometimes saying what you want right away can take all that weight off your shoulders. Just remember to be kind and respectful once you've put your feelings out in the open. It may take them a while to process everything, and that's okay. [6] X Research source You should offer positive comments regarding your relationship and ensure the break up doesn't occur during or after a heated argument. You can also try saying something along the lines of, \"I think we need to break up.\" Consider planning something close to when you want to break up. Having a deadline can help you avoid a dragged out conversation where you repeat what you've said over and over again.
