This sign loves to forge their own path—if you make them choose between options A and B, they’ll end up picking option C instead. Individualistic and independent to a fault, Aquarius isn’t afraid to stand by their thoughts and opinions, even if they aren’t necessarily popular or trendy. Here are a few more great qualities Aquarius has to offer: [3] X Research source Cleverness: Aquarius is excellent at thinking both on their feet and outside of the box. Innovative: Aquarius isn’t afraid to reinvent the wheel and explore new horizons. Self-reliant: Aquarius appreciates their space and doesn’t like to feel “caged” in any aspect of their life, whether it’s in their career or relationships."

In Western astrology, each astrological constellation is assigned to a 30-degree section of a circle that represents the Sun’s path. While the Ophiuchus constellation doesn’t get its own piece of the pie, it does pop up on the Sun’s path. If you were to factor it into the normal 12-sign cycle of astrology, it would shift each date range by about a month.
