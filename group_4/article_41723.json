      "content": "Engage your transversus abdominis during every workout. In order to get the most out of your core-strengthening regimen, take a moment to find the transversus abdominis (your deepest core muscle). Once you've found it, you'll want to keep that muscle contracted and tight throughout the course of your workout. Force yourself to take a deep cough. You should feel a muscle in your abs contract, which is the transversus abdominis. The transversus abdominis runs deep in your core and extends from your belly button to your rib cage. [1] X Research source Now that you've found the transversus abdominis, practice flexing and tightening the muscle. Engage your transversus abdominis every time you work on your core, no matter which routine or muscle group you're focusing on."

      "content": "Stretch with segmental rotations. Segmental rotations (rotating your core along the spine) can help work a variety of core muscle groups with relatively little strain. Begin by lying flat on your back, then bend your knees and pull your feet as close to your buttocks as you can comfortably get them. Keep your shoulders pinned to the floor, and focus on only moving your lower body. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tighten your abdominal muscles and slowly drop both knees towards the floor on 1 side. Only go as far as you comfortably can - you should feel a strong stretching sensation, but it should not hurt. Hold the position for 3 breaths, then return to the starting position. Switch your knees to the other side, hold for 3 breaths, and repeat."

Slide a rolled up towel or a small throw pillow under your hips to help support your back. If you'd like, you can also put a folded towel under your face to help support your head. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tighten up your abdominal muscles and lift 1 arm at a time, holding each arm elevated in the air for 3 breaths. Then switch to the other arm and repeat. Tighten your abdominal muscles and lift 1 leg at a time, holding each leg for 3 breaths. Then switch to the other leg and repeat. If you prefer, you can stretch out both of your arms and legs at the same time and hold this for 30 seconds.

      "content": "Lift into a bridge position. The bridge works several muscle groups in your core, making it a highly-effective exercise. Begin by lying on your back and bending your knees. Plant your feet right in front of your buttocks as though you were about to do a sit up and keep your back as neutral as possible (not arched, but not pressed down either). [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Tighten your abdominal muscles and raise your hips off the floor.

[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Make sure your shoulder is above your elbow and aligned with your hips and knees.

      "content": "Practice side bends. Side bends can work your abdominals as well as your back and side core muscles when properly executed. If you feel capable, you can do side bends with a barbell (but don't add any weights). Otherwise, you can just use a broom or some other long, straight stick. Tighten up your abdominal muscles and stand straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your toes pointed forward and sling the broom (or barbell) across your shoulders. While holding the broom/barbell with both hands a little past your shoulders, lean to 1 side as far as you can comfortably go. Keep your feet planted on the ground throughout the workout. Hold the side bend for 3 breaths, then return to your starting position. Bend to the other side, hold for 3 breaths, and repeat. Try to complete 2 or 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps each."

Hold the lunge for 3 breaths, then stand back up. Switch to the other side and repeat. Try to do 2 to 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps each. If you have joint problems, hip, knee, ankle, foot, or spine issues, reduce the number of reps. Instead, hold the position a little longer when you want to increase the intensity."

[16] X Research source Remember to tighten your abdominal muscles as you engage in these exercises. If you're just starting out and haven't built up a lot of core strength, it's best to start out slow and easy: begin doing 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 10 repetitions each, then increase the number of repetitions and/or the number of sets as you get stronger. Kneel on both knees with your body in an upright position and the medicine ball held at your chest. Do a controlled fall forward and chest press the ball out of your hands and towards a wall in front of you as you drop. Once you've dropped to your hands, do a kneeling push up.
