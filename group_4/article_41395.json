      "content": "Itchy eyes are a common symptom of allergies. Red, itchy eyes are one of the classic symptoms of hay fever, a.k.a. allergies, which can flare up at different times of the year. Eye allergies, also called “allergic conjunctivitis,” are super common and everybody reacts differently to different allergens. But whether it’s ragweed, pollen, or dander that’s causing your allergies, they all affect your eyes pretty much the same way—they make them red, watery, and itchy.

      "content": "There are 2 types of allergic conjunctivitis (eye allergies). The most common type of eye allergy is called seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC). It’s caused by plant pollens that are in the air at different times of the year and usually occurs in the spring, summer, or fall. The other type of eye allergy is known as perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), and it occurs year-round. PAC is caused by reactions to allergens such as dust mites, mold, pet dander, or other household allergens.

      "content": "Contact lenses can also cause an allergic reaction. Your tears contain proteins that can sometimes stick to the surface of your contact lens. Sometimes, this can irritate your eye and cause an allergic reaction that makes it itchy. A much more severe version of this type of reaction is called giant papillary conjunctivitis.

Each potential cause has various symptoms, but for the most part, an eye infection has a whole lot more symptoms than allergies. While it can sometimes be tricky to figure out whether your itchy eye is caused by allergies or an infection, for the most part, if you have more than tear-like fluids coming from your eye, or you have eye pain, it’s probably more than just allergies.

      "content": "Allergens are the cause of the most common cause of itchy eyes. Allergic conjunctivitis, a.k.a. eye allergies, is caused when you’re exposed to an allergen such as pollen, animal fur, mold, or dust mites. What happens is your body senses the allergen and reacts by releasing a chemical called histamine, which causes the blood vessels in your eye to dilate and irritate the nerves in your eye, which makes them itch and water. Some folks are more sensitive to certain allergens and can have more severe symptoms. [5] X Research source"

If you’re over the age of 50, you wear contact lenses, or you look at computer screens for long periods of time without taking breaks, you’re more likely to get dry eyes. Additionally, if you spend a lot of time in air-conditioned or heated environments, or if it’s windy, cold, and dusty outside, you could get dry eyes. People who smoke, drink alcohol, or take certain medications (such as some antidepressants or blood pressure meds) are at a higher risk of getting dry eyes as well.

A common eye infection is called conjunctivitis, but you may know it as “pink eye.” It’s caused by an inflammation or infection of the membrane that surrounds your eyelid and covers the white part of your eyeball. Pink eye can be caused by different things like a chemical splash or a foreign object in your eye, but it’s commonly caused by an infection.

While an eye infection often comes with some of the classic symptoms of allergies, such as redness, itching, burning, and clear, watery discharge, it also has additional symptoms. They can vary based on the cause of your infection, but some of the common ones include pain, a gritty feeling in your eyes, thick discharge, and mucus-like discharge. A good rule of thumb is that if you have anything more than clear, tear-like fluids coming from your eye, or you feel eye pain, it’s probably more than just simple allergies.

They can help reduce the itchiness in your eye if it’s caused by allergies. However, these are only meant to be for temporary relief. They may not relieve all of your symptoms, and if you use them for too long, they can actually make your symptoms worse.

Whether you’re suffering from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) or perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), you can help manage your symptoms by doing what you can to avoid the allergens that trigger your symptoms. While many allergens are in the air and are difficult to avoid, there are strategies you can do to minimize your exposure to them. [12] X Research source For outdoor exposure: stay inside as much as you can during pollen season, avoid using window fans, wear glasses or sunglasses when you’re outside, and try not to rub your eyes. For indoor exposure: keep your windows closed, use A/C in your car and home, wash your bedding frequently (for dust mites), use a dehumidifier to keep the humidity levels low, and clean your floors by mopping them instead of dusting or sweeping. If you’re allergic to animals, wash your hands immediately after you pet them and try to avoid them as much as you can."
