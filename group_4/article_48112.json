      "content": "The 😬 emoji depicts a tense face clenching their teeth. Ever show up to school and see someone wearing the exact same outfit as you? Awkward, right? That’s the emotion here. It’s the kind of nervous, potentially even embarrassed, energy you feel whenever you drop your plate in the cafeteria, show up to a party underdressed, or forget your line in a presentation. [2] X Research source Someone might say, “Omg, I was at dinner with my boyfriend and my ex showed up 😬” or, “I thought Melissa was waving at me, so I waved back, but she was saying hi to someone behind me 😬.” Some people call the 😬 emoji the teeth or tooth emoji. That’s actually this emoji, though: 🦷 (tooth emoji)."

      "title": "The 😬 appears next to people you share a mutual best friend with.",
      "content": "The 😬 appears next to people you share a mutual best friend with. There is a person you Snapchat with more than anyone else on your friends list. That is your best friend. If your best friend has anyone else in their life who snaps them more than anyone of their other friends, the 😬 will appear next to that person’s name—even if you don’t know them. [3] X Research source You can tell they’re your best friend because a 💛 (yellow heart emoji), ❤️ (red heart emoji), or 💕 (2 pink hearts emoji) will appear next to their name. The 💛 indicates you just became best friends. If you stay best friends for 2 weeks straight, it becomes a ❤️ emoji. [4] X Research source The 💕 appears after 2 months of friendship."

      "title": "Snapchat uses the 😬 to joke about awkwardness.",
      "content": "Snapchat uses the 😬 to joke about awkwardness. It’s sort of like if you were dating somebody and another person walked up to you and said, “What are you doing? That’s my partner!” It’s awkward! It’s Snapchat’s fun little way of encouraging you to continue snapping your best friend to keep them all to yourself. [5] X Research source Don’t take this the wrong way. Even if someone is snapping your best friend super often, it doesn’t mean they’re sharing anything serious. It’s even possible your best friend isn’t replying."

      "content": "You send snaps to Friend #1 more than anyone else in your friends list. Let’s say you’ve got a best bud (Friend #1). You snap them often enough that a little 💛 appears next to his name. Congrats! You’re now best friends."

      "content": "Friend #2 also sends snaps to Friend #1 more than anyone they know. Let’s also say you and Friend #1 know a mutual contact (we’ll call them Friend #2). The same way you snap Friend #1 regularly all the time, Friend #2 also snaps Friend #1 every day. In fact, Friend #2 interacts with Friend #1 often enough that Friend #2 also gets a little 💛 of their own next to Friend #1’s name. These two are now best friends."

      "content": "The 😬 emoji shows up next to Friend #2’s name in your app. Once you and Friend #2 both have 💛s next to Friend #1’s name in your respective friend lists, you’ll get the 😬 emoji next to one another’s names. Regardless of whether you’ve ever even snapped one another before, that 😬 will stick around so long as both of you keep Friend #1 as your best friends. If either of you were to drop Friend #1 as your best friend (either intentionally or unintentionally), that 😬 emoji will disappear."
