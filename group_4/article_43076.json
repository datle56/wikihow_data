    {
      "title": "Tell him that he’s miles above anyone else you’ve ever dated.",
      "content": "Tell him that he’s miles above anyone else you’ve ever dated. This exaggerated statement will let him know that you aren’t thinking about anyone else except for him. Plus, you’ll call him hot, which will probably make him feel really good. You might also say: [3] X Research source “You’re the most handsome man I’ve ever dated.” “I just can’t believe how handsome you are.”"

    {
      "title": "Tell him you miss him and just how handsome he is.",
      "content": "Tell him you miss him and just how handsome he is. With this message, he’ll understand how much you care for him and how attractive you think he is.

You could also try: [4] X Research source “It’s been too long since I’ve seen your pretty face.” “I can’t believe it’s been a month since I’ve seen your handsome face in person.”"

    {
      "title": "Follow up after a fun date or a hang out with him.",
      "content": "Follow up after a fun date or a hang out with him. If you couldn’t quite work up the courage to let him know how hot he is in person, you can send it via text later on.

You could also say: [5] X Research source “I was too shy to say this in person, but you’re very handsome.” “Your outfit was so nice today. You looked very handsome.”"

    {
      "title": "Let him know you want to see his handsome face.",
      "content": "Let him know you want to see his handsome face. If you two are long-distance or you can’t see each other for a while, this is a nice way to connect face to face. When he sends you the selfie, compliment him on his looks or how handsome he is. You might also say: [8] X Research source “I want to see that handsome face. Send me a selfie?” “I miss you. Send me a pic of your outfit today.”"

    {
      "title": "Send him a picture of you two that you really like.",
      "content": "Send him a picture of you two that you really like. When you say that you’re a good-looking couple, you’re complimenting both of you at the same time.

    {
      "title": "Maybe your brain wanted to remind you how handsome he is.",

      "content": "If he’s trying out a beard, let him know that you like it. Some guys get a little self-conscious when they try out new facial hair, so give him a boost of confidence with this compliment. He’ll be happy that you noticed, and it might even convince him not to shave for a few more days. You could also try: [11] X Research source “I like the beard, you should keep it! Makes you look rugged and handsome.” “Trying out a beard, huh? I like it!”"

      "title": "If he mixed it up, let him know you like it.",
      "content": "If he mixed it up, let him know you like it. Maybe he got a haircut or got some highlights done.

You might also text him: [12] X Research source “Did you do something different with your hair today? It looked so good.” “Forgot to tell you earlier, but your hair looked great today.” “I love your haircut! You look so handsome.”"

    },
    {
      "title": "If you liked his outfit, tell him about it.",
      "content": "If you liked his outfit, tell him about it. Maybe you were too shy to bring it up in person, or maybe you didn’t really think about it until you got home. If you saw him earlier and he looked really good, tell him about it over text. You could also say: [14] X Research source “Your whole outfit was really nice today. You looked very handsome.” “I loved the shirt you were wearing earlier. You can pull off anything.”"
