After the glitter glue has dried, use a permanent marker to write the days of the week on each pin. Then use the pins to organize your homework, to-do lists, and reminders. To make the pins magnetic, use a strong glue to attach a magnet to one side of the clothespin and apply glitter glue to the opposite side."

Mix in small figurines, letters, beads, or other small items to create a sensory experience for little hands. [16] X Research source Add glitter gradually, about a teaspoon or less at a time, to avoid overwhelming the slime. Use clear slime for the best visual effect, as it enhances the sparkle of the glitter. If you do add small items to the slime, be careful that no one puts the slime in their mouth and chokes on the small pieces. You can buy liquid starch from the grocery store—it’s in the laundry aisle. Store the glitter slime in an airtight container once you’re done playing with it."
