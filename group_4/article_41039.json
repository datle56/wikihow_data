If you find that you’re always going out of your way to help a person out or bring them stuff without them doing the same, ask yourself if it’s worth it. In a healthy relationship, there’s an equal amount of give and take. It’s totally fine to do nice things for someone every once in a while, but if it’s not reciprocated, it might be time to cut back. [1] X Research source Grabbing them a coffee on your way to work? That’s probably okay, especially if they asked you to. Heading over to their place and shoveling their driveway during a snowstorm, unasked? That’s too much, and it could even make them feel a little uncomfortable. Keep in mind that they don’t “owe” you a favor back, but a healthy relationship is a two-way street!"

If you find that you’ve been simping a little too hard, you might set boundaries around how often you buy them gifts or how much you compliment them online. Setting your boundaries and sticking to them will stop you from getting taken advantage of in your next relationship. [3] X Research source You could also try setting boundaries like: Splitting the bill with them when you go out on dates Not dropping everything to hang out with a person Not double texting a person if she doesn’t respond"

If you constantly rearrange your schedule anytime someone wants to hang out, they'll know that you’re putting them on a pedestal. It’s fine to make plans together, but if you’re busy, let them know that you can’t hang out that day. For instance, if someone randomly hits you up to hang out that day but you’re already with friends, you might say, “Hey, I’m pretty busy this afternoon. What about tomorrow?” This will show them that while you’re still making time for them, you aren’t dropping everything just because they texted you."

Confident people don’t need approval from other people—they already know how much they’re worth, so they aren’t worried if someone doesn’t like them back. Building your self-esteem and raising your own confidence is a great way to find validation in yourself, not from other people. [5] X Research source A nice way to quickly boost your self-esteem is to write out a list of your strengths. Then, you can look back on it every time you’re feeling down for a nice confidence boost."

However, stay away from grand gestures, like ordering for them at dinner, or even offering to pick up a big tab you can’t actually afford (split the check!). These old-timey gestures only work in the movies—in real life, they can make people feel awkward. Pouring them a glass of wine at dinner: totally fine, and pretty helpful! Throwing your coat over a puddle so they can walk on it: way too far, and could make them feel weird."

If you’ve been obsessing over a person (or multiple persons) who won’t give you the time of day, it’s probably time to move on . Stop hanging out in person, and dedicate your time to other people who enjoy your company. The more you spend time on other activities, the less you’ll feel tempted to fall back into your old ways.

It might seem like everyone you know is coupled up right now, but having a partner isn’t the end-all be-all! You can keep up with your friends and have fun all on your own. It seems counterintuitive, but when you stop looking for love, you’re much more likely to find it. Focus on your hobbies and finding stuff that you like to do! You’ll become a much more well-rounded person, and you’ll probably be much happier. Ask yourself: If it weren’t for this person, what would get you out of bed in the morning?

[11] X Research source Good questions to ask include, “What did you want to be when you were a kid?” “Where do you see yourself in 5 years?” “What do you like to do on the weekends?” Open up about yourself, too!
