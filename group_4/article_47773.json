      "content": "Boudoir photos are sensual photos often used to boost your confidence. The term “boudoir” is French for a woman’s private dressing room. While typically geared toward women, anyone can take and enjoy boudoir photography regardless of gender. At a professional boudoir photoshoot, the client usually wears lingerie or other seductive outfits to create an intimate and romantic tone. The photos are intended for the private enjoyment of the model and their romantic partner. [1] X Research source While boudoir photography is romantic in nature, you don’t have to be in a relationship to have boudoir photos taken. Many clients use boudoir as a way to love and appreciate their bodies. Generally, the client gets their hair and makeup done on-site before taking photos so they'll look their absolute best in them."

      "content": "There are many different styles of boudoir photos. Boudoir photography combines glamour, fashion, and portrait-style photography to create unique photos for each client. Because everyone has different tastes and expectations, you can choose which style best suits you. [2] X Research source Here are some common boudoir photo styles: Pin-up boudoir: Pin-up boudoir takes inspiration from classic pin-up girls. This style incorporates vintage hairstyles, makeup, and clothing and often leaves more to the imagination than some other boudoir styles. Dramatic boudoir: Dramatic boudoir puts the focus directly on the client. The photos will often be shot in low light using a solid background and will feature lots of highlights and shadows. Luminous boudoir: Luminous boudoir is almost the opposite of dramatic boudoir. It’s very light and rarely uses shadows, creating a fun, playful tone. Luminous boudoir often features outdoor settings and is commonly used in bridal boudoir. Elegant boudoir: Elegant boudoir is one of the most versatile styles. It allows the client to feel sexy, beautiful, and sophisticated all at once. Elegant boudoir photos are typically taken in black and white to add to the classic feel. Playful boudoir: Playful boudoir is meant to be fun and empowering. It often incorporates the use of props and themed costumes. Playful boudoir shoots are commonly done for holidays, but you can do one year-round. Bridal boudoir: Bridal boudoir is typically done as a wedding or anniversary gift. The client typically wears white, lace, and a wedding veil."
