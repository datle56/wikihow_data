      "title": "Stop deadheading 8 to 10 weeks before the first frost.",
      "content": "Stop deadheading 8 to 10 weeks before the first frost. Deadheading is the process of removing all of the flowerheads from your rose bush. This is beneficial during the warm weather to promote new growth, but it can damage the plant as the cold weather sets in. [1] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. Stop deadheading your rose bush about 2 months before the cold sets in. [2] X Research source Leaving the flowerheads on the bush protects the ends of the branches from freezing."

      "title": "Avoid fertilizing and transplanting as the cold weather sets in.",
      "content": "Avoid fertilizing and transplanting as the cold weather sets in. Fertilizing and transplanting your rose bush can promote new growth. This new growth can get damaged in the cold weather and can harm your plant. Try to stop fertilizing and transplanting your rose bush in the late summer. [3] X Research source Rose bushes usually do not grow in the cold weather anyway. Plan on fertilizing, transplanting, and promoting new growth on your rose bush in the spring and summer."

      "title": "Wait until the first frost is over to prune.",
      "content": "Wait until the first frost is over to prune. Pruning your rose bushes can promote new growth. If you trim them before the first frost, it could create new buds that will be killed when the first frost comes along. This can damage the plant and make it produce less flowers in the spring. Wait until your area has had at least 1 frost before you trim your roses. [4] X Research source The first frost comes at a different time for every climate. For most temperate areas, it comes around late fall in November or December. If you live in a warmer or colder climate, it could come much sooner or much later."

      "content": "Wipe a pair of sharp pruners with alcohol to sterilize the blades. It is important to use the correct tools when you prune your rose bushes. Get sharp pruners and dip them in isopropyl alcohol to disinfect them before you use them. [5] X Research source If your rose bush is big or thick, you can use sharp loppers with long handles to reach into the middle of the bush. Loppers give you less control, so use caution as you make your cuts."

      "title": "Make each cut at a 45 degree angle above the buds.",
      "content": "Make each cut at a 45 degree angle above the buds. The buds on your rose bush create new growth. In the fall, they will probably look like small green dots on the branches of your bush. Make your cuts about 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) above the bud at a 45 degree angle to keep the bud for the spring and lessen the damage to the branch. [6] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. [7] X Research source Cutting at a 45 degree angle allows water to run off of the branch and not collect on top of the cut."

    {
      "title": "Cut off about ⅓ of each branch.",
      "content": "Cut off about ⅓ of each branch. Roses are super hearty bushes and they love to be cut down. In the fall, take off about ⅓ of each branch that you cut so your rose bush can grow healthy and tall in the spring. [8] X Research source You can cut your rose bush down even more if you’d like to change its shape or height. Make sure to leave at least 6 inches (15 cm) of branches above the ground so that your rose bush can grow back."

      "title": "Cut away any heavy top pieces so the bush doesn’t bend when it freezes.",
      "content": "Cut away any heavy top pieces so the bush doesn’t bend when it freezes. Fall is usually a rain-heavy time for most areas. If your rose bush is very top heavy, it could bend and break as the rain collects and freezes on it. If you notice large clumps of branches near the top of your bush, cut those down to size until they are relatively the same height as the rest of the bush.

      "content": "Separate any branches that could rub together. Fall is a wet and windy time, and branches that are too close to each other can create friction and damage your plant. If you notice 2 branches that are crossed over each other, trim at least 1 back so that they aren’t near each other anymore.

      "content": "Remove any dead or diseased branches. Branches that are small and skinny or leaves with yellow splotches may indicate a fungal infection in your roses. [11] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. Cut off the branches about 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) below the diseased area to stop the spread of infection. [12] X Research source An infection on your rose bush doesn’t mean an imminent death. If you cut off the affected branches in the fall, it is much less likely that the infection will spread come springtime."

      "content": "Tear off any suckers at the base of the bush. Suckers are small offshoots of your rose bush that take away energy and food from the main plant. Dig down as far as you can toward the base of the sucker and tear it out of the ground with your hands. [14] X Research source You can also use your pruners to cut the suckers back if they are too thick to tear."

[15] X Research source Clark Hill. Plant Specialist &amp; VP of Operations, Platt Hill Nursery. Look for leaves with black, yellow, or white spots and carefully snip them off at the base. [16] X Research source Removing the infected leaves before your bush goes into dormancy for the winter increases its chances for survival. If your rose bush has a fungal infection that won’t go away, remove all of the leaves completely and then spray the bush with lime sulfur. This will sanitize the bush and kill the fungus.

Pile a thin layer of either mulch or compost to insulate the roots and keep your rose bush healthy. [20] X Research source You can purchase mulch or compost at your local garden supply store, or you can make your own compost at home."
