      "content": "Turn off the A/C and turn on the heat if you think your vehicle might be overheating. While it might seem counterintuitive, cranking up the heater can actually draw heat away from the engine bay, which might help cool your vehicle down. [1] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. On the other hand, using air conditioning can worsen the problem. Switch off the A/C, turn on the heat to full blast, and roll down your windows. [2] X Research source This isn’t likely to fix the problem but can be a temporary solution if you only have to drive a short distance."

      "content": "Pull over if the temperature gauge creeps into the hot zone. If you notice your engine temperature climbing into the hot, or orange/red, zone, don’t continue driving the vehicle. As soon as it is safe to do so, pull over on the side of the road. [3] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. Turn your hazard lights on so other motorists know that you are having mechanical issues. [4] X Research source Some vehicles may have a warning light that comes on when the engine begins to overheat. This is especially important if you notice steam pouring out from under the hood! Continuing to drive under these conditions could create additional mechanical problems."

      "title": "Shut off your vehicle and pop the hood.",
      "content": "Shut off your vehicle and pop the hood . Start by turning off your vehicle. Then, carefully open the hood to allow excess heat to disperse faster and steam to escape. Press the hood latch on the interior of your vehicle, go around to the front of the vehicle, release the safety lever, and open the hood. Take care not to burn your fingers! [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Let your vehicle cool down for at least 30-60 minutes.",
      "content": "Let your vehicle cool down for at least 30-60 minutes. If your engine is overheated, everything under the hood will be extremely hot. Do not attempt to diagnose or fix the problem until your car has cooled down. Wait for the temperature gauge to return to a normal reading before moving forward. This can take up to an hour, so make sure you’re parked in a safe spot. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for steam, leaks, or other issues.",
      "content": "Look for steam, leaks, or other issues. Do a brief inspection to see if you can figure out what the problem is. Steam or smoke pouring out or leaking coolant (also called antifreeze) from the radiator, hoses, or engine are signs of a serious problem. [7] X Research source Your coolant may be orange/red or green, depending on the type. If you hear bubbling coming from under the hood, it means your cooling system is over pressurized and your engine is overheating."

      "title": "Check the coolant reservoir tank",
      "content": "Check the coolant reservoir tank and fill it if needed. Your vehicle has a plastic reservoir of coolant connected to the top of the radiator. Locate the reservoir and twist the cap counterclockwise to remove it. This will allow you to see if your coolant is low. Look for marks indicating the proper level of coolant, and check to see if the coolant is at or below that level. Only add coolant once your vehicle has cooled down. [8] X Expert Source Duston Maynes Automotive Repair Specialist Expert Interview. 10 June 2021. If the reservoir is low, add coolant to your reservoir to the fill line. [9] X Expert Source Ed Beery Automotive Specialist Expert Interview. 19 November 2021. Replace the reservoir cap when you're done. You can use distilled water rather than coolant in a pinch. However, avoid using cold water as it could create additional problems, including cracking your engine block. Use warm water only. If you have a European car or any vehicle with a closed cooling system, follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly when adding coolant to prevent overfilling and to prevent air bubbles from entering the system.

If there aren’t any leaks, you can pressure test the heater core to see if it is working properly. If it’s not, flushing it may solve the problem. However, you may need to replace the heater core if that doesn’t work. [17] X Research source A non-operational heater is another sign of a bad heater core. Additionally, check for coolant on the floor of the passenger side of the vehicle to see if the heater core might be the culprit."

Check for leaks in and around the water pump. If you see any, try replacing the gasket first. If that doesn’t work, replace the water pump. [18] X Research source You may hear a rumbling noise while your vehicle is running if the pump is dry. Try adding coolant to the max fill line to see if that resolves the issue. Dirty coolant and corrosion can cause a water pump to fail, in which case you'd need to replace the pump."
