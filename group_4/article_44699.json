      "content": "Do not feed your cat for 24 hours. Whether your cat is vomiting, has diarrhea, or is experiencing both, try to withhold food for 24 hours. However, you should provide your cat with clean drinking water as described above. Food in the stomach stimulates muscular contractions, which either then causes the stomach to contract and the cat to vomit, [1] X Research source or the bowel to spasm and push out diarrhea. Allowing the gut to \"rest\" for 24 hours, gives uncomplicated cases of sickness and diarrhea a chance to settle down. If the cat is still vomiting after 24 hours, then you should bring her to a vet.

      "content": "Feed your cat bland food after the 24 hour period is up and she seems to be doing better. If your cat has stopped vomiting, but continues to have a small amount of diarrhea, you can begin to feed her small amounts of bland food. A bland diet is one consisting of white meats such as chicken, turkey, rabbit, cod, or coley. Give your cat meat, rather than a meat-flavored food. [3] X Research source An average cat needs 250 kcal a day; this is equivalent to feeding your cat roughly 250 g of chicken breast a day. [4] X Research source Clinical Medicine in the Dog and Cat.

      "content": "Transition your cat back to regular food. After your cat passes normal stool for 24 hours, start a gradual transition back to regular food over the course of two to three days. [5] X Research source This transition period allows bacteria in your cat’s gut to readjust to normal food. A typical transition may look like: Day 1: Feed ¾ bland diet and ¼ regular food. Day 2: Feed ½ bland diet and ½ regular food. Day 3: Feed ¼ bland diet and ¾ regular food. Day 4: Entirely back onto regular food."

[6] X Research source You can check to see if your cat is dehydrated by lifting the scruff off of her shoulders with your finger and thumb. If: The skin flops back into position immediately, your cat is hydrated. The skin remains peaked and slowly slides back down out of its tent-like position, your cat is dehydrated."

      "content": "Encourage your cat to drink if she can keep some fluids down. Provide clean fresh drinking water within reach of your cat’s bed. When they are ill, some cats prefer the taste of mineral water to tap water (because it has less chlorine in it and cats dislike the taste of chlorine), and will sip on mineral water even if they refuse tap water, so consider trying to give your cat different kinds of water.

[8] X Research source These solutions are mixed with water (normally 500 ml, but read the package) and are used to replenish lots electrolytes. Some cats don’t like the salty taste of these solutions. If this is the case with your cat, switch her back to water."

Place the nozzle of the syringe behind your cat’s canine teeth. Press the plunger down slowly in order to give your cat time to swallow. An average sized cat, weighing between three to five kg, requires 180 to 300 ml of water a day to meet maintenance needs. Try giving your cat 5 to 10 ml of water every half an hour.

      "content": "Seek medical care if your cat vomits every time she drinks water. For a cat with gastroenteritis, dehydration is a sign that fluid loss exceeds fluid gain and it is essential to redress this balance. If your cat vomits each time she drinks, or is unable to hold fluid down, then do not delay and seek urgent veterinary attention. A veterinarian will make a judgment call as to whether intravenous fluids need to be given to your cat based on your cat's demeanor (how alert or lethargic she is), how long she has been vomiting and expelling diarrhea, and the degree of dehydration. Intravenous fluids are given via a catheter which is placed in the vein in your cat's front leg. It can take between 24 and 48 hours to rehydrate your cat. [10] X Research source"

It helps to soothe gastric ulcers and reduce inflammation when the stomach lining is inflamed. The drug should be used with caution in cats with heart disease because it can slow the heart rate, but this is usually only a problem when given intravenously. [11] X Research source The dose is 0.5 mg/kg once a day, by mouth. A 5 kg cat thus requires 2.5 mg a day. [12] X Research source Clinical Medicine in the Dog and Cat. Michael Schaer.

A probiotic designed for cats can speed up recovery from diarrhea. Wait to start the probiotic until your cat has stopped vomiting, then mix the probiotic with the bland food once a day. This helps to repopulate the gut with the correct bacteria that aids in digestion. Repopulating the gut helps feces to firm up more quickly. An appropriate cat probiotic is Fortiflora, which comes in a sachet. It can be mixed in food and given to your cat once a day for five days."

      "content": "Talk to your vet about atropine. Another prescription medication is atropine. Atropine is an antispasmodic which causes the bowel to relax, and then as the effects of the atropine wear off, the bowel reverts back to a normal action. The benefit of giving atropine to cats with diarrhea is controversial. Some veterinarians argue that the toxins are better \"out than in\" and that antispasmodics such as atropine, cause the toxins to be retained in the bowel. The counter argument is that sometimes the bowel becomes sensitive because of diarrhea that it is constantly in spasm."
