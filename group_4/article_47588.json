      "content": "Attach sticky silicone cups if your dress shows a lot of skin. If your dress has a lot of unique cutouts that are revealing, a convertible or strapless bra may not be an option. You've probably seen silicone cups—simply press these to your breasts using their adhesive backing. If your cups have clear tabs, pull them up and stick them near the top of your breasts for more support. Wash your skin so it's completely free of sweat or lotion since these can prevent the silicone from sticking. Check the manufacturer's instructions since some recommend that you buy a size up or size down from your regular bra cup size."

      "content": "Stick on coverings if your dress is made of lightweight fabric. You might feel like traditional or sticky bras are visible if your dress feels thin, but you still want a little coverage. Peel the back off of nipple coverings and firmly press one onto each nipple. This way your nipples won't be visible through the thin fabric and you won't have to worry about wearing a traditional bra! [1] X Research source This option works really well if your breasts are small and you don't need a lot of support from a standard bra. You can buy matte nipple colorings in a variety of skin tones."

      "title": "Wear a low-back bra if you want support from standard straps.",
      "content": "Wear a low-back bra if you want support from standard straps. If your dress has some coverage on the shoulders, you can wear a bra with straps. Put on your dress and make a mark on your back where the dress falls. Then, shop for a low-back bra that fastens below this mark. Many low-back bras have a strap that you wrap around your entire waist for extra support. [2] X Research source Some low-back bras give you the option to unhook a few clasps so you can tuck in the fabric along the back. This is great if your dress narrows to a V-shape on the back."

      "title": "Convertible bras are a versatile option for your wardrobe.",
      "content": "Convertible bras are a versatile option for your wardrobe. If you don't want to invest in a special bra just for one dress, choose a convertible bra so you can adjust the straps to wear it with other dresses. For example, remove a strap and pull the other strap diagonally across your back if your dress has a peekaboo cutout along the side of your lower back. [3] X Research source Got a halter-style backless dress? Remove a strap from your convertible bra and pull the remaining strap behind your neck to the opposite side. You can also find convertible bras that have clear straps, making them even more useful for challenging dresses. Convertible bras are also great for women with large breasts since the straps will give more support than a strapless bra."

      "title": "Wear a self-adhesive plunge bra if your backless dress has a low neckline.",
      "content": "Wear a self-adhesive plunge bra if your backless dress has a low neckline. Plunge bras might look a little odd—you'll see what looks like a traditional bra with a deeply curved U-shape between the cups. To secure the bra to your skin, hold the cups to your breasts and pull back clear the adhesive tabs toward your ribcage. Press the tabs to keep your plunge bra in place. [4] X Research source Look for a plunge bra in your skin tone so it's not visible under light fabrics."

      "title": "Reach for a strapless if your backless dress doesn't plunge very low.",
      "content": "Reach for a strapless if your backless dress doesn't plunge very low. A strapless bra is great since a lot of backless dresses have unique straps or necklines that can make hiding bra straps difficult. If the back of your dress only falls about halfway down, you can probably pull off a standard strapless bra. If not, wear a strapless bra that has clear wings on the side instead of a complete band. [5] X Research source To wear a strapless bra that has clear wings, just position the cups over your breasts and pull the sticky wings to the sides of your rib cage. They'll keep the bra in place and invisible. Strapless bras can vary in size so you might try going down 1 size for the best fit. For example, if you're usually a 38D, try a 36D or a 38C."

      "content": "This is a great option if you want a lot of support and lift. Strapless bodices are sometimes called longline bras—these feature traditional cups with a lot of support along your ribcage. You can find these bodices with low backs so they work with some backless dresses. To wear, just wrap the bodice around your torso and get some help fastening the clasps along your lower back. [6] X Research source A strapless bodice is great if you have large breasts and want support as well as shaping."

      "content": "Customize a bra you already own so you can attach it to the dress. Take a great-fitting bra from your closet and cut off the sidebands so you have 2 cups that have fabric connecting them. Then, lay the bra facing up and squeeze fabric glue along the edges. Press the bra onto the inside of your backless dress where your chest is. Let the glue dry completely before you put the dress on. [7] X Research source It's totally fine to sew the cups in, but you'll be able to see the stitching on the front of the dress."

      "content": "Play around with boob tape if you want to customize your support. If you're feeling frustrated with bra options or don't want to buy a whole new bra, get boob tape. You can buy this adhesive tape in lingerie departments or online. Want to create cleavage? Press your breasts together and tape the undersides of your breasts in place. If you want some lift, stick 1 end of the tape on your breast and pull the tape up so you can stick it closer to your armpit. [8] X Research source Keep in mind that pulling off the boob tape may feel uncomfortable and it might leave your skin a little sticky."
