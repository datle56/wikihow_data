[2] X Research source Let your dog’s original family shoulder some of the teaching load before your family takes over the job. For dogs, as with other animals including humans, an important function of play is instruction. Puppies use yelps of pain and refusal to keep playing to instruct each other about the differences between playful mouthing and painful biting. Mothers likewise play an important instructive role in the formative weeks of a puppy’s life, one that is hard to replicate or replace."

Expose your young dog to other animals and people in a wide range of environments so that normal social situations are less likely to cause fear."

      "content": "Teach impulse control. It might not seem as direct as trying to teach your puppy “don’t bite,” but teaching common commands like “sit,” “stay,” “come,” and “leave it” are often quite effective in bite prevention. You may think you are just teaching your puppy to obey, but you are also teaching him patience. Dogs with poor impulse control are more likely to bite when their wants are not immediately met. Teaching your dog to “leave it” -- to avoid taking a treat in front of his nose until told “take it,” for instance -- can be particularly helpful in preventing biting.

[4] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Dogs don’t innately know how sensitive human skin is to sharp canine teeth. Let your dog know this in the same way as a litter of puppies. The earlier you start this process, the better. Play with your puppy and allow her to mouth your hand. As soon as you feel a tooth point touch your skin, however, give out a demonstrative “yelp” and let your hand go limp, indicating that this action hurt you and you will no longer play if it continues. As soon as the dog stops mouthing or licks your limp hand, praise her and start the process again. If you sense your puppy is about to bite you again, quickly say \"no\" or \"no bite.\" If he doesn't bite you, reward him with praise and a treat. This is a great way to use positive reinforcement to teach your puppy that biting is bad. [5] X Expert Source Jaimie Scott Dog Owner Trainer Expert Interview. 16 June 2020. If making your hand uninteresting for play is proving insufficient, employ time-outs. Leave the room for 10-20 seconds after yelping to make it clear that biting is not a part of play time. Extend the time-out and reduce your threshold for what constitutes a bite as your dog learns."

[6] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source As your dog learns to be more gentle with play biting, raise the standard further so that any mouthing of your skin is met with disapproval. Utilize the same techniques as in the previous step, but also: Substitute a chew toy or bone when your dog begins to mouth your skin. Have the toy at the ready and quickly present it to the dog. He will learn that these are acceptable targets for his mouthing instincts. Distract the dog with a treat in one hand while petting him with the other. This is particularly useful for dogs who tend to mouth or bite when petted. The lack of focus on the petting hand will become normal over time, even if there is not a treat to distract them. Enjoy non-contact play, such as fetch. Show your dog that there are many ways to play that do not involve her mouth on your skin."

Beating your dog is never the best way to handle any situation, and in the case of biting only tends to instill fear, aggression, and an invitation for rougher play, all of which promote more biting. Use the following negative association methods in combination with the “yelp and stop” methods. Spray your dog in the mouth with a peppermint breath spray (like Binaca) when she bites. She will like neither the taste nor the sensation of the spray.

Pain, sometimes pain of which you may not be aware, can be one cause of unexpected biting behavior. If there are behaviors, such as rough play or head-patting that can trigger a biting response from your dog, inform your family and guests to avoid doing so. Teach those around you to be aware of signs of an impending bite, by your dog or any others. These include ears pinned back, fur standing up, body stiffening, widened eyes with a direct gaze, and showing of teeth that can look like a yawn. [11] X Research source Teach those around you how, in the worst case scenario, to respond to a threatening dog: remain calm, be assertive but avoid eye contact, and if attacked, ball up and protect your face, throat, chest, and fingers (by making fists).
