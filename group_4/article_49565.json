      "content": "Tap on Book . The description says \"Write a book.\" While this doesn't specifically say memoir, writing a book counts as writing a memoir for challenges that require it, such as the Pushing Roses challenge. When you select Book , you may find that no publishing companies want to publish your book right now. If this happens, try aging up a year and try again. You can also try to increase your fame stat as well, as having low fame will make publishers less likely to want to publish your memoir. There is no age requirement to get your memoir published. The only requirement is that your character is famous."
