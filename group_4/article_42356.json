      "content": "Lead your horse to the grooming area of your barn. You should have an area or separate stall outside of your horse’s regular stall where you groom her, if you do not have a specific area, then simply just tie her up with a lead rope outside her stall. Whether you have a specific area or not, it is essential that you tie it up, so it cannot get away while you groom. Wear some clothes that you do not mind getting dirty because grooming your horse can be a very messy job."

      "content": "Use a rubber curry brush to loosen up the dirt on your horse’s coat. Move the brush in a circular motion over your horse’s body. To avoid injuring your horse’s more delicate skin, do not use the rubber curry brush on your horse’s face or legs."

      "title": "Use a dandy brush to remove dirt from the surface of your horse’s coat.",
      "content": "Use a dandy brush to remove dirt from the surface of your horse’s coat. With the direction of the hair, move the brush in rapid, short strokes, ending each one in a flicking motion to get the dirt off of your horse’s coat. You should see a cloud of dust come off from your horse’s coat each time you flick the brush. Make sure to use the flicking motion or the dirt will just stay on your horse’s body and may cause irritation. The Dandy Brush is very similar to the Body Brush but it is much rougher."

      "content": "Use electric clippers to trim your horse’s body hair. If there are any areas of your horse’s coat that look like they need to be trimmed, use a pair of electric clippers to neaten them up. Don’t use the electric clippers on or around your horse’ face or you may startle her and even injure her. You don't need to clip your horse's coat every time you groom it. Wait until it has grown back. Make sure you clean the clippers after use. Never clip inside your horse's ears; the fur there protects them from dust and flies. You can clip the outsides of the ears. Doing this step is optional, however, it looks better for showing. Blanket your horse in the paddock when it is cold if you choose to clip its hair."

      "content": "Clean your horse’s hooves. Stand next to your horse facing the horse's rump, and use one hand to bend and support your horse’s hoof. Use the hoof pick to remove any rocks, turf, or other objects that have lodged in your horse’s hoof. Scrape away from you so that you do not cause the objects in the hoof to fly towards your body or face. You should also have your horse's hooves trimmed every 3-8 weeks to keep them in good condition. Shoeing horses is not always necessary. In fact, some experts believe that shoeing can cause problems with the hooves rather than protect them.

Your horse’s nutritional needs will vary according to the amount of fresh grass she has consumed while out to pasture and the level of activity she has had. Evaluate your horse’s needs daily to determine whether to subtract or add from her regular feeding amounts. If your horse has been out to pasture all day and has been eating lots of grass, she will not require as much hay. If your horse has had a hard work day with lots of riding, then you will need to provide more food to help replenish the extra calories she burned."

      "content": "Make gradual changes to your horse’s diet. If you need to change your horse’s feed, do not just switch to the new feed. Start by replacing 25% of the old feed with the new feed. In two days, replace 50% of the old feed with the new feed. Two days after that, replace 75% of the old feed with the new feed. Then two days after that you will be able to give your horse 100% new feed. In addition to making food changes gradually, you should also feed your horse at about the same time every day. Horses perform better when they have a regular feeding schedule. Making drastic changes to your horse’s feed or feeding schedule can lead to equine colic and founder. Equine colic is a condition that causes severe abdominal pain and may even require surgery.
