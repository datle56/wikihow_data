    {
      "title": "Tie a starting knot.",
      "content": "Tie a starting knot. To start, cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap this left lace around the right lace and pull tight to complete a basic starting knot."
    },
    {
      "title": "Form two \"bunny ears\" with the laces.",
      "content": "Form two \"bunny ears\" with the laces. Bend the left lace in half, forming a loop, and pinch the bottom of the loop together with your fingers. Repeat the same thing with the right lace and hold that loop secure with your other hand. Hold the two loops side by side for the moment. Quickly gauge the approximate size of each loop. They do not need to be perfectly even, but the two loops or “bunny ears” should be roughly equal in size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold and thread the left loop.",
      "content": "Fold and thread the left loop. Fold the left loop over and around the right loop, and then gently pull it through the hole that forms between the two loops. Do not tighten yet."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fold the right loop over the back.",
      "content": "Fold the right loop over the back. Bend the right loop forward so that it crosses under the left loop and the entire knot structure. Feed this loop through the same middle hole that you just fed the left loop through. This can be done simultaneously with or immediately after taking care of the left loop. Note, however, that the left loop will need to be folded over before you begin working with this right loop. Otherwise, the middle hole you need to push the right loop through will not be created yet. After pulling the right loop through the center hole, the two lace loops should be about the same size again."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tighten.",
      "content": "Tighten. Pull the right loop to the right and the left loop to the left to tighten the knot. Use even pressure on both laces to form an even, tidy bow. As long as you apply enough pressure and tighten the knots thoroughly, they should not come undone, even with slippery leather laces. You might have to push the knot together a little as you tighten it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Form a loop with the right lace.",
      "content": "Form a loop with the right lace. Bend the lace into a loop near the base of the shoe and pinch the bottom closed with your fingers. Your loop should use up about one half to one third of the lace, and the rest of the lace should dangle to the side. Note that this method does not begin with the usual starting knot. In fact, in this method, the two laces are not tied together and the ends are not secured. Essentially, this is a decorative technique used to take care of the laces in a manner that keeps them from getting in the way as you walk. The coils formed by this knot method will stay firmly in place if secured well, but they will not secure the shoe to your foot like other knots will. Make sure that your moccasins are tight enough to be worn as slip-on shoes when using this lace tying method."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the end of the lace around the loop.",
      "content": "Wrap the end of the lace around the loop. Starting with the portion of the hanging end that is closest to the base of the loop, create a tight coil around the entire loop. You can wrap your coil in whichever direction you please. Make this coil as tight as possible without disrupting your grip."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the rest of the lace around the loop.",
      "content": "Wrap the rest of the lace around the loop. Coil the remaining loose end of the lace around the loop by wrapping it in the same direction several times. Each coil should be directly on top of the last one. Continue wrapping the lace end around the loop in this manner until you reach the top of the loop and have only a short tail left. Make sure that each coil or wrap is immediately above the one before it. Otherwise, the overall coil you end up with may not be secure enough to hold together. Wrap the laces around as tightly as possible without losing your grip. You should be left with a very tight coil of leather lace when done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feed the end of the lace through the top of the loop.",
      "content": "Feed the end of the lace through the top of the loop. Take the remaining shoelace end and feed it through the small remaining gap at the top of the loop. Then tug upward on the on the coil to pinch the top of the loop closed. The tighter you tug on the coil, the more secure your coil will be. If you tug the lace tightly enough, it should not unwind very easily."
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat with the left lace.",
      "content": "Repeat with the left lace. Use the same technique on the left lace to create another, separate coil. Try to make your left loop the same size as your right loop for a symmetrical look."
    },
    {
      "title": "Tie a starting knot.",
      "content": "Tie a starting knot. Cross the left lace over the right lace. Wrap this left lace around the right lace and pull tight to complete a basic starting knot. Pull the two laces together firmly to secure this knot in place. Note that this is the same “starting knot” used in the double slip knot method. This starting knot forms the basis for many different lace tying techniques."
    },
    {
      "title": "Form a loop with the right lace.",
      "content": "Form a loop with the right lace. Pull about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of the right lace up and fold over into a loop. Do not cross the ends over each other. Instead, simply pinch the loop closed toward the bottom with your fingers. Note that if you are left-handed, you might find it easier to start with the left loop instead of the right."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wrap the left lace around.",
      "content": "Wrap the left lace around. Pass the left lace over the right, wrapping it snugly around the back of the right loop. Use your index finger to push the left lace through the center hole created in between the two laces. As you push the lace through, you should notice a second loop forming from the left lace. You should continue to hold the right lace loop in place as you work with the left lace."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pull both loops together to tighten.",
      "content": "Pull both loops together to tighten. Grab both loops with your fingers and pull them outward to tighten the knot securely. The left lace loop will be pulled to the right and the right lace loop will be pulled to the left. This knot is the standard knot used to tie most shoelaces. You can use it to tie your moccasins, and if you practice enough to create an even, smooth looking loop, the appearance can be quite flattering. Since it is not as secure as the double slip knot or boat shoe knot, however, you might find yourself re-tying your moccasins more often if you stick with this method."
