      "title": "Speak to yourself positively.",
      "content": "Speak to yourself positively. Repeat a helpful mantra such as “I can control my actions” to yourself.

Changing your thinking (known as “cognitive restructuring”) from focusing on unreasonably negative or angry thoughts to more realistic, positive thinking may help you resist violent actions. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, instead of thinking “I hate this person and I want to beat him up,” you can think, “I do not care to spend time with this person, but I am above violent behavior.”"

      "content": "Remind yourself that it’s not worth it. Even if you think you may feel some genuine satisfaction from punching someone you hate, it is unlikely to make you feel better the way you think it will. Additionally, you could end up getting arrested or sued for assault, which could be expensive and time-consuming. You might say to yourself, “This guy, even though he is irritating me, is not worth my time. I cannot afford to lose time at work to be in jail or at a trial, and I am not willing to give this guy power over my walk. I am going to walk away instead of engaging with him."

      "content": "Leave the area. Get away from the person that you want to beat up. If you feel very angry, it’s better to just walk off (even without telling anyone why) and give yourself time to cool down than to get into a physical altercation. If you are with a friend, decide whether it would be better for you to be alone or to talk through your anger with your friend. If possible, try taking a walk in nature, since that can help you calm down."

      "content": "Work on developing impulse control. Most people do not plan to engage in physical violence; it happens in the moment as a response to strong emotions or as a result of escalating conflict. You can prevent yourself from responding to a trigger with violence if you strengthen your impulse control. Some strategies for developing or strengthening your impulse control include: [5] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Practice delayed gratification. Practicing delayed gratification in other areas can actually help you develop impulse control generally. For example, if you always sit down and watch your favorite show as soon as you get home from work, try pushing the habit back an hour and getting a bit of housecleaning done first. Accepting this delay will develop your willpower. Develop “if-then” scenarios ahead of time. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, you might decide ahead of time, “if this person insults me or my friends, I will walk away.” Strengthen your body. Some studies have linked strengthening your muscles and body through regular exercise to increased impulse control and willpower. [7] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Realizing what your triggers are can help you work through them and become more accepting. As a preventive measure, experiment with grounding techniques. Center yourself and identify what makes you angry so you can work our way through it."

You may not be able to change the way that you think or feel about another person, but you can always choose how to act towards him. Each time you speak or act, you are making a choice about what words and actions you use. For example, you can think to yourself, “I do not like this person. The way he is talking to me and my friends makes me want to beat him up. It is normal to feel angry and to dislike people, but I will not let him get the best of me by drawing me into a physical altercation."
