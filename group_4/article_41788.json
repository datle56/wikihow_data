      "content": "Mist the front and back of the jacket with water. Hold or dangle your leather jacket in an open area so that the water evenly covers the material. Focus on spritzing the outside of the jacket, since this is the area that will be stretched. While you want the material to be damp, make sure that it’s not dripping wet after you spray it. [1] X Research source To make the misting process easier, hang the jacket on a shower rack while you spritz over it. If you don’t have a spray bottle on hand, you can purchase one from any store that sells home goods."

      "title": "Put the jacket on while it’s still wet.",
      "content": "Put the jacket on while it’s still wet. Slide the jacket over your arms and wear it as you usually would. Tug on the damp jacket until it fits as snugly as possible, even if it feels tight in some areas. To make sure that the jacket is secure, wrap your arms around your shoulders like you’re giving yourself a hug. [2] X Research source Although this feels a little uncomfortable, leather stretches more while it’s wet. You can also grab the jacket firmly with both hands and pull it to stretch it out.

      "title": "Move your arms and shoulders to expand the leather.",
      "content": "Move your arms and shoulders to expand the leather. Stretch your arms and back in ways that force the leather to move and bend to the shape of your body. If you plan on wearing your leather jacket every day, try going through your daily routine in the jacket. [4] X Research source For example, if you bike a lot, go for a ride while the jacket is still wet. This helps the material to adjust to the natural stretch of your shoulders and arms."

      "title": "Set your washer to a light spin speed with cold water.",
      "content": "Set your washer to a light spin speed with cold water. Calibrate your machine to run a smaller load of wash with the gentlest settings possible, since you’ll only be washing one item. If your washer doesn’t have that many options, choose the cycle you would use for delicates. If possible, have your water temperature set to “cold” instead of “cool.” [5] X Research source Since you’re aiming to stretch the material, you don’t want to wash the jacket with hot water."

    {
      "title": "Pour in a capful of fabric softener and begin the cycle.",
      "content": "Pour in a capful of fabric softener and begin the cycle. Fill the lid of your fabric softener container with product and pour it into the proper area of your detergent tray. Don’t add any detergent to the load, since the only purpose of the cycle is to make the leather more pliable. Once you’ve placed your jacket into the machine, feel free to start the cycle. [6] X Research source Don’t use any extra rinse settings. Ideally, you don’t want the jacket to be dripping when you take it out of the washer. Baby shampoo and mild soap can work as substitutes if you don’t have any fabric softener on hand. Fabric softener isn’t harsh on leather, but laundry detergent is."

      "title": "Tug on the tighter parts of the leather to stretch it out.",
      "content": "Tug on the tighter parts of the leather to stretch it out. Hold the damp jacket in both hands and start pulling the leather around especially snug areas, like the armpits. Focus on physically stretching the parts that were tightest when you originally wore the jacket. [7] X Research source For example, if your jacket was tight around the elbows, pull around the circular seam that’s along the sleeve. Only use your hands to stretch the leather—don’t use any kind of equipment unless directed by a clothing or leather expert. Use more caution during the stretching process if your jacket isn’t made of cow leather. Sheep-skin leather and faux leather are much less durable materials, and they can rip if you pull on them too much."

      "title": "Let the jacket air-dry overnight.",
      "content": "Let the jacket air-dry overnight. Hang up your jacket in a cool, dry place where it can get a lot of open air. Once you’ve stretched the jacket, let the material dry in its new, expanded shape. Try on the jacket once it has dried, and see how it fits. [8] X Research source Do not dry your jacket in a clothes dryer, as this will shrink the leather. [9] X Research source If the jacket doesn’t feel stretched, try washing it with fabric softener again."
