      "content": "Understand what tapeworms are. As the name suggests, tapeworms are long flat worms. They can reach up to 30cm in length and are a creamy-white color with flat segments along their length. [1] X Research source The tapeworms attach firmly to the lining of the bowel wall, so it is unusual to see an adult worm unless the cat has had a worming treatment. It's much more common to see tapeworm egg packets on the cat's fur, especially near the anus."

      "title": "Look for white, rice-like objects in the cat's fur.",
      "content": "Look for white, rice-like objects in the cat's fur. When a tapeworm reproduces it fills special segments, called proglottids, which contain thousands of tiny eggs. [2] X Research source The adult tapeworms shed these egg packets into the bowel lumen where they migrate out of the cat's anus. The proglottids are about the size of a grain of rice and a similar shape. If you see a white rice-like object on the cat's fur then it is highly likely he has tapeworms."

      "title": "Know that a cat with a flea infestation is highly likely to have tapeworms.",
      "content": "Know that a cat with a flea infestation is highly likely to have tapeworms. There are two types of tapeworm that commonly infect the cat, and these tapeworms have different intermediate hosts. Dipylidium caninum (the most common cat tapeworm) uses fleas as its go-between. [3] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Cats with fleas are likely to develop tapeworm as immature fleas feed on tapeworm eggs in cat feces. The tapeworm hatches and develops inside the flea (the intermediate host), and when the cat grooms and swallows the flea, her digestive juices crack open the fleas body and release the larval form of the tapeworms. Thus, regular flea control is essential to prevent and control tapeworm in the cat."

      "title": "Understand that hunting cats are more likely to develop tapeworm.",
      "content": "Understand that hunting cats are more likely to develop tapeworm. The second most common tapeworm, Taenia taeniaeformis, develops its larval stage inside rodents such as rats and mice. Therefore, hunting cats are more likely to be infected with this type of tapeworm. [4] X Research source Rodents infect themselves with the larval form of tapeworm when they eat plants contaminated by cat feces containing tapeworm eggs. The tapeworm burrows into the rodents muscles and when the cat hunts and eats the infected rodent, it will infect itself with tapeworm. Thus, hunting cats need to be wormed regularly, ideally every 3-6 months."

      "title": "Take your cat to the vet.",
      "content": "Take your cat to the vet. If possible, bring a sample of the rice-like proglottids that you found in your cat's fur. This will help your vet determine which type of tapeworm your cat has contracted. Your vet will prescribe a tapeworm product that contains the ingredient praziquantel. [5] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source While treatment is the same no matter what type of tapeworm has infected your cat, knowing which type will help your vet give you advice about how to prevent future infections. Praziquantel is the only ingredient that can kill tapeworms, but many tapeworm products are combined with another ingredient that works against roundworms as well."

      "title": "Understand how praziquantel works.",
      "content": "Understand how praziquantel works. Praziquantel paralyzes the tapeworm, causing it to release its grip on the bowel wall. The dead worm is then passed out through the feces. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Praziquantel causes paralysis by making the phospholipid integument (skin) of the tapeworm permeable to sodium, potassium, and calcium ions. A massive influx of calcium ions paralyses the tapeworm's primitive nerve system, so the worm's suckers let go of the bowel wall and it is passed out.

However, other products are now available including Milbemax tablets, and a spot-on product, Profender, which is applied to the skin on the back of the cat's neck. [8] X Research source A summary of these products is listed below: Droncit injection: Contains praziquantel and is solely effective against tapeworms (no efficacy against roundworms). Drontal tablets: Contains praziquantel against tapeworm and pyrantel which is effective against roundworms Milbemax tablets: Contains praziquantel against tapeworm and milbemycin against roundworms. Profender spot-on: Contains praziquantel against tapeworm and emodepside against roundworms."

Approximately 2% of cats have mild side effects after oral dosing, which include sickness, diarrhea, or reduced appetite. If your cat appears to be experiencing side effects, call your vet immediately.
