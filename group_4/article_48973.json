      "content": "Illegitimate casinos are more likely to have unfair odds or poor security. Whether you’re playing at a physical casino or gambling online, always check the reviews first to see if other gamblers have had a good experience. Check their website for certification and licensing information to ensure they’re regulated properly. If you notice any bad reviews, a lack of licensure, or unencrypted sites asking for personal info, avoid putting your money into them. [1] X Research source If you’d rather gamble through an online casino, try playing on sites like Slots.lv , BetOnline , or Las Atlantis since they’re some of the most reliable services. Just make sure that online gambling is legal where you live. Check if online casinos are legal in your area before you sign up or deposit money. As of April 2023, online casinos are legal in Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, but illegal in any other state. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Many online casinos have promos for extra money to use in your wagers. When you first sign up for an online casino, check if they have any sign-up or welcome bonuses that give you free credits to use for your bets. Some casinos may even offer extra money when you deposit money into your account so you’re able to play for longer and have chances at higher winnings. [3] X Research source Read through the terms of the promotional offers before you accept them. Many online casinos have requirements for how much you need to wager before you cash out, which is usually a multiple of the promo offer. If you’re given $500 USD as a promo but the terms require a 10x wager, you’ll need to bet a total of $5,000 USD before banking your winnings."

      "title": "A high return to the player means you’ll win a majority of your bets back.",
      "content": "A high return to the player means you’ll win a majority of your bets back. Return to player (RTP) is the average percentage of how much players win compared to how much they’ve spent. [4] X Research source Physical casinos may not list the RTP and they may vary, but try searching for the specific game online to see an average. For online casinos or digital games, check for an info button that lists the RTP. Try sticking to games with RTP percentages over 95%, so that for every $1 USD you spend, you’re likely to earn $0.95 USD in winnings. The highest RTP casino games are: Video poker : Many video poker games have about 97–99.5% RTP. Blackjack : With basic strategy and knowing when to bet, blackjack has an average RTP of around 98–99%. Baccarat : As long as you make a banker bet in your baccarat game, you’ll get a 98% RTP on your bets. Slots : While slot machines can vary, keep your eyes out for ones that have between 95–97% RTP for the best chances of winning. Roulette : Roulette is a wheel game with an RTP of 97% or higher. The actual RTP will vary depending on the number of zeros on the wheel. Craps : Craps is a dice game with an RTP of 99% or higher, if played with the right bets. Some of the best bets in craps include the Pass Line bet and the Don't Pass Line bet."

      "content": "Guides tell you when to bet and when to stop based on how you’re doing. Even though all gambling games are a little unpredictable, there are still times when you have a higher probability of winning a payout based on what’s happened so far. Before you hop into your favorite casino game, take a moment to look over a strategy or betting guide to know when it’s best to place a wager and when to call it quits. [5] X Research source For video poker, save cards when they form a powerful poker hand, like a 4-of-a-kind or a royal flush, and get rid of cards that don’t add to the hand. When you’re playing blackjack , always hit and keep playing if you have 8 or lower showing in your hand, but call it quits if you have 17 or more. Check a blackjack chart for more options based on what the dealer has in their hand. In baccarat, bet on the banker’s hand instead of the player since they have a slight edge for winning the game. If you’re playing slots , bump up your bet to the next increment after winning a round so you have a chance at a larger payout. If you lose, lower your bet back down. It is important to refrain from playing slots solely to accumulate freebies or comps. Slot clubs and their associated perks are designed to entice players to continue playing. While it is acceptable to take advantage of the complimentary rewards if you are already playing, playing with the sole intention of earning more points can be problematic. It’s crucial not to fall into the trap of getting caught up in the marketing strategy employed by casinos. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Making lower bets gives you more opportunities to play.",
      "content": "Making lower bets gives you more opportunities to play. Check if the game you’re playing has betting options that only cost you a few cents so you’re not blowing all your cash right away. Any jackpots you win are proportional to the wagers you made, so lower bets mean a less valuable payout. Even with smaller payouts, you’re less likely to risk a big loss that burns through all your money. Adjust your bets depending on your winnings as you play the game. If you’ve been placing bets that are $1 USD and you’ve lost $5 USD already, then reduce the amount you’re betting to $0.50 USD if possible. Try the “Martingale System” if you’re playing roulette . Place a bet on red for the lowest amount you’re able to. If the ball lands on red, you’ve won and doubled your money. If the ball lands on black, then double your bet on red. That way, you can recoup your losses and break even if you win. Just be careful since losing multiple times could burn through your cash quickly. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Switching between game machines or tables may make your luck improve. If you’ve lost more than 5 times on the same machine or table, try moving to a different one to see if you have better chances. Even though the chance of you winning is always randomized, there’s always a chance you’ll have a bigger payout if you make the switch. [8] X Research source If you’re playing at an online casino, just try switching to a different game to see if your odds improve. Even if changing machines doesn’t affect the expected payout, taking a break after a cold streak gives you a chance to rest your brain and avoid making mistakes that lose you money.

      "content": "Setting a limit prevents you from overspending and losing your winnings. It can be so tempting to keep playing in hopes of winning a big jackpot or recouping your losses, but you risk losing even more. Set a win goal for how much money you’d like to win and stop as soon as you’ve cashed out that much. Alternatively, set a loss limit, and as soon as you lose that much money to bets, call it quits for the day. [10] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source When you’re starting with $20 USD, a realistic win or loss limit to set is usually between $100–200 USD. Setting win limits is usually more responsible than loss limits since you’re more likely to quit when you’re ahead and not as tempted to continue gambling.

If you’ve only been testing your luck on one gambling site, branch out and make an account for others that caught your eye. Not only will they have some new games for you to pick from, but they may offer bonus cash for signing up or making your first deposit so you have some extra earnings to wager right away. [12] X Research source Some other good online casinos to try out are BetUS , Wild Casino , and Cafe Casino since they have low deposit limits and large bonus offers to take advantage of."
