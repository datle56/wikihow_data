He might get embarrassed, but if he really likes you, he’ll say so. [8] X Research source You can just say “I like you a lot. Do you like me?” It’s best to tell him you like him too first, otherwise, he might think you’re making fun of him. If he avoids answering or even says no, just play it off as a joke.
