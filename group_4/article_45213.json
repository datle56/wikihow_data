Look at the guy, lock eyes for just long enough for him to see how sexy you are, and then look away. This will show that you're not afraid to look at him, but that you're also too coy to stare. Keep your body open. Don't fold your arms over your chest or cross your legs. Your body should be saying, \"Hey there boo, what's up?\" If you're wearing something with a zipper or a necklace, fiddle with the area near your chest to get his attention. Find ways to brush up against him. If you're already talking, lightly graze his knee, brush up against his hand, or place a hand on his forearm when you're laughing. Occasionally lick or bite your lips . If he's watching you from across the room, take the time to apply your lip balm. Remember that every guy is different, so try to understand his specific turn ons. [6] X Expert Source Alysha Jeney, MA, LMFT Licensed Relationship Therapist Expert Interview. 11 August 2021."
