      "content": "Practice the two different techniques of acupressure. Acupressure points are manipulated in two different ways: by either pressing (reinforcing) or reducing them. [4] X Research source Pressing technique: Use your fingers or something blunt (such as a pencil eraser at the end of a pencil) to press the particular point between 30 seconds to two minutes. Shorter pressures can be used and even a few seconds can provide relief. Reducing technique: Place your finger over a point and turn a finger in counter-clockwise direction for one to two minutes. Use enough pressure to feel the pressure but not too much (you should not feel pain). For each acupuncture point mentioned below, use one or both of the techniques mentioned above from 30 seconds to two minutes per point (unless directed otherwise). Don't worry—acupressure is really easy for people to use on themselves. [5] X Expert Source Karina Menali, L.Ac., DACM, Dipl.
