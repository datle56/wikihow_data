      "title": "Know what to look for.",
      "content": "Know what to look for. Each state’s I.D.s are somewhat different. Accordingly, you should learn the security features used on cards in your state and in surrounding states. Fortunately, there is plenty of information available: Purchase the I.D. Checking Guide from the Driver’s License Guide Company. It contains updated information on licenses in the U.S. and Canada. [1] X Research source You can order by calling 800-227-8827. Pick up any state-published reference. Your state might have published a booklet or handout on authenticating their state I.D.s. Check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. For instance, in some states, an I.D. for a person under 21 will be vertical, while one for a person over 21 will be horizontal."

    {
      "title": "Compare the identification to one you know is valid.",
      "content": "Compare the identification to one you know is valid. If you don’t have an I.D. checking guide, you can compare the I.D. to one you know is valid—maybe even your own. Check how similar they are. In particular, compare whether the thickness, size, coloring, lettering, and corners are the same. [2] X Research source A fake I.D. may be thinner than a legitimate one. In particular, counterfeiters use different paper or laminate than legitimate I.D.s."
    },
    {
      "title": "Examine the microprint with a magnifying glass.",
      "content": "Examine the microprint with a magnifying glass. Almost all states use microprint as a security feature. It looks like a straight line, but when magnified 10 times you can see the words clearly. Use a 10X magnifying glass to check whether the I.D. has microprint. [3] X Research source The microprint will be located on different positions, depending on which state’s I.D. you are looking at."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the card under ultraviolet light.",
      "content": "Hold the card under ultraviolet light. Depending on your state, certain security features will show up under ultraviolet light. For example, in California, you can see a second, lighter image of the cardholder only under UV light."
    },
    {
      "title": "Feel the card.",
      "content": "Feel the card. Your sense of touch can pick up on many signs of fraud. Some legitimate I.D.s may be tampered with, and you may be able to identify this through touch. For example, feel the edges of the I.D., which should be smooth and not peeling.Also, the card shouldn’t be flimsy and bend easily. Run a thumb over the picture and check its thickness. On some fake I.D.s, a picture is pasted over the original one, so the I.D. is especially thick there. Some information may also be tactile. On California licenses, for example, the cardholder’s signature is now printed using raised lettering. You can run your thumb across it and feel the lettering. On North Carolina licenses, you can feel the date of birth, which is laser engraved."

    {
      "title": "Scan the barcode.",
      "content": "Scan the barcode. The barcode contains information which should match the information on the front of the card. Most forgers cannot encode the information because it is too expensive. Scan the barcode and see if any information has been encoded and whether it matches the information on the front. There’s also an app you can use: BarZapp. The app only costs a couple of dollars and can be downloaded onto your smart phone. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Tilt the card in the light.",
      "content": "Tilt the card in the light. Some cards have security features that are only visible from certain angles. For example, you can check for an image overlay by tilting the card. [5] X Research source The card might also have the state name that is visible when you tilt the card toward the light. For example, on an Illinois driver’s license, the state name shows up in diagonal across the front of the card."

    {
      "title": "Search for misspellings on the identification card.",
      "content": "Search for misspellings on the identification card. You can spot a forgery if the I.D. contains a misspelling, such as using the wrong abbreviation for the state. Any I.D. with a misspelling is not legitimate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Look for signs of anxiety.",
      "content": "Look for signs of anxiety. Be suspicious if the cardholder avoids eye contact, is shaking, or otherwise looks nervous. This may be the first time they’ve tried to use a fake I.D. and could fear getting caught. Other signs of lying include pursing their lips or touching their face as they talk. [6] X Research source If the person is right-handed, then they will usually look to the right when they tell a lie."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare the physical description to the cardholder.",
      "content": "Compare the physical description to the cardholder. A driver’s license and other I.D.s should include a physical description that includes height, age, eye color, and weight. Check that the person handing over the I.D. matches the description. It can be difficult to judge height in the abstract. However, compare the person to your own height. If you’re 5’6” and the cardholder is allegedly 5’8”, then they should be close to your height."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare the picture to the person.",
      "content": "Compare the picture to the person. The I.D. should also have a picture. Analyze whether the person looks remotely like the person handing you the I.D.. Although the picture may be a few years old, the person should look generally the same. Instead of focusing on someone’s hairstyle, look at those features that don’t change: nose, ears, eyes, and chin. [7] X Research source Be suspicious if they look exactly like the picture or are wearing the same clothing. This indicates they made the fake I.D. recently."
    },
    {
      "title": "Compare signatures.",
      "content": "Compare signatures. If the cardholder is signing for something, compare the signatures. If they don’t match, then the I.D. is probably fake. You might suspect someone buying alcohol or cigarettes is using a fake I.D.. In that situation, ask them for their signature and then compare it. Sometimes, people will accidentally sign their real name, so this is a good test. [8] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask the cardholder questions.",
      "content": "Ask the cardholder questions. As you’re holding the card, ask the cardholder questions about the information that appears on it. For example, you should ask them their date of birth. If they can’t remember, then the I.D. is fake. You can also ask them their middle name or year they graduated high school. If they hesitate, then they may be using a fake I.D. If a companion is with the cardholder, quickly ask them the cardholder’s name. If they hesitate, they could be lying."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for a second form of photo identification.",
      "content": "Ask for a second form of photo identification. Someone might spend a lot of money to get 1 fake I.D. However, they probably don’t have 2. Ask to see a second photo I.D. If the person can’t produce 1, then the I.D. might be fake."
