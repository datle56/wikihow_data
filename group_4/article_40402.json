Especially if your child hasn't learned about puberty yet, you'll want to make sure that they know that their body changing is normal (even if it's early). Talking about your child's development neutrally (without acting as though it's shameful or embarrassing) will help them know that what they're going through is normal, and that it's okay to come to you about it. Some examples include: \"It's normal to need to wear deodorant. You just need it a little earlier than your friends, and that's okay.\" \"Lots of people need to wear bras. Your body is changing, and everyone else's will, too.\" \"You had a wet dream. Lots of people have those. It's okay.\" \"You're not 'losing your mind'.

Help them script responses to questions about their body (e.g. responding to \"Why are you so tall?\" with \"I just grew faster\"). Consider telling your child about your own experiences with puberty. Compliment your child's appearance if they say something negative about how they look. (However, don't constantly point out their changes.) Foster positive self-esteem by praising what they can do, and not focusing on how they look. Consider therapy if your child is struggling."
