DACs convert your phone's digital sounds to analogue; while every phone has a built-in DAC, purchasing an external one will both boost the power of the analogue sound and enable you to attach otherwise incompatible hardware-- in this case, a standard set of 3.5 millimeter headphones. Some popular DAC options include the following: Chord Mojo - A large DAC with a secondary headphone input that plugs into your phone via USB cable ($599 USD). While considered fairly high-quality, the size of the unit and overall price are common complaints. [2] X Research source AudioQuest Dragonfly - Another USB DAC with a headphone jack. Comes in standard Black ($100 USD) or the higher-quality Red ($198 USD) models. Common complaints include poor volume control and less refined audio than more expensive counterparts. Arcam MusicBoost S - A DAC built into an iPhone 6 and 6S case ($190 USD). Common complaints include it's limited compatibility (it won't work with a 6 Plus or 6 SE), mandatory charging and limited improvement to sound quality. Make sure your DAC supports a 3.5 millimeter set of headphones before purchasing it-- while most do, you don't want to order an expensive piece of hardware only to find that it doesn't work with your technology."
