This will cause mild discomfort when rolling over or moving around at night and can prevent the snorer from shifting in their sleep."

A CPAP machine can help to keep airways open while sleeping, but it is mainly used for sleep apnea. Consider drawbacks, such as hindering travel, before getting a machine. Traditional surgery for snoring: These surgical procedures will help to increase the size of the person's airways by removing tissues or correcting any abnormalities in the nose, such as a deviated septum. Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP): This procedure uses lasers to shorten the uvula, which is the hanging soft tissue at the back of the throat, and makes small cuts in the soft palate. As the cuts heal, the surrounding tissue will stiffen and prevent the vibrations in the throat that cause snoring."
