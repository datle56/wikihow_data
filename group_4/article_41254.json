Then clean it up with an antiseptic wipe or a bit of Neosporin and apply a bandage to protect it while it heals. You can also try using betadine or peroxide on the wound to clean and remove unwanted bacteria. These basic precautions will help to keep it clean and prevent infection.

      "content": "Keep the scab protected. Scabs form over wounds to keep out germs while the body repairs skin cells and tissue. It is important to help the healing process by protecting this barrier. [2] X Research source If you cannot bandage it, try applying moisturizer or lotion as it heals. Scabs kept protected will usually leave less scarring. The slight skin massage that comes with applying moisturizer will also increase circulation and help it to heal properly. Take a fingernail file and carefully smooth the scab down to the surrounding skin. [3] X Research source Then, when your hand rubs across the area, it will be less of a temptation and harder to pick."

      "content": "Study yourself. There may be reasons why you are picking at your scabs, ranging from purely physical (they itch) to mental or emotional (perhaps as a way to relieve tension). Understanding the root cause can help you to break the habit. [4] X Research source Not everyone who picks their scabs has a behavioral problem. Some amount is normal. Other times it is a sign of skin problems, drug use of withdrawal, or other conditions. It only becomes a behavioral disorder when it is so frequent that it impacts other aspects of your daily life.

      "content": "Make picking more difficult. One way to stop is to make the habit physically hard. Cut your nails, wear gloves, or cover the scabs. Having shorter fingernails will make it harder for you to pick. Keeping scabs bandaged will prevent you from looking at them and help you resist the urge to pick. [7] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try soft cotton gloves. Not only do they act as a barrier, but they should make you even more conscious of the behavior and help you to reduce it. [8] X Research source If you tend to pick at your arms or legs, wear long sleeves and pants whenever possible. If the scabs are on your ankle, wear high socks. This way, even if you give in, you will pick at the fabric rather than the skin itself."

      "title": "Apply acrylic fingernails.",
      "content": "Apply acrylic fingernails. This is another way of making your picking harder — and also a fashion-sensible one. It will be more difficult because you will have to scrape with thicker nails, which won't catch the skin as easily. Thin nails are sharp and can slice off the scab. If you go this route, have the manicurist make the nails as short and thick as possible. This will be added insurance against damaging the skin."

You might try drawing, gardening, knitting, doing a puzzle, playing the piano, or crocheting. You can even just hold a coin or paperclip. If nothing else works, sit on your hands.

If out of control, scab picking can be a sign of a bigger behavioral problem called \"Skin Picking Disorder.\" People with Skin Picking Disorder compulsively touch, scratch, pick, or rub their skin, which can result in scarring or worse. Try asking yourself the following questions: Does your skin picking take a lot of your time up? Do you have noticeable scars from skin picking? Do you feel guilty when you think about your skin picking? Does your skin picking cause significant disability socially or professionally? If you answer yes to more than one of these questions, you may have SPD."

It may be dermatological, like eczema, for example, an inflammation of the skin that can cause itching. In this case the doctor may prescribe medication like corticosteroids or other topical creams.
