      "content": "Use lumber to create a base that will keep the plywood off the ground. Moisture can seep up through the earth, causing your plywood to rot. You can use any size lumber you have, as long as it creates a frame that is big enough to contain the plywood. Space your lumber about 2 feet (0.61 m) apart to ensure it’s supported enough that it doesn’t sag."

      "content": "Store your plywood overhead if you don’t have the floor space. If you want to keep your plywood laying flat but you don’t have enough room on the floor, you can install a rack on the ceiling of your garage. This will keep the plywood out of your way while still protecting it from warping. [1] X Research source You can purchase a hanging storage storage rack from a hardware store for around $100 USD, or you can design and build a custom rack if you prefer. Most ceiling beams can safely support about 160 pounds (73 kg). This means you can safely store 3 sheets of 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm) thick plywood, or 2 sheets if they are 5 ⁄ 8 in (1.6 cm) thick.

      "content": "Lean the plywood against an interior wall if you can. The easiest way to store plywood is just to lean it against a wall. However, this can lead to the plywood bending or warping, so it’s not recommended for long-term storage. [3] X Research source If you store your plywood against an outside wall, moisture may seep through the wall and cause the wood to warp more quickly. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Secure multiple sheets of plywood with bungee cords or ratchet straps . If you have several sheets of plywood that you’re storing vertically, you can help prevent warping by securing the sheets together across the top, middle, and bottom with canvas ratchet straps or elastic bungee cords."

      "title": "Build a vertical plywood storage rack.",
      "content": "Build a vertical plywood storage rack. You can build a basic storage rack by creating a 4 by 8 ft (1.2 by 2.4 m) frame out of lumber. Place a support beam at each end of the rack and one in the middle to hold the plywood in place. Attach a piece of scrap plywood to the bottom of the rack to protect the plywood from moisture seeping in through the floor. [5] X Research source If you build your own storage rack, the possibilities for customizing it are endless. You can choose whether to store the plywood on its end or rest it on its side. You can also choose whether to mount the rack to the wall or attach casters to the bottom so you can easily move it. You can also purchase a plywood storage rack from a hardware or home supply store if you don’t want to build one yourself."
