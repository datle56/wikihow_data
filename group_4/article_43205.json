      "content": "See if you have a few memories of the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War lasted from 1955 to 1975 between the communist North Vietnam and the anti-communist South Vietnam. North Vietnam was supported by the Soviet Union and China, whereas the South was supported by the United States. [5] X Research source You may have heard about this event in the news. Additionally, if you had an older sibling or a parent who served in the war, you may be a Baby Boomer. If you are an older Baby Boomer, you may have served in the war yourself. Public opinion on this war divided America. While many World War II veterans believed it was crucial to stopping the spread of Communism, many pacifists, youths, and members of the Civil Rights Movement saw the conflict as costly and unjust. As the first televised war, horrific images, and reports that America was defending a corrupt and anti-democratic government, led people to question how the American government could justify standing for such a regime. [6] X Research source You may have lived in Vietnam or another country affected by the war at the time. In this case, you likely witnessed numerous tragic events caused by the fighting.

[9] X Research source Many hippies actively protested against the Vietnam War. The Volkswagen Type 2 is a famous type of van many hippies owned.

      "content": "Remember how your family lived during your childhood. In the US, most people grew up in middle-class families. Marriage was very important back then, so most women married young and had children with a man. It was typical for the patriarch (usually the father) to go to work every day, and for female family members to stay at home. At the time, women were only expected to take responsibility for housekeeping. Pursuing other avenues, such as work, was often considered selfish or as putting themselves before the needs of their family. [12] X Research source Because of the baby boom, most baby boomers aren't only children. Economic prosperity, advances in healthcare, a desire for stability, and government policy lead to a significant increase in birth rates, particularly in post-World War II USA.
