Measure the resistance by disconnecting the heating element from any power source, and connecting the multimeter leads to the terminals of the heating element. [2] X Research source If the reading is the same or very close to that of the calculated value, then the element is OK and the fault lies elsewhere. [3] X Research source If the reading is a lot higher than the calculated value, the element is failing and won't be heating fully. If the reading is a lot lower than the calculated value the element, it is failing and will be heating too much or not at all if part of the element has shorted or exploded."
