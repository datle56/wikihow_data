      "content": "Start with daily meditations. Meditation is the practice of taking your attention away from the world and re-focusing it towards yourself. [5] X Research source It allows you to slow down and take the time to be still. “When you’re thinking about things, that’s not really your soul,” psychic medium Mari Cartagenova explains. “[Meditation] is a quick and easy way to connect to your essence, your light, and who you really are.” There are 16 forms of meditation ranging from yoga meditation to sound bath meditation. [6] X Research source However, the most common form is breathing meditation. To learn how to meditate , start by picking a quiet environment to sit in. This can be a bedroom or outside in nature. Once you’re settled, allow your eyes to close. Sit in a still position with your hands placed on your knees and a straight posture. It helps to close your eyes in order to become fully aware of your breath and slow your body. If you're struggling or are new to the practice, try a 5-minute meditation when you first wake up or before bed. You can also play guided videos or practice being alone."

Allow it to rise to the top of your head, leave your body, and hold it for a moment. When you exhale, let your breath travel down your spine. When you do, you should be able to feel yourself drop back into your body."
