      "content": "Pick a time to talk when the person is calm and relaxed. It's best to catch the person when they're in a relatively calm mood. If they've had a rough week, or the two of you have been fighting all day, it's probably better to hold off until the person is in a more positive state of mind.

I've been really worried about you!”"

      "title": "Stay calm.",
