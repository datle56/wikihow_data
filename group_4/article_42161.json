      "content": "Locate a body of water like a river, stream, lake, or pond. Water flows downhill, so you should look for bodies of water in depressions in the earth and valleys. If you’re in a mountainous region, there’s a reasonable chance that if you walk parallel to a mountain you’ll find a stream or river eventually. [1] X Research source If you do find a body of water, you should build your shelter near it. Don’t build the shelter on the water’s edge, though, because chances are that (possibly dangerous) animals will frequent the area to quench their thirst. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Sterilize water from lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers. You should always boil any water that you collect from a body of water in nature. If you have a metal container, you can put it on your fire to boil for at least 20 minutes to sterilize it. If you don’t have a container you can put onto a fire, you can still boil the water with a boiling pit. To boil water with a boiling pit, dig a hole approximately 2 feet (0.61 m) long by 2 feet (0.61 m) wide by 2 feet (0.61 m) deep next to your campfire. Then, separate out the clay from the soil (it will be sticky and reddish), and line the hole with the clay, making sure there are no cracks or openings in the layer of clay. Then, use a container like a hat or a shoe to transport water from your water source to the boiling pit until it’s full Once your pit is full, heat rocks on your campfire. Heat them for approximately 10 minutes, then start dropping them in the pit. Rotate freshly hot rocks with ones in the pit that have cooled down until you have a steady boil for 20 minutes."

Before you go to sleep, dig a hole that is approximately 1 foot (0.30 m) long by 1 foot (0.30 m) wide by 1 foot (0.30 m) deep. The hole should fill with water overnight. The water will be muddy, so you should strain it with a piece of cloth like your shirt. If you don’t have a container to strain your water into, you can use your shirt to soak up water and then wring it into your mouth. The shirt should hold on to most of the mud."

First, wrap your hand in your shirt to protect it from the spines and break the pads off the plant. Then, use a rock to scrape off the spines before eating the pad. To catch a lizard, on the other hand, try to act opportunistically. If there are lizards nearby, sit as still as possible until they approach, then grab them as quickly as you can. If you intend to eat a lizard, cook it as thoroughly as possible to avoid salmonella. Focus on eating the tail meat. Avoid the mouth, because that’s where salmonella tends to be most prevalent."

Find a green, pliable branch and tie one of your shoestrings to either end of it to form a bow. Then find a hardwood stick approximately .75 inches (1.9 cm) in diameter to serve as your drill. [22] X Research source If you don’t have shoelaces and you’re in a forested area, you can create a string by digging into a tree with a rock to the fibrous inner layer, pulling out the fibers, and tying them together. If you’re not in a forested area and need string, you can create it by cutting off bits of your hair and tying them together.

Hold the softwood firmly with your foot and place the top of the drill in the divot of the hardwood or rock you found to hold it securely in position. Then draw the bow back and forth so that the drill spins and creates friction on the softwood and makes a spark. [23] X Research source After several minutes of vigorous sawing, you should start to see smoke. Once you do, you can blow on the kindling gently to encourage the spark to spread. [24] X Research source Once your kindling has started burning, form a pyramid around it with twigs and bark in the center, then build another pyramid around that with small branches, and a final pyramid around the whole thing with larger branches.
