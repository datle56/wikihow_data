      "content": "If you're a Virgo moon, the moon was in the constellation of Virgo at the time of your birth. Whereas your sun sign deals with your core identity and outward-facing personality, your moon sign “highlights your hidden and more mysterious side,” says psychic astrologer Stina Garbis. In other words, it “reveals your innermost feelings and emotions.” If the moon was in Virgo when you were born, you likely process your emotions like a practical, even-keeled Virgo, even if your sun sign has a very different energy from this. To find your moon sign , simply enter your birth date, time, and location into a free online birth chart calculator. The moon changes positions every 2 to 2 ½ days, making your moon sign even more specific to you than your sun sign! [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Structured & organized Your moon sign “has to do with where you feel comfortable, and how you like to live,” explains expert astrologer Angel Eyedealism. Virgo moons tend to feel happiest and most comfortable when they have a structured and stable routine. They like to have everything planned out ahead of time, and they aren’t big fans of chaos or spontaneity. They also value tidiness and order in their living spaces.

      "content": "Practical & composed Virgo moons are known for being realistic and level-headed. They aren’t the kind of people to let their emotions run away with them; instead, they work through their feelings rationally and logically. [4] X Research source They never act out on impulse, and they don’t get caught up in the heat of the moment. In other words, those who have a Virgo moon tend to lead with their heads, rather than their hearts. This doesn’t mean that Virgo moons don’t feel their emotions deeply—they definitely do! They just tend to make decisions from a logical standpoint, rather than letting their emotions drive their actions. They’re also pretty hesitant to express their emotions to others, preferring instead to keep up a composed outward appearance. [5] X Research source"

As a result, Virgo moons will jump at the chance to lend a helping hand to a friend in need, and they love to be of service to their communities. [8] X Research source Virgo moons usually focus on providing practical support, rather than emotional support. For example, if a friend needs a ride to the airport or a last-minute babysitter for their children, a Virgo moon would be all over it! If a Virgo moon sees a problem in their community, they’re quick to volunteer their time to fix it. For example, if they notice that their local beach is dirty, a Virgo moon would take the initiative and plan a beach clean-up event."

      "content": "Perfectionistic Virgo moons have very high standards for themselves, and they have a hard time accepting anything less than perfection. As a result, they tend to be pretty hard on themselves when they make a mistake. [9] X Research source To overcome this: Practice self-compassion. This means recognizing when you’re struggling, and being kind to yourself in those moments, rather than judging yourself. When you make a mistake, imagine your best friend in your situation. What kind, encouraging words would you say to them? Now direct these compassionate messages toward yourself.

[12] X Research source Their hearts are in the right place—they just want to see loved ones live up to their full potential. However, if they aren’t careful, this criticism can cause tension in their relationships. To overcome this: Take a pause before offering advice or constructive criticism to others, and ask yourself these questions: Did this person ask for my opinion? Is this an appropriate situation for me to share my perspective? Is my input actually productive, or is it just hurtful? Does this person already know they made a mistake? Do they already feel bad about it? If you truly have a helpful suggestion to give, share it in a kind, respectful way. Focus on the positive and what can be done to improve, rather than calling them out for their mistakes. [13] X Research source"

As a result, Virgo moons often intellectualize and rationalize their feelings, rather than truly experiencing them. [16] X Research source They may also avoid opening up to loved ones, preferring instead to work through their feelings in secret. To overcome this: Try journaling about your emotions. This is a great first step, since it gives you a chance to privately write down your thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. Challenge yourself to be more vulnerable. Pick someone you trust, and open up to them about something you’ve been going through. This will lead to deeper connections with loved ones and provide the emotional catharsis you need.
