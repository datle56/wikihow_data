There are two main methods for making soap, the hot process and the cold process. The cold process of making soap is the most common method. It involves mixing an alkali (usually lye) with fats or oils. Once mixed and formed into shape, it can take weeks for the soap to cure. The hot process of making soap requires you to cook the soap. This method requires no cure time, and can make it easier to add scents and colors. However, it is more difficult to work with and mold hot process soap. If you are new to soap making, consider taking a class in your area. Check with local crafts organizations, stores, and soap makers to see what opportunities are available.
