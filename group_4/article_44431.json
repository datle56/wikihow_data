      "content": "Put an e-collar around your dog’s neck to protect the ear. An e-collar, also called the \"cone of protection,\" prevents your dog from scratching or rubbing its ear, which gives the ear time to heal. You can get an e-collar at your local pet store, online, or your vet. They come in different sizes, so pick one that’s labeled for your dog’s size. While your dog is wearing the e-collar, watch them closely because the cone can get stuck on stuff. You may need to take off the e-collar so your dog can eat and drink water."

[4] X Research source If you don’t treat the underlying condition, your dog’s hematoma will keep coming back. [5] X Research source To see if your dog has ear mites, look for grainy discharge in its ear that looks like coffee grounds. [6] X Research source Look for the following symptoms of an ear infection: yellow or brown discharge, odor, scabs, redness, swelling, itching, head shaking, loss of balance, hearing loss, and walking in circles.

The ear is highly vascularized and repetitive trauma such as pawing, scratching, or rubbing at the ear can lead to the breaking of capillaries. Once the capillaries are broken, internal bleeding occurs and leads to the formation of an ear hematoma. Here are the typical causes of aural hematomas in dogs: Injury to your dog’s ear, especially from scratching and shaking. Skin infections Parasites, like ear mites or ticks A foreign object, like glass, that’s trapped under your dog’s skin.
