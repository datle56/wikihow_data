      "title": "Recognize your skills.",
      "content": "Recognize your skills. You can have many types of skills and not even know it. Skills aren’t just knowledge but are ways of relating to information and people. Skill types can include technical, transferable, and personal skills. [1] X Research source Technical skills are the “how-to’s”, such as fixing or creating things, and administering or following protocols, such as being a mechanic, nurse, artist, or racecar driver. Transferable skills are skills that can help in many situations, such as organization, customer service, teamwork, and leadership, and can be helpful across many professions or activities. Personal skills include being reliable, having initiative, listening to your gut/intuition, and being self-motivated. Reflect on your skills and recognize that you have many skills. Remember how your skills have helped you in the past (like planning a wedding or doing well in interviews) and brainstorm ways to use your skills in the future."

      "title": "Reflect on what makes you happy.",
      "content": "Reflect on what makes you happy. There’s no use using and improving skills you don’t enjoy. Even if you have skills you excel in, don’t waste your time doing things that you don’t find fun. Remember that money cannot buy happiness. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Instead, think about things that make you happy. Perhaps you get along with everyone, are naturally charismatic, and love to make friends. You may want to work in sales or do activities that involve lots of people, like coordinating volunteer opportunities. Or perhaps you enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together. Maybe you want to be a mechanic or have a hobby fixing old toys. These are skills you can use! By knowing what makes you happy, you can pursue areas in your life to activate your skills and be happy while doing it."

      "title": "Create goals.",
      "content": "Create goals. People who are goal-oriented tend to be happier and achieve more. [3] X Research source Think about what you want to develop and what fuels you to want to improve these skills. When creating goals, make sure they are SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, results-focused, and timely. [4] X Research source If your goal is to run, make it more specific by determining to run your first half marathon. Avoid general goals and be as specific as possible. Make your goal measurable by setting dates and creating a timeframe. Pick a half marathon race in the future that will allow you to train and prepare for the race. Then create a training plan. An achievable goal is one that challenges you but is still within your grasp. Being the first person on Mars may be a bit of a stretch, but learning how to ride a motorcycle may be doable, even if you feel fearful. By focusing on the result, you can stay motivated throughout the process. Think about the benefits of meeting your goal, and focus on the outcome of this goal. A timely goal has an end date in mind. Instead of “I will hike”, a time-bound goal has an end date in mind, creating some sense of urgency, such as “I will hike to the top of Mount Timpanogos by August 16.” For more information about goal setting, check out How to Set Goals ."

      "content": "Pursue an education. A formal university education is well-respected by many and serves to give credibility in many fields. If you’d like to use and improve your skills in engineering, computers, foreign language, psychology, etc., obtaining formal education is a beneficial route to take, especially if you’d like to hold a job in one of these fields. If you’re interested in pursuing knowledge and not a career, community colleges offer more affordable options and offer classes for many interests. You can apprentice someone to learn specialized skills. You may want to be a surf instructor but not know how to teach surfing. By apprenticing a surf teacher, you can learn the skills to teach."

      "content": "Make friends/network. Networking can be a beneficial business and personal skill. By having a network, you open yourself up to information, people, and power. Find ways to meet other people in your field of interest, whether it be events, social media, or through friends of friends. Join interest clubs or professional societies to help you meet people with similar interests or career paths. Take advantage of any opportunity to meet others who share your interest. Ask them questions about how they improved their skills, how they achieved success, and any things to avoid or re-consider. If you want to learn a skill, such as welding, take a class. A class offers an environment to meet other people with similar interests, and it may open doors to pursue more ways to improve this skill."

      "title": "Use your resources.",
      "content": "Use your resources. You may love to sing, but be unsure how to use that skill. Maybe you are interested in writing but can’t seem to find a way to engage this skill. Connect with people who may be able to help you find ways to use your skills. Ask friends, family, co-workers, and people your spiritual community about ways to open up your skills. Some community colleges offer career aptitude tests. While you may (or may not) use it to work toward your career, these tests can help you define your strengths and weaknesses. By asking around, you may find that your church would love for you to sing at services. You may find that you can write for your local newspaper or submit stories for local publications. Don’t be afraid to ask!"

      "content": "Transfer your abilities. Perhaps you want to change careers but fear not having experience in the new field. Maybe you want to head back to work after being a stay-at-home mom, but feel like you have nothing to offer. Think about what skills you do have, and hype those skills up! For instance, a stay-at-home mom may have excellent organization skills, time management skills, taking charge, remaining calm under pressure, and the ability to multi-task. You can always learn knowledge, but value the skills you have and make them known! Practice the role tree exercise: Think about the roles you currently have in your life or have previously had, and write the skills that go along with those roles. See which skills overlap, which are most enjoyable, and which skills aid you the most in moving forward. [5] X Research source"

If you’re creative, pursue a career in acting, singing, dancing, or art. Or if you love working with your hands, consider becoming an electrician or builder. If you love flowers, become a florist."
