      "content": "Show respect. Being mindful of your actions and what you say is one of the best ways to keep yourself out of trouble in school. [1] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA Academic & School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. Be respectful to your teachers as well as your peers. Don’t talk back to a teacher, just listen to them and understand that they are trying to help you, even if seems otherwise. Avoid calling your classmates names, teasing them, or spreading gossip and rumors. [2] X Research source For example, if a group of your peers is making fun of the way someone dresses, don’t join in with jokes. Instead, walk away or say something like, “Lay off, man. She’s got her own sense of style.” If a teacher pulls you aside to discuss your behavior, listen carefully to what they have to say. Don’t roll your eyes or get defensive, just say “I understand, Mr. Roberts. It won’t happen again,” or something similar."

      "title": "Be honest.",
      "content": "Be honest. You should admit when you have done something wrong, and tell the truth rather than lying. Not only are you likely to be caught in a lie, but then your teachers and parents won’t trust you moving forward. Own up to your mistakes and find a way to fix them. [3] X Research source Never, ever cheat. You won’t learn what you are supposed to, and you’ll get in a ton of trouble when you get caught. If you are struggling to the point where you are tempted to cheat, talk to the teacher or a tutor. Explain to them that you don't understand the subject at all."

      "title": "Use appropriate language.",
      "content": "Use appropriate language. Many kids get in trouble for using curse words or speaking inappropriately. Avoid talking like that at school or in front of teachers and parents. Think of other ways to express yourself in a mature manner. For example, if a teacher assigns a 3-page paper, don’t say “This is BS! What a waste of time.” Instead, keep your thoughts to yourself or say something like “Wow, it’s going to be a long night.”"

      "title": "Avoid fights.",
      "content": "Avoid fights. Fighting will certainly get you in trouble at school, so you need to avoid it at all costs. If someone tries to pick a fight with you, simply laugh it off or walk away. It can be difficult to control your emotions in the moment, but it’s a far better solution than wailing on someone and getting suspended. If you feel like the situation is getting out of control, talk to a teacher or counselor. [4] X Trustworthy Source HealthyChildren.org Health information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Go to source For example, if someone says something rude to you, respond with “Hey, man, that was rude. Don’t talk to me like that. Look out for your classmates. If you notice someone getting bullied, you could tell the bullies to stop or to knock it off."

      "title": "Stand up to peer pressure",
      "content": "Stand up to peer pressure . Just because your peers think something is a good idea doesn’t mean it actually is. Think the situation through and trust your gut instinct. If you have a feeling you could get into trouble for doing something, don’t do it. Say your friends want to steal a rival school’s mascot costume. Rather than going along with the plan, say “Nah, I don’t want to get in trouble. I’ll see you guys later,” and walk away."

      "content": "Show up for every class on time. Being on time and present for each class will help you avoid getting in trouble. Make sure you have enough time to get ready and get to school in the morning so you don’t have to rush. For example, if you feel like you’re always rushing, get up 15 to 30 minutes before you normally would to give yourself some extra time."

      "title": "Pay attention.",
      "content": "Pay attention. Focus your attention on the teacher and the lesson. Though it can be tempting, refrain from distractions like talking to your friends, passing notes, or looking at your cell phone. Rather than staring off into space or out the window, focus your attention on your teacher and what they are saying. [5] X Research source If you need something to fidget with in order to help you pay attention, ask your teacher first. You can also try squishing a small piece of kneaded eraser."

      "title": "Take notes.",
      "content": "Take notes. If you haven’t done this before, it may seem awkward at first, but taking notes will keep you on track as well as help you remember the material you are being taught. Write down key words, definitions, equations, tips, and tricks that your teacher mentions. If the teacher writes something on the board, it's probably important and likely to appear on a test. Write it down!"

      "title": "Participate in class.",
      "content": "Participate in class. If your teacher asks a question and you know the answer, raise your hand. You can also ask questions or get clarification on things that are confusing. Participating in class will show your teacher that you are listening and trying to learn the material, which they will surely appreciate it. Many teachers consider class participation to be part of your grade. This means that even if you do poorly on your tests, you can still boost your grade!"

      "title": "Follow directions.",
      "content": "Follow directions. When your teacher assigns something, listen carefully to what they say and follow their directions. Do what is expected of you, even if you don’t really want to. It’s not up to you to determine if an assignment is worthy, you still need to complete it. [6] X Research source For example, if your teacher tells your class to pair up and discuss a book you’re reading, do so. Don’t ignore their instructions or talk to your partner about other things, simply bring up an interesting point about the book and ask your partner what they think about it."

      "title": "Complete your assignments on time.",
      "content": "Complete your assignments on time. Make a planner that you can list all your assignments in so that you know what to do each day. Stick to your schedule and wait to play video games or hang out with your friends until your homework is done. You can also pack your backpack each night before you go to bed so that you aren’t rushing around looking for your assignments in the morning."

      "title": "Don’t bring prohibited items to school.",
      "content": "Don’t bring prohibited items to school. You may be tempted to show your friends a cool new cell phone or gadget. But, if you’re caught with something you shouldn’t have at school you are going to get in a lot of trouble. Leave banned items at home, or don’t buy them in the first place. Never bring drugs, alcohol, or weapons to school. You can get expelled as well as get in trouble with the police, so it’s not at all worth it."

      "title": "Choose your friends wisely.",
      "content": "Choose your friends wisely. Rather than hanging with the crowd that always lands in detention, find friends who keep up with their grades and participate in appropriate after-school activities. Look for classmates who share your interests, and spend time with them. [7] X Research source For instance, if you love comic books, find a few friends who share your passion. You could even start a comic book club after school."

      "content": "Get involved at school. A great way to stay out of trouble is to get involved at school. Join the student council/government or look for other ways to help out. Volunteer to organize a school event, such as a dance or fundraiser. You could also reach out to a coach and see if they could use your help managing a team or club. Many schools put on a play during the spring. See how you can get involved. They often need people to help out with the costumes, props, and sets."

      "content": "Stay busy after school. When you have a lot of free time on your hands, it can be easy to get into trouble. The best thing to do is to stay busy. Join a sports team or a school club so that you have activities after school. You can also get a job, which will keep you busy as well as provide you with some extra cash. [8] X Research source For example, join the softball team, the art club, the swim team, or the drama club. As for jobs, offer to babysit your neighbor’s children, mow lawns in your neighborhood, or apply for work at a local ice cream shop or restaurant, or even go to the park to let yourself let loose."
