      "content": "Get 1-2 new outfits to wear during the first week. While you don't need a whole new wardrobe, having a new outfit for the first day can make you feel more confident. If your school doesn’t require uniforms, save up to get an outfit or 2 that you like, or get a new pair of shoes to wear for the year. Once you have an outfit that you like, make sure you style it appropriately for school . Keep in mind that whatever you wear should follow your school’s dress code. If you don’t have a lot of room in your budget for a new outfit, mix and match your old clothes to make new outfits, visit a thrift store to find inexpensive clothes, or organize a clothing swap with your friends where you can all trade clothes."

Visit an office supply store or local supermarket to pick up a few folders, pencils, notebooks, and other supplies that your school wants you to have. If you’re not sure what you need, check your school’s website, ask a store associate, call the school to ask them, or look up lists for your grade level online. Your classes might require you to get specific supplies, like a protractor for geometry class or a world map for history. You don’t have to get a new backpack and lunch box every year, but if yours have rips or tears in them from last year, remember to get a new one when you’re shopping for school supplies."

If you’re not going to pack your lunch, be sure to have at least $5-$6 on hand for buying lunch from the cafeteria. Some schools have lunch accounts where you should be able to load money onto your account before the school year. If you don’t have an account, bring cash to pay for lunch."

Remember, you should only talk during class if the teacher says it’s okay to do so, like before the bell for class rings.

Let them know you’re glad to be in class with them again by saying “Good morning Mrs. Miller, it’s nice to be in class with you again this semester!” For your homeroom teacher, you might want to ask your parents to let you bring them a beginning of the year gift, like a gift card to get coffee, or a teacher-themed craft. Since you’ll be seeing them a lot throughout the year, it’s especially important to make a good impression."
