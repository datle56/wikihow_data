Explain where and when the harassment occurred, as well as who witnessed it. Describe the incidents in chronological order, which is the easiest for people to understand. In some larger organizations, HR might not know everyone, such as a coworker. Identify who they are, e.g., “Jason Jones, who works in the cubicle next to me, saw our boss make the obscene gesture.” Stick to the facts. Don’t make any kind of allegation or charge that you can’t back up with proof, such as your written memories or a witness. For example, don’t speculate about your boss or coworker’s motivation for what they said or did, since there’s no way to prove that."

For example, you might have met with your harasser to ask them to stop making sexually-explicit jokes. Remember to explain how the harassment made you feel.

Your boss or coworkers are bullying you . Some abuse doesn’t qualify as workplace harassment. Legally, harassment must be based on a protected characteristic, such as race, gender, religion, age, etc. [10] X Trustworthy Source US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission U.S. government agency that enforces civil rights in the workplace Go to source Nevertheless, someone might bully you simply because they don’t like you.

Although she said she would investigate, my pay hasn’t changed and she doesn’t seem too worried about it. We are now approaching the 2-month mark and I am still not being paid properly.” Also let HR know how you have been feeling.

      "title": "Participate in mediation if HR recommends it.",
      "content": "Participate in mediation if HR recommends it. Human Resources might have a mediation program you can use to resolve disputes. In mediation, you and the person you are having problems with will meet with the mediator, who is a neutral third party. The mediator isn’t a judge. However, they can help each side talk and listen to each other. [19] X Research source The purpose of mediation is to resolve the dispute voluntarily so that each side can walk away feeling good. If the harassment has been severe, don’t feel compelled to mediate a dispute with your employer. Instead, find an attorney and discuss next steps. Your employer might offer “conciliation,” which is like mediation. However, the conciliator is more involved in decision-making than a mediator, who lets the parties decide on a proper resolution."

      "title": "File a harassment charge with the EEOC if HR won’t investigate.",
      "content": "File a harassment charge with the EEOC if HR won’t investigate. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) investigates claims of workplace harassment. You can file a complaint (“charge”) with them. You may also complain to a state agency that investigates harassment. Avoid delaying this step. You have 180 days from the date of the harassment to file a discrimination charge with the EEOC. [20] X Trustworthy Source US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission U.S. government agency that enforces civil rights in the workplace Go to source Your state agency may give you more time. Generally, federal EEOC law covers most employers. But some smaller employers might only be covered by state law. If your employer has 15 or fewer employees, you may need to complain to your state agency."

      "title": "Hire an attorney to escalate the situation beyond your workplace.",
      "content": "Hire an attorney to escalate the situation beyond your workplace. You need expert assistance to protect your rights. A lawyer can help you if your employer retaliates against you, continues to harass you, or refuses to pay owed wages. Contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral. Visit the American Bar Association to find your nearest bar association. Ask for an employment lawyer. When you call to set up a consultation, ask how much the lawyer charges. Prepare for your consultation by gathering helpful documents, such as a copy of your complaint letter to HR. At the consultation, you will discuss whether you have a legal case. Not all harassing conduct rises to the level of legal harassment. For example, 1 off-color joke probably doesn’t qualify."
