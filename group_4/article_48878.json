      "content": "Choose a briefcase to keep for yourself. Initially, you will be asked to choose 1 briefcase out of the 26 that you believe has the highest amount of money in it (in this case, $1 million). The briefcase will be brought over to you, but you won’t get to see what’s inside of it just yet. You’ll get to switch this briefcase out after every round, or you can choose to stick with your original pick. [2] X Research source There’s no way to know which briefcase has the highest amount of money yet, so you’ll have to choose at random."

Since there’s no way to know the money amounts in each case, you can pick these at random, going for your favorite numbers or choosing them completely on a whim. The aim is to pick briefcases with low amounts in them because once they get removed from play, you can’t win that amount anymore. [3] X Research source The cases range in amounts from $.01 to $1 million. The cases that you choose to be removed from the play will be opened up as you pick them, so you’ll be able to see which ones you’ve removed. In each round, you’ll be asked to remove fewer cases from play, so pay attention!"

      "content": "Listen to the banker’s offer. After you pick out your cases, the “banker” will send you an offer to purchase your cases from you. Initially, the banker will probably try to throw you some pretty bad deals, so don’t expect a lot of money in the first couple of rounds. [4] X Research source The banker bases their offer on what amounts have been removed from play and what amounts are still on the board. The banker has the same information as you do, so they don’t know what briefcase has which monetary amount."

      "content": "Accept the offer if you think it’s more than what’s in your briefcase. If you believe that the banker’s offer is more than what you would win by opening up the briefcase that you picked initially, you can say “Deal.” This will end the game and you’ll get to take home the amount of money that the banker offered to you. [5] X Research source Remember, the banker’s role is to get you to leave the game with the least amount of money as possible. Make sure you don’t accidentally say “Deal” when you mean “No Deal.” It sounds silly, but it does happen!"

If you think that the banker is offering less than what is in your current briefcase, say “No Deal.” This will keep you in the game so you can play more rounds, continuing to remove briefcases from play until the end. [6] X Research source If you do decline the offer, you’ll be able to switch out which briefcase you’re keeping for yourself if you’d like to. Or, you can hang onto the same one you picked originally."

      "title": "Look at the board to see which amounts are still in play.",
      "content": "Look at the board to see which amounts are still in play. Each time you remove a briefcase from play, the monetary amount gets taken off of the giant board in the center of the room. Keep an eye on this board as you keep playing so you know which amounts you still have left so you can try to guess which amount is in your briefcase. [7] X Research source Keeping an eye on this board is the best way to track your progress as you remove briefcases from play. For example, if you knocked off the $5, the $100, and the $0.01, there’s a pretty good chance that you have a briefcase with a high amount in it. However, if you’ve removed the $1 million, the $50,000, and the $100,000, it may be time to accept the banker’s offer."

This will help you randomize your briefcase numbers completely to make sure you don’t have any amount of bias when you pick the ones to remove from play. [8] X Research source Tony Oriente, the contestant who brought a bingo cage to the show, said it helped him at first, but ultimately, he should have gone with his gut."

If you notice that there are only 1 or 2 high values left on the board, you may want to take the banker’s offer so you can walk away with a good amount of money. The more low values are on the board, the higher the chance is that your briefcase is a low amount. [9] X Research source Remember that the banker is seeing the same information you are, so if they see that there aren’t many high values left, they may offer you a lower amount of money."

The expected value of the game Deal or No Deal, or how much you would win if you played the game an infinite amount of times and averaged out your results, is $131,477. This means that if you leave the game with more than that, you’ll have done better than average. [10] X Research source You can calculate the expected value by adding up all of the potential values and then dividing that number by 26, or the number of briefcases in the game."

Chances are, you may have a high value in your briefcase that’s much better than what the banker has to offer. Games like this are hard to quantify, and even statistics can’t fully predict what amount is in your briefcase. Ultimately, it’s up to chance."

Although it can be tempting to play all 10 rounds in hopes of getting the $1 million, your odds of choosing that amount is less than 4%, or 1/26. Don’t be afraid to “settle” for an amount of less than $1 million. Since you don’t have to pay to sign up for the show, you aren’t losing anything! [11] X Research source"
