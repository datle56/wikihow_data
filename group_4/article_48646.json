If you reach the storage limit, you will no longer be able to send or receive emails. For Google accounts, go to https://one.google.com/storage/management to delete items and free up space or buy more space. For Microsoft accounts, go to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2218097 to see your storage and free up space. For iCloud users, open your iCloud mail and swipe left across a message to delete it. Don't forget to empty your Trash folder when you're done! [1] X Research source"

This might be the culprit if you see that you can send emails, but aren't getting any in return. Go to Settings in your email provider, like Gmail or Outlook, then look at Filters and blocked addresses (the wording may vary slightly). Click Unblock next to any email addresses you want to receive emails from."

You can even make it so new emails (containing certain words) automatically skip the Inbox and are Archived. Return to the Filters and blocked addresses menu in Settings, then look at your current filters. Click Delete next to any filters that are preventing new emails from appearing in your Inbox. You can find these filtered emails in your All Mail folder of Gmail or Outlook. However, the email will not be available if you didn't receive it, like if the sender got a bounce-back email."

There is a setting in most email providers to keep a copy of the original email with the original email address, but you won't get emails if this isn't checked. To see if email forwarding is set up: Go to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP menu setting. This is in different places depending on your email provider, but you can usually find it within Settings. For example, click the gear icon and All Settings in Gmail to find this. Check the options selected in the Forwarding , POP download , and IMAP access sections. You don't want to see that downloaded emails are deleted or archived from the original address."

      "content": "Check your Junk or Spam folder. Different email service providers label these folders differently, but they function the same if you're using Outlook, Gmail, or Apple Mail. An old filter that you forgot exists may automatically sort your incoming mail; on top of that, many of these email services also use algorithms to determine which emails you want to see and what emails you consider spam or trash. For example, if you haven't opened an email from a specific sender and sent it to the trash consistently for a few months, the email provider learns to send those emails directly to spam.

Mobile email apps can be set to \"push,\" which updates your inbox live as new messages come in, or \"fetch,\" which fetches data from the server at set times throughout the day. While Gmail on Android phones tends to push by default, the Mail app on your iPhone may not be configured to do this. [5] X Research source Here's how to check: Go to Settings > Apps > Mail and select Mail Accounts . Tap Fetch New Data . Toggle on Push at the top of the screen. Check your mail accounts to see if they are set to Push or Fetch . Some mail services may not support Push on your iPhone or iPad. If not, they will be set to Fetch . However, you can use the options at the bottom of the menu under the FETCH header to set how often your iPhone fetches new email. Automatically frequently fetches new data from your mail server. You can also set your phone to fetch new data every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or hourly. You can also choose Manually to only fetch data when you request it. Fetching mail less frequently can help prolong your iPhone or iPad's battery life."
