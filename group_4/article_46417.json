      "title": "Do a patch test",
      "content": "Do a patch test 24 hours before using the cream. Hair removal creams can cause redness and irritation, so it’s important to test them before you use them on your skin. Apply a small drop of the cream to the area you want to treat, wait 3 minutes, then wash it off. Wait for 24 hours to see if you have any redness or irritation. [1] X Research source If you do experience any redness, irritation, swelling, or pain, don’t use this cream on the rest of your body. If your skin shows no irritation, continue using the cream. Do not use the cream if the tube it comes in is damaged, since the product may be old or unsafe to use."

      "title": "Wash your skin and pat it dry.",
      "content": "Wash your skin and pat it dry. It’s easiest to use this cream after you’ve gotten out of the shower, since your skin will be smooth and your hair will be soft. Wash your skin thoroughly with soap and warm water, then pat your skin dry with a towel. [2] X Research source Don’t rub or exfoliate your skin before using Veet. Hair removal creams can be slightly irritating, so avoid agitating your skin too much before you use the product."

      "title": "Spread the cream onto your skin with the spatula.",
      "content": "Spread the cream onto your skin with the spatula. Grab your bottle of Veet and apply a quarter-sized amount of cream onto your skin. Use the included spatula in the box to spread the cream evenly over your skin. You can add more cream if it doesn’t fully cover the hair that you’re trying to remove. [3] X Research source You can use Veet hair removal cream on your legs, arms, underarms, and bikini area. Do not use the cream on your face, head, breasts, or genitals, as it could cause severe irritation. If you have sensitive skin, use Veet’s sensitive skin line . It’s less irritating and is gentle on sensitive, delicate skin. Don't apply the cream to moles, scars, spotty, irritated or sunburnt skin. Avoid contact with skin that has been shaved in the last 72 hours."

      "title": "Leave the cream on for 3 to 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Leave the cream on for 3 to 5 minutes. Hair removal creams break down the hair near the follicle, causing the hair to fall off and out of your skin. Set a timer for 3 to 5 minutes, and wait for the cream to do its magic. [4] X Research source Leaving the cream on too long can cause irritation, so keep a close eye on the time. If you experience any stinging or tingling during use, remove the cream immediately and rinse thoroughly with water. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Scrape the cream away gently with the spatula. Grab the spatula again and carefully scrape the cream off of your skin, going against the direction that your hair grows. You’ll notice that most of your hair glides right off with the cream, which means the product worked. [6] X Research source Use a soft sponge or washcloth to remove the cream if the spatula is too abrasive."

[8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source If a cotton towel is too rough, try a microfiber towel instead. Always wait 72 hours between cream applications. This will reduce irritation and inflammation. [9] X Research source If your skin feels dry or itchy, apply a fragrance-free moisturizer to the area.

      "title": "Exfoliate your skin 24 hours before waxing.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your skin 24 hours before waxing. Exfoliating helps remove dead skin cells for a smooth, even wax with less irritation. Use a chemical exfoliant or a physical exfoliant on the area you want to wax, then rinse your skin and pat it dry. [11] X Research source Chemical exfoliants are better for sensitive areas, like your bikini area. You can use physical exfoliants on areas like your legs or your arms. If you’ve just shaved your skin, don’t wax immediately. Ideally, wait until your hair is 2 to 5 mm long so the wax can adhere to it."
