You may, for example, come across books with more than one author or that contain specific essays or short stories you want to reference. You may also come across articles published in electronic journals rather than in print. Below are some tips to guide you through these special circumstances. If a source has more than one author : Cite the last and first names of the first credited author like a normal citation, followed by a comma and the words \"et al.\" (a Latin phrase meaning \"and others\"). If a source is part of an anthology : Write the title of the essay or short story you're referencing in quotation marks, followed by a period. Then write the name of the anthology in italics. If a source is an electronic article : Add the name of the database where you found the article (in italics) and the URL after the page numbers, followed by the date you accessed it. If there are no page numbers, leave them out. Example : McElroy, John Harmon. “The Kindred Artist; or, the Case of the Black Cat.” Studies in American Humor , vol. 3, no. 2, 1976, pp. 103–17.

A great example of how a bibliography supports your claims is an academic essay . When you take on an academic essay assignment in college, your professor will require you to develop a thesis (i.e., a primary claim or topic that your paper will focus on) and make arguments to support it. One of the ways they'll expect you to support your thesis is to cite sources that have already made the same or similar claims."
