[1] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source You may still have strep throat even if you are only experiencing moderate throat pain, but a mild sore throat that is easily remedied or soothed is not likely to be caused by strep. The soreness should not be dependent on anything such as talking or swallowing. Soreness that can be dulled with pain medication or partially soothed with cold liquid and food might still be related to strep throat, but it is usually quite difficult to rid yourself of the soreness completely without prescription medication."

This occurs as a result of the reproduction of the bacteria. While potent, the exact smell can be difficult to describe. Some state that it smells like metal or hospitals, while others compare it to rotten meat. Regardless of the exact odor, \"strep breath\" will smell stronger and worse than normal bad breath. Due to the somewhat subjective nature of “bad breath,” this is not really a way to diagnose strep throat, but rather a commonly seen association. [3] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.).

[4] X Research source While lymph nodes are located in various parts of your body, the first nodes to swell are usually those that are nearest to the source of infection. In the case of strep throat, the lymph nodes in and around your throat will be the ones to swell. Use your fingertips to gently feel the area directly in front of your ear. Move your fingertips in a circular motion behind your ear. Also check the area of your throat just below the chin. The most common site of lymph node swelling with strep throat is under your jaw, about midway between your chin and your ear. Move your fingertips back and up toward the ear, then down the side of the neck below the ear. Finish by checking the collarbone and repeating on both sides. If you can feel notable swelling or bulging in any of these areas, your lymph nodes might be swollen due to strep. [5] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.).

Scarlet fever usually surfaces 12 to 48 hours after your first strep throat symptoms emerge. The rash usually begins around the neck before developing and spreading over the chest. It can also spread to the abdomen and groin areas. In rare cases, it may appear on the back, arms, legs, or face. When treated with antibiotics, scarlet fever generally clears up quickly.

This means that you will not experience a cough, runny nose, stuffy nose, or red, itchy eyes. Additionally, while strep throat can cause stomach pain, it does not usually cause diarrhea."

However, they may not have the usual symptoms as older children and adults. They may have a fever, runny nose, or cough as well as a decreased appetite.

Immunocompromised individuals, those with the decreased ability to fight off infection, may be more at risk. Other infections or illnesses can also increase the chances that you have strep. Your immune system may be compromised simply due to fatigue. States of extreme exertion or exercise (such as running a marathon) can also tax your body. As your body focuses on recovery, it’s ability to fight infection may be impeded. Simply put, an exhausted body is focused on recovery and may not be able to defend itself as efficiently. Smoking can cause damage to your protective mucosa in the mouth and allow for easier colonization of bacteria. Oral Sex can expose your oral cavity to be more directly exposed to bacteria.

For adults, your doctor may use what is known as a Modified Centor Clinical Prediction Rule in order to empirically indicate how likely it is that you have a group A Streptococcal infection. [20] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source This is simply a list of criteria that the doctor checks for to determine whether (and how) you should be treated for strep throat.

If you score 3-4 points, then there is a positive predictive value (PPV) of roughly 80% that you have a group A streptococcal infection. Basically, you are considered positive for strep.

If the results of your rapid strep test are negative but you still exhibit other strep throat symptoms, the doctor may want to administer a longer test known as a throat culture. A throat culture will attempt to colonize bacteria outside of your throat in a lab. As the bacteria colony collected from your throat grows, it will become easier to detect larger amounts of group A streptococcus bacteria. Your doctor will likely use any combination of the Centor criteria, rapid strep test, and throat culture, depending on his or her clinical judgment. [24] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source While rapid strep tests alone are usually enough to determine whether or not a strep infection is present, false-negatives have been known to occur. Throat cultures, by comparison, are more accurate. A throat culture is not needed if the rapid strep test comes back positive, as the rapid strep test directly tests for antigens to the bacteria and will only test positive if a threshold level of bacteria are present. This would indicate immediate treatment with antibiotics. [25] X Research source Domino, F. (n.d.). The 5-minute clinical consult standard 2015 (23rd ed.).

Be sure to take your antibiotics for the fully prescribed time, even if you feel better before you finish the full course. Penicillin, amoxicillin, cephalosporins, and azithromycin are all common antibiotics that can be used to treat an infection. Penicillin is used often and effectively in the treatment of strep throat. However, some individuals may have allergic reactions to this medication. You should let your doctor know if you are aware of this possible side effect. Amoxicillin is another drug of choice for strep throat with good results. It is similar to penicillin in effectiveness and can withstand the gastric acid in your stomach better before being absorbed into your system. Additionally, it has a broader activity spectrum than penicillin.
