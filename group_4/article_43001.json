      "content": "Reflect on your feelings. When you find out that you are pregnant, it is normal to go through a wide range of emotions. You might be excited, scared, surprised, or anxious. Before you share the news with your boyfriend, take some time to consider your own feelings. [1] X Research source Once you have gotten over the initial shock, ask yourself some questions. For example, \"How do I feel about this pregnancy?\" You can also say, \"How will this change my life? How will it change my boyfriend's life?\" Think about what kind of reaction you expect.

[2] X Research source If this pregnancy was unplanned, you might be somewhat nervous to tell your boyfriend. That is normal and understandable. Spend some time thinking about your goals for the conversation. For example, are you only looking for emotional support? Or are you also seeking financial support? Once you've clarified your goals, spend some time planning the conversation. This is important, so it's a good idea to jot down some notes to have with you. This will help you to remember what you want to say. Take some time to practice. For example, look in the mirror and say, \"John, I am pregnant. I know this is a surprise, but I'm very happy about the news.\" Rehearsing what you want to say can help you feel more calm and confident. It can also help you sort out your own feelings."

If your boyfriend just does not want a baby and you do, you need to express your feelings. You can say something like, \"I understand your feelings. But I want this baby and the choice is ultimately mine. Please know that the door is open to continue this conversation.\" Remember that your hormones can cause you to be very emotional when you are pregnant. Make sure to give yourself the time and space you need to deal with your feelings. If you do not initially get the reaction that you want, you will likely be frustrated.
