      "title": "Choose a cooler with ventilation.",
      "content": "Choose a cooler with ventilation. Dry ice is safe to use in most coolers as long as there's a way to ventilate them. Make sure the cooler has a lid that doesn't seal completely shut or a drainage cap (which is usually located near the bottom of the cooler). If you need a small cooler or just want to use the dry ice for a day, choose a styrofoam cooler or urethane-insulated box . To keep the dry ice for longer, use a large roto-molded or plastic cooler . [1] X Research source If you're using a urethane-insulated box, buy one that's at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick. Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide. As it “melts” (which is called sublimation), it turns back into carbon dioxide gas. Warning : It’s important to choose a cooler with ventilation because if carbon dioxide gets trapped inside a container, it can potentially explode. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Cover the bottom of the cooler with styrofoam or cardboard. If you aren't using a styrofoam cooler, protect the plastic interior of your cooler from the extreme cold of the dry ice. Simply cut pieces of styrofoam or cardboard and lay them on the bottom of the cooler. [3] X Research source Place styrofoam or cardboard along the sides of the cooler if the dry will touch the walls of the cooler, too."

      "content": "Put on insulated gloves and wrap the dry ice in newspaper. To make the dry ice last longer, wrap the blocks of dry ice in newspaper while wearing insulated gloves. The newspaper insulates the ice and helps slow down how quickly it evaporates. It also helps prevent you from accidentally touching the dry ice with your bare hands. [4] X Research source If you’re using small chunks of dry ice, you may not be able to wrap them in newspaper. Instead, surround the chunks with newspaper to slow evaporation."

      "title": "Add the dry ice and some insulation, then arrange the food on top.",
      "content": "Add the dry ice and some insulation, then arrange the food on top. To keep food and drinks cold, place the wrapped dry ice on the bottom of the cooler. Then, set a piece of cardboard on top or add a layer of newspaper or regular ice. Simply arrange the food or drinks on top of the cardboard, newspaper, or regular ice. [5] X Research source Food and drinks will freeze if they touch the dry ice directly . The cardboard, newspaper, or regular ice acts as a barrier to keep the items cold instead of frozen. As a plus, it also prevents you from accidentally touching the dry ice. Tip : Cut a hole about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide in the cardboard so the gas is better able to escape as the dry ice evaporates. When you need to get the food or drinks, simply open the cooler and remove the items."

      "title": "Put the dry ice on top of food and drinks to freeze them, if you prefer.",
      "content": "Put the dry ice on top of food and drinks to freeze them, if you prefer. If you want to use the cooler as a portable freezer, place the items you want to freeze at the bottom of the cooler. For example, place meat from a hunting trip in storage bags at the bottom of the cooler. Then, wrap the dry ice in newspaper and set it directly on top of the food to get it to freeze quickly. [6] X Research source Avoid putting the dry ice on top if you plan on getting in and out of the cooler often since it can be difficult to move the dry ice out of the way."

      "title": "Pack the gaps with newspaper.",
      "content": "Pack the gaps with newspaper. To help the dry ice last longer, take a few sheets of newspaper and wad them into loose balls. Place the newspaper between the chunks of dry ice or wherever there are any gaps. This helps insulate the dry ice, as extra space can make it evaporate faster."

      "title": "Crack open the lid or loosen the drainage cap on the cooler.",
      "content": "Crack open the lid or loosen the drainage cap on the cooler. As the dry ice evaporates, gas can build up within the cooler. To prevent damage to the cooler, leave the lid slightly cracked (if you're using styrofoam or the urethane box). If you're using a plastic or roto-molded cooler, unscrew the drainage cap a little. [7] X Research source If the gas has no way to escape, pressure can build up within the cooler and weaken the plastic or even cause the cooler to explode."

      "title": "Get 10-20 lbs (4.5-9 kg) of dry ice for every 24 hours of cooling you need.",
      "content": "Get 10-20 lbs (4.5-9 kg) of dry ice for every 24 hours of cooling you need. To determine how much dry ice you need, first decide how long you'll need the dry ice in the cooler. For every 24 hours of storage you need, get 10 to 20 lbs (4.5 to 9 kg) of dry ice. Then, consider how much dry ice fits inside your cooler along with the items you want to store. For example, a 40 to 60-quart (37 to 56-liter) cooler can usually hold 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of dry ice. [8] X Research source The type of food in your cooler also determines how much dry ice you need. For instance, frozen items may require more dry ice than refrigerated items. In general, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60-quart (4.7, 9.4, 18.9, 37.8, 56.8 L) coolers need 5 to 10 lbs (2.3-4.5 kg) of dry ice to last 24 hours. For each extra day of cooling you need, add 1.5 to 2x as much dry ice. Most 100 quart (94.6 L) coolers need 10 to 15 lbs (4.5-6.8 kg) of ice for 24 hours. You can find dry ice at most grocery stores. Or, order it online."

      "title": "Buy blocks of dry ice to help keep the cooler cold for longer.",
      "content": "Buy blocks of dry ice to help keep the cooler cold for longer. Most dry ice is available to buy in large blocks or pellets. Blocks typically last longer and evaporate more slowly than small pieces or pellets of dry ice. Other ways to help keep your cooler cold include : Placing it in a shaded location out of direct sunlight. Avoiding opening it frequently to keep the ice from evaporating. Covering the outside with aluminum foil to help redirect light and heat."

      "title": "Wear gloves to protect your hands when you handle the dry ice.",
      "content": "Wear gloves to protect your hands when you handle the dry ice. Because dry ice reaches extremely cold temperatures (around -109° F or -78° C), it can burn bare skin and even cause frostbite. Always wear thick, insulated gloves when picking up the dry ice or grabbing items out of the cooler. [9] X Research source Alternatively, use tongs or thick towels to move dry ice. If other people are opening the cooler to get items out, ask them to wear gloves and inform them not to touch the dry ice. If you need to break apart the dry ice, wear safety goggles and a face shield to protect your eyes and face. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Transport and store the cooler in a well-ventilated area.",
      "content": "Transport and store the cooler in a well-ventilated area. In closed spaces, carbon dioxide can be toxic to breathe in. If you’re traveling with the cooler, open the windows in your vehicle. Then, store the dry ice outside if possible. If not, place the cooler in a large, open, and well-ventilated room with the windows open. [11] X Research source Always keep the cooler’s lid slightly cracked or the drainage cap open to allow the carbon dioxide to escape as it evaporates. Never store dry ice in a tight, closed area, as the buildup of carbon dioxide can be dangerous."

      "title": "Let the dry ice evaporate in a ventilated area when you’re done with it.",
      "content": "Let the dry ice evaporate in a ventilated area when you’re done with it. To dispose of dry ice , place the cooler outside, open the lid, and unwrap the newspaper from the dry ice. The dry ice will evaporate on its own over several hours or days, depending on how warm it is outside. [12] X Research source Never pour dry ice down the sink or toilet, as the extremely cold temperatures can damage the plumbing. Do not dispose of dry ice in a garbage can or other container, as dangerous amounts of carbon dioxide can build up inside. If you have small children or pets around, keep them away from the cooler. Never leave the dry ice unattended. If you can't leave the dry ice outside, set it on a solid surface, such as a wooden cutting board, in an open, well-ventilated room. Then, open the windows in the room to keep the area ventilated."
