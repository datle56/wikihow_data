      "content": "Go get your blood tested to see what you may need to treat. According to the proponents of overmethylation, you will have high levels of copper in your blood, low levels of zinc, high levels of estrogen, or a high homocysteine levels if you’re overmethylated. The treatment for these deficiencies is going to be unique depending on which hormones or nutrients are high/low, so get a blood test and talk to your doctor to see what you can do to fix this problem if there is one. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Some people suggest that folate, zinc, vitamin C or vitamin B supplements will help with overmethylation, but there’s no way to know which one you’ll need to take without the blood test. On top of that, there may be some underlying condition causing your deficiency if you have one, so don’t do anything here without seeing a doctor first!

Your body definitely goes through methylation, but as a medical diagnosis there isn’t much evidence that you’ll need to treat or change your methylation. [3] X Research source Scientists working in the field of epigenetics are interested in methylation for gene therapy and mutation research purposes. [4] X Research source But methylation just describes the process of methyl groups being added to or removed from DNA; it may not be a recognized condition you can treat. [5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Your body goes through methylation millions of times a day. It’s possible for a gene to be overmethylated one minute, and undermethylated the other. [6] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source DNA methylation has definitely been implicated in certain mood disorders and conditions, but it’s probably not a causal relationship. In other words, while people with depression often have low levels of methylation, it’s not clear if those methylation levels are causing the depression or the other way around.

      "content": "There are hundreds of symptoms according to some holistic healers. Due to the fact that methylation occurs everywhere in your body thousands of times a day, people have pinned a wide array of symptoms on overmethylation. While some are likely unrelated to methylation, potential symptoms include: [8] X Research source Depression, anxiety, self-harm, low motivation, and low sex drive. Trouble sleeping, tinnitus, dry eyes or mouth, nervous legs, and hyperactivity. Adverse reactions to SSRIs, SAMe, estrogen, or antihistamines. An absence of seasonal allergies, intense belief in religion, musical ability, or a tendency to be overweight."

If you smoke, eat a poor diet, don’t sleep, or expose yourself to excess stress, it may change the way your body processes nutrients. Living a healthy lifestyle may help your body process information from your DNA more efficiently!

This is why scientists are so interested in studying methylation—so they can learn how to turn genes on or off!
