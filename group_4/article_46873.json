The directions given here are for a basic incubator that is affordable for most hobbyists. [1] X Research source Since there are different types of incubators, it's important to have the correct directions for your specific incubator. [2] X Trustworthy Source Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition Go to source Be aware that cheaper incubators will have only manual controls. This means that you will need to diligently monitor temperature, turning, and humidity many times a day. Pricier models have automatic controls for these processes, which require you to do a little less - though still daily - monitoring. If the incubator did not come with written instructions, look for the serial number on the incubator and the manufacturer's name. Check the manufacturer's website for directions or contact the company's customer service department by phone or email to obtain directions."

Then wipe down all surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge dipped in a diluted bleach solution (mix 20 drops of household bleach in 1 quart of water.) Use gloves to protect your hands from the bleach and wring the cloth or sponge out before wiping down the incubator. Allow the incubator to air dry thoroughly before plugging it in for use. [3] X Research source This cleaning step is particularly necessary if you bought the incubator second-hand or if you had it stored away somewhere, collecting dust. Keep in mind that sanitation is highly important. Diseases can be transmitted through the eggshell to the developing embryo."

[6] X Research source Make sure to adjust the incubator's thermometer so that it will measure the temperature around where the center of an egg will reach in the incubator. Adjust the heat source until the temperature reads between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (37.2 and 38.9 degrees Celsius). [7] X Research source Getting the correct incubator temperature is very important. Low temperatures can keep the embryos from developing, while overly high temperatures can kill the embryos and cause abnormalities. [8] X Research source"

[10] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Don't attempt to incubate eggs you bought from a supermarket. The eggs sold in stores are infertile and will not hatch. Locate hatcheries or farmers in your area who sell eggs for hatching. You will need to get eggs that are produced by hens in a flock with a male bird, or else the eggs may not be fertile. Contact your local agricultural extension office if you have difficulty finding an egg source. The office may have recommendations for local poultry farmers. Consider how many eggs you want to incubate. Note that it is very rare for all of the incubated eggs to hatch and that certain species have higher viability than others. You should expect about 50-75% of the fertile eggs will hatch, although it possible that this could be higher. [11] X Research source Store eggs in cartons at 40 to 70 degrees F (4.5 to 21.1 degrees C) until ready to incubate. Rotate the eggs daily by propping up different ends of the carton each day or carefully turning over the carton."

[17] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Turn eggs an odd number of times each day. This way, the symbol on the eggs will change every day after you turn the eggs, making it easy to see whether or not you've turned the eggs yet for that day. As you do your daily turns, check to see if any eggs are cracked or spoiled. Remove these promptly and dispose of them in the garbage. Move eggs around to different positions in the incubator. Stop turning the eggs during the last three days of incubation, as, at this point, the eggs will soon hatch and turning is no longer necessary."

Humidity should be around 45 to 50 percent throughout incubation, except during the last three days when you will want to raise it to 65 percent. You may need higher or lower humidity levels depending on the type of eggs you wish to hatch. Consult your hatchery or the available literature on hatching your particular species of bird. [18] X Research source Measure the humidity level in the incubator. Using a wet bulb thermometer or hygrometer, take a reading of the humidity level. Be sure as well to record the temperature in the incubator using a dry bulb thermometer. To find the relative temperature between the wet bulb and dry bulb temperature readings, consult a psychrometric chart online or in a book. Replenish the water in the water pan regularly. Filling up the pan helps maintain the desired level of humidity. If the water depletes, the humidity level will drop too low. [19] X Research source Always add warm water.
