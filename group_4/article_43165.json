      "content": "Take note of any calluses or scars on their hands and fingers. When you vomit, stomach acid comes up with the food.

      "content": "Pay attention to how they smell. One common way of purging is to induce vomiting. This is a difficult smell to mask, and if you are paying attention you might notice it. If a person smells like vomit once, they may simply be sick (and maybe even embarrassed of it). If you smell vomit on a person frequently, it is likely that this could be a way of purging."

      "title": "Watch for fluctuations in weight.",
      "content": "Watch for fluctuations in weight. Purging is not an effective way to eliminate calories from your body (which is usually the goal), and thus a person with bulimia will not usually be underweight. Most people with this disorder are slightly overweight or are normal weight. It is common, however, for someone battling bulimia to fluctuate frequently in weight (e.g., dropping ten pounds this month, then gaining fifteen next month, then dropping seventeen shortly after).

      "title": "Take note of where they go after a meal.",
      "content": "Take note of where they go after a meal. If someone is binging and purging, they will often excuse themselves from the table before anyone else. They will also go to purge if they feel that they have eaten too much or eaten the wrong foods. This often means they will go to the restroom, but not always. You should pay close attention to after meal habits."

      "title": "Pay attention to bathroom habits.",
      "content": "Pay attention to bathroom habits. It is common for someone purging in the bathroom to run water to cover up the sounds of purging.

      "content": "Notice any signs of withdrawing. When someone is combatting bulimia, there is an underlying component of guilt and low self-esteem.

      "content": "Check for a consistent eating schedule. It is common for someone with bulimia to have trouble sticking to a meal schedule. They may skip meals and they eat large portions, stopping only when they are physically uncomfortable. Sometimes clear cycles of overeating and then fasting will be clear.

      "content": "Listen for any signs of obsessions around body image. These obsessions can be elusive and well hidden under the guise of “being concerned about health.” Common body image obsessions include picky eating, calorie counting and crash diets, excessive exercise habits, constantly worrying over food and weight, and obsessing over the way they look. While it is healthy to take care of one’s self, obsessing over “health” or “looks” can be a sign of bulimia."

      "title": "Pay attention to defensive behaviors.",
      "content": "Pay attention to defensive behaviors. If someone you care about is hiding bulimia, they do not want you to find out. The guilt and shame that fuels the binging and purging cycles also makes the thought of being caught unbearable for most. If you bring up food or eating habits, it is likely that someone struggling with bulimia will become irrationally defensive."

      "content": "Note the excessive use of breath fresheners. If a person is purging by inducing vomiting, they will likely use minty breath fresheners (e.g., gum, mouthwash, or mints) to cover their breath. If you are noticing other signs of bulimia, or have a strong suspicion of bulimia, this is another sign to watch for. Remember that just having gum is not a cause for suspicion."

      "content": "Watch for food to go missing. For someone with bulimia, eating is often something to be ashamed of. It is common for someone with bulimia to sneak or steal food and eat it in secrecy. If large amounts of food go missing often, this deserves your attention."

      "title": "Monitor the trash or recycling.",
      "content": "Monitor the trash or recycling. If someone is eating in secrecy, they will likely dispose of the evidence. Even if you do not notice food missing, large quantities of wrappers or food containers being thrown away might suggest binging.

Some people choose to vomit in the sink, and others find the shower to be very convenient because the water covers up the sound of purging.
