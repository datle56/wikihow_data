Maybe you would have reacted in a similar way if you were in their shoes. You can practice empathy by actively listening to others, opening up to others, withholding judgment, and volunteering.

However, prioritize listening to what the other person is saying (rather than thinking about what you’ll say next).

[5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Think about the effects the grudge has had on you. Do you find yourself not trusting other people? Do you find yourself acting irritable and angry more often? Are you experiencing physical issues like stomach pains or headaches? Have you changed your routines as a result of the offense? After you consider the grudge's effects on you, ask yourself who it is helping for you to be experiencing all of that. Does it tell the offender anything? Is the offender bothered by it? Are you expecting to \"get back\" at the person somehow? How effective is the grudge? Is it just hurting you?"

Telling the truth about your feelings to yourself will help you to acknowledge the hurt you feel. Don't deny the event, and go over the facts of what occurred. Was the situation really a big deal? If not, try to let go of it. If so, you should talk about it with the offender. When you evaluate the situation, step back and consider if this grudge is worth your time to pursue or to continue dwelling on. Sometimes you can let go of the grudge without discussing the situation with the offender. Ask yourself if holding the grudge is about you or them. Extend compassion to whatever caused the wound, and let it go. After you understand exactly what took place and how you feel, find commonalities as to why your offender may have acted the way they did. Once you realize that you got in a fight with your friend because she just lost her job, it will be easier to let go of your hard feelings. [6] X Research source"

By revisiting the grudge and feelings of resentment, you are traumatizing yourself over and over each time you bring it to mind. Avoid this by letting go of the grudge out of love and respect to yourself, because you deserve to be happy. Remind yourself that you only have control over your response to a situation, so you can't do anything about how the other person feels. Reinforce these boundaries in your mind so that you don't feel responsible for someone else's feelings. To give up your grudge, you have to commit to forgiving the other person, starting with letting go of the negative emotions you attached to the situation.

When you do have expectations for a situation, tell the other person what they are so that they know what they need to do to satisfy those expectations. People who fail to tell the other person what they want are setting themselves up for disappointment because the other person cannot read their mind. When you don't have expectations, you are less likely to get upset if someone doesn't meet them, and therefore you are less likely to hold a grudge.

If you can't date someone after they cheated on you, break up with them out of respect for yourself. Do something nice for yourself, like a relaxing bath or a walk in your favorite park.
