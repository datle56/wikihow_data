      "content": "Create a good study space . The first step to studying harder is to create a study space for yourself. Studying in the same space each day is effective because your mind will learn to associate a particular space with work. It'll be easier to get into the flow of studying when entering your study space. Students who spend time struggling to find a space to study often waste valuable time. Having a space you go every day to study is helpful. [1] X Research source Choose a study space that is free of distractions. Find a space away from television and other noises. You should not study in bed or on the couch. Choose a place with a desk where you can sit upright to work. [2] X Research source Make sure the space is set up for what you need. If you need to prepare a class project with lots of small pieces that must be arranged, a large, uncluttered space with a worktable will be best. If you just need to read your textbook, a cozy chair and a cup of tea may be just fine. The best study space for you will depend in part on your learning style. For example, if you're a visual learner, working in a bright, colorful space might be helpful. [3] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020.

Having a regular study sessions will help you avoid procrastination and stick to your goals as a students. You should start planning your study schedule as you get your course syllabus -- that way, nothing will sneak up on you. You should strive to prioritize studying. Place study time ahead of extracurricular or social activities. Try to study shortly after class or school each day. [4] X Research source Schedule study sessions at roughly the same time each day. Having a regular schedule can help you stick to studying on a regular basis. Put these sessions into your calendar, just as you would a dentist appointment or soccer practice. [5] X Research source Start slow. At first, keep your study sessions between 30 and 50 minutes. After you've gotten used to this duration, push yourself to study for longer periods. Stop to take short breaks occasionally. [6] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020. Studying for hours on end can cause stress. Take 10 minute breaks as you study. [7] X Research source Don't go longer than 2 hours without a break."

      "content": "Have specific goals for each study schedule. Studying without direction is not an effective way to learn and retain information. Go into each study session with specific goals in mind to try and make the most out of your study session. Keep your overall academic goal in mind. Branching off of that goal, break it down into manageable chunks and focus on each chunk per session. [8] X Research source For example, say you have to memorize 100 vocabulary words for your Spanish final. Aim to memorize 20 words per session over the course of 5 study sessions. Make sure to review old words at the beginning of each new study session to make sure the information stays fresh in your mind."

      "content": "Test yourself. A vital part of studying is repetition. Test yourself on difficult material during each study session. Make flashcards with vocabulary words, dates, and other facts. Use these to test your knowledge. If you have a math exam, do practice tests in your math book. If your teacher or professor provides practice exams, take as many as possible. Try to make your own practice tests. Review the types of question your teacher asked on quizzes and try to replicate them in your own words. Make a test for yourself, containing 10 to 20 questions, and then complete the test. If your teacher provides practice tests to help you study, take them home and do them on your own time. Start well ahead of time and bring in your practice test to show your teacher. Ask her something like, \"I've gone through my notes and made this practice exam to help me study for the test next week. Could you tell me if it's on the right track?\" Your teacher isn't likely to tell you whether or not specific things will be on the test, but she will probably be happy to tell you whether you're studying the right areas. And your hard work and preparation are sure to impress!"

It's easy to get distracted if you're working with groups of people. A schedule can help you stay on task. [11] X Research source Work with people who you know are hard workers. Even the best planned study groups can fall apart if you choose to work with people who are distracting and procrastinate."

Take breaks every hour or so to stretch your legs, watch television, surf the internet, or do some light reading. Provide rewards at the end of study sessions to motivate yourself to work harder. For example, if you study 3 days in a row treat yourself by ordering take out. [13] X Expert Source Alexander Ruiz, M.Ed. Educational Consultant Expert Interview. 18 June 2020."

They can be extremely helpful when it comes to smart studying. [19] X Research source Many people remember subjects by stringing words together to form sentences, the first letter of each word signifying part of a topic that requires memorization. For example, the sentence \"Kings play cards on fat green stools\" can be used to help remember the taxonomy ranking for animals: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species. Make sure you use mnemonic devices that are easy to remember. If you're creating your own mnemonic device, pick words and sentences that have personal meaning to you and that you will easily remember later."
