      "title": "Identify any obviously racist behavior in your life.",
      "content": "Identify any obviously racist behavior in your life. People who openly embrace the idea that their race is superior to others don't need to ask whether they're racist—they are. While most people have moved past these types of beliefs, they do still persist. Actively reject any behavior that's overtly racist, including: [1] X Research source Using racist slurs and other hurtful or hateful language. Displaying symbols that people of color might find hurtful, like swastikas, blackface, or Confederate memorabilia. Believing that people of different races should stay segregated. Defending other people's racist remarks and ideology. Assuming all people of a certain race must act the same way. Dismissing or ignoring people of color and their contributions."

      "title": "Check whether you frequently need to defend yourself as not racist.",
      "content": "Check whether you frequently need to defend yourself as not racist. If other people seem to always accuse you of saying or doing racist things, there's a good chance that you need to make some changes. Instead of getting defensive and insisting you aren't racist, try to be open to hearing constructive criticism so you can learn and grow. [2] X Research source For instance, you are probably showing some racial biases if you often catch yourself saying things like, \"I'm not racist, but...\" or \"I have plenty of black friends.\""

      "title": "Examine whether you feel comfortable speaking up when others are racist.",
      "content": "Examine whether you feel comfortable speaking up when others are racist. Even if you're not actively acting in a racist way yourself, you may be helping to perpetuate racism if you don't speak out when you see it. That doesn't mean you have to confront every racist meme you see on social media, but it does mean you should make your position clear when it's appropriate. [3] X Research source For instance, if you're in a meeting and someone dismisses an idea by one of your black coworkers, you might say something like, \"I thought Chris made a really good point just now. Can we circle back to that?\" If people are comfortable saying racist things around you, then you're not being antiracist around them."
    },
    {
      "title": "Question whether you react differently around people of color.",
      "content": "Question whether you react differently around people of color. When you're out and about and you come across someone of a different race, do you ever find yourself feeling nervous? If so, you've probably internalized the idea that people of color are often dangerous criminals. While you should always stay safe by paying attention to your surroundings, you shouldn't treat people of color like they're any more of a danger to you than anyone else. [4] X Research source For instance, if you feel tense or speed up when you see a black person walking toward you on the street, that's an unconscious form of racism. A more subtle form of racism might be acting overly friendly toward people of color in an effort to be perceived as less racist."

      "title": "Think about whether you're less likely to support business owners of color.",
      "content": "Think about whether you're less likely to support business owners of color. You might not realize it, but unconscious biases could be leading you to choose businesses that are run by people who look like you. You might also have a preference for movies, books, and music made by people of your own race. [5] X Research source By opening supporting businesses run by people of color, you're helping to create a society where everyone has a fair chance at success. Reading books, listening to music, and watching movies made by people of color can help open your mind to the reality of their experiences. That can help you shake off even more of your unconscious prejudices."

    {
      "title": "Pay attention to whether you avoid the subject of race entirely.",
      "content": "Pay attention to whether you avoid the subject of race entirely. Sometimes it can be easy to say things like, \"I don't see color,\" as a way to shut down conversations about racism. However, when you do that, you aren't actually celebrating the diversity all around you, and you may not be listening when a person of color is trying to tell you about their experiences. [6] X Research source Instead, be open to engaging in productive conversations about race."
    },
    {
      "title": "Notice whether you frequently call attention to another person's race.",
      "content": "Notice whether you frequently call attention to another person's race. While you shouldn't ignore the topic of race entirely, you should also avoid being overly focused on it. If you constantly bring up a person's ethnic background, you'll make them feel like all you can see is how they're different from you. Instead, try to focus on things that you have in common. [7] X Research source For instance, instead of saying, \"Can I touch your hair?\" you might say, \"Hey, you look great today. I brought us coffee.\" Don't say, \"I'm sorry, I can't pronounce your name, can I just call you J?\" Instead, practice saying their name until you get it right. Also, don't say things like, \"Hey I have a black friend from college, you guys should totally meet.\" Just because two people have the same color skin doesn't mean they'll automatically be friends."

      "title": "Understand how your words and actions could be interpreted.",
      "content": "Understand how your words and actions could be interpreted. Being an antiracist goes a lot deeper than just avoiding obvious acts of racism—you have to think about how you might be perceived by others. Regardless of your intention, if you make someone else feel less-than, marginalized, or stereotyped, that's a racist action. [8] X Research source However, don't expect people of color to point out every racist thing that you say or do. People of color have to face subtle forms of racism all the time, and they're not responsible for educating everyone they come into contact with. Remember, overcoming racism is a lifelong process, so continuously examine your actions, thoughts, and beliefs about race."

      "title": "Recognize that most people hold unconscious biases about race.",
      "content": "Recognize that most people hold unconscious biases about race. You don't just develop biases and stereotypes overnight. Images and messages from the media, politicians and even friends and family have undoubtedly shaped your beliefs about race. This is true for everyone. It doesn't necessarily make you a bad person, but you first have to understand that those beliefs are there if you want to overcome them. [9] X Research source You can have these beliefs even if you have friends who are different races or you support causes like Black Lives Matter. [10] X Research source For instance, you may have internalized the idea that people of color are more likely to be career criminals or do drugs. You might even support that position with statistics. However, that doesn't address the political and social factors that might influence those statistics, like the fact that people of color are more likely to be charged with a crime than a white person, even for the same offence. They often receive harsher sentences for the same crimes, as well. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Reflect on how your biases impact your views on race.",
      "content": "Reflect on how your biases impact your views on race. While other people may be able to point out if you're acting or speaking in a racist way, they can't actually tell you what your thoughts are. The only way to determine if you're holding on to racial biases is to ask yourself the hard questions, such as: [12] X Research source \"Am I surprised when a person of color is especially well-spoken or intelligent?\" \"Do I make assumptions about a person's interests or athletic ability based on the color of their skin?\" \"Would I be less likely to hire a person of color, even if they were equally as qualified as (or more qualified than) a white person?\" \"Do I care more about being antiracist or just not being seen by others as a racist?\" \"Do I perceive someone who has natural hair as being less polished or professional?\" \"Do I feel uncomfortable when I see someone wearing ethnic or religious clothing, like a head covering or a tribal print?\""

      "title": "Learn to identify those biases as they arise.",
      "content": "Learn to identify those biases as they arise. It's almost impossible to sit down all at once and figure out every bias that you have about race. Instead, make an effort to evaluate your thoughts about race as you have them. Question whether you're making assumptions about a person just based on their race—whether those assumptions are negative or not, they can still be hurtful. [13] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source For instance, if you automatically assume that all people of a certain race are good students, it can put a lot of pressure on a student from that race who's struggling in school. They might even have a hard time being taken seriously if they reach out for help."

    {
      "title": "Avoid blaming people of color for being oppressed.",
      "content": "Avoid blaming people of color for being oppressed. When you hear that people of color are struggling, do you automatically wonder what they've done wrong? Similarly, do you blame their culture, appearance, or lifestyle? These are subtle forms of racism, so remember to challenge these beliefs. [14] X Research source For instance, you might find yourself thinking something like, \"I would never give my child such an unusual name. They'll never succeed in life that way.\" You might also criticize someone's speech, clothing, or where they live."

    {
      "title": "Be open to receiving constructive criticism.",
      "content": "Be open to receiving constructive criticism. If someone points out that something you did or said seems racist, don't shut down or get defensive. Instead, look at it as an opportunity to grow. Overcoming these types of biases can take a long time, so it's okay if you don't get it right away. Just keep trying, and learn to check in with yourself to ensure you're acting in a way that's sensitive and fair to people of color. [15] X Research source Remember, having unconscious racist biases doesn't mean you're automatically a bad person, and it doesn't mean that your conscious antiracist thoughts 'don't count.' You're the sum of all of your parts, and identifying areas where you can grow just means you're committed to being part of social change."
