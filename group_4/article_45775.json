      "content": "Ask the content owner for permission. Generally speaking, you will need to get the copyright owner's permission to upload copyright material to YouTube. To do so, you'll need to contact the owner and negotiate the terms. Some major studios and record labels have contact information on their official web page. [1] X Research source Some websites allow you to license copyrighted songs for a one-time fee or a monthly subscription. Some of these websites include: Licked.co , Epidemicsound , and Easysong.com . If you get permission to use copyrighted material, make sure you read and understand the license agreement. There may be stipulations in the agreement that must be adhered to. For example, the license agreement may stipulate how much of the material you are allowed to use and require you to credit the original artist or copyright holder. Failure to do so may result in a copyright claim or strike."

      "content": "Use the Fair Use doctrine. The Fair Use doctrine is a loophole that allows you to use copyrighted material in your own work without the copyright holder's permission as long as it is used for educational, review, commentary, or parody purposes. Your video must be about the work you are using. [4] X Research source For example, if you want to do a movie review, you can use clips from the movie you are reviewing without permission from the copyright holder. Alternatively, you could make an educational video about a particular book and use passages from that book in your video. The Fair Use doctrine won't protect you in all circumstances. Your video must be about the material you are using. You are also limited in how much of the material you are allowed to use. It comes down to your intent and how much of the material you used.

      "content": "Dispute a copyright claim or strike. If you believe you got a copyright claim or strike in error—either you have a license or permission to use the material, or you believe it qualifies as Fair Use—you can dispute the claim . Copyright claims don't necessarily negatively impact your channel. You should only dispute a claim if your video was muted or demonetized. However, if you get a strike, your video will be taken down, and if you get three strikes in 30 days, your channel will be terminated. Use the following steps to dispute a copyright claim or a strike: Log in to YouTube Studios . Click Content in the menu bar to the left. Hover over Copyright next to the video with a claim or strike you want to dispute. Click See Details . Click Select Action . Select Dispute and click Continue . Check the box next to \"My dispute isn't based on any of the reasons above.\" Click Continue . Choose why you dispute the claim and click Continue . Fill out the rationale form and click Continue ."

You can still get a copyright claim or strike, even if your video is not monetized. Copyright holders also have the right to run ads against your video and claim the ad revenue for themselves."
