      "content": "Reviewers in the affiliate program post reviews for commission. While anyone can be a Temu reviewer in the sense of posting reviews on Temu, the website also offers the opportunity to join the affiliate program. Affiliates post reviews, referrals, and participate in activities to earn coupons, gifts, store credit, and commissions on orders. This program is open to everyone; just sign-up and you automatically become an affiliate! Anyone can sign up to join the affiliate program, and there is also an influencer program for social media influencers with at least 300 followers. These programs share similar benefits, though the influencer program has additional posting requirements based on the influencer’s main social media platform. Temu has affiliate options for websites and organizations, too. Reviewers test products and provide honest, detailed feedback. They write clear, concise reviews and post them in a timely manner to meet deadlines and product launches."

Be sure to include your referral link with your reviews so you can earn a commission when people sign up and make a purchase. [5] X Research source Unlike the influencer program, which has specific requirements and expectations for posting products and reviews, affiliates can post their reviewers wherever they feel is best. Because the affiliate program is based more on getting people to join Temu and make purchases, there doesn’t seem to be any length or quality expectations for affiliate reviews. Temu does, however, have rules in place for referrals to ensure there is no fraud or malicious behavior. Temu will monitor this behavior and has the right to freeze your account or take back any earnings. Read the rules carefully to make sure this doesn’t happen to you."

[11] X Research source Unlike the affiliate program, the influencer program has different “campaigns” where you select which products you’d like to review or online promotions you’d like to share. Temu then provides an explanation for the campaign and requirements for posting your review, like how long review videos should be and where to display prices in photos. Influencers also receive a “seeding balance” on their account which allows them to purchase “free” items to try out without spending their actual money. Rules and requirements vary depending on the campaign. Be sure to read them carefully to ensure you do everything correctly. Temu monitors activity and has the right to take back earnings or freeze your account if they suspect malicious behavior or fraud."

[12] X Research source Your account balance is Temu credit, and you can use it toward receiving campaign–specific items.
