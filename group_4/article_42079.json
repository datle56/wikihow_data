      "content": "Determine whether or not your school is held to Title IX. All public educational institutions are accountable to protect you as a pregnant student under title IX. Private schools that receive federal funding are also accountable. Any educational institution that receives federal funds, including those run in correctional or health care facilities, must abide by Title IX or forfeit funding. [2] X Research source Any educational program that receives federal funds, including internships and School-to-Work programs, must abide by Title IX. A school that is controlled by a religious organization is exempt from Title IX when the law’s requirements would conflict with the organization’s religious beliefs. [3] X Research source This means if the religion has a strict belief against premarital sex, the student would not be protected by Title IX and could potentially be denied the opportunity to continue participating in classes or have excused absences due to pregnancy."

      "content": "Speak to your school's Title IX coordinator. Every school that receives federal funds must designate a Title IX coordinator or counselor. [4] X Research source This person will help you navigate the system as a pregnant student. Ask in the main office of your school, or look up the coordinator online. The information has to be readily available for your school to be in compliance with Title IX, so don't take no for an answer. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Demand your education. Under Title IX, your school must allow you to continue participating in classes and extracurricular activities while pregnant. Continue to take your regularly scheduled classes, including advanced placement and honors classes. If you would like, you can continue to participate in school clubs, sports, and after-school programs. [6] X Research source Hold your positions. If you have been elected to a position of student leadership, an honors society, or anything else, you may not be asked to step down because of your pregnancy. Again, if you school is exempt to Title IX, you may not be guaranteed these rights."

      "content": "Take the time you need. If your school is held to title IX they must excuse absences related to pregnancy or childbirth, provided your doctor says they are needed. Your school must allow you to return to the same place you were in when you left. They cannot demote you from positions you held, nor remove you from the classes you were in. You must be given the chance to make up the work you missed when absent, including homework, tests, and presentations. If you are graded on attendance or class participation, your teachers must give you alternative assignments of equal worth. [7] X Research source"

Your school may give you the choice of transferring to an alternative school, or taking special instructional classes for pregnant students. This program must offer the same types of academic, extracurricular and enrichment opportunities as your school’s regular program. Under Title IX, this must be a choice: your school cannot pressure you to participate. [8] X Research source If you are in middle or high school, your school might want to transfer you to an alternative school. You do not have to transfer. Visit the facilities of the alternative school. If you don't like it, stay in your regular school. [9] X Research source Students who transfer when they don't want to are more likely to drop out."

As a pregnant student, you should have the same rights as other students with temporary medical conditions. Some schools offer significant help to students with medical issues. If your school provides these students with homebound instruction, independent study, or at-home tutoring, you can ask for these options as well. Unless your school requires one from all temporarily disabled/ill students, you should not be required to get a doctor's note to participate in class or extracurricular activities. [10] X Research source You are not required to provide a doctor's note to excuse your hospitalization during childbirth, unless all students who are hospitalized are required to provide a note."

      "title": "Get medical support.",
      "content": "Get medical support. One of the most reliable ways to survive school while pregnant is to have on-campus health support. Visit the school nurse and ask what sorts of aid are available. Unless you study at a university with its own hospital, you are unlikely to have all your health needs taken care of on campus. Visit a regular doctor for other needs. [17] X Research source If you are a teenager, you are at a higher risk for pregnancy complications such as anemia, premature birth, and high blood pressure. [18] X Research source If your parents have health insurance that covers dependents, you may be covered by their plan until you are 26. [19] X Research source Discuss the terms of your parents' health insurance policy to determine whether or not you are covered. If getting on your parents' insurance plan is not an option (maybe you are not on good terms or you aren't covered), you will need to seek out your own insurance. Giving birth qualifies you to apply for government insurance even after the deadline for Open Enrollment (or the period during which you can sign up for insurance) has passed. [20] X Research source If you enroll up to 60 days after giving birth, your insurance will begin the day of the event. So, if you give birth on March 15, 2016 and enroll on May 14, 2016, you coverage applies from March 15 to the end of the year (December 31, 2016). [21] X Research source If you are unable to work or afford the monthly payments for insurance, you may be eligible for Medicaid through your state. If you receive Medicaid, your infant will automatically be eligible for coverage as well. Each state has its own requirements for eligibility, so you will need to contact your local Medicaid office to find out if you qualify. [22] X Research source Try searching here for an office near you. While you wait for your government insurance, visit a free clinic. They may have resources your school doesn't have, such as classes for expecting parents and material assistance. Most towns have women's health centers or family services centers you can visit."

      "content": "Enlist help from friends. Being pregnant and in school is a lot of work. You will need your friends to help you out in ways they never have. If your friends have not been pregnant or helped someone who is pregnant, they may not pick up quickly on your new needs. Communicate clearly about things you need. You may need help with food, with errands, and with getting around. Create a schedule and ask your friends to sign up for shifts. If you are in middle or high school, you also may need help socially, as some people won’t \"get it.\" Ask your friends to stand up for you if they hear someone spreading rumors or calling you names. Tell your best friends exactly what you're going through. If student pregnancy is unusual at your school, you will have to spell out your needs to your friends. Tell them what you are worried about, what you need, and that you appreciate their support. If you don't have supportive friends, see if you can join a local meet up group for new parents. You'll meet people who have gone through what you are going through."

Depression might happen during pregnancy, and is very common afterward. If you find yourself to be unusually sad, have thoughts of hurting yourself, or feelings of hopelessness, report this to your doctor like you would a physical pain. Ask your doctor for help finding a therapist or a social worker to get you through your depression."

Ask your counselor or social worker to help you find a group home for pregnant teens and teen parents that will not require you to move far from your school. If you are escaping an abusive relationship with your partner or family, you may need to stay in a secret location.

Eat whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat meat and dairy. There are government programs such as the WIC (Women, Infant, and Children) that can help you afford good food. Avoid soda and junk food, and eat healthy snacks like fruits and nuts in between classes to keep your energy up. An empty stomach can lead to morning sickness and nausea. Carry a mild snack like wholegrain crackers to eat throughout the day. [24] X Research source Try to drink fluids throughout the day, cutting back during mealtimes. [25] X Research source Seek treatment if you have an eating disorder. You can seriously harm your child and yourself if you give birth without adequate nutrition.

Ask your school if there is a place you can lie down if you find you need a nap during the day. Exercise will help you sleep better, reduce health risks for you and your baby, and ease your back pain. If you always exercise, you can probably continue a similar exercise regimen during your pregnancy. [28] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you do not normally exercise, start by going on walks or exercising for 10 or 15 minutes at a time until you build up more stamina. Avoid any exercise that has you lying on your back after your first trimester. Avoid exercise that puts you at risk of falling. Drink plenty of fluids while you exercise. Check your local hospital, fitness center or gym for exercise classes for pregnant people, such as prenatal yoga.

      "content": "Treat school like it's your job. For a pregnant student, school becomes less of a social space and more of a job. You're taking care of your body full time, so taking care of schoolwork will need a special focus. You also might experience what is sometimes called \"baby brain,\" or a lack of focus and memory associated with pregnancy. Keep a calendar with all your assignments as well as your doctors appointments and other dates. Get a tutor or talk to your teachers if you are struggling with understanding the material."

      "content": "Consider taking time off. If you are in college, you have the option of taking a semester or a year off. Talk to your guidance counselor about the possibility of leaving and picking up where you were. You might want to stay in school while pregnant and then take a year off if you are keeping the child, or you might need to stay in school in order to collect your financial aid. If you do take time off, make sure you apply for extra scholarships for students who are parents when you are ready to return. If you are in high school and you are struggling to take care of your pregnancy and your schoolwork, consider taking classes for your GED. Talk to your school counselor about this decision."
