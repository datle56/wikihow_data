      "title": "Apply super glue or clear nail polish to the crack.",
      "content": "Apply super glue or clear nail polish to the crack. Carefully squeeze a small amount of super glue into the crack—just enough to fill the crack without causing a mess. Then, carefully wipe away the excess liquid with your cleaning rag. Let the glue dry for at least two hours before getting back on the road. [3] X Research source If you’re using nail polish, be sure to use clear nail polish so that the fix is transparent and not too distracting. Super glue and nail polish fill the crack and help prevent further damage, but they're not permanent solutions. You'll need a repair or even full replacement in order to completely fix any chips or cracks."

      "content": "Cover the crack with tape. Use strong, clear tape, like packing tape , to seal the crack. Make sure the crack is completely covered to prevent any further dirt or debris from finding its way inside. Use transparent tape that will allow you to drive and see through your windshield without too much distraction. Tape will only cover the crack and can help prevent further damage, but don’t stop there. Use a windshield repair kit or visit an auto body shop to fully repair or replace the windshield."
