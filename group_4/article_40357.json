      "content": "Assess the injury and stop using the finger immediately. It’s important to stop using the finger for anything and let it rest after you injure it. No matter how you got the injury, stop what you’re doing and assess the injured finger.

Go to source Feels numb or you cannot move it. Hurts, especially in the bones over the joints. Has red streaks extending from the injury. Has been injured before. Is cut or broken and the bone is visible. The skin is split and may need stitches. There is large swelling. There is blood under the nail or the nail has popped off. Dirt in the wound won’t go away after 15 minutes of scrubbing. The skin is cut and you have no past tetanus shots. Severe pain does not go away after 2 hours of taking OTC pain medication."

      "title": "Place the finger against a splint or clean popsicle stick.",
      "content": "Place the finger against a splint or clean popsicle stick. If you have a minor sprain, you can splint it until you can see a doctor. Buy a splint in the first aid section of a drug store or use a straight, hard object. Choose something that is about the same length or slightly longer than the finger. A clean tongue depressor or popsicle stick works well. Once you have a splint, press it against the top side (dorsal side) of the injured finger and hold it there gently. Don't squeeze the finger or apply pressure to the injured area. [3] X Research source Make sure to position the splint under the injured joint. Depending on the type of injury or available splint, the splint may also go on the underside of your finger."

      "title": "Wrap medical tape around each phalanx, or finger bone.",
      "content": "Wrap medical tape around each phalanx, or finger bone. Next, secure the splint to the finger by wrapping medical tape around it 3 times at 3 separate points. Wrap medical tape around the finger at the base of the fingernail (the distal phalanx or fingertip bone), the middle finger bone (middle phalanx), and above the knuckle next to the hand (the proximal phalanx). Make sure that the tape is snug, but still loose enough to ensure good circulation. [5] X Research source If you don’t have medical tape, you can also use regular clear tape. Taping each phalanx immobilizes the finger and prevents injured joints from bending and moving while they heal."

      "title": "Apply ice to the injured finger to reduce pain and swelling.",
      "content": "Apply ice to the injured finger to reduce pain and swelling. Wrap an ice pack in a towel or paper towel and press it against the injured finger. Ice the finger for 10 to 20 minutes, and then remove it from the ice pack. Then, wait for the skin to return to its normal temperature before icing it again. This will take about 1 to 2 hours. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you don’t have an ice pack, a bag of frozen corn or peas also works well. Just wrap it in a clean cloth or paper towel first. Never let ice or an ice pack come into direct contact with your skin. Icing is most helpful within 24 hours of receiving the injury."

      "title": "Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain.",
      "content": "Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain. If the finger hurts, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. This will help you get some relief. Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for how much to take and how often to take it. [7] X Research source Keep in mind that the pain should start to subside after the first 24 to 48 hours. However, if the pain is worse or isn’t improving, call your doctor."

      "content": "See a doctor for an injured finger as soon as possible. If you have a sprained or broken finger, call your doctor or visit an urgent care center for treatment. Your healthcare provider will assess the injured finger and apply an appropriate splint for the location and type of injury. They may also need to realign the finger before placing it in a splint, but they'll give you a local anesthetic to numb the finger first. [9] X Research source The sooner you get treatment for a sprained or broken finger, the better. Depending on the severity of the injury, it may take up to 3 to 4 months to heal. Delaying treatment can delay healing and lead to other complications, such as a skin infection."

Discuss surgical repair options with your doctor if they recommend surgery. However, keep in mind that this is uncommon. Most finger injuries heal well with a splint in about 4 to 8 weeks (but may take several months or up to a year if the finger is broken). [15] X Research source You may need surgery if your injury involves a joint, contains loose bone fragments or multiple fractures, there is tendon or ligament damage, or there is an unstable fracture that a splint can’t support.
