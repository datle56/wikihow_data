You should also check if you're connected to the 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi frequency on your router. Your phone might have a poor connection on the 5 GHz frequency, so connect to the 2.4 GHz frequency instead."

If you've set up port forwarding , static IP addresses, firewall rules, or made other configuration changes, double-check your work to make sure you haven't blocked internet access for your phone. You can also reset your router to its original factory settings. If your router is very old, it may not be compatible with your phone. If you haven't upgraded your router in a while and Wi-Fi still doesn't work on your phone, you may need a new router."
