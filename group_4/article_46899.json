      "content": "Turn off data roaming for international travel. When traveling abroad, you can rack up some hefty charges if you don't have an international data plan. To turn it off, click \"Settings\" on the iPad, and then find \"Cellular Data.\" Switch the toggle for \"Data Roaming\" to off (it should be white, not green). [1] X Research source Check on international data plans if you want to keep using data. Keep in mind, though, that even with a plan, you can run up a large bill in no time using data. You can monitor your data usage on the \"Cellular Data\" page at the bottom."

      "content": "Download your entertainment ahead of time. Not every plane has wifi, and even if it does, it can be slow and jerky. Plus, you may not have wifi or even data everywhere you're going. It's best to stock up your iPad with music, books, and movies before you leave. [2] X Research source You don't have to pay per item for your entertainment. If you have memberships with sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime, you can often download movies (and music, in Amazon's case) included with your membership for free. Similarly, check with your library for e-books and audiobooks. Most libraries have these available free for you to check out on your iPad. You may need to download an app to download and read or listen to your books. The main apps for this purpose are Overdrive and Libby (also by Overdrive), but check with your library. Don't forget to include a few fun games if you have kids, particularly ones they can play offline."

They can also assist you with booking hotels if you don't have your whole trip planned out. [3] X Research source For instance, try apps like FlightTrack ($5 USD), Kayak (free), or 1,000 Ultimate Experiences ($20 USD). Review apps like Zomato, Yelp, and TripAdvisor can also be helpful. [4] X Research source A language app and a weather app would also come in handy! Download a wifi finder app to locate nearby wifi."

Google Maps allows you to download specific areas so you can use it to navigate offline. [5] X Research source Find the city you want to download in Google Maps by putting it in the search box. Hit the 3 dots, and then click \"Download area offline.\" Zoom in if needed by using the zoom slider. This will affect the amount of detail you download.

      "content": "Buy the right plug adapter for the area you're going. If you're traveling internationally, it's likely the electrical plug will be different. All you need to buy is a plug adapter kit. Most of these have a variety of adapters that will fit a variety of plugs worldwide. [6] X Research source Alternatively, research the country you're visiting to find the specific plug you'll need, and just buy that adapter."

While more and more of this information is digital, it's a good idea to keep it in 1 place. You can save all your paperwork to the cloud so you can access it from your iPad. [7] X Research source You can simply use iPad's Files app, as long as you've updated to iOS 11 or later. You can save items to Files on your iPad or connect your Files to your Mac or PC using iCloud. You just need to sign into the same iCloud account on all your devices, and then upload the files you need. [8] X Research source"

Usually, you'll know your phone needs an update if it has a little red number in the app button on the home screen.

In the past, airport security has allowed items like iPads, tablets, and Kindles to go through security while still in a bag. However, now you have to take them out separately to be scanned. It's best to have your iPad out while you're standing in line so you're ready. [9] X Research source You'll need to place it in a scanning bin with nothing on top of it or below it. Look for signs that indicate whether your iPad needs to be removed from its case when you go through security."

Under \"Cellular Data,\" choose \"Set Up Cellular Data.\" Pick a carrier and set up an account with them right from your iPad while using wifi. [10] X Research source If you don't have an Apple Sim, visit a local carrier store to buy a carrier sim in the country you're visiting. You can also purchase an Apple Sim before leaving home. This step probably won't help you if you're only in another country for a few days. However, if you're there a week or longer, it may be a good idea."

Your iPad will guide you through the process, but basically, you'll hold your finger on the home button for a few seconds while it reads it, then shift it slightly. You'll keep doing this until your iPad reads your whole fingerprint. Even if you set up the fingerprint scanner, you can still use a passcode to get into your iPad."

Alternatively, it could just be damaged when you drop it while trying to take a photo. Either way, a little insurance never hurts to make you feel better about taking your iPad with you. [15] X Research source You can find travel insurance for your iPad online at a variety of companies. Alternatively, check with the insurance company that covers your car or house. Travel insurance for your iPad can be as low as $5 USD/month. If you have travel insurance already, check to make sure your iPad is covered. Also check to see if your iPad is covered for travel under any warranties or protection plans you may have."
