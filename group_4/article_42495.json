      "content": "Understand the uses of psyllium husk. Psyllium husk is a source of soluble fiber. It is often used for occasional constipation and to help restore regularity. Psyllium husk works by absorbing water in your digestive tract, forming a bulky gelatin-like mass that transports waste, stimulates digestion, and helps quicken the passage of stool. For this reason, psyllium husk is known as a bulk-forming laxative. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Psyllium husk is also used to help treat irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. These conditions cause pain and digestive problems that may be alleviated by incorporating psyllium husk into your daily routine."
