      "content": "Store whole watermelons at room temperature. Putting a whole watermelon in your fridge can actually reduce its nutritional value. If you’re not planning on cutting up your melon right away, it’s best to store the whole melon at a room temperature, out of direct sunlight. You should still cut up your watermelon, or freeze it, within two weeks of buying the whole fruit."

      "content": "Wrap the cut end of the watermelon with plastic. If you cut your watermelon in half and want to store one half, wrap it with plastic. The uncut watermelon should be tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. This will keep your watermelon from picking up the scents or flavors of other food in your refrigerator. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut up only what you need. If you cut up an entire watermelon, chances are you’re going to end up with more cut watermelon than you can possibly eat. Cut your watermelon in half, and store one uncut half in the fridge. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Store the watermelon in an airtight container. Even in an airtight container, your watermelon will lose its freshness and sweetness in 3 to 4 days. Make sure you eat it before then, or the juice will run out of the pieces of watermelon and they’ll lose their flavor. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Remove the rind. Cut the watermelon in half, then place the flat side down on a table. With a large, sharp knife, cut the rind away by starting at the top of the watermelon (what used to be one of the ends) and slowly curving your knife down. Repeat this all the way around the watermelon. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Cut the watermelon into pieces. To cube the watermelon, cut the watermelon halves into slices crosswise. You can store the watermelon in slices, or you can cube it. To cube it, lay the slices flat and cut them into cubes. [8] X Research source For example, if you’re going to use the frozen watermelon in smoothies or to make ice cream, cubes are best. Cubing watermelon is best if you’re planning on just snacking on it. Thawed watermelon will be softer than fresh watermelon, though, so keep that in mind as you freeze it. You can also freeze the watermelon in slices if you're short on space on in your freezer. Sliced watermelon will stack more easily than cubes."

      "content": "Freeze the watermelon in a single layer. Spread your cut watermelon in a single layer on a baking sheet. Stick the baking sheet in the freezer and let the watermelon freeze solid. You might need to check the watermelon every 10 minutes or so to see if it’s frozen yet. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Put the watermelon in an airtight container. Once the watermelon is frozen solid (after about an hour in the freezer), you can place it in an airtight container or storage bag. You can store the watermelon in your freezer for up to six months. [10] X Research source You can also place a draining grate in the container or even just a paper towel to absorb any juice that seeps out. Fruit breaks down much faster when it's sitting in its own excess juice."
