But if you're only experiencing mild nausea, there are some steps you can take to reduce or prevent the need to vomit. Try the following options to manage your nausea: step outside and get some fresh air take deep, slow breaths through your mouth suck on a mint candy or chew gum smell the inside of your wrist or armpit (the smell of perfume or deodorant may distract your body from the sensation of nausea) sniff something scented, like essential oil pinch your arm or tug on your hair (physical sensations can sometimes distract the body)"

      "content": "Try to plan your location. If at all possible, try to anticipate when and where you will vomit if the need arises. The most ideal place is in a restroom (in the toilet, if possible), but obviously that may not always be feasible to get to a restroom. If you cannot get to a restroom, try to at least find a plastic bag or trash can to vomit into, as this will greatly reduce how much of a mess you make. [4] X Research source If you're going to induce vomiting, wait until you can get to a toilet, trash can, or plastic bag. If you believe that you may vomit uncontrollably in the near future, stay close to a bathroom or keep a trash can/plastic bag on hand."

      "content": "Prevent personal mess. Once you've eliminated the potential for making a mess of your immediate environment, your next focus should be on keeping yourself clean. Whether you've made it to a bathroom, found a trash can, or stepped outside to a safe outdoor environment, you'll want to prepare yourself as best as you can for what's about to happen. If you have long hair, tie it back, tuck it behind your ears, or hold it in place behind your head. Vomit in your hair will quickly ruin your day and make an absolute mess. [5] X Research source Remove any long, dangling necklaces, or at least tuck them into your shirt. This could create a similar complication as long hair. Try to direct the stream of vomit away from your shoes, pants, and hands (if you're on all fours). Aim slightly ahead of where you're standing/sitting/crawling. If indoors, keep your head above the toilet or trash can. Try to lower your head enough such that no vomit will splatter outside the container you're vomiting into. If you're sick in bed, keep a trash can and a stack of towels next to the bed. That way, if you can't reach the trash can or make it to the toilet, you can put down a towel to vomit onto/into. The towel can easily be washed, and it will be much easier to clean up than if you threw up in your bed or on the carpet. [6] X Research source"

This is normal, as vomiting can be extremely stressful on the body and leaves a revolting aftertaste in the mouth and throat. Even if you managed to complete the actual process of vomiting without making a mess, you'll want to clean yourself up after throwing up to feel better and cleaner. Brush your teeth, or at the very least rinse your mouth out. Using mouthwash is best, but in a pinch even water will help. [7] X Research source Splash some clean, cold water on your face, and wash away any residual vomit that may have clung to your lips, chin, or facial hair. Suck on a breath mint or chew gum to ensure that your breath does not smell. Wash your hands with soap and water."

No matter what the cause of your vomiting was, your body will most likely experience some mild to moderate dehydration after you vomit. That's because your body loses water and nutrients any time you vomit. When you feel that you will not vomit anymore and you think you can stomach it, slowly drink a glass of cold water. Do not chug the water or attempt to drink it quickly - just sip on it slowly and steadily. [9] X Research source If you can keep water down, try drinking a little bit of a sports drink or any other electrolyte-rich beverage (such as Gatorade, Powerade, or Pedialyte). Do not try to eat any food until you are feeling completely recovered. Let yourself sit and relax for a few minutes after vomiting. Avoid any immediate activity, and focus on getting rehydrated and letting your body calm down. [10] X Research source"
