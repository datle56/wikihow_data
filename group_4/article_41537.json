[1] X Research source Avoid wrapping the chives too tightly which will trap moisture and cause them to mold faster. [2] X Research source To absorb any extra moisture, put a paper towel between the chives and the plastic wrap before wrapping them up. Using a partially closed resealable bag instead of plastic wrap will also work. [3] X Research source"

[4] X Research source Don’t place your chives in the back of the fridge where it’s colder because this dries them out and may cause them to partially freeze. [5] X Research source Throw the chives away if the stems turn dark or crunchy or if you see mold spots."

      "content": "Wash the chives right before using them. Don’t rinse the chives prior to putting them in the refrigerator because any leftover moisture will make them go bad faster. Instead, wait until you’re ready to use them and wash any dirt or grime off in cool water. [6] X Research source Even if there’s no visible dirt on your chives, always rinse them before eating them. They can contain bacteria that you can’t see. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Rinse the chives and pat them dry with paper towels. Use cold water to wash the chives, running your hand gently along the stems to get rid of any grime. Remove all excess water by firmly pressing the chives between 2 paper towels. [8] X Research source Use a salad spinner if you have one to dry the chives. Place the rinsed chives in the bowl of the spinner, then spin them to wick off the water. If you leave any moisture on the chives, they will stick together when they freeze."

Hold them in your hand if you’re using scissors or lay them on a cutting board if you’re using a knife. Cut through all of the stems together. Trim off any pieces of the chives that are brown or yellow and discard them."

      "content": "Arrange the chives in a single layer on a baking sheet. Use your hands to smooth out the chives across the sheet, making sure they don’t pile up on top of each other. Keeping them in one layer stops them from freezing together. [9] X Research source Putting a piece of parchment paper or a silipat mat between the chives and the baking sheet will prevent the chives from hardening to the baking sheet itself."

      "content": "Place the baking sheet in the freezer for 5 minutes. This is a process known as flash freezing. It will harden the chives before you put them in a container so that they freeze as separate pieces instead of clumping together. [10] X Research source Clear out a spot for the baking sheet to sit flat and level in the freezer. If the sheet is on an angle, the chives may shift and freeze together."

[12] X Research source The best spot for your chives is the back of the freezer, where it's coldest. A freezer temperature of 0 °F (−18 °C) is ideal for keeping your food fresher for longer. [13] X Research source Because the chives are so small, you don’t have to defrost them before using them in recipes. Just remove them from the freezer when you need them."

Then lay the chives flat on a paper towel and pat them dry with another paper towel. Let the chives sit on the towel until they’re dry. [14] X Research source If you have a salad spinner, this is a great tool for washing herbs. Rinse the chives in the sink first, then place them in the salad spinner. Turn the handle to spin the water off the chives. Continue spinning until there’s no moisture left on the chives."

Bunching the chives together in your hand before cutting so you can trim all of the stalks at once will make the process quicker.
