      "title": "Try making up stories about the other guests.",
      "content": "Try making up stories about the other guests. If you see two guests chatting, try to imagine what they might be saying to each other. Insert funny dialogue into their mouths (either mentally or very, very quietly to yourself) as their lips move. Or choose someone you don't know and try to make a creative backstory for him. You could also watch everyone's body language and try to guess their relationships to each other from these cues. Maybe you'll pick up that the girl at the snack table has a crush on the guy who is playing with the dog because she can't stop glancing over at him."

Keep some of these tips in mind if you find yourself playing DJ at a boring party: If the party is a dinner party, you'll want to pick softer music with slower rhythms. If it's time to dance, pick some tunes that have a great beat and turn up the volume at bit. If the party is mostly drinks and conversation, try picking some smooth music styles like blues or light jazz."

These games will get everyone moving and talking, adding some much needed life to the party. Try looking over some of these examples to get an idea of which games you might want to play: You can try whispering a word to someone next to you and asking them to whisper a word they associate with it to the next person. It's a lot of fun to see what the original word ends up being. Try asking everyone to say a certain word without showing their teeth. You can play in teams and eliminate players who show their teeth when talking. You can always try playing the classic game of charades if things get dull. One person will try to act out a word while the other players try to guess that word."

By discussing topics that are open-ended, you'll be able to keep a conversation going and help make the party a bit more interesting. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Try to avoid topics like the weather, money or traffic. Instead, ask people about their hobbies and interests, what music they like, if they've seen any good movies, and so on. Keep topics broad at first and then narrow the subject down if the other person is interested. Asking questions is a great way to keep a conversation open and flowing. Pay attention to what the other person is saying. You'll likely find they have mentioned a few things that would be a good topic to focus on."

Knowing how to jump form one topic to another can help keep a conversation going strong. Keep some of these tips in mind whenever you need to change topics during a conversation: [10] X Research source Generally, you'll want the new topic to be somewhat related to the last one. For example, a discussion about libraries could easily transition into a talk about e-readers and then onto new technology. Don't be afraid to abruptly change a topic if the old one should fizzle out. Feel free to explore topics that go beyond the usual small talk. For example, you might ask someone what he would do if he were trapped on a desert island."

Keep some of these tips in mind to keep a conversation going and avoid boredom at a lackluster party: [11] X Research source Try not to drone on or speak in a monotone voice. Allow your personality to shine through in your conversation and express yourself. Avoid ranting or dominating the conversation. Always let the other person have a turn to speak. Don't interrupt.
