      "content": "It signals general approval or acceptance. The 💯 emoji can also be used in place of “I agree 100%.” There are a bunch of different variations of this, but all of them are generally good. If someone sends you a 💯 after you’ve asked them a question, this is their way of saying “yes.”"

      "content": "It was originally designed to look like a grade on schoolwork. The 💯 emoji is supposed to resemble a grade on a test or piece of homework. In Japan (where emojis were invented), it’s common for teachers to use a red “100” stamp when students ace an exam. The emoji is supposed to represent that. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use it to compliment someone for being true to themselves. If a friend or family member makes a tough decision, you could send this emoji to tell them that you recognize they’re staying true to who they are. Similarly, you might also send a lone 💯 if someone does something that they’re known for. [3] X Research source “Hey! I heard you quit your job to start your own business! Congrats! 💯” If someone breaks up with their partner because they’d been treated poorly, you might say, “I know it’s hard right now, but I’m proud of you 💯” You can send multiple 💯 emojis to really emphasize it, like, “I see you! 💯 💯 💯”"

      "title": "Agree with someone wholeheartedly with this emoji.",
      "content": "Agree with someone wholeheartedly with this emoji. If someone states an opinion that you agree with, the 💯 is a quick way of saying, “I totally agree.” You don’t even need to include any words in your response. The sole, “💯” will stand on its own. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a 💯 instead of “yes” to answer a leading question.",
      "content": "Use a 💯 instead of “yes” to answer a leading question. If someone asks you a yes or no question, a sole 💯 will indicate “yes.” You can also use it to confirm a question where someone is presuming an answer, like “You’re going to the dance next weekend, right?” [5] X Research source Any kind of question that requires elaboration or explanation won’t work with the 💯. For example, if someone asks you, “I’m going to pick up food. Want me to bring you a sandwich?” a 💯 will communicate, “Yeah, I’ll take a sandwich.”"

There are a lot of memes out there surrounding the 💯 emoji, usually surrounding the “grindset” culture of people who work way too hard and pretend to “keep it real” when they’re not actually being authentic. If you want in on the joke, the 😤, 💪, 🔥, and 😂 emojis are all similarly meme-able. [8] X Research source"
