      "content": "Store your condoms at room temperature in a dry place. Extreme temperatures can damage your condoms, and so can moisture. This can make them ineffective at protecting you from pregnancy and STDs. Make sure the place you choose will keep them from reaching extreme temperatures or getting wet. [1] X Research source For example, you could put them inside your desk or dresser drawer. Never store them in temperatures warmer than 100 °F (38 °C) or cooler than 32 °F (0 °C).

      "content": "Keep sharp objects away from the condoms. Sharp objects can damage the condom packaging, as well as the condom itself. They can cause rips and holes, which make the condom ineffective. Even if just the package rips, the condom can dry out, making it likely to break. [4] X Research source For example, remove scissors, letter openers, pencils, razor blades, knives, and other such items from the area where you store your condoms. If you want to store these items in the same place, such as in a desk drawer, make sure your condoms are in a container that can’t be penetrated, such as a metal tin. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Keep condoms in your wallet for no longer than 1 month. Condoms quickly become damaged in your wallet. The wallet is both warm and causes friction, which breaks them down. Although it’s best to avoid putting them in your wallet, sometimes you need to carry them to be safe. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If you need to carry a condom in your wallet, stick to 1 or 2 and change them out on a schedule. For example, you might place 1 in your wallet and change it on the first of the month. Even if you use a condom during the month and replace it early, it’s a good idea to always change it on the first so you know you’re safe."

      "title": "Avoid storing your condoms in your vehicle.",
      "content": "Avoid storing your condoms in your vehicle. The temperature inside your vehicle is unstable, so the condoms could get damaged.

For example, you might place them in the car while you go on a road trip or for a night on the town. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Put your condoms in a discreet container.",
      "content": "Put your condoms in a discreet container. You might use a decorative item that’s already part of your decor, such as a small trinket box. Alternatively, you could choose a practical option, like a recycled food container. Just make sure you don’t pick something that the other people in your home will want to use. For example, store them in your jewelry box, an empty Altoids tin, a pencil case, or a toiletries bag. If you’re on the go, an old Altoids tin or gum pack is your best bet. You could also use a coin purse."

      "content": "Use a hollow book. You can purchase hollowed out books or faux books online or from some home goods stores. As another alternative, you can make your own hollowed out book . Take an old book you don’t need, then use an exacto knife to cut a hole in the center part of the pages. Make sure you leave several solid pages in the front and back of the book. Place your condoms in the gap, then put the book on your bookshelf or desk. Make sure it blends in with other books."

      "title": "Store your condoms in a drawer with something on top of it.",
      "content": "Store your condoms in a drawer with something on top of it. For example, you might put your condoms under your T-shirts or under a writing pad in your desk. This helps the condom blend in with your other items so they aren’t noticeable. [9] X Research source Choose a drawer where people are less likely to go, such as your personal dresser. Don’t place the condoms where they’ll get too hot."

      "content": "Find the expiration date. Although condoms last awhile when stored properly, they do expire. An expired condom will not provide proper protection against pregnancy and STDs.
