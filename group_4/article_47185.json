      "content": "Talk or sing to them softly. Slowly coax them into the waking world with your voice. Sing or hum a sweet little tune, or just start talking to them in a low, soothing voice. Pair this with some gentle touches, and your newborn may be a bit less averse to the idea of having to wake up. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Undress your baby. While probably not nearly as pleasant as being woken up with a nice back rub, your baby is more likely to wake up if you start undressing them. Being moved around and having their toasty warm clothes taken off might not be their ideal wake-up call, but it’s certainly effective. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Lay them on your chest for some skin-to-skin contact. This is especially helpful if you’re waking your baby up to feed them. Skin-to-skin contact has been shown to release hormones and trigger instincts in your baby that make feeding easier and more natural.

Even if their diaper is clean, just going through the motions can help them wake up. If they do happen to need a change, then consider that a double win of sorts. [6] X Research source"

Gently support them and raise them into a sitting position, almost like you’re having them do a sit-up. Repeat this motion a few times to help coax them awake. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Run your newborn a warm bath if all else fails. Bathing your infant is certainly more of a “drastic” means of waking them up, so use it sparingly and only for the times when there’s really no other option. For example, if they’re long overdue for a feeding, and you just can’t seem to get them to wake up, get them into some warm bathwater to help. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Undress your baby and rub their back if they start to drift off. When it comes to newborns, it’s pretty normal for your baby to doze off while nursing or being fed, especially if their tummy is feeling full. Keep them awake with gentle touches, such as rubbing their back or tickling their feet. On top of that, movement and cool air from being undressed will help to stop them from falling back asleep. [9] X Research source Being too hot can make a baby sleepy, so unwrap any blankets from around them, undress them, and keep the room at around 64ºF (18ºC). [10] X Research source You should feed your baby ten or more times in 24 hours. Wait for the baby to open its mouth wide when you are breastfeeding. The wider the mouth, the more comfortable it's going to feel. It will ensure the baby takes enough milk and gains weight appropriately. Track their diaper output. So what goes in must come out."

They’ll usually gain this weight back within 1 or 2 weeks, but until then, it’s important that you breastfeed or bottlefeed them regularly. If your baby isn’t waking up by themselves to make this demand, you might have to do the rousing yourself.

They usually end up sorting this out by themselves by about 8 weeks, but you can certainly provide some assistance. Keep their nap times to around 2 hours and keep them up for at least an hour before letting them take their next nap.

      "title": "To teach them how to soothe themselves to fall back asleep.",
      "content": "To teach them how to soothe themselves to fall back asleep. Using something called the “wake-and-sleep” technique teaches your baby how to self-soothe and fall back asleep with less help on your part. To do this, lightly rouse them from sleep by tickling their neck or feet until their eyes drowsily open. After this, just let them fall back asleep on their own. In those few seconds where they were awake, they were able to soothe themself back to sleep. [16] X Research source Your goal here isn’t to rouse them fully, but rather bring them to more of a sleepy state of consciousness. There may be times when your baby doesn’t go back to sleep on their own, but that’s perfectly okay. If this happens, just go about your normal routine for getting them to sleep . This is a good technique to use to help get your baby to start sleeping through the night. Start using the wake-and-sleep technique as early as the day your baby’s born."

      "content": "Most newborns sleep for a total of 16 hours a day. This is broken up into about 8 or 9 hours at night and 8 hours during the day. However, these 8 hours are usually broken up into shorter periods of sleep – around 1 to 2 hours. Babies typically won’t start sleeping through the night (6 to 8 hours) until they’re around 3 months old, or until they weigh 12-13 pounds (5.4-5.9 kg). [17] X Research source Naturally, as babies grow older, they start spending more time awake. However, even when babies are as old as 2 years old, they’ll still typically sleep about 13 hours a day. Contact your pediatrician immediately if you have any concerns about your baby’s sleep patterns. Even if it’s nothing, it’s best to check. If your baby is particularly hard to wake up or if they’re sleeping more than normal, talk to your pediatrician immediately."
