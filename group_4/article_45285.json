      "content": "A twunk is a young, slim, but muscular gay or queer man. Twunk is a combination of “twink” and “hunk”—it’s basically a guy who might be seen as more feminine than masculine, but who also has muscles. Imagine a younger, queer man with a clean-shaven appearance, defined biceps, and abs. [1] X Research source A “hunk” is an older slang word that describes a handsome, well-built man. [2] X Research source A “twink” typically refers to an attractive, young, slender gay man. [3] X Research source Celebs like Olympic diver and gold medalist Tom Daley have been described as a “twunk.” [4] X Research source Although twunk was popularized and frequently refers to gay or bisexual men, people who identify as non-binary and other queer folks might also use this term to describe themselves."

      "content": "Use twunk to describe a queer person who is muscular but slim. While people in the LGBTQ+ community use terms like “twunk,” they have also been used in derogatory ways to stereotype people, so it’s important to ask if the person is comfortable with that label first. [5] X Research source If they say it’s okay, you might call them a twunk when you’re describing them. “He says he’s a total twunk, but I told him he doesn’t have enough muscles to be called that.” “I met this super cute twunk online, want to see a picture of him?”"

      "content": "Describe yourself as a twunk if you feel like that label fits you. If you feel like the slender-but-muscular description fits you well, you might reference yourself as a “twunk” when talking to other people. You might also use this as a hashtag on social media posts or in your dating bio. “After I started hitting the gym, I totally transformed from a twink to a twunk.” “If you’re looking for a lovable twunk who likes hiking and playing video games, I’m the guy for you.” “Soaking up the summer sun in my new swimsuit. What do you think? #twunk”"

      "title": "A twunk is a more muscular version of a twink.",
      "content": "A twunk is a more muscular version of a twink. While “twink” is a label or stereotype that refers to a young, hairless, thin gay man in their early 20s, “twunk” describes a more toned, chiseled version of that. [6] X Research source Both terms were popularized by gay men and have since extended to other parts of the LGBTQ+ community. For example, singer Troye Sivan self-identifies as a twunk. [7] X Research source Someone like actor Timothée Chalamet (although he isn’t queer) might be called a twink, too. [8] X Research source The earliest use of the word “twink” was in the 1950s, while “twunk” is a more recent term. [9] X Research source Since these terms describe a person’s appearance, they may be used as stereotypes or derogatory labels. Try to use them only if the other person is comfortable with it."

[10] X Research source Although this term isn’t restricted to the LGBTQ+ community, it’s typically used in queer circles to describe a gay person who loves exercise and has the muscles to show for it. [11] X Research source “Gym bunny” and “muscle Mary” are more derogatory stereotypes that typically describe gay men who work out at the gym to keep their youthful looks for as long as possible.

      "content": "Bear A bear often describes a gay or bisexual man with facial or body hair and a hunky, cuddly body. Bears vary in size, shape, and skin tone, but the stereotypical bear might be a burly, hairy man with facial hair who wears clothing associated with blue-collar workers. [13] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “Bear” is also an umbrella term for people in the bear subculture who celebrate having a traditionally masculine appearance while showing affection and intimacy, which are traditionally feminine traits. [14] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source “Cub,” “dolphin,” “otter,” and “wolf” might all fit under the “bear” umbrella term as sub-identities.

      "content": "Wolf Someone who calls themselves a “wolf” might be a slender, more dominant or aggressive version of a bear. While bears are believed to have larger body types, the stereotypical wolf might have a more toned physique and a suave James Bond vibe.

      "content": "Cub Someone who describes themselves as a “cub” might look like a younger or younger-looking version of a bear, and may have a smaller physical frame. [18] X Research source This term is also sometimes used to imply being the more passive partner in a queer relationship. The opposite of a cub might be a “polar bear” or “daddy bear”—a self-identified bear who’s over 50 years old and has gray or white hair. [19] X Research source"

      "content": "Dolphin “Dolphin” typically refers to a more slender, athletic, and hairless version of a bear. [20] X Research source This is similar to a “twink,” however, “dolphin” is usually used as a bear sub-identity while twink tends to be used more broadly to describe any queer person. [21] X Research source “Dolphin” and “twink” may also be used interchangeably."

      "title": "Otter",
      "content": "Otter Someone who calls themselves an “otter” might look like a more slender version of a bear. They may identify with the hairy body and passive personality stereotype of a bear, but instead of being large and hunky, an otter might look more lean or skinny. The term “otter” was first used by gay men who identified with bear culture but didn’t feel like they quite belonged. [22] X Research source Some people say that otters are halfway between a twink and a bear. They may not be as hairy as a bear but are also not as lean or young-looking as a twink. [23] X Research source “Otter” can also refer to a sub-identity of people in the bear community who are an edgier version of the “guy next door.” They’re kind and completely comfortable in their own skin.
