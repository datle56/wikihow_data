      "content": "Cover the blister with a bandage. If you have a blister from a burn, it is recommended that you cover the affected area with a sterile bandage if possible. Leave enough room for blister formation. Make a tent in the bandage or cloth over the burn. This helps prevent the blister from breaking or becoming irritated or infected. If it isn't possible to use a bandage or gauze, use a clean towel or cloth instead."

      "content": "Refrain from using common at-home burn remedies. Many people believe that you should use all sorts of household items as burn remedies. People think you should put butter, egg whites, oil sprays, or ice on burns. Don't put these substances on a blister burn. They can lead to infection or tissue damage. [3] X Research source Instead, either use a burn cream or ointment, honey, or skip any type of ointment completely."

      "title": "Avoid popping the blister.",
      "content": "Avoid popping the blister. You should not break open the blister that forms from a burn, at least for the first three to four days. To aid in keeping the blister in tact, keep it covered. To remove the bandage without breaking the blister, you may have to soak the bandage in warm water. Change the bandage daily, applying either the antibiotic ointment or the honey every time. If the burn blister becomes too painful or has become infected, you can take steps to carefully break the blister. Always wash your hands first, and then clean the area around the blister with alcohol or an iodine solution to kill off any bacteria on the skin. Pierce the skin of the blister at its base, near the bottom of the blister, with a needle that has been sterilized by swabbing it with alcohol. Let the fluid drain out. Use a cotton ball to soak up the fluid or pus. Leave the overlying skin as intact as possible."

Even if you have run cool water over the burn and covered it, you may still feel pain or throbbing in the blister. Taking OTC pain meds can help reduce the pain. You may want to start taking them as soon as you get the blister burn instead of waiting for the blister to start hurting.

If the blister burn is filled with anything other than a clear fluid, there is a chance it is infected. If you have a fever, have any streaks on the skin around the blister, or the blister is very reddened and swollen, see a physician immediately. These may be signs of an infection. Any young child or elderly person should always be seen for any blister burns to minimize the risk of infections and scarring."

They do not usually produce blisters, but they may peel. First degree burns are dry, and usually take three to five days to heal. [8] X Research source"

Second degree burns affect surface layer and the next few under layers of the skin. Blisters are often common with second degree burns. [9] X Research source Second degree burns are painful and often form blisters and are red or pink. They may look swollen or have a pocket of clear, wet liquid. If more severe, a second degree burn can be dry with a reduced level of feeling in the area. If you apply pressure, the skin will not turn white or turn white very slowly. [10] X Research source Second degree burns usually heal within two to three weeks. Blistering burns larger than three inches should be seen at an ER or by your physician as soon as possible. If a second degree burn is on the hands, feet, face, groin, a major joint, or the buttocks, see your physician or go to the ER right away. Older individuals and children should be seen at the ER for any second degree burn because complications are more common in these groups."

Third degree burns are considered a major burn because the skin layers are destroyed and should be seen immediately at an ER. These burns affect the deepest part of the skin and cause whitened or blackened skin. [11] X Research source The burnt areas may be black or white. They also will be dry and leathery. [12] X Research source These burns are often painless at first because the nerves in the skin have been damaged."

Unless a singular blister is a severe second degree burn or third degree burn, you can treat it at home. However, if you are getting large numbers of blisters and they appear all over your body, see your physician right away. Many blisters on your body can be a symptom of a serious health concern, such as pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis."
