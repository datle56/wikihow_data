[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If it isn’t winter and you cannot turn down the temperature, try using a fan instead.

      "content": "Place cold washcloths or icepacks on your neck. [6] X Research source There are several methods you can use to get something cool enough to put on your forehead, face or the back of your neck. You can run a washcloth under cool or cold water, place an icepack or ice cubes inside a washcloth or towel (this method will last longer), or wet a washcloth and put it in the freezer before using it. Try making a rice pack and placing it in the freezer. This can be made with a cloth bag and dry rice or purchased as-is."

Put a pair of thicker socks overtop of your wet socks. Go to bed. [7] X Research source This is not recommended for diabetics, as they do not have good circulation or sensation in their feet.

Drink as much water or juice as you can, as often as you can. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Broths are also helpful since they contain some salt, which can help alleviate dehydration. Try having chicken soup or a similar broth to help treat colds or the flu. [11] X Research source An alternative to simply drinking a liquid is to suck on ice chips or popsicles. Because you have a fever and are probably very hot, this might also help you feel a little cooler, at least temporarily."

Note that it is not uncommon for an immunization with an active virus to give you temporary symptoms, including a fever, in the few days following the shot. Make sure you’re aware of these possible side effects by speaking to your doctor."
