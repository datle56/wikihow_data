      "content": "Get an HDMI adapter if you need one. If your digital camera has an HDMI output and you want to stream at a high quality, you can use an HDMI-to-USB adapter or capture card, such as the Elgato Cam Link 4K, MiraBox Capture Card, or Up Stream Video Capture Adapter. This is probably the easiest way to use your digital camera as a webcam, but if you don't have an HDMI-to-USB adapter or HDMI capture card already, it's definitely more expensive than using USB. Check out Using a USB Cable for an alternative to HDMI. If the HDMI output isn't \"clean,\" your streaming software will display everything on the camera's screen, including menus, timers, and battery notifications. [1] X Research source Check the manufacturer's website or your owner's manual to make sure you have a clean output. Most HDMI adapters/capture cards work on modern versions of Windows and macOS, but double-check the model before buying."

      "content": "Connect the HDMI adapter to the camera. You'll usually need a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable, but that varies by manufacturer. The smaller end goes into the camera, while the larger end plugs into the HDMI adapter. Most cameras have a built-in setting that lets you adjust the resolution delivered through HDMI. You might need to check the settings and adjust them to something that is compatible with the HDMI card. Depending on the model, you may also need to switch the camera's mode to Movie or Video mode, which is usually done by flipping a switch or turning a wheel on the camera. It's also a good idea to plug your camera into a power source—you wouldn't want to run out of batteries while streaming."

Once you've selected the camera, you're good to go! If you are not able to select your digital camera in the app and there's no streaming software available from your manufacturer, you may need to use a streaming app like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to receive the signal first."

Some new digital cameras, such as the FujiFilm X-47 and X-T200, are webcam-ready and USB-capable out of the box, meaning that you don't need to install the manufacturer's software or use an HDMI adapter to video chat or broadcast. [2] X Research source Check your camera's manual to see if there's a section about using it as a webcam (it may say \"streaming\" or \"video chat\"), and follow any included instructions. Some digital cameras require firmware updates to be used as webcams. Check your manufacturer's support site for instructions on updating your camera's firmware. Even if the manual doesn't mention anything about streaming or broadcasting, you'll usually be able to stream with it through HDMI or USB."

All of these work with Zoom, Twitch, Facebook Live, WebEx, OBS Studio, and other software. Just check the software's website to make sure it works with your model, operating system, and streaming or video chat software before buying."

Plug the smaller end of the cable into the camera, and the larger end into an available USB port on your computer. For best results, plug the USB port directly into the computer and not through an external USB hub. Make sure your camera is fully charged before you start streaming. If your camera isn't charging while connected via USB, you'll probably want to connect it to a power source before you get started. You wouldn't want to run out of batteries while streaming!"
