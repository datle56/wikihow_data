    {
      "title": "If he never had one before, that’s a red flag.",
      "content": "If he never had one before, that’s a red flag. Maybe you went to use his phone for something innocuous and noticed you couldn’t get in all of the sudden. It’s even more suspicious if he won’t tell you the password or he changes it right after telling you what it is. [1] X Research source It’s totally fine for people to have passwords on their phones (in fact, it’s safer to have one than not). However, if he’s super secretive about it, he might be hiding something."
    },
    {
      "title": "Or, he might swipe out of certain apps when he sees you.",
      "content": "Or, he might swipe out of certain apps when he sees you. If he was doing something innocent, he probably wouldn’t worry about you catching a glance at his screen. If you constantly see him swipe to the home screen or lock his phone when you come in the room, that’s a bad sign. [2] X Research source The same thing goes for his computer—if he exits out of tabs as soon as you walk in, he’s probably hiding something from you."

    {
      "title": "You might wake up to him texting when you thought he was asleep.",
      "content": "You might wake up to him texting when you thought he was asleep. Or, he might be texting someone while you two are out on a date. If you ask him about it, he might say that it’s “no one” or “just a friend.” However, friends don’t usually text each other 24/7, especially late at night. [3] X Research source Of course, he might actually just be texting a friend who is going through a tough time right now. If that’s the case, he should have no trouble telling you who it is and what they’re talking about."
    },
    {
      "title": "He might make a point to lock it before he leaves the room.",
      "content": "He might make a point to lock it before he leaves the room. It’s probably because he doesn’t want you to go through his phone. While it’s normal to lock your phone most of the time, you might notice him checking or double-checking it multiple times. [4] X Research source He might also turn his phone face down before he leaves the room. This is to prevent you from seeing any notifications that might pop up while he’s gone. Keep in mind that it’s normal for people to lock their phones, even if they have nothing to hide (think about how often you lock your phone before you set it down or leave the room). The problem arises when he’s doing it obsessively, especially around you."

    {
      "title": "You might notice this when you two are hanging out on the couch.",
      "content": "You might notice this when you two are hanging out on the couch. If he picks up his phone and subtly shifts his body away from you, that’s a red flag. If he had nothing to hide, he wouldn’t care if you caught a glimpse of his screen. [5] X Research source If you call him out for angling away from you, he’ll probably insist he was just getting comfortable."
    },
    {
      "title": "It probably means he didn’t want you to see them.",
      "content": "It probably means he didn’t want you to see them. If you happen to check his phone and there are chunks of the conversation missing, it means he’s been wiping them clean. This is a bad sign, since it most likely means he didn’t want any evidence left on his phone. [6] X Research source Keep in mind, though, that some people just like to free up their storage by deleting messages periodically."
    },
    {
      "title": "This might mean he doesn’t want to leave you alone with his phone.",
      "content": "This might mean he doesn’t want to leave you alone with his phone. If he makes a point to grab his cell before going anywhere (even the restroom), it’s a red flag. He’s keeping it close by in case any notifications pop up that he doesn’t want you to see. [7] X Research source However, if he’s using his phone for something (like listening to music while in the shower), try not to worry about it."
    },
    {
      "title": "He might even get mad when you use it to check the time.",
      "content": "He might even get mad when you use it to check the time. While you shouldn’t expect to have free access to his phone 24/7, partners usually let each other use their phones to order food or pick a new song to play on the radio. If he won’t even do that, it’s a red flag. [8] X Research source He might also insist on doing stuff on his phone himself, even when it’s inconvenient (like when he’s driving). Healthy relationship boundaries usually don’t include partners going through each other’s phones, so you shouldn’t expect to be able to scroll through his socials or his messages whenever you want.

      "title": "He’ll probably shift the blame onto you instead.",
      "content": "He’ll probably shift the blame onto you instead. If you’re scrolling through his phone and you find evidence that he’s flirting and you confront him about it, he’s probably going to act defensive and hurt. You may end up feeling guilty for invading his privacy, and the situation will probably go unresolved. [10] X Research source This is a classic manipulation tactic that a lot of people use to get out of trouble. While it may be true that you invaded his privacy, it doesn’t negate the fact that he was doing something wrong."

      "title": "If you think your boyfriend is cheating, it’s best to have a talk with him about it.",
      "content": "If you think your boyfriend is cheating , it’s best to have a talk with him about it. You can bring up any doubts you’re having and why you feel like he’s acting shady. If he’s not doing anything wrong, he’ll most likely be happy to talk it out and work on any issues. [11] X Expert Source Kelli Miller, LCSW, MSW Psychotherapist Expert Interview. 11 June 2020. If he is doing something he knows you won’t like, he probably won’t talk to you about it or he’ll just get angry. [12] X Research source You can bring it up by saying something like, “Could we talk? I’ve noticed that you’re on your phone a lot more lately and I’m starting to feel a little weird about it.”"
