    {
      "title": "Pick the purpose for your personal statement.",
      "content": "Pick the purpose for your personal statement. The basic structure and purpose of a personal statement can vary based on your goals and your field. You will emphasize different skills and focuses depending on the type of situation for which this personal statement will be used. [1] X Research source If you're writing a personal statement for undergraduate schools or scholarships focus on how your interests developed, your high school achievements, and your community involvement. If you're writing for an undergraduate transfer, focus on your academic and community record with your current school and describe your reasons for wanting to switch universities. If you're writing for graduate school, focus on the specific course you want your graduate project or studies to take, your reason for pursuing graduate school, and the undergraduate experiences that have prepared you. If you're writing for a job, portfolio, or to gain a particular client, focus on your past work experiences, your relevant academic accomplishments within the past 5 years, and your positive character traits. If you've been given a prompt for your personal statement, make sure you have a clear understanding of what it's asking for and what you should write."

    {
      "title": "Research your target institutions.",
      "content": "Research your target institutions. Start any personal statement by researching the institution or client that will read it. Read over the organization's mission statement, history, and recent newsletters or bulletins to see what they value in a potential student or employee. [2] X Research source Every institution and organization will look for content specific to their mission and goals in a personal statement. Don't send the same personal statement to different organizations, but instead personalize each statement you write. For example, if you're applying to a university that emphasizes community service and involvement, you'll want to emphasize your service work in that statement. Another school may value academics first though. For that school, talk about your coursework and grades."
    },
    {
      "title": "Define your academic and career goals.",
      "content": "Define your academic and career goals. Your goals are ultimately the focus of any personal statement. These goals let the reader know that choosing you will have a significant impact. You do not need to describe all your goals in your final statement, but list as many as possible as you brainstorm to make your goals clear and specific. To get started, ask yourself a range of questions like: How will this university/academic program/scholarship/job position/client directly impact my future? What project do I plan to undertake to complete this degree or job opportunity? What is my ultimate career goal? Where do I see myself in 1 year? 5 years? 10 years? What are the steps I need to take in order to reach my ultimate goal? What are other goals I hope to accomplish along the way?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask yourself why you should be chosen.",
      "content": "Ask yourself why you should be chosen. You will likely have plenty of competition, so you need to thoroughly describe what sets you apart from the rest of the crowd. Before you can convince the reader of your uniqueness, you need to convince yourself. Ask yourself a range of questions, such as: What personal qualities (leadership skills, organizational skills, self-control, etc.) do you possess which make you a valuable asset? What experiences and beliefs have shaped your present character? What accomplishments make you the proudest? Have you had any turning points that redirected your life in a positive way? Why would you choose yourself over other candidates? Why should anyone else?"

    {
      "title": "List your formal achievements.",
      "content": "List your formal achievements. While you should not include a straight list of achievements in your personal statement, some of your most significant achievements deserve to be mentioned. Writing out a list of your achievements will help you to recall each one and determine which to include. Formal achievements can include: Academic degrees and certificates Scholarships, fellowships, and grants Awards or honors from academic institutions (e.g. summa cum laude, manga cum laude, departmental honors, Dean's List, etc.) Workplace promotions, reviews, and evaluations Speaking at a conference, convention, or workshop Published works in your field of expertise Official recognition for community service or contributions"

      "title": "Outline how you reached this place in your life.",
      "content": "Outline how you reached this place in your life. Jot down a list of experiences and turning points in your life that led you to develop your current career or academic interests. Questions worth asking yourself include: When did you originally develop an interest in your field of choice? What do you love most about your field of choice? Why do you think your field of choice is important? What experiences have you had that have provided you with experience in the field? Have you given up any other dreams or expectations in order to chase after this one?"

    {
      "title": "Describe any challenges you have faced.",
      "content": "Describe any challenges you have faced. Challenges and difficulties can help foster interest in your story and make you more endearing. Everyone loves an underdog, and many people will be willing to assist you if they see that you have already worked hard to reach your current position. Possible challenges to explore include: [3] X Research source Financial difficulties Prejudice Social disenfranchisement Learning disabilities Physical disabilities Family problems Medical problems Unexpected tragedies"
    },
    {
      "title": "Read any specific questions mentioned.",
      "content": "Read any specific questions mentioned. Sometimes, an institution or organization will provide a list of specific questions or topics they want you to address. If this is the case, review the list carefully so that you can outline answers that directly answer those concerns. Often, these questions will be listed directly on the application, or otherwise on the job posting or program web page. If you're not sure if your application needs to address specific questions, reach out to the program coordinator or the contact person listed on the posting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Outline the basic structure of your statement.",
      "content": "Outline the basic structure of your statement. You will generally only have 1-2 pages to fit all of your information into your statement. Outlining your statement before you write will make sure you cover all your most salient points in your limited space. Try to pick 2-4 critical points to cover. [4] X Research source Prioritize the purpose of your statement in your outline. For example, if you're applying to a graduate program, your graduate project should be your main focus. Write about what interests you. You will be able to write more convincingly and more passionately if you write about events, goals, experiences, or ideas that you already feel passionate about. Address issues specifically brought up by the institution or organization. If there are any topics that the reader demands to see, then make sure that those are included in your personal statement."
    },
    {
      "title": "Create a strong beginning.",
      "content": "Create a strong beginning. Your first paragraph must grab the reader's attention. A strong introductory paragraph will clearly introduce the thesis or theme of your personal statement while creating a sense of narrative as if you're introducing a story. Use a personal anecdote to hook your readers. [5] X Research source Avoid starting with common or cliché phrases like, “The most important moment in my life was when...” A better way to introduce that “important moment” would be to simply start describing it. Explain that, “When I first started working at XYZ Company, I didn't know the first thing about widget manufacturing.” Directly break into the narrative instead of alerting the reader that you intend to do so. Provide as much detail in the first paragraph as possible. Introduce the main idea of your personal statement and describe how it connects to your narrative. Save any elaborate details or related notes and experiences for the body of your essay, though."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write a body to support your statement purpose.",
      "content": "Write a body to support your statement purpose. The paragraphs following your introduction should bolster your statement purpose. Focus each paragraph on a single point, and make sure you relate each point back to your statement purpose or the goals you mentioned. For example, for a graduate program statement, your second paragraph could focus on your undergraduate career. Frame your undergrad research, your relevant coursework, and your achievement as tools that helped prepare you for your graduate project. Do not be vague or general. Do tell the reader about experiences, goals, and ideas unique to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Maintain a positive tone.",
      "content": "Maintain a positive tone. Write in an optimistic, confident tone, even if you're addressing difficult subjects. Your statement should show how you will address problems and create solutions, and your tone should reflect that. Avoid uncertain or weak phrasing like, “I'm not sure but I think I would probably be a good fit for your program.” Even when discussing challenges or difficulties you faced, focus on your triumphs over those problems."
    },
    {
      "title": "Expand your statement if it's too short.",
      "content": "Expand your statement if it's too short. Your first draft can be as long or short as you need it to be, but many institutions and organizations have a word count or page count limits on personal statements. If your statement is not long enough, you have space to add more supporting information. [6] X Research source When expanding your personal statement, look for ways to elaborate on the information you already have. Include more specific detail to create a fuller picture. Alternatively, you could introduce another point that contributes to your overall statement purpose. While it's not advisable to submit a statement that's too short, you also shouldn't add information just for the sake of having it. If your statement is a paragraph short of a full page but covers all your relevant information, you don't need to expand it. Avoid telling the reader why something is important to you. Instead, explain what you've done to show and develop the skill."

    {
      "title": "Trim down your statement if it's too long.",
      "content": "Trim down your statement if it's too long. When trimming your personal statement down, scan the essay for any parts that do not directly address your point. You should also cut points that only serve to provide background information. [7] X Research source You may also consider reducing your number of main points if one point does not seem especially significant. Unlike a short statement, a long statement can't be left long. Many application programs won't allow you to press the submit button until your statement is the correct length. That means that if your statement is too long, it needs to be cut down."
    },
    {
      "title": "Read your personal statement aloud.",
      "content": "Read your personal statement aloud. Reading the piece out loud will give you a more accurate idea of how it sounds. As you read, listen for errors or clunky wording. You should also note any sentences that seem out of place or awkward. [8] X Research source While listening to your statement, ask yourself if it sounds like your natural voice. If you were describing these things in person, would the way you speak sound like what you wrote?"
    },
    {
      "title": "Ask for constructive criticism.",
      "content": "Ask for constructive criticism. Ask at least 3 people you trust, such as a professor, your business partner, or someone successful in your field, to read over your statement and make suggestions for improvements. Different sets of eyes may offer a more objective analysis regarding your statement's strengths and weaknesses. [9] X Research source Accept constructive criticism graciously and try not to take anything personally. When asking for constructive criticism, first go to professional sources like a high school teacher, a university professor, an internship supervisor, an academic adviser, or a trustworthy colleague. After your professional sources have been exhausted, ask friends and family for their thoughts. They may offer great insight regarding the “every-man” opinion, since not all your readers may be familiar with your program or industry. It's common to receive conflicting feedback. Think about each of their perspectives to see what may have influenced what they told you. If their experiences don't match your goals, consider if their advice is worth taking."

    {
      "title": "Proofread at least twice prior to submission.",
      "content": "Proofread at least twice prior to submission. Once you feel satisfied with the content of your personal statement, proofread it once for basic spelling and grammar errors. Then, set your statement aside for 3-4 days, and take a look at it again with fresh eyes. You may catch some errors you didn't find during your first read. [10] X Research source Once you fix these problems, your personal statement is ready to submit."
