Solo trips, such as business conferences or trade shows. Hanging out with single friends who are constantly looking for dates. Following people you’re attracted to on social media like Instagram. Flirting, sexting, or DMing anyone as a “fun distraction.” Keeping in touch with anyone you share a romantic history with."
