      "content": "This is the key to making her stop. Make her feel bad about bullying and try to shut her up so that she can't bother you. In other words, say something that she can't answer. Nevertheless, make sure it's not something that she can later make a comeback from. Showing her assertive energy can also help, in some cases; it doesn't need to be confrontational. [4] X Research source If she feels the need to say \"we\" or \"us\" and you know it's only her that's bullying you, it shows that she's a coward, and she is trying to intimidate you. They do that to make people scared."
