      "content": "Honey Honey is a light brown color that may appear golden or amber in the light. Honey-colored eyes are thought of as attractive and mysterious and contain less melanin than their darker brown variants. They are also less common than darker brown eyes and vary across regions, with lighter brown eyes being more prevalent in northern parts of Europe. Southern Europe leans darker on the brown eye spectrum. Honey brown eyes can appear to change color depending on lighting conditions. This color can range from a very light golden honey to a dimensional and intense caramel honey. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Cognac Cognac is another light brown color, as showcased in its shimmery appearance. Cognac is named after the brandy, which is slightly darker than honey and has rusty red undertones. Cognac eyes could also be mistaken for amber eyes. The color cognac is warm, subtle, and multi-dimensional. It mimics the lush and luxurious tones of autumn, with hints of fiery red and orange like the changing leaves. [2] X Research source It also looks stunning on people with almond eyes. This eye shape is oval and has a slightly elongated appearance, which complements cognac's light shimmer."

      "title": "Chestnut",
      "content": "Chestnut This is a lovely shade of medium brown. Chestnut is a romantic reddish hue that resembles chestnuts, as advertised. The color chestnut can also be used to describe other things like horses and hair. This shade of brown is deeper and darker than honey and cognac, with higher concentrations of melanin. [3] X Research source Chestnut eyes fall right down the middle of the brown color spectrum, resulting in a rich yet unique shade. People with round, chestnut-colored eyes can achieve a doe-eyed youthful look quite easily. Their eyes are naturally wide open and demure in appearance, traits which pair well with chestnut's warmth. Maroon is a color similar to chestnut, which is derived from the French word for “brown.”"

      "title": "Russet",
      "content": "Russet Russet brown is a darker version of chestnut, with more orange undertones. It’s viewed by many as a beautiful autumnal shade, the color of fox fur, and often worn by Mary, Queen of Scots. The word “russet” is likely to derive from the French “rousset” or “reddish” and is multilayered with undertones of orange and purple. [4] X Research source The word can also be used to describe something rustic or a coarse texture, leading to the well-known russet potato. Terra-cotta is a similar color, named after the brown clay used to make ceramics."

      "title": "Chocolate",
      "content": "Chocolate This shade is one of the darkest of the brown eyes, appearing like two deep pools of the gooey melted stuff. Chocolate brown eyes boast a profound, delicious, and almost edible shade of brown. This dark variation of brown eyes contain some of the highest levels of melanin, surpassed only by black-brown eyes. This deep shade is comforting and can make those with chocolate brown eyes appear more attractive, trustworthy, and empathetic. You can think of chocolate brown eyes as referring specifically to milk chocolate, reflected in its rich but creamy tone."

      "title": "Black-brown",
      "content": "Black-brown The darkest pair of peepers on the list, black-brown eyes contain the most melanin and are akin to dark chocolate. These kinds of eyes are most protected from the sun and can be found in the hottest climates, like Africa and Asia. The difference between the color of the pupil and the color of the iris is nearly indistinguishable in black-brown eyes, making them appear very mysterious, alluring, and exotic. [5] X Research source According to the color wheel, orange and black can be mixed to make brown, which is a good way to describe this dark variant. Black-brown eyes can look even darker and more attractive on people with hooded eyes (eyes with a drooping browbone). Especially when enhanced with a smoky eye! Dogs, rabbits, and elephants tend to have dark brown-black eyes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Hazel eyes are not considered a type of brown eye. Hazel eyes are actually a combination of brown, green, and gold. Most hazel eyes contain 2-3 of these colors, and this variable blend can make them seem like they’re changing colors. People with hazel eyes have less melanin than those with brown eyes, but more than those with green eyes, which is the rarest eye color, accounting for only 2% of the population. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hazel is a truly unique eye color, with some people having brown canvas with flecks of gold and green, green with flecks of gold and brown, or any variation of the three. Hazel is one of the trickiest eye colors to define, as its appearance often depends on light, complexion, and the color of clothing a person is wearing. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Amber eyes may be considered as brown eyes.",
      "content": "Amber eyes may be considered as brown eyes. Amber eyes are very rare, making up only 5% of the population. Amber eyes are named after the gemstone, which is orange-yellow in color. This hue is due to the high levels of pheomelanin, which is one of the two subcategories of melanin in the iris. Pheomelanin is orange-red in hue, underscoring the warm glow in the amber gaze. [9] X Research source Some scientists still categorize amber as brown, although amber eyes can be several shades lighter and yellower in tone. Brown eyes contain more melanin than amber eyes, or the brown-black subcategory of melanin, which tips the scales over to the dark side."

      "content": "Brown eyes are the most common eye color. However, that doesn’t mean that they all look the same! Shades of brown vary from a very light honey brown to almost black. Brown eyes are most prevalent in Africa and Asia, making up about half of their populations. People with brown eyes have more melanin, which is a pigment that adds a darker tint to our eyes, hair, and skin. [10] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source All humans are believed to have had brown eyes up until about 10,000 years ago, when a common ancestor had a genetic mutation that resulted in lower melanin and, thus, lighter eyes. All eyes are technically brown, but how they appear in color has everything to do with melanin and the scattering of light. If the iris, or the colored part of the eye, contains less melanin, it reflects more light, therefore leading to lighter-looking shades like green, blue, and hazel."

      "title": "Brown eyes are caused by a dominant gene.",
      "content": "Brown eyes are caused by a dominant gene. High levels of melanin cause brown eyes, and scientists have discovered about 150 different genes that contribute to melanin production. The brown eye allele, called EYCL3, is dominant. There are a ton of genetic complexities and possible mutations to consider, but the likelihood of two blue-eyed people having a brown-eyed child is still high, as brown is dominant and blue is recessive. [11] X Research source Melanin determines the color of the eye and increased amounts of melanin result in darker brown shades. Decreased amounts of melanin lead to lighter browns, greens, and blues. Eye color is inherited, but the intricate combination of genes makes predicting eye color relatively difficult. Many Caucasian babies are born with little to no melanin, having blue eyes at birth. As they grow, melanin production increases, which is why eye color tends to darken as babies get older. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear green, blue, and purple eyeshadows. According to color theory, these kinds of colors can help bring out the natural gold tones in brown eyes, helping them appear richer and more vibrant. Colors like amethyst , cobalt blue , pink , and teal best accentuate brown eyes and can be applied as eyeshadow all over the eye for a dramatic look. You can also find these colors in eyeliner pencils, opting for a fun pop in the corner of the eye. [13] X Research source D'Angelo suggests experimenting with bright colors, stating that “any contrasting shade like pink, purple, or blue will draw more attention to the eyes in general, making the eye color appear a richer, deeper brown.” D’Angelo recommends applying “sweeping soft, warm neutral brown tones in the crease [of the eye]” and pressing a “shimmering green, bronze or golden tone across the lid for a sexy, sultry look.” Use color to adapt your makeup look to the different seasons while still complementing your brown eyes' rich hue. For example, in winter, apply more jeweled tones like emerald and deep purple. Then in the spring, switch to lighter colors like pink and teal."

      "content": "Try metallic eyeliners to bring out the glimmer in brown eyes. A touch of gold can add that X-factor to your makeup look, complimenting the warm radiance of brown eyes. D’Angelo explains that adding gold shimmers can bring out the amber in the eye, which will, in turn, render the eye color lighter. Bronze and copper eyeliners can offer a similar glittery effect with a bit more subtlety. These shades have metallic undertones and are a cross between brown and gold. Metallic shades can add depth and razzle-dazzle without too much pigmentation, allowing those beautiful brown orbs to shine on their own."

      "content": "Create a smokey eye to enhance the intensity of brown eyes. A smokey-eyed look is perfect for brown eyes, intensifying their deep luscious color. The key to achieving a perfectly seductive smokey eye that still makes brown eyes pop is to lead with a brighter color, like blue or purple. [14] X Research source As Redugerio recounts, “when I say, ‘I'm going to put purple on your eyes,’ I know people tend to freak out because they think of the brightest fuchsia purple possible, but there's a classier way to apply it.” Although purple or plum would be the focal colors, Redugerio suggests blending it in with more golden browns and a bit of black. “The number one key to a beautiful smokey eye is to build up to it,” she offers. Redugerio notes that a common mistake for beginners is that they start with the darkest color first and lay it on thick. Instead, she advises that it’s easier to build more pigment than to remove, even if the process takes longer. According to Redugerio, trying to remove deeply pigmented color from your skin is how one ends up “looking like a raccoon,” so avoid this at all costs!"

      "content": "Use colored mascara in blue or burgundy to make brown eyes pop. Brown eyes certainly benefit from the lengthening, volumizing, and darkening powers of regular black mascara, adding to the seduction of the sultry brown-eyed gaze. But if you really want to have fun and stand out, try a colored mascara! For brown eyes, picking colors opposite on the color wheel is advised. These include bright blue and burgundy . [15] X Research source For darker brown eyes, the pop of blue will enhance the cool tones in the eyes, creating a noticeably different yet stylish look. Burgundy mascara can bring out the gold undertones in lighter brown eyes, framing your gaze in a unique and elegant glow."

Jet black hair can be used to enhance the dark beauty of your brown eyes, adding to your air of mystery, confidence, and seduction. The intense black of your hair will help your eyes appear brighter, resulting in a bold yet timeless look. Ebony hair can highlight the gold or amber flecks in lighter brown eyes.

A head of luscious chocolate brown locks coupled with copper or caramel highlights is perfect for brown eyes, adding depth and dimension in every way. If you choose copper highlights, these will better illuminate the orangey tones in amber and chestnut eyes, while caramel highlights will compliment the golden flecks present in hazel and honey-colored eyes. You can ask your stylist to play up the red of the copper, adding drama to your look. Just like eyeliner, golden pops of color in your hair can add nuance and brightness to your overall look."

Depending on your current shade, you might want to go darker or lighter. Toffee brown contact lenses add warmth and richness to your naturally brown eyes, resulting in a unique and alluring set of peepers. [17] X Research source If your eyes are naturally a darker brown, hazel contact lenses could be the perfect accessory to any outfit. Hazel contact lenses are typically three-toned, reflecting the kaleidoscopic nature of hazel eyes, and they can add a luminous, shimmery quality to your brown eyes. For a less realistic, more supernatural look, try some gray-brown contact lenses on for size. These contacts can give your eyes an otherworldly appearance, resembling that of majestic wolves."

      "title": "Brown-eyed people are less vulnerable to light and some diseases.",
      "content": "Brown-eyed people are less vulnerable to light and some diseases. The melanin in the iris adds a layer of protection, so brown eyes allow less light to pass through. This is part of the reason why brown-eyed folk tend to populate sunny, warm places, like Africa and Southeast Asia. High levels of melanin in the eyes, skin, and hair help protect people against these hot, tropical conditions. People with brown eyes are less susceptible to some diseases, like eye cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration. Due to UV exposure, however, brown eyes are more likely to develop cataracts than their blue or green-eyed counterparts. [18] X Research source"

It’s not exactly good news for those of us with brown eyes, but a 2014 study showed that people with brown eyes have a lower pain tolerance than most others. 58 pregnant women were surveyed, and the results unveiled that the 24 brown-eyed women suffered from significantly more pain, discomfort, sleep issues, and depression than the blue-eyed pregnant women. [21] X Research source Even after receiving epidural analgesia, the brown-eyed participants reported more signs of emotional and physical distress.
