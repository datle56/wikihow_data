Buy the essentials such as clothes, blankets, diapers, bottles, pacifiers, a deluxe stroller, a car seat, reborn doll milk formula [this is usually fabric softener or glue and water], baby wipes, and toddler toys.

Perhaps you should prepare a warm bottle of milk for them, or cover them up in a warm blanket to take a nice long nap. Whatever you choose, be prepared to repeat it every day to create your daily reborn mommy routine. You can also spend some time holding the reborn or child and sitting with them, so that you can become confident and comfortable with your reborn doll. Make sure to always care for your doll just like you would a newborn."

      "content": "Take your baby out for a stroll. Walk through the neighborhood with your deluxe baby stroller, give them a pacifier and make it all snuggled up in the stroller with a blanket or summer clothes if it is hot outside. You could also carry a diaper bag. This could include extra diapers, a baby bottle, a changing blanket, and extra pacifiers & extra clothes [winter or summer]. You can use these items in the same way you would if you had a child or newborn or toddler. Alternatively, place your reborn essentials into the bottom of your stroller in your diaper bag. Or, you can put them in your reborn’s booster seat in your car and take them for a ride around town or take them for long car rides until they fall asleep just like you would with a newborn or toddler."
