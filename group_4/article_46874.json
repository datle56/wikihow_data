      "title": "Be aware that many Indian toilets are squat toilets.",
      "content": "Be aware that many Indian toilets are squat toilets. If you are pregnant, elderly, or have a disability, you might find it difficult to squat and use Indian toilets. While India is making improvements to accommodate people with disabilities, know that most toilets are squat toilets. To make navigating India easier, search for accessible restrooms in the area that you’re visiting and plan out your route before you arrive. Search the internet for Western toilets and toilets with ramps, handrails, and Braille signs. Ask hotel concierges and city guides where to find accommodations. Stay near public places such as railway lines. These are areas where the government is improving disability access. More urban areas and cities like New Delhi typically have more accessible restrooms and Western-style toilets than less traveled or rural areas. [1] X Research source Children use the same toilets as adults."

      "title": "Check the bathroom for water.",
      "content": "Check the bathroom for water. Squat toilets in India don’t use toilet paper. Instead, they use water to rinse areas that come into contact with waste. Because toilet paper isn't used, you’ll typically find a spray hose or a bucket of water in its place. Before using the toilet, make sure there is a water source available; some people use the water before anyone notices and refills the bucket. Most bathrooms have either a spray hose for cleaning or a bucket of water with a bowl or mug. If there isn’t any water, find a different toilet."

      "title": "Look for soap before going into the toilet stall.",
      "content": "Look for soap before going into the toilet stall. Always check that there is soap or hand sanitizer available to wash your hands when you’re done. It’s cultural practice to use your left hand to clean yourself, as Indians use their right hand to eat. To properly disinfect your hands, just make sure to choose a toilet that has soap available. When traveling in India, carry wipes, soap, or hand sanitizer with you in case you use a bathroom without soap available. This reduces your need to search for an alternative bathroom in an emergency."

      "title": "Spray a little water on and around the toilet.",
      "content": "Spray a little water on and around the toilet. This is optional, but pouring a little water around the toilet helps prevent your shoes from sticking to the floor. Spray a bit inside the toilet as well to make it easier for you to wash away waste later. [2] X Research source Simply dip the mug or bowl in the bucket or use the spray hose. Use enough water to wet the floor without making the floor slippery. Leave enough water to use on yourself later."

      "content": "Check for a place to hang your pants. You might find it easiest to remove your pants and undergarments when using a squat toilet for the first time. Some restrooms have hooks for your clothes, while others have pipes and other features that give you a place to hang your clothes and valuables. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Drop your pants.",
      "content": "Drop your pants. The best way to avoid getting water and waste on your pants and underwear is to remove them entirely. Some bathrooms have hooks or other places to hang them. If not, find a creative way to wrap your clothes around a pipe or other feature. [4] X Research source You don’t have to remove your clothing to use a squat toilet, but you might find it more comfortable at first. Once you’re more experienced, just pull down your pants to your knees and roll up your pant legs. If you are wearing a skirt or dress, bunch it up with your hand or fold it over your lap."

      "title": "Position yourself correctly over the toilet.",
      "content": "Position yourself correctly over the toilet. The squat toilet forms a u-shape on the ground with a hole towards the back end. The correct way to use a squat toilet is similar to how you use a Western toilet. Face your back to the wall and align your backside over the hole. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Secure your footing.",
      "content": "Secure your footing. Some toilets have foot pads on each side of the toilet. While standing, place your feet on either side of the toilet with the hole positioned behind you. If there are no foot pads, place a foot on each side of the toilet about shoulder-width apart."

      "title": "Squat over the toilet opening.",
      "content": "Squat over the toilet opening. A squat toilet functions the same as an upright, Western toilet except it has no seat. To find a comfortable position, bend your knees and lower yourself to a crouching position with your feet flat against the ground. Imagine you’re balancing weights on your shoulders until you reach a semi-sitting position. [6] X Research source Find a position that’s comfortable for you. Many people keep their thighs together and let their arms rest on their knees."

      "title": "Wash your private areas with the available water.",
      "content": "Wash your private areas with the available water. Use the cup provided to pour water on your backside. Or, rinse your bottom off with the spray hose if one is available. Reach between your legs with your left hand and wiggle your fingers quickly to clean yourself. If you need more water, pour it with your right hand as you clean with your left. The water plus your hand movements cleans away waste, keeping your left hand relatively clean. In India, it is common to clean with your left hand and only use your right hand to pour the water or throw it up towards your bottom. Wipe away from your genitals as you clean yourself. Clean yourself with about 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water. It might seem unusual to you at first, but using water is often cleaner than using toilet paper."

      "content": "Throw toilet paper in the trash can. If there is toilet paper in the restroom or you brought your own, don’t put it down the hole. The plumbing for squat toilets isn’t designed for toilet paper. If you throw it down the hole, you can cause a clog. Instead, throw away your toilet paper in a trash can. Some restrooms don’t have trash cans, so bring a storage bag with you to dispose of your toilet paper. When you find a trash can, throw away the bag."

      "content": "Flush the toilet. If the toilet has a water tank above the toilet, just pull the handle like you would in a Western-style toilet to flush. Some squat toilets have hanging flush chains, so simply pull the chain to flush the toilet. If the toilet you’re using doesn’t have a flush mechanism, spray or pour water into the toilet to wash any waste away. [8] X Research source"
