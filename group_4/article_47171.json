      "content": "“Vro” stands for Very Rare Only and is used in place of bro. When it first became popular, “vro” was used unironically as another word for “bro.” In late 2023, however, it became a term that was used ironically on TikTok. Users usually use the term in comments, stylized as “𝓗𝓮𝓵𝓵𝓸 𝓥𝓻𝓸 ❤️,” to ironically greet other users. The term is also used in memes with photos of cute animals or regular people being captioned with “Hello Vro” accompanied by a heart. [1] X Research source Very Rare Only refers to XXXTentacion and Ski Mask The Slump God’s music collective of the same name. In other contexts, VRO stands for Value Realization Office. A Value Realization Office oversees Value Realization, which is the ability to measure how people and projects directly impact large business objectives, specifically objectives that are executive-level.

      "content": "“Vro” was popularized by late rapper XXXTentacion in 2015. In his track “Look at Me,” the rapper sings a line that reads, “she kick me out I’m like Vro.” After the track went viral on Soundcloud, fans incorporated the term into their vocabulary. Fans often used it to identify fellow XXXTentacion and Ski Mask The Slump God listeners. “Vro” has since been used in place of “bro” by hardcore XXXTentacion fans, but it is also used in an ironic way by various people on the internet."

      "content": "Use “vro” to refer to a friend you care about—but in an ironic way. While “vro” is a term of endearment, its outdatedness and TikTok virality have caused it to be a term that is best used ironically. Using it regularly runs the risk of people looking at you like an XXXTentacion super-fan! So, to get a laugh out of your friend or annoy them with an unserious greeting, text them “good morning vro” with a heart. Make sure to include the heart (or a winky face ) so they know you’re being ironic. Be careful when using this term with people that you don’t know. Even if you use it ironically, people may think that you’re unfunny. [3] X Research source If you are a hardcore fan of XXXTentacion or Ski Mask The Slump God and want to communicate with other fans, use “vro” in place of “bro” in a sincere way. For example, when discussing their discographies with fellow fans online, say “Yooo vro, what’s your favorite X and Ski collab?”"
