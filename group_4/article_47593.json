      "content": "Invest in chains made with high-quality materials. Make a commitment to your new fashion statement by purchasing a chain made with nice metals, like silver, gold, or platinum. It’s completely fine if you can’t afford something really pricey—what matters most is that you pick up some jewelry made with real metal, and not something cheap, like plastic. [1] X Research source You can get some metal chains for under $30, depending on what you’re looking for. The type of metal you choose really depends on your personal preference. Silver is a more universal chain material, while gold may have a confident, luxurious connotation attached to it."

      "content": "Pick out a necklace that’s around 24 in (61 cm) long or so. Think about where you’d like your chain to fall along your chest. Note that 18 in (46 cm) long necklaces will fall slightly beneath your neck, while 20 to 22 in (51 to 56 cm) long chains fall somewhere around your collarbone. If you’d like your chain to be front and center, choose one that’s at least 24 in (61 cm) long, which will dangle around the center of your chest. If you’re really tall or have an especially large build, you may want to buy a chain that’s slightly larger."
