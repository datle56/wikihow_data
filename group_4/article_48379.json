      "content": "Keep the patch on until it has turned cloudy. Take your patch off once you notice it has raised or turned a milky opaque, before the skin becomes dry. Some patches can be kept on for days depending on the amount of liquid, but it’s generally recommended to take off or change your patch every 24 hours.

To help prevent this, use a gentle face wash to clear away any germs.

      "content": "Apply another patch if you see extra fluid. After removing your patch and washing your face, you may notice some additional pus from your pimple. In that case, put on another patch to help dry up the rest. A pimple that isn’t completely drained may reoccur. [4] X Trustworthy Source American Chemical Society Scientific society for those involved with chemistry and publisher of several leading peer-reviewed scientific journals Go to source If you removed your pimple patch and it burst or bled after, you likely removed the patch too early. Once you’ve cleaned up the area, pop on another patch to finish the job. Before you apply another patch, dab on a small amount of antibiotic ointment to help the healing process. Keep using patches until you no longer see pus. After that, you can move on with your routine."

      "title": "Exfoliate your face once you remove the patch.",
      "content": "Exfoliate your face once you remove the patch. Sloughing away the dead skin helps promote skin regeneration and lessens the chance for scarring. After you’ve removed the second patch and your pimple has dried, exfoliate your entire face as usual. Although some people recommend being gentle when exfoliating, that's not necessary. If you use an exfoliating scrub , choose one without large exfoliants like nut shells or microbeads. These can cause microtears in your skin that can irritate your healing wound or cause new ones. Chemical exfoliators often reach deeper into the skin for a more thorough effect. Look for ones with alpha and beta hydroxy acids, or fruit enzymes if you have more sensitive skin."

      "content": "Avoid makeup directly on that area. Makeup can be irritating for a healing wound. Until the pimple is completely healed, don’t apply any foundation or concealer on it. Makeup can clog your pores, making it difficult for your skin to breathe and, as a consequence, heal.

However, hands can be covered in bacteria that could reinfect the area—or cause a worse infection!

However, even with washed hands, bothering your healing pimple will slow down the healing process. It’s best to just leave your skin alone."

      "content": "Choose plain hydrocolloid patches if you have sensitive skin. The most basic pimple patches are made of hydrocolloid, a highly absorbent material used to treat wounds. Although extra chemicals in the patch may give you a boost in healing, if you have more sensitive skin, plain hydrocolloid is best.

Not only will the hydrocolloid absorb the liquid in your current pimple, but the medication will help keep it from coming back.

These are great options in terms of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action, as they help dry the pimple out and reduce inflammation."

If your pimple has already burst prior to patching it, be sure to clean up any pus or blood, as well.
