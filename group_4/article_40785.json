Do an internet search, look in the local phone book, and pay close attention to advertisements on local television to identify similar businesses in your area.

      "content": "Identify supply sources. The more you have on hand, the better. In the beginning, it may be hard to invest in the right parts. Start small, and seek parts you know people are looking for. You can also invest money in parts you know are necessary and are expensive when purchased brand-new. This way, people will more often seek out the used parts you have. Identifying the parts you need and where to find them depends largely on your business plan. Your business may choose to focus on providing parts for rare vehicles not in production anymore, as these will be in high demand among a small segment of the population. Alternatively, you may choose to specialize in providing parts for very common vehicles in an effort to expand your potential sales base. Try finding these parts in junkyards, from cars sold at salvage auctions, or contact insurance agencies to try to purchase \"scrapped\" cars from them at a discounted price. As a used auto parts business owner, you will need to educate yourself on the mechanics of how a car operates in order to find the right parts. Also, be prepared to test the parts you find to know if they are still operational or can be refurbished to become operational again."

      "content": "Establish repeat business. One of the main goals of any business to establish a reliable customer base who will bring in repeat business. This can be particularly difficult with used auto parts businesses because the needs of customers are intermittent and specific. However, you could offer a repeat customer discount, a frequent-buyer card, or other special offers to entice customers to come back. Offer to take the old parts from your customers who purchase their used parts from you. You may be able to salvage car parts, refurbish them for a low cost, and place them back on your shelf. You could also consider offering a discount to customers who bring “trade-in” parts to your business. Consider selling online. When you deal with very specific parts for specific vehicles, you may find that no one in your immediate area will need the parts you are offering. As a result, it is wise to consider listing your inventory online to reach a much wider customer base. If you do choose to sell parts online, you need to account for the cost of packaging, shipping and handling in your prices and business model."
