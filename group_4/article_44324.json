Marriott and United share the RewardsPlus linked membership program. You can convert miles to Marriott Reward points at a 1-to-1 ratio. The points to miles ratio depends on the transfer amount. For instance, you can convert 8,000 points to 2,000 miles, 16,000 points to 5,000 miles, and 24,000 points to 10,000 miles.

After logging in, you'll see separate links to transfer miles to points and to convert points to miles. Select your desired option, enter the amount you want to transfer, and click submit. For other partner programs, such as Hyatt, log into your account and look for a convert points and miles link. Select United as your preferred air carrier (if you didn't when you created your account), provide your MileagePlus number, and enter how many points you'd like to convert."

Some partnerships award bonuses for making transfers and purchasing vacation packages, so they can be a great way to earn extra points or miles. [9] X Research source For example, suppose you have 175,000 Marriott Rewards points. A 7-day package that includes hotel accommodations and 50,000 award miles for airfare costs 200,000 points. Make up the difference by transferring 25,000 United miles to your RewardsPlus account at a 1-to-1 ratio. The points should transfer immediately, then you can book the vacation package. Since you’re converting your miles to purchase a partnered vacation package, you’ll also earn 5,000 bonus miles, or 10 percent of the award miles included in the package. If there's an issue with a transfer between United miles and Marriott points, call RewardsPlus customer service at 1-801-468-4000 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
