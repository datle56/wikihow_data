When you bake with stevia, you'll want to use 1/2 the amount of sugar you would normally use (or even less).

      "title": "Mask the aftertaste.",
      "content": "Mask the aftertaste. Stevia can have a licorice-y aftertaste, which some find bitter. Rather than using stevia that contains artificial additives (intended to mask the taste), you can add a small squirt of agave nectar (which has a low glycemic index), lemon juice, or lime juice to help mask this bitterness."

      "content": "Use stevia leaves to sweeten tea. If you have access to a fresh stevia plant (or if you have grown your own), you can use fresh stevia leaves as a sweetener. This helps you to eliminate the presence of additives and save money. To sweeten a cup of hot tea, simply remove 1-4 small leaves from your plant and place them in hot water with your tea bag. Remove the leaves after several minutes.

      "content": "Create dry leaf powder. You have two options for drying your stevia leaves. You can either pluck 8 or more leaves from your plant and place them between 2 paper towels, or simply remove an entire stevia stalk and hang it upside down. In either case, leave your stevia leaves in a cool, dry place for a few days. Then grind the dry leaves using a mortar and pestle. [7] X Research source Use this green powder to sweeten drinks, breakfast cereal, or curries. 1 teaspoon of this stevia powder is equal to approximately 10 teaspoons of sugar. This pure form of stevia will have a licorice-y or slightly bitter aftertaste."
