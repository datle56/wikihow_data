Picking out a knot or matt can be really stressful and might damage your hair. Fortunately, conditioner or oil can lubricate the strands, making it easier to pull them apart. Put a dollop of conditioner or oil onto your palm, then gently apply it to your hair. Use as much product as you need to saturate the tangled area. [2] X Research source You can use your normal conditioner, a leave-in conditioner, or oil from your kitchen, such as olive or coconut oil. The conditioner or oil will also reduce the risk of damage when you try to untangle your hair."

      "content": "Use your fingers to gently pull apart big knots. [3] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. Your fingers are less likely to cause breakage and damage than a comb or brush. Start by running your fingers through your hair, stopping when you hit resistance. Then, slowly pull apart areas that are knotted. Run your fingers through your hair again to see if the tangles are gone. [4] X Research source You may want to do this a few times until you can run your fingers through your hair without them getting stuck. Detangling with your fingers first allows you to pinpoint and loosen any problem tangles before you go in with a comb. It’s more gentle than a comb as well, which means less pain for you."

[5] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. Start at your ends and pick out any remaining knots. Then, slowly work your way up to your roots. Finally, comb down the entire length of your hair-shaft. [6] X Research source Since you’ve already broken up the major knots and mats with your fingers, this shouldn’t take very long. If you’re still struggling with a tangled area, you might want to try using your fingers again."

      "title": "Cut above a very stubborn knot that’s near your ends.",
      "content": "Cut above a very stubborn knot that’s near your ends. Sometimes a knot just won’t come out and you have no choice but to cut it out. Generally, this happens near your ends, which are more likely to be damaged. If you’re having trouble getting the knot out, snip just above the knot using the ends of a pair of scissors. This will minimize damage from trying to pull apart the knot. [7] X Research source While this will cause uneven ends, the cut strands should blend back into your hair. Use hair scissors if you have them. They’re sharper than regular scissors so they make a cleaner cut."

      "content": "Divide your hair into 4 sections so it’s easier to break up mats. Sectioning your hair will save you a lot of time and may reduce the risk of damaging your hair. [8] X Expert Source Gina Almona Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 12 December 2019. Use a rattail comb or your fingers to section your hair down the middle of your head. Then, divide your hair again from ear-to-ear. Use a hair clip to secure each section to your head. [9] X Research source If your hair is very thick or long, you might make 6 sections. After you divide your hair down the middle, section it along your temples and at the lower part of your ears. It’s really hard to detangle a whole head of hair without sectioning it off. Working 1 section at a time will make the job easier."

Place about a coin-sized amount of conditioner or oil into your hand, then rub your hands together. Gently slide your palms over the section of hair you’re working on to apply the product. Add more conditioner or oil as necessary to saturate your hair. [11] X Research source You can use a regular conditioner, leave-in conditioner, or any oil, such as olive or coconut oil. This will lubricate your hair so it’s easier to pull apart, and it helps minimize damage. Always section your hair first so it’s easier to apply the product evenly. If you apply the conditioner or oil first, you’ll likely miss spots."

      "content": "Pick out knots at your ends first using a wide-tooth comb. Start at your ends because it’s easier and less damaging for your hair. Use your comb to gently pull apart the knots or mats. Keep working until your comb goes through your ends easily. [12] X Research source If you try to start combing up near your roots, your comb will probably get stuck on the way down. This also makes the knots and mats worse because the pressure from the comb will tighten the tangles."

      "content": "Work your way up to your roots as you untangle the hair. Once you untangle your ends, move up to the mid-shaft and keep working. Continue untangling the section until you can run your comb from your roots to the tips without meeting any resistance. [13] X Research source Make sure you remove all of the tangles before you move your comb higher. Otherwise, you might damage your hair."

      "title": "Focus on 1 section at a time until they’re all detangled.",
      "content": "Focus on 1 section at a time until they’re all detangled. Wait until you’ve finished an entire section before you unclip the next section. Coat each section with conditioner or oil, then start again at the ends. Keep working until all of your hair is tangle-free! [14] X Research source For instance, you might do the bottoms sections first and then move to the top sections."

      "content": "Take your time so you don’t damage your hair. You’re probably in a hurry to get finished and might have places to go. However, you can cause a lot of damage and pain by pulling at the knots too fast. Go slowly so the process is easier on your hair — and your scalp. [15] X Research source Try to stay patient. If you rush, you might damage your hair or break off some strands. The time it takes to untangle each section can vary, depending on how tangled your hair is. For instance, it might be more tangled in the back than in the front, so you might spend more time on the back."

      "title": "Squeeze water out of your hair after a shower instead of rubbing it.",
      "content": "Squeeze water out of your hair after a shower instead of rubbing it. Hair is more delicate when it’s wet, and towel drying it may damage your tresses. Instead of rubbing your hair with a towel, gently press the towel around your locks to blot away excess water. Doing this reduces the risk of accidentally damaging your hair. Plus, it creates fewer tangles. [16] X Research source Some people prefer using cotton T-shirts to dry their hair because the material is gentler on hair than bath towels are."

      "content": "Spray a leave-in conditioner on your hair after showering. Leave-in conditioner provides a ton of benefits, including making it much easier to remove tangles. Follow the instructions on your leave-in product to apply it to your hair. Concentrate the product on your ends up to the mid-shaft. Try not to apply much, if any, on your roots because it can make them look greasy. [17] X Research source If you have very thick or textured hair, it’s best to section your hair into 2 to 4 sections when applying your leave-in conditioner. This helps you evenly distribute the product."

While you’re asleep, it's normal to shift around, which can leave you with unmanageable hair. Fortunately, this is a super easy problem to solve. Simply wrap your hair in a high bun or put it in a loose braid before you go to bed. [24] X Research source If you’re not washing your hair in the morning, a bun might be better if you’re going for a straight hairstyle or want to preserve your natural curl pattern.

[27] X Research source Keep in mind that split ends can spread up your hair shaft if you don’t get them cut. This causes a lot more damage to your hair, so don’t skip trims."
