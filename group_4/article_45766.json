Necromancer makes you square-shaped and transforms normal squares you (or your drones) collide with into square drones you can control. Factory makes your tank square as well, and will produce up to 6 drones that are like mini tanks (there is even a chance a new player will spawn on you). Battleship has four trapezoid spawners attached to it like Twin Flank but with the spawners being smaller. It uses Drones of its teamâ€™s color.
