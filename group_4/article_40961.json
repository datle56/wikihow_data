It's best also to keep your pantry near your kitchen. Be creative. You can use a cabinet in your kitchen, garage (if it doesn't get too hot or cold), cellar, or even a nearby closet or bin. If no space is built in, be creative and create your own. [1] X Research source"

For example, you have spaghetti two nights a week, and meat loaf on the weekends. For these, you always need the same items: pasta, ground beef, bread crumbs, tomato sauce, Parmesan cheese, a loaf of Italian bread, a couple of eggs, etc. Write these items on your list."

To keep them fresh and bug-free, use mason jars with screw-on lids, keeping one type of lentil, bean or rice in each, and write it on top along with the date. They look nice in there, too.

Just make sure to use them promptly. Oils and sauces: olive oil, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and so on. Many sauces require refrigeration, so read the labels first. Baking supplies: baking soda, chocolate chips, salt, cooking spray. Canned goods. Prepared foods and snacks: crackers, cookies, dried fruit, chips, and anything else you like for munching."
