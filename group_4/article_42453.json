      "content": "Treat anemia with an iron-only supplement. Schedule a doctor’s appointment if you think you have an iron deficiency. They'll perform an exam and order a blood test to make an accurate diagnosis. To correct an iron deficiency, they’ll recommend iron-only tablets or capsules, which often contain at least 65 mg (360% daily value) of iron. [4] X Research source You may need to take higher-dose iron supplements if you have cancer, bleeding problems, kidney disease, Crohn’s disease, Celiac disease, or ulcerative colitis. These conditions often cause iron and other vitamin deficiencies. Consuming too much iron is dangerous if you don't have a serious deficiency, so do not try to take high doses of over-the-counter iron supplements. Never take high-dose iron unless directed by a doctor."

      "content": "Ask your doctor to recommend the right dosage amount. Whether you take an iron supplement in pill or liquid form, use it as your doctor prescribes. Depending on your specific condition, your doctor may prescribe a dose of iron that’s unsafe for people with normal iron levels.

      "title": "Take iron on an empty stomach with juice and a small amount of food.",
      "content": "Take iron on an empty stomach with juice and a small amount of food. Taking your supplement on an empty stomach improves absorption, but it may cause stomach cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. To lower the risk of an upset stomach, take the supplement with 1 cup (240 mL) of orange juice and a snack or light meal. [7] X Research source Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron, so it’s a good idea to take your supplement with orange juice. While taking iron supplements, you should also eat more foods that are rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, cantaloupe, mango, strawberries, and tomato. Just be wary of eating raw high-fiber fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli and cabbage, within 2 hours of taking your supplement. Fiber can interfere with iron absorption."

If you take iron with food, make sure you steer clear of dairy products, whole grains, and raw high-fiber veggies. Additionally, don’t drink caffeinated tea, coffee, or soda, and avoid sneaky sources of caffeine, such as chocolate. [8] X Research source You should also avoid consuming calcium supplements and antacids within 2 hours of taking an iron supplement.
