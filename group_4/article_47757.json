That’s not to say that this pairing is totally star-crossed—but both partners will have to communicate freely and honestly to make sure they want the same things overall. Sagittariuses have a real need for freedom and space. For this relationship to work out, Taurus needs to be wiling to give their partner some extra breathing room."

      "content": "Be patient with them. For better or for worse, Tauruses march to the beat of their own drum. Try not to rush them into making decisions, and give them as much time as they need to make a decision or come to an opinion about something. Keep in mind that Taurus is considered a “fixed” sign in the zodiac—it’s hard to get a fixed bull to move unless it really wants to."

Disagreements are inevitable in any relationship, but a Taurus may often find themselves at odds with free-spirited signs like Aquarius and Sagittarius. Being willing to meet in the middle is a great way to sidestep potential disagreements and conflicts while keeping both partners happy. If a Sagittarius wants to go on a week-long trip, the Taurus could suggest going on a weekend excursion instead. If Aries wants to go to a last-minute concert, Taurus might suggest booking tickets for a concert a few weeks in the future."
