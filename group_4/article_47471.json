      "content": "“WBK” stands for “we been knew.” “We been knew” is a joking, slang phrase that means something is very obvious or well-known. You usually use it mockingly in response to someone saying something you have known about for a long time or that you think most people find obvious. Basically, “WBK” is another way of saying “Duh,” “Obviously,” or “How did you not know that!?” [1] X Research source Them : “I think I have a crush on Jaden…” You : “WBK, girl. You’ve been making heart eyes at him for weeks.” Them : “Guys, it’s going to snow this weekend!” You : “Uh, WBK! That’s all anyone has been talking about today!”"

When someone makes a comment about your favorite celebrity on X/Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok that’s totally obvious to you, or your friend texts you about something that you find super apparent, reply back with “WBK.” This is a joking and slightly snarky way to tell them that they’re clueless and have clearly been out of the loop. Them : “I’m so glad Charli XCX won a Grammy for Brat ! She’s an amazing artist.” You : “WBK about her greatness. She deserved that Grammy years ago!” Them : “You know what, denim-on-denim is such a cool look. We should bring that back.” You : “Where have you been? WBK that! It’s such a trend right now.”"

      "title": "“We been knew” is correct in AAVE but not in Standard English.",
      "content": "“We been knew” is correct in AAVE but not in Standard English. AAVE has its own grammar rules that might be different from Standard English rules, but aren’t any less “correct.” [4] X Research source The phrase “we been knew” uses the invariant/habitual “be,” which is commonly used in sentences in AAVE to emphasize that something is routine or happens often and frequently. [5] X Research source It also uses the stressed “been,” which emphasizes that something has been happening for a long time. [6] X Research source For instance, you might hear someone say “I be tired after work” (“I am usually tired after work”) or “I been seen that show on Netflix” (“I saw that show on Netflix a while ago”). While “We been knew” is a grammatically correct and valid phrase in AAVE, it is broadly considered a slang term. So, people might find it too casual to say to authority figures, like a teacher or boss. The “correct” way to say, “We been knew” in Standard English is “We’ve known” or “We already knew.”"
