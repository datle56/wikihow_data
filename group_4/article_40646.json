At the same time you need to remain competitive. Consider hiring an administrator who is experienced in bidding projects. Your administrator can quote jobs in a timely fashion, while you focus on completing projects. You could also have the same person submit invoices and collect your payments on time so you have the funds to pay for materials without accruing excessive interest."
