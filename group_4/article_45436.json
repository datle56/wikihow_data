      "title": "Learn the contemporary terms.",
      "content": "Learn the contemporary terms. Though initially named after the disease's discoverer, the term \"Bright's disease\" has largely been removed from contemporary medical literature and discussions of kidney disease — in fact, your doctor might not know what you are referring to if you use it. Instead, Bright's disease as a diagnosis has been superseded by the contemporary medical terms \"nephritis\" or \"glomerulonephritis\" (GN). [1] X Research source The term Bright's disease is most often found today by people researching their genealogy."

      "content": "Understand the underlying causes. There are two types of GN: acute and chronic. Acute GN may be caused by some other illness like strep throat or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. [2] X Research source Chronic GN can run in families, but often the cause is not known. A person may suffer an acute attack and then develop chronic GN later on.

      "content": "Know the effects. Chronic kidney diseases affect the kidney's ability to function at a normal, healthy level. The loss of kidney function has subsequent effects on the rest of the body, including the body's ability to: Filter waste out of the blood Maintain normal blood pressure Produce vitamin D Produce erythropoietin, which helps produce red blood cells"

      "content": "Get tested. In addition to the presence of telling physical symptoms, there are a number of tests that can confirm a diagnosis of GN. Common tests include the following: [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Urine analysis to check for red and white blood cells, increased protein levels, or increased levels of creatinine and urea Blood tests to measure for levels of waste products like creatinine and blood urea nitrogen Ultrasound Biopsy of the kidney"

      "content": "Recognize the stages of kidney disease. Kidney disease is categorized as a chronic and progressive disease. Each stage of the disease is marked by its own symptoms and the gradual loss of kidney function, measured by the kidney's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). [8] X Research source The stages of kidney disease are: Stage one — Marked by mild symptoms and normal GFR of at least 90 percent of normal kidney function. Stage two — Marked by mild symptoms and reduced GFR, with the gradual reduction of kidney function to between 60 and 89 percent of normal function. Stage three — Marked by moderate symptoms and significantly reduced GFR, with kidney function ranging between 40 and 59 percent of normal function. Stage four — Marked by severe symptoms and drastically reduced GFR, with kidney function ranging between 15 and 29 percent of normal function. Stage five — The kidneys operate at less than 15 percent of normal function."

      "content": "Control the immune system. Medications like corticosteroids can help decrease immune system responses like inflammation, which is a common problem for people with kidney diseases and disorders; however, corticosteroid use carries the risk of significant side effects, including increased appetite/weight gain, sudden and significant mood swings, delayed healing of injuries, weakened bones, diabetes, and high blood pressure."

      "title": "Take blood pressure medication.",
      "content": "Take blood pressure medication. Chronic kidney diseases often affect the body's ability to regulate its blood pressure. Because of this, many treatment plans include taking blood pressure medication. In addition to regulating the body's blood pressure, these medications can also reduce the amount of protein released through your urine, which may help you manage the symptoms of the disease. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Common blood pressure medications prescribed to treat kidney diseases like GN include benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), and enalapril (Vasotec). Some doctors may also prescribe angiotensin II receptor blockers like losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan) to achieve similar results."

Decreasing water retention will help manage swelling in the body and can increase your kidneys' ability to function by increasing water output.

Blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants, reduce your blood's ability to form clots, which may help prevent blood clots in your body (specifically the kidneys).
