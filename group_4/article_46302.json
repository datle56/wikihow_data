If your reusable K-cup has lock symbols on the cap, turn the cap counterclockwise to unlock and lift it off of the filter. If your K-cup has a hinge instead, simply flip the cap open. [1] X Research source The Keurig Universal Reusable Filter can fit any model of Keurig machine, but other reusable cups may only be compatible with certain models. Check the K-cup’s packaging to see which Keurig machines they work with."

      "content": "Coarse grounds work best for reusable K-cups. You can use store-bought grounds or grind your own coffee . If you’re brewing a single cup, fill the reusable K-cup to the first line. For a travel-sized mug, add grounds up to the second line. Put the cap back on after you add the grounds. [2] X Research source Avoid filling the K-cup past the max fill line at the top since it could make your Keurig clog. Reusable K-cups are only meant for coffee, so avoid filling them with loose-leaf tea or any other powdered drinks. Using finely ground coffee for espressos can clog the mesh screen on the K-cup."

Then, just set the K-cup inside of the holder so the arrow printed on top lines up with the arrow on your Keurig machine. Then, slowly lower the handle to close your Keurig again. [3] X Research source If you have a Classic Series Keurig machine, remove the gray adapter on the bottom of a Keurig Universal K-Cup before putting it in your machine. If you have a 2.0 Plus machine, then leave the adapter attached. If the K-cup doesn’t fit properly, you may need to remove the original K-cup adapter. Lift the handle on your Keurig to expose the circular adapter that normal K-cups fit inside. Pull the adapter straight up to remove it from the machine. Then, slide the reusable K-cup into the slot so the printed arrows line up. [4] X Research source"

Fill your Keurig’s tank with water and press the button that matches the size of the cup you want to brew. Run your Keurig through the brew cycle completely before you take the cup from under the spout. [5] X Research source If your Keurig doesn’t run, try opening the machine’s lid and closing it again to ensure it has a secure fit. If that still doesn’t work, check that the K-cup isn’t too full."
