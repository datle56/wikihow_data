      "title": "Place an ice pack over the bruise for 10 to 20 minutes at a time.",
      "content": "Place an ice pack over the bruise for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Do this as soon as soon as you see a bruise start to develop. Hold a cold compress, ice pack, or frozen food bag to the affected area for 10 to 20 minutes. Repeat this at least 3 times a day or, for the quickest results, every 1 to 2 hours. The ice will slow down any blood flowing to the bruised area, reducing swelling and discoloration. If you decide to use a frozen food bag, go with small products like peas since they can easily adjust to your facial shape."

      "title": "Elevate your head to reduce swelling.",
      "content": "Elevate your head to reduce swelling. While going about your day, make sure to keep your head in an upright position as much as possible. Before going to sleep, place extra pillows behind your head to hold it up slightly. Do this until the swelling around your bruise goes away.

      "title": "Wait 24 hours before taking anti-inflammatory drugs.",
      "content": "Wait 24 hours before taking anti-inflammatory drugs. If at all possible, avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen for at least 24 hours after receiving your bruise. These pain relievers can increase blood flow to the bruised area, making it more difficult for your body to heal. [2] X Research source In some cases, drugs like aspirin may even cause unintended bleeding. If you’re experiencing a lot of pain during the first 24 hours, use a brand of acetaminophen like TYLENOL or Ofirmev to treat your pain. Acetaminophen will not get rid of swelling, but it should make the pain more manageable."

For the best results, crush up fresh parsley leaves, sprinkle them over the bruise, and hold them in place using an adhesive or elastic bandage. Try using this treatment every night before going to bed so the parsley doesn’t fall off due to movement.
