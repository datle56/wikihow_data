      "title": "Remove the case.",
      "content": "Remove the case. If you have placed your pillow in a pillowcase or sham, take this off now. Some pillows come with additional zip-on cases that should also be removed and washed separately from the body of the pillow."

      "title": "Put your pillows in the washing machine.",
      "content": "Put your pillows in the washing machine. Don’t worry - it is perfectly safe to wash pillows (even down pillows) in the washing machine. Try to wash at least two at once so that the washer is balanced and the pillows don’t get thrown around so much. [1] X Research source If your pillows are yellowed, try rubbing the surface with a solution made with 1 part white vinegar and 1 part warm water before adding them to the washer."

    {
      "title": "Add your detergent.",
      "content": "Add your detergent. For a regular wash job, add a cup/scoop of your regular washing detergent. To get your pillows ultra white, add the following in addition to the detergent: 1 cup of powdered dishwasher detergent, the recommended amount of bleach, and ½ a cup of borax. [2] X Research source Or, you can simply use a special detergent for white garments that are discoloring."

      "title": "Start the wash cycle.",
      "content": "Start the wash cycle. Adjust the settings on your washer so that it runs with hot water and goes through a 2nd rinse cycle. Use the \"bulky/large\" cycle if it is available on your washer. Then, let it work its magic!"

      "title": "Put your pillows in the dryer.",
      "content": "Put your pillows in the dryer. Place your pillows in the dryer and adjust the settings; if your pillows are feather-filled, put your dryer on the \"air\"/\"fluff\"/\"no heat\" setting. For synthetic pillows, switch your dryer to low heat."

      "title": "Dry your pillows.",
      "content": "Dry your pillows. Take two tennis balls and put them in separate clean, white socks. Throw these in the dryer with your pillows to fluff them and help decrease their drying time. Then start your dryer! [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check your pillows.",
      "content": "Check your pillows. When your dryer has finished its cycle, remove the pillows and feel them, checking for dampness. Smell the pillows to check for moisture in the center. If your pillows don’t feel quite dry, repeat the drying process and check them again a second time. Otherwise, your pillows are clean and ready! [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Remove the cover.",
      "content": "Remove the cover. If your pillow has a pillowcase or sham, take it off prior to washing. Most memory foam pillows also have a zip-on protective cover that should be removed as well. These items can be washed separately and in a washing machine."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill a tub with water.",
      "content": "Fill a tub with water. Washing machines prove too rough for sensitive memory foam, so pillows of this material must be hand washed. Fill a tub (or your sink) with warm water. You only need enough water to cover the pillow."

    {
      "title": "Add your detergent.",
      "content": "Add your detergent. For each pillow, add a tablespoon of liquid clothes detergent to the water. Swirl it around with your hands a bit to bubble it up and get it evenly mixed."

      "title": "Wash your pillow.",
      "content": "Wash your pillow. Place your pillow in the water, and move it around the bit to help the detergent to work its way in. Massage and squeeze the pillow with your hands to help get dirt out and to freshen it past the outer layer."

    {
      "title": "Rinse the pillow.",
      "content": "Rinse the pillow. Run the pillow under fresh water. It is important to get as much of the soap out as you can, checking for suds in the runout. Rinsing the pillow may take several minutes longer than washing it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dry the pillow.",
      "content": "Dry the pillow. High heat levels can ruin the memory foam and cause it to crumble, so do not put your memory foam pillow in the dryer. Instead, lay it out on a clean white towel in a dry area. If possible, allow it to dry in the sun."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check the pillow.",
      "content": "Check the pillow. Memory foam is especially susceptible to holding water for a long time, as it is made out of a sponge-like material. Make sure that there is absolutely no water left in the material before bringing it back for use on your bed, otherwise it will begin to grow mold and mildew."
