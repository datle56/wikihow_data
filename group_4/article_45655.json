During your turn, you can only play a card from your hand if it has the same number, color, or symbol as the card on top of the discard pile. [4] X Research source Wild cards show all 4 colors, so you can play them on top of any card. If you play a Number card that has the flip icon (a rectangle with an arrow), then flip your Power card over to the other side. At the start of the game, this means flipping it from the green side to the red side. When you play an Action card, you also trigger a special ability right away. To learn more about the abilities, jump to our section on Action cards . The new Flex cards in the game show 2 different colors or actions. Go to our section on Flex cards to learn how to play them."

The “flex” side at the bottom has a different color for Number cards or a new ability for Action cards. To use the flex side, flip your Power card from the green side to the red side and set the flex card on the discard pile. [7] X Research source Example : If the top card of the discard pile is blue, you could play a green card that has a blue flex side. The color in the center of a Flex card is its “regular” color. The next person taking a turn has to play a card that matches the regular color even if you used the flex color. You can only use the flex side of a card if the green side is face-up on your Power card. If the red side is face-up, then you can only play the regular side of the card. Power cards can flip back to the green side if you play a card with a flip icon on it, if someone uses a Wild Flip card, or if every player has the red side face-up."
