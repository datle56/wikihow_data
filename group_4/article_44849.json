Wash the burn with a mild soap and warm water, or use a homemade saline solution . Rinse the burn with plenty of warm water to wash out any debris, and gently pat it with clean, moist, lint-free gauze. For larger pieces of debris, use clean tweezers to remove them.

You can soak them in rubbing alcohol for a few minutes before using them. If you're cleaning someone else's burn, wash your hands first. You should also wear protective gloves. If there is quite a lot of embedded debris, or large pieces of debris in the burn, see a doctor to have them removed."
