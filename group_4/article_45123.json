If you're using an Android, iPhone or iPad, you can't turn off spell check just for Chrome—you can only disable spell check globally for all apps. This might be risky if you're not the most careful typist, so do so at your own risk: To disable spell check for iPhone/iPad apps, go to Settings > General > Keyboard > and disable \"Check Spelling\" and/or \"Auto-Correction.\" To disable spellcheck for Android, you'll need to do so from your keyboard app. If you're using Gboard, go to Settings > Text correction and toggle off \"Spell check\" and/or \"Auto-correction.\" To disable spellcheck on a Samsung Galaxy, go to Settings > General management > Samsung Keyboard settings > Auto spell check and turn the feature off. You can also do this for Auto replace if desired. [1] X Research source"

You can also toggle spell check on or off for individual languages you're using in Chrome.
