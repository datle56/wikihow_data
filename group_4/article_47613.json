      "content": "Slip on the undergarment dress and clasp it in the front. Hanbok undergarment dresses are usually white and have a row of clasps or buttons on the front. Pull it on over your head and clasp it up your torso so that it is tight. [1] X Research source You can even wear jeans under your dress if you’d like to, since the undergarment dress usually covers down to your ankles."

      "content": "Pull the dress onto your arms so that the opening is in the back. Depending on your style of dress, it may have thick straps or thin spaghetti straps. Make sure the straps sit over your shoulders and that the opening of the dress is behind you. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the back ribbons around to your front.",
      "content": "Wrap the back ribbons around to your front. Reach behind you and find the loose ribbons hanging down and pull them around your chest until they reach the center of your torso. Make sure the ribbons are tight across your chest so the dress stays up, but not so tight that you can’t breathe. [3] X Research source If you need to, pull down the dress in the front so the tie sits right on your chest."

      "content": "Tighten the ribbons and tie them in a bow on your front. Grab the 2 ends of the ribbon on the front of your dress and pull them taut. Tie them into a tight bow on the center of your chest that won’t slip off as you wear your hanbok. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Put on the jacket and fasten the clasp in the front.",
      "content": "Put on the jacket and fasten the clasp in the front. Use caution as you put on your jacket over your dress, because it is usually made of stiff material. Clasp or button the right side to the left so that it stays closed in the front. [5] X Research source Your jacket may also have embroidery or beading on the sleeves, so be gentle with them as you put it on."

Keep this knot fairly loose so that you can still work with each of the ribbons. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Wrap the short ribbon around your hand to make a loop at the top. Take the part of the shorter ribbon sticking out of the knot and wrap it around your 4 fingers. Make a loose loop that is wide enough for the long ribbon to go through. [8] X Research source Although it is sometimes helpful to have a friend or family member help you with your hanbok, it’s actually easier to make this loop and bow if you are wearing the jacket yourself."

      "content": "Pull the long ribbon through the loop until it sticks out about 1 in (2.5 cm). Grab the top part of the long ribbon and pull it through the loop around your hand. Pull it through and then tighten up your knot by pulling on the loop of the long ribbon and the end of the short ribbon at the same time. [9] X Research source The knot should sit at a horizontal angle on the front of your jacket with the loop of the long ribbon sticking out towards your left and the trailing ends of the ribbon hanging down on your right."

Make a triangle out of 1 side of your jacket above your armpit and tuck the excess fabric from your sleeve underneath it. Then, do the same to the fabric on the other side. [10] X Research source This helps your jacket stay flat in the front and makes it look smoother."

      "title": "Wear jeans or leggings under your hanbok to stay warm.",
      "content": "Wear jeans or leggings under your hanbok to stay warm. Since the fabric of the hanbok dress isn’t super thick, if you are wearing it in the winter, you might get chilly. Pull on some leggings, yoga pants, or even jeans for an extra layer. [11] X Research source Since the dress is so long, you won’t be able to see your pants at all."

If you want to be authentic, you can put on a pair of ggotshin shoes, which are usually handmade and have intricate details on the sides. These shoes are usually flat so they are comfortable to walk around in. [13] X Research source If you don’t have a pair of these shoes, you can also put on some low heels or comfortable flat shoes."

      "content": "Add a norigae, a handcrafted tassel, as an accessory. Norigae are knotted ornaments that are traditionally made by hand with long, flowing tassels at the end. They may fit in with the color scheme of your hanbok, or act as a pop of color. Tie the top of the norigae to the waistband of your dress and let it hang down over the front of your hanbok. [14] X Research source Norigae are seen as a good luck charm."

Pull on a long hanbok coat for an extra layer over your outfit, or put on a shorter hanbok vest to cover your upper half. Tie the ribbons on the front of the coat or vest in the same way that you tied your jacket, and take off your coat to show off your hanbok. [15] X Research source Traditional hanbok coats are made of the same flowy material as the dress, while vests are usually thicker and may have fur around the collar. If you don’t have a hanbok coat or vest, that’s okay! They aren’t necessary to complete your look."
