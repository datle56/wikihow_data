      "title": "Get a high-quality stethoscope.",
      "content": "Get a high-quality stethoscope. A high-quality stethoscope is important. The better the quality of your stethoscope, the easier it will be for you to listen to your patient’s body. Single tubed stethoscopes are better than double tubed ones. The tubes in double tubed stethoscopes can rub together. This noise can make it hard to hear heart sounds. Thick, short, and relatively stiff tubing is best, unless you plan to wear the stethoscope around your neck. In that case, a longer tube is best. Make sure that tubing is free of leaks by tapping on the diaphragm (the flat side of the chest piece). As you tap, use the earpieces to listen for sounds. If you don’t hear anything, there may be a leak."

Otherwise, you might not be able to hear anything with your stethoscope. [2] X Research source Make sure that the earpieces are facing forward. If you put them in backwards, you won’t be able to hear anything. [3] X Research source Make sure that the earpieces fit snugly and have a good seal to keep out ambient noise. If the ear pieces don’t fit well, most stethoscopes have removable earpieces. Visit a medical supply store to purchase different earpieces. [4] X Research source With some stethoscopes, you can also tilt the earpieces forward stethoscopes to ensure a better fit. [5] X Research source"

If your earpieces are too tight or too loose, readjust them. [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If the earpieces are too loose, you won’t be able to hear anything. To tighten the tension, squeeze the headset near the earpieces. If the earpieces are too tight, they might hurt your ears and you’ll have a hard time using your stethoscope. To reduce the tension, pull the headset apart gently."

Chest pieces come in different sizes for adults and children. The chest piece is also known as the diaphragm and bell. Different chest pieces have different acoustic levels based on whether you’re using them on adults, children, or people with cardiovascular issues. [7] X Research source"

The bell, which is the round side of the drum, is better for hearing low-pitched sounds.

[15] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The “lub,” or systolic, sound happens when the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart close.

If you do not hear any strange sounds, the patient may have air/fluid around the lungs, thickness in the chest wall, a throttled airflow, or over-inflation in the lungs. [22] X Research source There are four types of abnormal breath sounds: Wheezing sounds like a high-pitched sound when the person exhales, and sometimes when they inhale as well. Many patients who have asthma also have wheezes. [23] X Research source Stridor sounds like high-pitched musical breathing. It’s similar to wheezing, and heard most often when the patient inhales. Stridor is caused by a blockage in the back of the throat. [24] X Research source www.onhealth.com/content/1/normal_healthy_heart_rate_charts_health_heart Rhonchi sounds like snoring. Rhonchi cannot be heard without a stethoscope and happens because the air is following a “rough” path through the lungs (usually because the path is blocked).
