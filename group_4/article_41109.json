      "title": "Sleep on your back.",
      "content": "Sleep on your back. Side-sleepers are more prone to drooling during the night simply because gravity is causing the mouth to open and allowing drool to pool on your pillow. Try sleeping on your back and tucking yourself in so that you do not shift around during the night."

      "title": "Breathe through your nose, not your mouth.",
      "content": "Breathe through your nose, not your mouth. The main reason that people drool is that their nasal sinuses are clogged. As a result, they end up breathing through their mouth and drooling in the process. Try applying sinus-clearing products like Vick's Vaporub and Tiger Balm directly under your nose to loosen clogged nostrils. Smell essential oils such as Eucalyptus before going to bed to clear sinuses and soothe yourself to sleep. Take a hot, steamy shower before bed to allow the pure vapors to cleanse your sinuses."

Sleep apnea causes your breath to become shallow and thin during sleep. [3] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some behaviors and conditions can increase your risk of sleep apnea. These include smoking, high blood pressure, and people at high risk for heart failure or stroke. Your doctor can determine if you have sleep apnea by running various sleep monitoring tests and learning about your sleep history."

CPAP outlines that patients must wear a mask that forces air through the nose and mouth while sleeping. The idea is to have the right amount of air pressure filtering through the air passages to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing as you sleep.

[9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Somnoplasty uses radio frequency to constrict the soft palate at the back of the throat and open the airway. ' Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty' (surgical procedure), or UPPP/UP3, can remove soft tissue in the back of the throat surgically to open the airway. Nasal surgery consists of several procedures that can fix obstructions or deformities like deviated septums. A tonsillectomy can remove oversized tonsils that are obstructing your airway. Mandibular/maxillary advancement surgery consists of moving the jawbone forward to create space in the throat. This is a rather intense procedure that is reserved for only the worst cases of sleep apnea. [10] X Research source"
