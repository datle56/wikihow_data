      "content": "Cheating involves someone having a romantic or sexual relationship with someone other than their partner. This other relationship happens without their partner's consent. While this is the most common understanding of cheating (also known as infidelity), there isn't a one-size-fits-all definition. Different couples can define cheating in different ways. [1] X Research source For example, one couple might be fine with each other flirting with other people, while a different couple might consider that a betrayal of trust. Every couple has their own standards for what is vs. isn't cheating. Couples that practice open, polyamorous or ethically non-monogamous relationships often have different standards for what is considered infidelity. [2] X Research source In general, however, most couples agree that hiding or lying about behavior is a red flag and a breach of trust."

      "content": "Physical cheating Physical cheating is what most people think of when they picture infidelity. Physical infidelity is usually defined as having sexual relations with another person, but it does have some gray areas. Some people may consider non-sexual physical intimacy, like holding hands or kissing, as cheating, while others may not. Similarly, some people may see a drunken kiss as a less egregious form of cheating than a sober one. Depending on the relationship, common examples of physical cheating include: [3] X Research source Holding hands or cuddling with another person Kissing or making out with someone else Dancing with or touching another person in a sexual way Having sex with someone else Paying for sex or an erotic massage"

      "title": "Emotional cheating",
      "content": "Emotional cheating Emotional cheating occurs when someone has formed a close emotional, romantic bond with someone besides their partner. This type of cheating often involves no physical intimacy (at least in the beginning). Instead, emotional affairs often begin as an innocent friendship but evolve to the point where the emotional intimacy and support typically reserved for a romantic relationship are being shared in a platonic one. Emotional cheating can be hard to define, but some examples of an emotional affair include: [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Inappropriate communication like excessive texting, calling, or social media contact Hiding a “friendship” from a partner because of guilt or the knowledge they may feel uncomfortable Sharing deep thoughts and feelings with someone else (while not sharing them with a partner) Behaving like a couple with someone else, without the physical intimacy Having strong emotions or romantic feelings for someone else Telling someone about said strong emotions or romantic feelings"

      "content": "Virtual cheating Sometimes called online or digital infidelity, cheating via online services or social media profiles is similar to emotional cheating. However, it’s become increasingly more common due to the ease of finding and engaging in infidelity with someone online. Some potential examples of virtual cheating include: [5] X Research source Liking other people’s thirst traps Sending flirty messages or leaving sexual comments on social media posts Spending more time chatting with another person online than chatting with a partner Having a secret dating profile online Sexting Sending or receiving nudes Initiating conversations or personal relationships with digital sex workers or people in chat rooms"

      "content": "Micro-cheating Micro-cheating is one of the most common types of cheating in a relationship, and it consists of repeated minor and subtle actions that lead someone to develop intimate connections outside of their relationship. These actions may make the faithful partner feel jealous and insecure, but they’re not quite enough to qualify as traditional cheating. The specifics of what does or doesn’t constitute micro-cheating depends on the couple, but some examples may include: [6] X Research source Going to strip clubs Sending flirty messages Stalking an ex on social media Texting or communicating frequently with an ex Flirting with other people Entertaining someone else’s advances Fantasizing about someone else Having an active online profile on a dating site"

Rather, financial cheating happens when a partner is secretive or deceitful about their spending or savings. While this type of infidelity can happen in conjunction with a physical affair (e.g., the cheater is going over their family’s monthly budget to buy gifts for their secret lover), it can also manifest in other ways, including: [7] X Research source Gambling addictions that deplete the partner’s savings Substance abuse problems, causing large amounts of money to be spent on alcohol or drugs Compulsive shopping that runs through the family budget Large amounts of debt or diminished savings being hidden from one partner"

      "content": "Object infidelity Some people believe it’s possible to cheat on a partner with a hobby or interest. While it’s completely healthy to have normal hobbies and interests, this type of cheating may occur if all of someone’s time and attention is devoted to a hobby. For example: [8] X Research source If someone spends all of their free time playing video games online with friends. If someone spends every weekend with their intramural sports team instead of a partner. If someone spends every evening working rather than spending time with a partner."

      "content": "Commemorative infidelity Commemorative cheating happens when one person has decidedly fallen out of love with their committed romantic partner but stays in the relationship out of obligation. In this case, the individual may still see romantic or physical connection outside of their monogamous relationship and justify it because (from their perspective) their relationship is over."

      "title": "They’re possessive over their electronics.",
      "content": "They’re possessive over their electronics. Evidence of cheating is often found in texts and emails on electronic devices like phones or laptops. For this reason, a partner who’s cheating may be overly possessive of or protective over their electronic devices and the amount of time they’re spending on them. In effect, they don’t want you (their partner) to know who they’re talking to. [9] X Research source If you’re concerned about your partner’s behavior with their phone, consider asking them if they’d be willing to share their location and phone activity with you. A surveillance app like mSpy allows you to monitor and log activity on a target device—in this case, your partner’s cell phone or computer. mSpy lets you read messages, view calls, see social media activity, and track GPS location. mSpy may be the ideal solution to give peace of mind to and guarantee mutual transparency for both you and your partner. Before using a phone monitoring app like mSpy, make sure to get your partner’s consent, since using one of these apps without permission is illegal in most cases."

      "content": "They’re unreachable for long periods of time. If your partner disappears for long periods of time without any logical explanation, this may mean that they’re engaging in infidelity with someone else. Otherwise, they’d probably just tell you that they’re with their friends or at a meeting, and they won’t act strange or evasive about where they’ve been. [10] X Research source If you use mSpy , you’re able to track the location of your partner’s phone (with their permission, to avoid legal issues). Even if they aren’t responding to your texts, you’ll be able to see exactly where they are and deduce what they might be up to."

If your partner is constantly lying to you about where they’ve been or who they’ve been with, you’ll probably be able to pick up on inconsistencies in their story over time. If they start to give conflicting information or get stressed when asked about what they’ve been up to, then they may be cheating and struggling to keep their story straight. [11] X Research source"

If your partner all of a sudden has to work late consistently (even when their job doesn’t really require that), then they may be cheating. Similarly, if they suddenly have to go on frequent out-of-town business trips for a job that never required that before, you may have reason to be suspicious about whether or not they’re telling the truth.

Contrary to what you might think, people who are being unfaithful actually tend to want more sexual intimacy with the partner that they’re cheating on. While you might expect them to have less time for sex with their committed significant other, cheating may make some people feel more sexually energized and want to seek out more frequent or more exciting varieties of sex with their romantic partner.

      "title": "Their friends act uncomfortable around you.",
      "content": "Their friends act uncomfortable around you. Most of the time (but not always), the friends of the cheating partner will know about the infidelity before the significant other does. If your partner’s friends are suddenly acting awkward or uncomfortable around you—or if they even seem to be avoiding you entirely—then this guilty behavior may be because they know that their friend is cheating. [15] X Research source If you think that your partner’s friends know something you don’t, then they’ve probably had phone calls or text messages with your partner discussing their infidelity. On mSpy , you can record phone calls and see texts, call logs, or even ambient recordings of your partner’s surroundings. If they are cheating and talking with their friends about it, mSpy will let you know. However, remember that it’s usually illegal to monitor someone’s phone without their knowledge, so it’s best to ask your partner before installing any spyware on their phone."

      "content": "They accuse you of cheating with no concrete reasoning. If your partner knows that they’re doing something wrong or dishonest, they may start projecting onto others and imagine that everyone else is doing the same thing as they are. As a result, they may start accusing you (or someone else) of cheating, even though they have no real evidence or reason to believe that that’s the case. [16] X Research source However, there are many possible reasons that a partner may accuse you of cheating—including that they’re recognizing some of the signs on this list! They may also be struggling with feelings of jealousy or insecurity, although that’s still an issue that you probably want to address in your relationship."

      "content": "They start to criticize you often or make belittling comments. If your partner is cheating on you and feels guilty about it, then they may be experiencing something called cognitive dissonance. What happens with cognitive dissonance is that your partner believes that two things can’t be true at the same time—in this situation, they can’t simultaneously believe that cheating hurts their partner and that they are a kind person who wouldn’t hurt their partner. [17] X Research source To deal with this dissonance, your partner may start telling themselves that you aren’t worthy of honesty or faithfulness, so they can’t really be hurting you (or that hurt is deserved). To prove this idea to themselves, they may start to criticize or demean you frequently."

      "title": "You think they’re cheating but don’t have proof.",
      "content": "You think they’re cheating but don’t have proof. Sometimes, you might have a major feeling that your partner is being unfaithful but don’t have any real evidence to prove it. Some studies have shown that people can detect lies subconsciously, even if they’re unable to identify why they feel like the person is lying. If you just can’t shake the feeling that your partner is cheating (and you don’t have any past relationship trauma that may be causing you to feel that way), then it might be worth it to talk to your partner or do some further investigation. If you want to find proof, then asking your partner to install a monitoring software on their phone may be just the solution. It’s really unlikely that your partner will be able to keep all signs of cheating off of their phone, which is why mSpy allows you to monitor your significant other’s text messages, phone calls, social media behavior, camera images, calendar, and GPS location."

      "content": "Understand why people cheat. The best way to deal with cheating in a relationship (or prevent it) is to understand its root causes. While understanding the causes of cheating doesn’t make this behavior okay, it can make it easier to discuss with your partner and potentially reach a resolution together, whether you’re the one who’s cheated or the person who’s been cheated on. Of course, in some situations, it may be best to just walk away from the relationship. Some of the most common reasons for cheating have to do with a want for excitement, dissatisfaction with the current relationship, selfish pursuit of status or personal goals, or simple manipulation and game-playing. [18] X Research source Underneath these more surface-level causes, some of the root causes of cheating stem from insecurity, selfishness, jealousy, and dissatisfaction with one’s own life. Discovering the true cause of someone’s unfaithful behavior—especially in a serial cheater—often requires the help of a professional counselor or psychologist."

If you’re the person who suspects their partner of cheating, avoid assuming they’re cheating or packing up your bags without taking a beat to think about your situation—even if they tick off all the common signs of cheating. Believing your partner is cheating can (understandably) kick off some very volatile and sensitive emotions, and you’re probably feeling a lot of anger and sadness. Before making any rash decisions, try to calm yourself down so that you can logically reflect on what’s happening."

Whether you know or just suspect that your partner is cheating, share your feelings with your most trusted friends, family members, and other loved ones.

      "content": "Communicate openly and respectfully with your partner. Have an open dialogue with your partner about whether cheating has happened in your relationship and whether your relationship is salvageable. If you’ve already established that someone has been unfaithful, then continue to do your best to communicate respectfully about your needs and feelings. Discuss if and how you want to move forward with the relationship and what conditions must be met for your partnership to continue. [20] X Research source For example, the person who’s been cheated on may request that all contact ends with the person that their partner cheated on them with. Ask yourself whether or not your relationship is worth continuing. Is there a history of unfaithful behavior? Is the unfaithful partner committed to change? Although it can be really difficult to communicate with respect and honesty in emotionally laden conversations such as this one, it’s really important to help you both get what you need and heal from this situation. Communicating respectfully is even more crucial if children are involved. Custody agreement negotiations, divorce proceedings, and other conversations that may happen around or involving the child must be cordial and mature, if nothing else. Otherwise, this situation may severely harm or emotionally damage your child or children."

Whether or not you and your partner have decided to stay together, it’s important to establish boundaries for any contact or communication you’ll have moving forward. If you’re staying together, have a discussion about cheating and what is and isn’t appropriate within the boundaries of your committed relationship.

      "content": "If you were the partner who cheated, take responsibility for your actions. If you cheated on your monogamous or otherwise committed significant other, then it’s crucial to hold yourself accountable for your actions. Being responsible for your own actions doesn’t mean beating yourself up, and it should happen whether or not you’re still in a relationship with the person you’re cheating on. [23] X Research source Rather, accepting blame and taking accountability is a necessary step in recognizing your past behaviors so that you can heal, move forward, and have healthier relationships in the future."

This topic can be sensitive, and people can have wildly different understandings of what is and isn't cheating in a monogamous or ethically non-monogamous relationship. For this reason, it’s best to approach this conversation and discuss cheating with your partner early on. [24] X Research source Here are some tips for discussing boundaries around exclusivity and cheating: Choose the right time when emotions aren’t already running high and there aren’t any distractions. Use “I” statements and talk about your personal beliefs with phrases like, “For me, cheating means…” Ask open-ended questions about what your partner considers to be cheating, like “How would you feel if I commented on an ex’s social media posts?” Listen to your partner without any judgment—nearly everyone has different boundaries and expectations around cheating, and there’s no wrong or right answer. Talk through gray areas that many couples clash over, such as watching pornography, using online chat rooms, or having emotional affairs. Come to an explicit agreement about what is and isn’t allowed in your relationship moving forward. Revisit your boundaries from time to time and discuss anything that’s changed in your relationship and your beliefs about what counts as cheating."

If you do get the truth out of them, you may be able to understand more about why they cheated instead of making assumptions.

Talking to someone else may become cheating if it crosses a couple’s mutually agreed-upon boundaries or if the “talking” crosses the line into intentional flirting. In this case, excessively talking to someone or messaging them in a flirty or emotionally revealing way may count as emotional infidelity.
