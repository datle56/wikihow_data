      "content": "Clean the anvil and spindle before beginning. Use either a clean sheet of paper or soft cloth, and hold it between the anvil and the spindle. Gently twist and close on the sheet or cloth. Slowly, pull out the sheet or the cloth. This practice isn't a necessary step for measuring, but keeping the surfaces of the anvil and spindle clean ensures precise measurements."

In between those whole numbers are three lines that represent twenty-five thousandths of an inch; in decimal form, it would look like .025. The thimble has evenly spaced lines that represent one-thousandth of an inch; in decimal form it would be .001.
