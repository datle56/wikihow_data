While the latest versions of Deluge (2.0 and later) aren't available for Windows, there are still 2 ways you can run the app on your PC: The easiest way is to install an older version—the most recent version available for Windows is 1.3.15, and you can download it from https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/deluge/windows/?C=M;O=D . Once downloaded, double-click the installer to run it. [1] X Research source When installing Deluge, you might see a security alert from your firewall. If so, choose to allow Deluge to run on your network and click Allow Access when prompted. If you've enabled Windows Subsystem for Linux , you can easily install the latest Linux release of Deluge through Ubuntu. Just launch Ubuntu from the Start menu, then run these commands: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deluge-team/ppa sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install deluge"

If you want the most recent release, you can install the Linux version using Homebrew at the command line. [2] X Research source In a Terminal window, run these commands: First, install Homebrew if you haven't already with this command: /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh )\" .

      "content": "Understand the risks. If you're downloading legitimate software or content from a source you trust, downloading torrents is safe and easy. But if you want to download copyrighted games, movies, applications, or other files, you'll need to understand the risks. Torrenting any copyrighted content that you don't already own is illegal. If you get caught, your ISP could issue you a warning. If you incur multiple warnings, you could lose your service. Depending on what you download (and your ISP), you could be served with a copyright infringement notice. It's possible such notices can ultimately result in fines and penalties. Downloading torrents from unknown sources is a surefire way to get malware and viruses. Before downloading torrents, make sure you have solid antivirus and antimalware protection. Using a secure VPN service that doesn't keep activity logs might help you download torrents without getting in trouble. Just make sure to do thorough research on any VPN services before signing up."

      "title": "Find a torrent you want to download.",
      "content": "Find a torrent you want to download. When browsing for torrents, stick to sites that allow users to rate and review the downloads and/or have ranking systems for users. It's also a good idea to look for files that have a lot of seeders, as more popular files are less likely (but not immune) to be infected with viruses. Sites that require memberships (such as TorrentLeech) are generally safer than open sites . Sites like Pirate Bay are popular and have built-in ranking systems, but can be risky as far as legality and safety are concerned."
