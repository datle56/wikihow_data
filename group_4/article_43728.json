      "content": "Add the thickening agent to the paint. Read the directions on the bottle of thickening agent to find out how much to use. Typically you will add it by the tablespoon depending on how much paint you have. [3] X Research source For the best result, add a smaller amount than called for, and then slowly add more until you get the thickness you need. Adding more than the manufacturer’s recommended amount can cause the paint to crack and peel when applied to the wall."
