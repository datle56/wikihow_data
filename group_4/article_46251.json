While you don't need to purchase a subscription to listen to Pandora, subscriptions do have added benefits. Free: This is the ad-supported version of Pandora that lets you create radio-like stations based on your favorite songs, artists, and musical genres. You can improve your stations by giving a thumbs-up to the songs you like, and a thumbs-down to the songs you don't want to hear (which also skips the song). [1] X Research source You get 6 skips per hour per station, up to 12 total skips per day. [2] X Research source You can unlock more skips by listening to ads. Pandora Plus: The first paid level of Pandora gets you all of the features of free Pandora with unlimited skips, the ability to listen to your top 3 stations offline, and higher-quality audio. [3] X Research source Pandora Premium: The top Pandora tier gives you features similar to services like Spotify and Apple Music, letting you search and play any songs on demand. You can create fully-customizable playlists, have top-quality audio (even better than Pandora Plus), and unlimited offline listening for all stations."
