If the primer is wet, such as a liquid or gel, allow it to dry. The main purpose of eye primer is to help keep your eye makeup locked in place all day. [1] X Research source Christin Birckhead.

      "content": "Apply your eyeshadow of choice with an eyeshadow brush or applicator. Apply your base shade across the eyelid and two-thirds of the way up to your eyebrow. Apply a second, darker shade along your lash line and in the crease at the outer corner of your eye to create a sideways “V.” For example, try applying a sparkly nude shade as your base color, and a shimmery chocolate for the accent color. Apply the darkest color at the outside corner of your eye and fade it as you get closer to your nose."

      "content": "Line your lower waterline. Use a matte white eyeshadow pencil or thin crayon to carefully line your lower waterline. Brush the line with an eyeshadow brush to soften its appearance. Before you line your eyes, take a cotton swab and swipe it lightly 1-2 times across your waterline to dry it. That will keep your eyeliner from smudging. [2] X Research source Christin Birckhead. Makeup artist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020. To apply white to your waterline, gently hold down the skin under your eyes with one hand. Use the other hand to color back and forth on the waterline with your liner, taking care not to slip and poke your eye."

Line your upper lash line with white again. Flick the corners out into cat eyes, or use tape as a guide to draw the outer edges, tapering off towards the tips. Finish the look with dark mascara to your upper lashes. [4] X Research source Try touching the sticky side of clear tape with your finger first, so that it isn’t too sticky. [5] X Research source For an even more striking look, line your upper lash line the second time with liquid white eyeliner or create a whitened water line. If you have pale skin, use a gloss white liner or finish with a shimmery white eyeshadow to make the white liner pop even more. You can also use white eyeshadow just at the last line, or blend it with a nude shadow."

Top off this dramatic style with mascara to your upper and/or lower lids, if desired. You can also pair this with a whitened water line. Set your eyeliner by using a very small brush to tap on a similar-colored eyeshadow on top of your eyeliner. [6] X Research source Christin Birckhead. Makeup artist. Personal interview. 8 May 2020."

Draw another shade of eyeliner, such as black or brown, over half the thickness of the white. For stark contrast, you can also try the opposite: line your upper and lower waterline with black liner, then trace your lash lines with a shimmery white liner. [7] X Research source If you want a costumey look, try drawing white eye liner in between two other shades, such as black (near the lash line) and blue (above the white)."
