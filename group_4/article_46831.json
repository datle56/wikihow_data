      "content": "Lie down with your head on the headrest. Place the ab rocker on the floor with the headrest behind you. Lie down on your back inside the rocker so that your head is resting on the headrest and the upper roll bar is positioned above your chest. [1] X Research source Make sure your head, neck, and back are straight, and that your back is resting flat on the floor."

      "content": "Bend your knees and place your hands on the roll bar. Once you're in position, bend your knees and put your feet together, with the soles flat on the floor. Raise your arms and lightly grip the upper roll bar above your chest. [2] X Research source If you're a beginner, place your hands next to each other on the roll bar, directly above the middle of your chest. For more difficult crunches, place your hands shoulder-width apart."

      "title": "Exhale and bend forward with your abs contracted.",
      "content": "Exhale and bend forward with your abs contracted. Slowly exhale through your mouth as you use the ab rocker to help you rock forward, lifting your head and upper body off the floor toward your knees. Make sure your abs are tight as you perform this action. [4] X Research source Take care not to push too hard with your hands as you perform the crunch. You still want your abs to be doing most of the work. Use slow, controlled movements and make sure your head does not slip off the headrest."

Inhale as you slowly lower yourself back down to the floor. [5] X Research source When you're starting out, you may wish to do 3 sets of 7-8 crunches. [6] X Research source You can gradually increase your number of reps as you get better at doing crunches."

      "content": "Put your head on the headrest and bend your knees. Get into the same starting position you would use to do regular crunches. Lie down in the machine with your head on the headrest, your back and shoulders on the floor, and your knees bent. Reach up and place your hands on the upper roll bar. [7] X Research source Keep your feet together with the soles flat on the floor. When you're starting out, keep your hands close together on the upper roll bar. As you get more comfortable with the exercise, try moving them farther apart."

Keep your legs and feet together as you do this. [8] X Research source During this exercise, only your feet, legs, and buttocks should leave the floor. Keep your head on the headrest and your shoulders and back flat on the floor."

Hold onto the upper roll bar with both hands. [11] X Research source For this exercise, you will be keeping your upper back and shoulders flat on the floor, but your lower body will be twisted to the side. As you get more comfortable with the exercise, position your hands shoulder-width apart on the upper roll bar instead of side-by-side."

Your knees should now be pointing at the wall, perpendicular to your head. [12] X Research source Make sure to swivel your hips to the side as well as your knees. Do your best to keep your head, shoulders, and upper body in a straight line and flat against the floor."

Once you've done as many reps as you like on one side, swing your knees and hips around to the other side and perform the crunch that way. This will help you exercise your muscles evenly on both sides of your core. [16] X Research source You may wish to start out by doing 7-8 reps on each side, then gradually build up to doing 10-12 on each side."

At the same time, draw your left knee up to your chest. Repeat this cycle for 7-8 reps. [24] X Research source A single repetition includes pulling the right knee toward your chest, followed by the left knee. Try to perform the entire exercise fluidly as if you were working the pedals on a bicycle. You may need to practice more slowly at first until you get the hang of coordinating all your movements. As you get better at the cycling exercise, gradually work your way up to 10-12 reps per set."
