      "content": "Choose the dimmer switch designed for your specific lighting fixture needs. Pick an incandescent switch for traditional bulbs that gives off light when the filaments heat up. Opt for an electronic low-voltage switch if the bulbs are small and used for decorative lighting. Buy a fluorescent switch, a special dimming ballast, for fluorescent lights that contains a gas that lights up when charged. Select a dimmer switch that is intended for CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lights) which use less power and last longer."

      "content": "Confirm the electricity is off at the spot you want to install the dimmer. Remove the faceplate from the switch with a screwdriver. Touch a non-contact voltage detector to each of the 2 screw terminals. If it lights, electricity is still on, and you are at risk, so return to the circuit breaker to determine if it is off and/or if it is the correct circuit breaker. If the voltage detector does not light, the electricity is off, and you can proceed."

Pair each wire from the electric box with the respective wire on the dimmer switch. Use needle-nose pliers to twist exposed ends of wires around each other. Tighten a wire nut around each such connection. Wrap this wire connection with a 3 inch (7.62 cm) strip of electric tape."
