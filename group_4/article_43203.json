If you don't know your family history, a genetic test can tell you if you're Ashkenazi Jewish. [1] X Research source Home tests are relatively inexpensive and can provide a starting point. If one of those do-it-yourself consumer test shows Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, you might want to get further tests to confirm."

      "content": "\"Ashkenazi\" describes Jews from Central and Eastern Europe. Not every Jewish person from Europe is Ashkenazi, although most of them are. This term refers to a specific group of Jewish people who originally settled in the 10th century in the Rhineland, in what is now Germany. This group remained so isolated throughout history that their descendants form a distinct genetic population. [2] X Research source The founding group of this genetic population was likely extremely small and happened to carry certain genetic mutations that lead to an increased risk of some otherwise rare genetic diseases. These mutations are more prevalent in modern Ashkenazi Jews than in the general population. Researchers believe that, as of 2024, Ashkenazi Jews make up about half of the global Jewish population."

Companies such as Ancestry and 23andMe offer inexpensive home DNA testing that can give you some clues into your ancestry and help you determine if you are of Ashkenazi descent. While these tests aren't necessarily definitive, they can give you a really strong clue as to your ancestry. [5] X Research source Genetic testing can be particularly beneficial if you don't have any older biological family members you can speak to or if you were adopted and don't know your biological family. Keep in mind that the company you order your test from keeps your DNA in its database for continual analysis. Ancestry and 23andMe each hold one of the largest collections of human DNA in the world. Before you order a test, think about whether you want to add your DNA to a privately held company's database."

[7] X Research source Consumer DNA test companies typically have resources on their website or through their app that will explain to you what each part of your results means. You might also have access to possible genetic relatives whose DNA is in the company's database. If you connect with these people, you might be able to learn more about your ancestry."

This test will tell you if you have specific genetic variants associated with specific genetic diseases. The test can be ordered by your doctor and only requires a sample of either your blood or your saliva. [8] X Trustworthy Source University of California San Francisco Health Center Research hospital associated with UCSF, a leading medical university, providing innovative patient care and public health resources Go to source In the US, carrier screening is often covered by health insurance provided you have Ashkenazi ancestry. Check with your insurer as companies have different policies. Although it's good to know if you carry these variants regardless, it's especially important information if you're planning on having children."

If you already have names of ancestors, search for them and see what you find. At the same time, it's important to keep in mind that names can be misspelled or recorded incorrectly. As if that didn't make it difficult enough, many Jewish people didn't have consistent names that they were called all the time until well into the 1800s, which can make it even harder to trace back your lineage . Different countries also had different name conventions, so your ancestor's name might have changed as they migrated. [13] X Research source Pay attention to how common the name is as well. If your search brings up the names of 20 people with that name who lived around the same time, you can't be certain that any one of those people is actually your ancestor without more information."

Town web pages often have links to other resources that can help you track your ancestry. If your ancestors have come from a very small town, also look for information in the next town over or the nearest large town that would've been a sort of regional hub.
