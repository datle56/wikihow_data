      "title": "Give it at least a few days before sending an email.",
      "content": "Give it at least a few days before sending an email. Though there are mixed reports about how long you should wait to follow up on a job application, the general consensus is that you should wait at least 3 to 5 days. In fact, some hiring managers say that they prefer not to receive follow up emails at all. They believe that it is an attention-grabbing tactic and takes away from the time they need to select qualified candidates. That said, others say that following up will make you stand out in a good way. Just remember that it's possible that dozens of applicants applied for the same position as you did, and that it takes time to sort through applications and find qualified candidates for the next round. You don't want to seem pushy or impatient by following up too soon. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Address your email to the correct person. Ideally, you should address your email to the same person you reached out to when you applied for the job. If you can’t find the name, then \"Dear Hiring Manager\" may be the best you can do. [2] X Research source You may be able to find the contact information for the hiring manager on the company website or LinkedIn page. Always check the spelling. Nothing can create a negative impression quicker than misspelling someone's name."

      "title": "Make the subject specific and direct.",
      "content": "Make the subject specific and direct. Something simple like, \"Application Follow-Up for Editor Position\" will do the trick. If the position had a reference or requisition number, then you can add that as well. Remember that the hiring manager may be hiring for multiple positions at once, so it's important to be as specific as possible. You can even put your name in the subject to make it easier for the hiring manager to find your application."

      "title": "Write the correct greeting.",
      "content": "Write the correct greeting. Simply write \"Dear\" in front of the hiring manager’s name, just as you did when you wrote your cover letter . Don't fall into being too informal and say \"Hi\" or \"Hey\" just because it's an email—it's important to keep things on the formal side for now. \"Dear Mr. Smith\" is an appropriate salutation."

      "content": "State the position you applied for and when. Start off by saying when you applied for the position, how you found it, and that you are checking on the status. You can add that you would like to make sure that they received your materials.

Be confident that the strength of your resume and cover letter coupled with your persistence in following up, will put you in a strong position to land an interview. Though some people are tempted to follow up over the telephone, you should make sure you've been patiently waiting before you consider this move. A phone call may help you stand out as a candidate, but it may also come off as pushy. If you do decide to make a phone call, make sure you sound confident yet respectful, and remind the hiring manager why you're a good fit."
