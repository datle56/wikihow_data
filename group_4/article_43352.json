      "content": "Find out if your fish is female. The best way to find out the sex of your goldfish is to ask when you buy the fish or to consult a vet. That said, females goldfish typically have plump bodies. When viewed from above, you can usually notice fuller bellies on the females, and slender midsections of the males. Also, the female pectoral fins (located just behind the gills) are shorter and rounder than those on males.

      "content": "Consider the time of year. If your goldfish is kept outside, it will only spawn during the spring. If your goldfish has always been kept inside, it could spawn at any time of year. Think about what season it is when determining if your outdoor goldfish is pregnant . [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Check your water temperature. Goldfish are most likely to breed in water that is around 72 °F (22 °C). If you believe your goldfish may be preparing to spawn, check the temperature of your water to see if the temperature right."

      "title": "Look for spawning tubercles on your male goldfish.",
      "content": "Look for spawning tubercles on your male goldfish. When your male goldfish are ready to spawn, they will develop tiny white bumps known as “spawning tubercles” around their heads, gill covers, and pectoral fins. If you notice these white spots on your male fish, there is a greater chance that your female fish may be pregnant. [3] X Research source Spawning tubercles may be hard to see. If you do not see these, it doesn’t mean that your fish isn't pregnant."

      "title": "Notice male goldfish chasing female goldfish.",
      "content": "Notice male goldfish chasing female goldfish. When they are preparing to spawn, the male fish may chase the female ones, in a dance sometimes called the “spawning chase.” In many cases, this behavior is more obvious than spawning tubercles (which can be hard to see).

Take note if your goldfish is moving slowly or seems to have trouble getting around.

      "content": "Note the size of your goldfish’s body. Female goldfish are generally a bit rounder than male goldfish. When your female goldfish is about to lay eggs, the size of their belly may grow even larger, and stick out a bit. [7] X Research source Just like the spawning tubercles, in some fish this can be quite noticeable, yet in others, you may not see it at all."
