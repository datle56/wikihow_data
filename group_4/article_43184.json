If your steak is still good, it shouldn’t have any residue or coating on the surface. Once spoilage starts and bacteria forms on the meat, the surface may feel sticky or slippery to the touch.

While it’s okay for a little discoloration to form around the edges of your meat, your steak may have spoiled if it has a consistent gray color. [3] X Research source As red meat is exposed to oxygen, the protein starts to break down and change colors. Dry-aged steak may have a discolored outer layer from the aging process. During dry-aging, the meat is left in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room to tenderize the meat. [4] X Research source"

If you notice a sour or rancid smell coming from the meat, throw it in the trash. [5] X Research source If your steak is slightly discolored but doesn’t have an odor, then it’s still safe to cook.

If there are large areas that feel tough or look discolored, then those areas have freezer burn. While freezer burn is safe to eat, it may give your steak a stale flavor or tougher texture so it’s best to throw it away.
