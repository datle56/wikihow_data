      "content": "Guys your own age haven’t had a ton of life experience. If you often find yourself wondering why the guys you date just want to go out and party all the time, dating an older man might be for you. If you get called an “old soul” a lot, you’d probably have a lot in common with someone a little older. [1] X Research source Keep in mind that this is usually, not always. Even older men can be immature sometimes."

      "content": "Older men might be more worried you’re going to be unfaithful. This is especially true if you still go out to bars and clubs with people your own age. If he’s a jealous person, his possessive nature could become a problem in your relationship. [2] X Research source Jealous behavior can happen at any age. If your partner is controlling where you go, who you talk to, and when you can go out, it may be time to end the relationship."

      "content": "He’s had a long time to work and save his money. While guys your age might still be working for minimum wage or taking college classes, older men are more likely to have some money in the bank.

      "content": "Older men have already lived out their partying days. If you enjoy staying out until the wee hours of the morning, he might not always want to join you. It could turn into a point of contention if he’s constantly bailing on plans or he just wants to stay home and watch TV. [4] X Research source You also might not like going out to the same places. If you prefer the club scene and he likes quiet, candlelit dinners, it could be an issue."

      "content": "They’ve had years of experience you might not have had. Generally, older men know what they like in bed (and they might know what you like, too). While guys your age are still figuring it out, an older man has already experimented enough to know what works and what doesn’t. [5] X Research source On the other hand, he might be less open to trying new things with you. Older men tend to get stuck in a rut of what they like and what they don’t."

Your boyfriend might also have to pay child support or share custody of his children, if he has them. It’s just one more thing to consider when you think about dating an older man. [6] X Research source His ex won’t necessarily be mean to you, even if they had a messy divorce. However, it is a possibility."

      "content": "Older men tend to know what they want. You probably won’t have to deal with the wishy-washy “what are we” conversation—an older man will let you know if they want to get serious or not. If that’s something you want, getting in a relationship with someone older might be a good idea.
