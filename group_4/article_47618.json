      "content": "Try layering your Henley with a button-down shirt in cooler weather. When the weather turns to cooler temperatures, throw on a button-down over your Henley. You'll be stylish and warm. Alternatively, you could wear a pair a sleeveless Henley with a sleeveless button-down in warmer weather. Patterned shirts go well with Henleys. Choose a color found in your shirt pattern, or go with a neutral like black, white or gray."

      "title": "Wear a jacket or a sweater for a pulled together look.",
      "content": "Wear a jacket or a sweater for a pulled together look. This works equally well under military-style coats, jean jackets, cardigans, and V-neck sweaters. The buttons on a Henley will bulge under a crew neck sweater. Choose a cardigan or V-neck instead. If you layered your Henley over a tank top or undershirt, you may want to adjust the undershirt to avoid wrinkles or discomfort."

      "title": "Combine your outfit with jeans for a casual, easy vibe.",
      "content": "Combine your outfit with jeans for a casual, easy vibe. Henley shirts go perfectly with jeans, distressed or not. Unbutton your Henley to reveal a bit of a tank top or an undershirt. This look works well for both men and women. Baggier boyfriend-style jeans will give you a more casual look than a skinny jean or a men's straight jean. Faded washes tend to look more casual than uniform dark washes, and your jean wash will impact how dressed up or casual your Henley looks."

      "title": "Wear your Henley with leather or pleather pants for a night out.",
      "content": "Wear your Henley with leather or pleather pants for a night out. For a sexy look, do a half-tuck and unbutton two buttons. The look is tough and effortless for a fun night out or a casual date. Whisper-thin Henleys will go equally well with leather/vegan pants as a heavier thermal-style Henley."

    {
      "title": "Use a casual skirt for running errands or grabbing brunch.",
      "content": "Use a casual skirt for running errands or grabbing brunch. A skirt is as easy to wear like jeans, and a Henley will work with a denim mini skirt or a fuller skirt. If you opt for the fuller skirt, make sure to tuck it in to maintain a streamlined look. Short or long-sleeved Henley's work with casual skirts."

      "title": "Wear dressy jeans for the ultimate versatile outfit.",
      "content": "Wear dressy jeans for the ultimate versatile outfit. Really, you can wear this outfit almost anywhere and feel great. Dark jeans in a uniform wash look dressier than their distressed and faded counterparts. A heel or dress shoe will immediately dress-up the entire outfit, as will a suit coat or a faux fur or leather/vegan jacket."

    {
      "title": "Add a dressy skirt or pants for work or a date.",
      "content": "Add a dressy skirt or pants for work or a date. You can layer a Henley sweater over a tank or tee and pair it with a dressy skirt or pants. This elevated look can take you from day to night. A thin ribbed Henley with short sleeves is a good choice to wear with a career skirt or dress pant. You can wear a Henley under a suit coat. Smooth fabric Henleys will read as dressier than waffle fabrics."

    {
      "title": "Choose a sleek Henley dress for a bodycon look.",
      "content": "Choose a sleek Henley dress for a bodycon look. Choose a body-con Henley dress in a premium fabric that hits just below the knee. Throw on a suit jacket and heels to elevate the look.<ref> Wear a snake-print ankle-wrap heel for a dinner date. Shorter Henley dresses in looser cuts will look more casual, but still cute, with flip-flops, tennis shoes, or flats."

      "title": "Include a necklace for a little polish.",
      "content": "Include a necklace for a little polish. Both men and women can accessorize their Henleys with necklaces. Shorter necklaces will show when the shirt is unbuttoned. Longer necklaces can work over or under a Henley. Pendant or simple chain options will go better than large jeweled chokers. Wearing a completely unbuttoned Henley with a very long necklace will draw your eye down to where the necklace lays. If this isn't the look you are going for, button one more button or wear a shorter necklace."

      "title": "Use footwear to drive home your vibe.",
      "content": "Use footwear to drive home your vibe. Second, to what bottoms you wear, your shoes may very well drive the vibe of your outfit. From a sexy heel to a hiking boot, the sky's the limit here for both men and women. Moto boots will toughen up your look. They can be worn with straight jeans, over skinny jeans, or with a mini skirt. Tennis shoes help to play it down when you are running errands, but a polished leather high-top might turn you toward a coffee date or casual dinner. Men's dress shoes are a great option for suit pants, dressy jeans, or chinos."

      "title": "Slip on a belt to finish things off.",
      "content": "Slip on a belt to finish things off. Belts are a great way to give outfits a tailored, put-together look. From simple to extravagant, the choice has to do with the vibe you are projecting. A thin leather belt can be worn around the waist of a Henley dress. Thicker embellished belts go great with jeans and boots. Women's high-rise jeans and a tucked in Henley will benefit from a belt. Choose one that fits the width of the belt loops A half-tucked shirt looks great with a belt. Tuck in a little bit slightly askew to the middle. It should look effortless and reveal part or all of your belt's buckle. Avoid wearing an untucked Henley over a belted pant. The belt will bulge under the Henley."
