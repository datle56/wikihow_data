If you do decide to wash your hair, use your regular shampoo and conditioner and wash your hair as you normally would. However, if you're looking to reduce frizz, consider making a few alterations to your chosen products. Try all-natural products that cleanse with oils, rather than soap agents, to help your hair look healthy and glossy when it's dry. Avoid using harsh shampoos made with sulfates, which can dry out your hair and cause it to look dull and frizzy."

      "content": "Apply leave-in conditioner and other products. For best results, add a leave-in conditioner after drying. This will moisten your hair immediately after a shower and prevent frizz during the drying process. A few other kinds of hair products can also help with the diffusing process. [1] X Research source There is one exception to this rule. If your hair is wavy, it might be best to skip the leave-in conditioner. This can weigh down your hair, decreasing the curls and volume you're trying to achieve through using a hair diffuser. [2] X Research source Styling lotion for curly hair can also be helpful. If you have wavy hair, go for a lightweight product like curling cream, or mousse. [3] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. Try twisting each of your curls around your fingers and then slipping your finger out of the coil before you use the diffuser on them. This will help to define them. [4] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. Some advise what is called the \"rake and shake\" method to try and bring out natural curls before diffusing. Divide your hair into 5 sections: 1 in front and 2 sections on either side of your head. Work in leave-in conditioner and hair products section-by-section. When you finish a section, hold it by its end and gently shake it out in a way that allows natural curls or waves to begin taking shape. [5] X Research source"

While this means it'll take longer to dry, your hair will not dry out or get as frizzy during the drying process. [7] X Research source To start, tilt your head to 1 side. Take the diffuser and place it near your hair's roots. Hold it there until your roots are dry. [8] X Research source Use circular motions as you dry the hair near your scalp. Use the diffuser's prongs to gently massage your hair, promoting volume as well as natural waves and curls. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Work your way down to the tips of your hair. Continue massaging your hair with the diffuser, using a circular motion, until your hair is dry down to the tips. Use the diffuser to gently push up on your curls as you work your way down. This helps retain your hair's natural shape and give your hair bounce. Keep in mind, if your hair's naturally curly you may want to use the diffuser differently. Many women with natural curls feel their hair dries better if they stop after drying the roots. If you feel a diffuser makes your natural curly hair frizzier, try letting your ends air dry. See if this leads to better results. [10] X Research source Try lifting each section of hair from the bottom as you dry it with the diffuser. This will add more lift at the roots, and it will prevent your wet hair from weighing down your curls as they dry. [11] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 December 2020. After your roots are dry, you can take sections of curls and put them into the diffuser. Keep the curls intact as you do this to help prevent frizz. Use your hands sparingly as you diffuse your hair. Touching can create frizz and cause natural curls and waves to lose shape. It may feel like it's taking a long time relying on the diffuser alone. However, keeping your hands out of your hair will lead to better results. [12] X Research source"

Hairspray, pomade, or other products can help reduce damage. Gently mist your hair with styling spray once it's dry. This will help your hair retain its shape all day. [13] X Research source If your hair feels crunchy or dull after drying, there are a variety of products you can use to combat this. Consider pomade or shine serum, both of which you can purchase at a local salon. Rub some of the pomade or serum into your hands and then gently work it into your hair. Pull your hands through your hair, as if you're trying to pull your hair into a ponytail, and then continue pulling until you reach your ends. [14] X Research source"

As the heat from a diffuser can be hard on your hair, take extra precautions when conditioning. Leave your regular conditioner in for 3 to 5 minutes instead of washing it out immediately. This will keep your hair a little softer and more moisturized going into the diffusing process. [15] X Research source Make sure to rinse out shampoo and conditioner completely. Leaving in any residue can dry out your hair and cause damage. Rinse until you no longer see any suds leaving your hair. [16] X Research source"

Your local salon will likely also sell leave-in products designed to encourage volume. Read the instructions on the products you buy carefully. Some are spray-on and some should be massaged into your scalp. [29] X Research source Mousse can work well when you're trying to make straight hair curly. Consider adding a small bit of mousse to your hair, focusing specifically at the roots. [30] X Research source As heat can damage hair, a heat protectant is important. This is especially true if your hair is thin. Blow dry sprays and oils are usually sold at local salons. You usually do not need to use more than a drop of such products.
