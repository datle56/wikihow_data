      "content": "The standard array is a method for giving characters their ability scores. In D&D 5e, ability scores are a key part of character creation . They determine how skilled characters are at doing things (and making saving throws and ability checks). There are several ways to set your new character’s ability scores, and the standard array is one of them. With the standard array, you’ll get 6 predetermined numbers to assign to the 6 different ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma. Strength (STR) measures a character’s ability to exert physical force and lift or carry gear. Dexterity (DEX) measures a character’s agility, reflexes, balance, and ability to move swiftly. Constitution (CON) governs a character’s fortitude, vitality, and ability to endure pain. Wisdom (WIS) refers to a character’s practical intelligence, perceptiveness, and cleverness. Intelligence (INT) represents a character’s logic, memory, and analytical thinking skills. Charisma (CHA) measures a character’s charm, eloquence, and force of personality."

Simply assign one number to each ability score (one to Strength, one to Dexterity, one to Constitution, and so on). Then, you’ll be able to determine your character’s modifier for each score. Modifiers are equally important because they’re used in skill rolls and saving throws while playing D&D. [1] X Research source Higher numbers will give your characters higher modifiers, while lower numbers result in low (or even negative) modifiers. For example: 15 grants a +2 modifier 14 grants a +2 modifier 13 grants a +1 modifier 12 grants a +1 modifier 10 results in a +0 modifier 8 results in a -1 modifier"

      "content": "Consider your PC’s class and background when assigning scores. A high ability score means your character is exceptionally talented in that area, while a low ability score means that stat isn’t one of your character’s strong suits. That’s why it’s important to prioritize the ability scores that’ll fit your character best and assign the higher numbers (14 and 15) to those scores—while leaving the low numbers (8 and 10) to ability scores you’re less likely to need. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re building a wizard and want their highest ability score to be Intelligence, assign the highest standard array number (15) to your character’s INT stat. From there, if you want your wizard to have a decent Constitution score (to ensure they have enough hit points), assign the standard array’s 14 to your character’s CON stat. All you need to do to use the standard array is assign each number to each ability score! When you’re done, you can move on to designing the rest of your character."

      "content": "Use racial ability bonuses strategically. Another part of character creation for D&D 5e is choosing your character’s race (for example, human, elf, dwarf, genasi, tiefling, and so on). Most races also provide a bonus to ability scores (either a +2 and +1 bonus to 2 different scores or a +1 bonus to 3 different scores) based on that race’s predominant traits—and you can choose to assign those bonuses as you see fit. So, use your character’s racial bonus to ensure their most important ability scores get an extra boost. [3] X Research source For example, if you want your wizard character to have an INT score even higher than 15, give them a +2 racial bonus. That’ll bring their total INT score to 17 (with a +3 modifier). Alternatively, you might decide that you don’t want your character to have a -1 modifier (from the 8 in the standard array) and assign the +2 racial bonus to your lowest stat."

With predetermined numbers, you can easily assign your character’s ability scores and move on to other aspects of character creation quickly. The standard array is also very simple, requiring no extra calculations on your part and no randomness; all ability scores are balanced and standardized. The standard array prevents min-maxing (which is a strategy where players focus on building up one ability as much as possible at the expense of others). This method lets you create more well-rounded characters. Finally, DMs can easily use the standard array to create quick NPCs and enemy characters when they don’t want to worry about rolling for stats or coming up with stats on their own."

      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons Using the standard array has a downside: it’s limiting. The highest ability score you can have with this method is 15 (or 17 with a +2 racial bonus), and it also prevents you from having any other high scores—which may disappoint some players. Furthermore, this method limits your ability to customize your character; ability scores can help define aspects of your character’s personality or background, but preset scores may limit your creative freedom. Basically, the standard array is D&D’s most rigid method for assigning ability scores. Consider using a different method if you’re an experienced player and want to customize your character as much as possible."

      "title": "Rolling for Stats",

This involves rolling a d6 (6-sided dice) for each ability score number. Simply roll 4d6, drop the lowest number you roll, and add the other 3 dice. Write that number down, then repeat the process 5 more times—and from there, you’ll have 6 numbers to assign to your character’s 6 ability scores. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Point Buy",

Then, you get 27 points and must distribute those points to the different ability scores as you see fit. The more points you buy for an ability, the more expensive raising that ability score becomes. This method is best for advanced D&D players who don’t want to deal with the randomness of the rolling method. [17] X Research source Increasing an ability score with this method costs the following: An ability score of 8 costs 0 points to raise. An ability score of 9 costs 1 point to raise. An ability score of 10 costs 2 points to raise. An ability score of 11 costs 3 points to raise An ability score of 12 costs 4 points to raise. An ability score of 13 costs 5 points to raise. An ability score of 14 costs 7 points to raise. An ability score of 15 costs 9 points to raise."

      "title": "Homebrewed Standard Array",
      "content": "Homebrewed Standard Array Do you like the simplicity of the standard array method but wish the numbers weren’t so limiting? Try using the standard array while implementing your own homebrew changes to it! For example, a common homebrew variation is the “Advanced Standard Array,” which works the same as the standard array but raises the available numbers to 15, 14, 13, 13, 11, and 9—meaning your character will end up with higher ability scores overall. [18] X Research source Want to play a super powerful character? Another homebrew adjustment involves changing the standard array numbers to 18, 17, 16, 15, 13, and 11. On the other hand, if you want to explore the concept of a character that has both very high ability scores and very low ones, try an array like 18, 16, 12, 10, 8, and 6."

      "title": "As a DM, you can easily allow both point buy and standard array.",
      "content": "As a DM, you can easily allow both point buy and standard array. Since the point buy method actually lets you recreate the same numbers as the standard array (if you arrange your numbers a certain way), it’s simple enough to let players use either method. Experienced players who want more control can use point buy, while new players (or those who don’t really care about ability scores) can use the standard array. [19] X Research source However, mixing the standard array and point buy methods with the rolling method might not be a good idea since the results can be so different. For example, a player who used the rolling method and got multiple low scores might be jealous of players with a more balanced setup using point buy. On the other hand, a player who used the standard array might be jealous of another player who get several high scores with the rolling method. If you’re going to be a Dungeon Master (DM), try talking to players before the start of the campaign and decide on using either point buy/standard array or the rolling method."
