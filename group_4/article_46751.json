      "content": "Set the steamer down in a spot where it’ll get a little bit wet.

Be sure to take your shower steamer out of the packaging before setting it out; otherwise, the steamer won’t work. Some shower steamers may come with a mesh bag. Simply dampen the bagged steamer with a little water and dangle it somewhere in your shower."
