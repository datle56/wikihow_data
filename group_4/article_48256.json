      "title": "Awakened Buddha",
      "content": "Awakened Buddha It’s hard to pick a favorite, but we’re going with the awakened version of Buddha here—it allows you to transform into a large Buddha form that's tankier and able to use swords, guns, and fighting styles. In addition to the transformation, your range for sword and fighting styles increases, and paired with the AOE moves from the Fruit, provides massive damage. You can easily solo stronger bosses, like the Cake Queen, Darkbeard , and Soul Reaper. Being harder to kill and having high damage makes Awakened Buddha the best for overall gameplay, which includes grinding, PvE, and PvP. If you're newer or don't have the Buddha Fruit yet, use Light [1] X Research source or Flame. [2] X Research source"
