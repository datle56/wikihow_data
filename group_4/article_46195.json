      "content": "Get familiar with the Minitab layout. When you first start Minitab, you will be shown two main windows: the Session window and the Worksheet window. The Session window will display the output of any analysis, and the Worksheet window is where you enter your data. The worksheet window will look very similar to an Excel spreadsheet."

      "content": "Enter your data labels in the second row of the Worksheet. The first row of the worksheet is reserved for the C1, C2, C3, etc. labels that Minitab assigns to the columns. The second row is reserved for column labels, which you can enter in manually. Simply click an empty second row cell and type in the label for that column."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enter your data into columns.",
      "content": "Enter your data into columns. Once you have your column labeled, you can start entering data into the column. Pressing ↵ Enter will take you to the cell below the current one. If you click the little arrow in the upper-left corner of the Worksheet, you can change the direction of data entry so that pressing ↵ Enter will take you to the next column on the same row. If data is saved in an Excel spreadsheet, copy and paste it to Minitab. Highlight the data set saved in Excel. Right click the mouse and select copy. Go to Minitab and click the first cell below C1. Right click the mouse and select paste cells. [1] X Research source Each column should represent one type of data. For example, if you are entering information about baseball teams, one column might be RBI, one might be Errors, and one might be Home Runs."
