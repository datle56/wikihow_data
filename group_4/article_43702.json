      "content": "Theatrical Romantics are soft with a slightly sharp bone structure. In David Kibbe’s book, Metamorphosis: Discover Your Image Identity and Dazzle As Only You Can , he describes 13 body types that fall along a yin/yang spectrum. [2] X Research source Yin is the more feminine, romantic figure, while yang represents a dramatic, masculine figure. [3] X Research source The Theatrical Romantic falls on the feminine side of the yin/yang spectrum with a few masculine characteristics, like a slightly sharp bone structure. The Theatrical Romantic body type has soft or fleshy arms and legs with hands and feet that are small in proportion to their body height. [4] X Research source When the Theatrical Romantic gains weight, they maintain their hourglass, or double-curve, shape and defined waist, but their upper arms, thighs, and face can become very fleshy.

      "content": "Theatrical Romantics are under 5’5” with proportional arms and legs. Theatrical Romantics are thought of as petite from their height to their delicate, if occasionally sharp, bone structure. [6] X Research source If you have most of the following characteristics, your body type is most likely a Kibbe Theatrical Romantic. Very delicate & petite Sloped, rounded shoulders Delicate hands & feet Arms & legs that are short but proportionate to your height A full bustline & rounded hips An overall voluptuous appearance Small, delicate facial structure Large, rounded eyes, lush lips, and slightly sharp cheekbones"

      "content": "Theatrical Romantics aren’t tall, and they don’t have sharp angles. If you aren’t sure about your body type, there are a few characteristics that can help you rule out whether you’re a Theatrical Romantic. This is especially helpful if you feel like two or more different body types seem to fit. Theatrical Romantics don’t have the following characteristics: [7] X Research source Extreme height Large or wide bones Large hands & feet Extremely prominent facial features Small, narrow eyes Thin, straight lips Straight, boyish figure No waist definition"

      "title": "Wear clothing that hugs your curves and highlights your waist.",
      "content": "Wear clothing that hugs your curves and highlights your waist. Try rounded cuts with hourglass silhouettes that are very slightly oversized to emphasize your curves and really showcase your small waist. Go with soft, draped lines that are flowing and a little clingy. [8] X Research source A sharply defined waist is the most flattering cut for your body. Ornate cuts and delicate but intricate embellishments look great on you and compliment your lush figure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Choose tops with draped fabric and ornate details.",
      "content": "Choose tops with draped fabric and ornate details. Soft ruffles, bows, lace trim, and sparkly detailing all fit with your Theatrical Romantic essence. Silky blouses in draped styles with puffed sleeves are ideal, especially if there is definition or emphasis along the waistline. [9] X Research source Sleeves can be voluminous as long as they gather or taper at the wrist. Avoid stiff fabrics that are highly tailored with sharp details. Shapeless, unstructured styles tend to look boxy and unflattering on you because they hide or clash with your soft, rounded curves."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for pants in lighter fabrics that taper toward the ankle.",
      "content": "Opt for pants in lighter fabrics that taper toward the ankle. Choose a drapey fabric that flatters your curvy figure. Ties, shirring, or gathers emphasize your small waist. A narrow or tapered ankle will highlight your naturally delicate bone structure. Have pantlegs hemmed so they end at the ankle or slightly shorter. [10] X Research source Avoid straight or heavily tailored styles with sharp pleats, cuffs, or plackets. Stay away from overly baggy styles that lack any structure."
    },
    {
      "title": "Go for knee-length flowing skirts that are cut for your curves.",
      "content": "Go for knee-length flowing skirts that are cut for your curves. A flowy skirt with an uneven hem can be a little longer and fall around the mid-calf. A bias-cut or shirring at the waist is perfect for hugging your curvy body. [11] X Research source Avoid straight or A-line skirts that hide your curves. Choose a “tulip” shape instead. Wide, shapeless skirts with long hemlines can make your hourglass figure appear bulky."

    {
      "title": "Wear dresses in soft fabrics with an emphasized waist.",
      "content": "Wear dresses in soft fabrics with an emphasized waist. Choose feminine styles with defined shoulders and shirring or gathering to emphasize your waist. [12] X Research source Soft, draped necklines, tapered wrists, and ornate detailing match your Theatrical Romantic style. Try light fabrics with a sheen or a plush feel in luscious colors. Avoid both sharply tailored or unstructured styles that are symmetrical and subdued."

    {
      "title": "Choose fluffy sweaters that are fitted at the waist and wrists.",
      "content": "Choose fluffy sweaters that are fitted at the waist and wrists. Plush knits with soft necklines and lavish trim best fit the Theatrical Romantic vibe. Choose sweaters that have a defined waist or are shorter in length and tapered at the wrist. [13] X Research source Avoid bulky, oversized knits or skinny rib-knit styles. Pass on classic crew necks and cardigans without any embellishments."

      "title": "Try peplum jackets or classic fitted blazers with a narrow lapel.",
      "content": "Try peplum jackets or classic fitted blazers with a narrow lapel. Choose jackets that have a nipped-in waist and short length. Peplums look wonderful on your hourglass figure, as do lapels with ornate trim like braiding or jewels. [14] X Research source Avoid boxy or severely tailored jackets that hide your shape. Long blazers and jackets obscure your small waistline, making you appear larger than you are."

    {
      "title": "Wear delicate shoes with ornate detailing in plush materials.",
      "content": "Wear delicate shoes with ornate detailing in plush materials. Strappy shoes or ones with open toes or backs accentuate your dainty feet. Go all out with ornate trim like bows, lace, and jewels. Feminine flats are also a good choice. [15] X Research source Avoid both chunky and plain styles or shoes with angular designs."

    {
      "title": "Opt for soft fabrics that drape over your curves.",
      "content": "Opt for soft fabrics that drape over your curves. Lightweight fabrics with soft textures are ideal for the Theatrical Romantic. For clothing, go with fabrics like silks, jerseys, challis, crepe, and handkerchief linen. You can’t go wrong with suede, velvet, and shantung for shoes and accessories. Softly textured knits like Angora and Boucle are also great choices. Avoid dull, heavy, or stiff fabrics that clash with your soft figure. [16] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose larger floral, feather, and rounded prints.",
      "content": "Choose larger floral, feather, and rounded prints. Any colorful or luscious prints will work for the Theatrical Romantic. Abstract watercolor prints with swirls of color, ornate shapes, and wild florals are all great choices. You also look great in larger prints in vivid color combinations. [17] X Research source Avoid geometric prints, stripes, plaids, or small symmetrical prints, as they can seem overly angular for your lush form."

      "title": "Try accessories with rounded shapes in plush fabrics.",
      "content": "Try accessories with rounded shapes in plush fabrics. Think feminine, intricate, and ornate when it comes to accessories. Go for high-quality investment pieces for a more polished and sophisticated look. Choose small bags with a rounded shape and gathers, tucks, or beading with delicate shoulder straps. Try wider belts in supple leather with beading and intricate buckles. The best hats for you are rounded with crisp brims. [18] X Research source Avoid stiff fabrics and leather, floppy hats, and masculine styles that clash with your yin energy."

      "title": "Wear romantic hairstyles with curls or lavish waves.",
      "content": "Wear romantic hairstyles with curls or lavish waves. Choose soft styles with some volume for a rounded shape. Longer styles require lots of work to keep them looking perfectly coiffed and well cared for. Shorter styles with a marcelled or mermaid wave look fabulous on you as long as they seem lavish and ornate. [19] X Research source Avoid stiff styles with too much hold that creates a “helmet head” look and feel. Severe blunt cuts, overly layered styles, and wash-and-wear hair may be too angular and messy for the Theatrical Romantic."

      "content": "Choose makeup for a refined, finished look with a hint of sparkle. Think of well-blended watercolors when applying your makeup. Choose any color from pastel to bright with a bit of sheen or sparkle. Finish off your look with glossy lips in any shade of red or pink. Avoid sharp or heavy contouring since you’ll be fighting against your naturally soft features. [20] X Research source Smoky colors and neutrals may look a little hard or stark on you."

      "title": "Theatrical Romantics have a bit more yang than Romantics.",
      "content": "Theatrical Romantics have a bit more yang than Romantics. Kibbe identified 2 body types that fall in the Romantic spectrum: Romantic and Theatrical Romantic. These types have a lot in common with the soft curves and petite frames that come with strong yin, or feminine, energy. The hint of yang, or masculine energy, gives the Theatrical Romantic a little sharpness in their bones. [21] X Research source Romantic is the softest body type without any sharpness in their bones. They have rounder shoulders and slightly wider bones. Theatrical Romantic is more dramatic with thinner, sharper bones. There’s an additional sharpness in their facial features and character."
