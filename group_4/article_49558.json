Marriage contracts are commonly known as \"prenuptial agreements,\" \"prenups,\" and \"premarital agreements.\" A well-drafted marriage contract can protect the parties' property and make a divorce a lot less painful, but contemplating divorce and talking about finances can be very challenging for a couple. Some advantages of marriage contracts are: Defining what property is separate property and what is community property (belonging equally to the couple) Clarify agreements between the spouses Establish how future matters will be decided Support your estate plans Reduce conflicts and save money on attorneys' fees in the event of a divorce [2] X Research source"

[3] X Research source Discussing divorce and asset division can cause bad feelings between couples. It can be hard to imagine that the person you want to marry could try to take advantage of you during a divorce, and it can be even harder to face the implication that you might do the same to them. If your relationship can't withstand these challenges, a marriage contract may not be a good fit for your relationship. [4] X Research source State law may protect you without a marriage contract. [5] X Research source There are nine community property states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin (Alaska also has an opt-in community property law). [6] X Research source In community property states, most property acquired during marriage is presumed to be community property, while property acquired before or after marriage, or inherited or purchased with funds earned before marriage, is considered to be separate property. If you live in a community property state, you might forego a marriage contract and just rely on the law for the division of your property in the event of a divorce. [7] X Research source"

[8] X Research source This minimizes the pressure either of you feel to sign an agreement with which you're not completely comfortable. You might consider giving your partner some reading material about marriage contacts, like a book or website, to read on his or her own time. Then you'll both have a better understanding of the basics, and will be more emotionally prepared to have an honest conversation."

Your contract may be invalid if a court determines that one spouse waived his or her rights without fully understanding the contract, and some courts require that both parties are represented by attorneys. [9] X Research source You and your partner should each hire different attorneys to avoid any conflict of interest. Have each attorney review the contract terms and explain what rights you gain or waive under each provision. Remember that the contract is a compromise and that some of the terms may not be in your best interests. Your attorney will point this out and ask you to consider the contract carefully. Several high profile cases of marriage contracts being overturned have demonstrated that it can be cheaper and simpler to not have a marriage contract at all than to have one that is drafted incorrectly. [10] X Research source An attorney can also advise you of any specific state law that relates to your agreement. [11] X Research source You can get referrals from friends and family, or from attorneys who may not practice family law but know a trusted colleague who does. You can also use referral services through your state and local bar associations, or just search online."

You may also want to designate certain assets to the less wealthy spouse in the event of a divorce, so that he or she gets a fair share and is able to live independently.
