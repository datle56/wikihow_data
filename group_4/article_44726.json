If the blister is on your foot, wear sandals or loose slippers around the house to give it time to heal. If the blister is on your hand, there's no need to wear gloves or a bandage as long as you aren't using your hands to do something that might cause the blister to break or get infected."

[14] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source For example, put a bandage over a spot on your hand that gets repeatedly rubbed while you are doing a craft project or some other repetitive motion. If you have problems with blisters on your feet, wear 2 pairs of socks to create more padding on them. There is also padding available at most pharmacies that is made to cushion areas of your feet that rub in your shoes.
