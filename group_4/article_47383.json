Water can damage your doll’s stuffing and even make her eyes go rusty. [1] X Research source Pull the bag right up to her hairline. For extra protection, close your doll’s eyes before you cover her. If you don’t have any plastic bags handy, be very careful not to get any water on your doll’s face or body."

      "content": "Rinse her hair under the water. Turn on the water and run your doll’s hair under it, from the tips up to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from her scalp. Try not to get her scalp wet, since that can damage her wig and loosen the glue holding it in place. [2] X Research source Make sure the water isn’t too hot or too cold. It should be about room temperature, or a little bit warm. Run the water in a steady, gentle stream. Don’t turn it up too high because it might splash onto your doll."

      "title": "Wash her hair with a bit of mild shampoo, then rinse it out.",
      "content": "Wash her hair with a bit of mild shampoo, then rinse it out. Squeeze a dime-sized amount of shampoo into your palm and scrunch it up through your doll’s hair, just like you would with your hair. Rinse her hair out under the sink when you’re done lathering. [3] X Research source You can use special synthetic wig shampoo, baby shampoo, or a mild regular shampoo. Stop shampooing about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from her scalp so you don’t get her head wet. If your doll has anything stuck in her hair, like glue or gum, work those strands with your fingers until you can feel it loosening. It’s ok if it doesn’t all come out now—you’ll be brushing it out later."

      "content": "Rub a little bit of conditioner through her hair, then rinse it. Pour a dime-sized amount of conditioner into your palm. Massage it into your doll’s hair, starting at the ends and working up to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from her head. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, then rinse it out under your sink. [4] X Research source If your doll has curly hair, the conditioner might make the curls a little less tight. Conditioning your doll’s hair is optional, but it can help to make your doll’s hair less frizzy. You can use any kind of conditioner you want. You can try to use the brand that goes with the shampoo you used, or just go with a regular hydrating conditioner."

      "content": "Gently brush through her damp hair with a wire brush. Sit your doll up straight and hold her between your legs. Use a wire brush to detangle and smooth down her hair, starting at the ends and brushing up to the roots until it’s flat and shiny. If you want to restyle your doll’s hair, to make it wavy or curly, for example, now is a great time to do it! You can create waves with 1 or 2 braids, or make curls by twirling her hair around your fingers. You want to brush her hair while it’s still damp because brushing it when it’s already dry can make it frizz."

      "content": "Spray your doll’s hair with a little bit of water. Fill up a spray bottle with sink water and spray it evenly over your doll’s hair. You want her hair to be damp, but not dripping. This will make it easier to brush and style, and prevent it from getting frizzy. [7] X Research source If you’re styling your doll’s hair after washing it, you don’t need to spray it again as long as it’s still damp. If her hair starts feeling dry while you’re brushing or styling, give it a few more spritzes. Try not to spray near her face, or too much over her scalp. It’s just a light spritz, though, so don’t worry if you get a little on her skin—just wipe it off with a paper towel."

You can get them online or at American Girl Stores. If you don’t have one, use a small, unused wire brush or pick. [9] X Research source If your doll’s hair is straight or wavy, use a wire brush. A wire brush is just a regular brush with bristles made of wire instead of plastic, which can snag in your doll’s hair. If your doll’s hair is curly or textured, use a pick instead of a brush, which will make her hair frizzy. [10] X Research source Don’t use a brush or pick that you’ve used on your own hair."

Slowly work upwards towards the roots of your doll’s hair, but make sure to brush in a downward motion so you don’t create snarls. Don’t forget to spritz and brush her bangs, too! [11] X Research source If you can, hold her neck and the roots of her hair while you brush so you don’t yank her head. It’s ok if you see some strands come out while you brush. This is normal, especially if this is the first time you’ve brushed your doll’s hair. Take your time while you detangle!

Smooth it out with your hand, then coil it and twirl it around your finger to create a curl. Repeat until you’ve curled all of your doll’s hair. [13] X Research source For even tighter curls, wind the strand of hair around a pen or unsharpened pencil. Hold the hair around the pencil for a couple of seconds, then slowly slide the brush out. If you can see the natural direction of the curl, twirl it around your fingers in the same way. If not, curl it however you think looks best! Make sure your doll’s hair is wet when you curl it. You can spritz it with the spray bottle again if you need to."

While her hair is still wet, braid it back tightly into however many braids you want. Leave the braids in for a day or so, then take them out for a permanent wave style. The longer you leave the braids in, the longer the waves will last. You can do regular braids or French braids in your doll’s hair. Braid close to her scalp to create the most waves."

Only wash it when it’s noticeably dirty, which probably won’t be more than once every 2-3 years. American Girl doesn’t recommend you wash your doll’s hair regularly. Your regular doll hair care routine should be a simple misting and brushing."
