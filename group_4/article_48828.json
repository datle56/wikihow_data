Find your microphone in the list, click it once to select it, then make sure the Set Default option is greyed out (active). Click Properties to open more options for your mic. Click the Levels tab and make sure the volume is set to 100. Click the Advanced tab and make sure you have the right quality set for your microphone. Many external mics use the last option – \"2 channel, 16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)\"—but you can check your microphone's manual to see the recommended quality. Choosing the wrong option here can prevent your mic from working or cause your input to sound bad. Restart Roblox and test your mic. If it's still not working, close Roblox and return to this Properties menu. Enable or disable the options under Exclusive Mode to test if your mic works with or without them."
