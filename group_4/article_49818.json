      "content": "Click on \"Compose\" or \"New.\" Before you can write an email, you will need to open a new, blank message box to write your email in. The exact method varies depending on the service you use, but there will usually be a button toward the top of the page with a label like “Compose,” “New,” or “New Message.” [1] X Research source If you are uncertain about how to create a new message, check the help pages for your email service to learn more about it in greater detail."

      "title": "List the recipients' email addresses.",
      "content": "List the recipients' email addresses. You do not need to list your own email address, but you do need to specify the email address of the person or people you intend to send the email to. [2] X Research source A space is often enough to separate multiple email addresses, but some services do request that you separate multiple addresses with a comma or some other form of punctuation. If this is the case, these instructions should be specified by your specific email provider. Type the email address of the main receiver or receivers in the “To:” field. The main receiver usually refers to anyone whom the email is directly meant for or addressed to in the body of the email. Type other email addresses in the “CC:” field. This is the “copy” field. A receiver should be listed in the “CC:” field if the email does not directly mention them but does refer to something that individual should be aware of. Use the “BCC:” field to hide email addresses. If you do not want the receivers of an email to see a list of email addresses the message went to, you should type those email addresses in the “blind copy” field."

      "title": "Include an informative subject.",
      "content": "Include an informative subject. Every email service will let you type a subject or title for your email in the “Subject” box. [3] X Research source The subject should be brief, but it should also give the recipient some idea of what the email is about. For example, a casual email to a friend could simply say “What's Up?” If you are emailing with a question about an assignment, though, the subject line might read something like “Math homework.” Similarly, a question to a supervisor or professor could be labeled with a subject line like “Question” or “Question about...” followed by a brief label describing the topic in question. Note that a message without a subject will appear in a recipient's inbox with the label of “(no subject).”"

      "title": "Write the body of your email.",
      "content": "Write the body of your email. The body of your email should be written in the large text box below the subject line. The body of each email should typically include a salutation, message, and closing. The nature of email is fast, so you should generally keep the length of your message fairly short."

If the message is casual in nature and you are sending it to someone you are on informal terms with, you can send a friendly email. [5] X Research source The only time you would not send a friendly email to a family or friend would be if you are sending a group email of an official nature, like a plea for donations or sale advertisement. Since these emails will likely be sent to people who you are not on casual terms with, as well, you must gear the email toward them."

[6] X Research source If you are just writing an email to catch up with a friend, you could include a humorous subject line or one as simple as \"Long time no see!\" If you are writing with a purpose, mention what that purpose is. For example, if you decide to write an email about a group outing, label the email with a subject that specifically mentions that outing."

      "content": "Consider addressing the recipient by name. For a friendly email, this is not strictly necessary, but it is still a polite way to begin the body of your message.

      "content": "Write your message clearly, but keep your language casual. The body of your message should be easy to understand, but the tone should be informal and conversational. [7] X Research source Read your email and ask yourself if the content of the email sounds like the way you speak in person. If so, then you've achieved a good tone for a friendly email. Use contractions. Contractions are not a part of formal writing, but they are a common part of everyday conversation, making them appropriate for a friendly email. Feel free to use slang. If desired, you can include Internet slang: \"thx\" instead of \"thanks,\" \"4\" instead of \"for,\" \"l8r\" instead of \"later,\" etc. Also use emoticons when appropriate. :)"

[8] X Research source Your closing can be as simple as your name: \"Jen\" \"-Jen\" You can also get a little more creative with your closing: \"Later! Jen\" \"This email will self-destruct in 3...2...1...\""

This includes, among others, supervisors, teachers (If you are a student), co-workers, clients and customers, instructors, and community or political officials. Note that you may find that strict formal emails are not necessary with someone who falls into one of these categories once you build a working relationship with that person. When a \"formal\" email becomes a little too rigid, you should write a \"semi-formal\" email. The tone of your message can be a little more conversational but you should stay away from Internet slang.
