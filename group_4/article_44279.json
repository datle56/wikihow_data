      "content": "Find or buy a removable as hard drive that is compatible with your PC. Small hard drives up to 1 terabyte are available online and in most electronics departments at large box stores. It is best to keep a removable hard drive for backing up files, if you don’t have a cloud storage provider. Refrain from using the same backup drive as a way to occasionally transfer files from computer to computer. If you use cloud backup, check to see if you can download your files onto another computer by signing into a new computer. Some programs may not have this capability, while others may require verification of computers for security purposes."

      "content": "Use a small USB flash drive, if you want to transfer under 64 gigabytes (GB) worth of files to a different computer. This is ideal if your PCs are located far from each other. Flash drives are available at office supply stores, box stores and online for $5 to $50, depending on the size. In place of a USB drive, you can opt to burn the files onto a CD or DVD; however, unless you buy expensive rewritable discs, burning a disc filled with files will write the disc permanently. With removable hard drives and flash drives, you can delete and reuse the drive."
