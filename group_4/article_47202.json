      "content": "Maintain good posture while you walk. Your posture can change your gait, so try to stand tall while you’re walking around barefoot. Straighten your spine, roll your shoulders back, and engage your core as you walk. Additionally, look forward to check your terrain rather than looking down. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might be tempted to look down so you don’t accidentally step on something. Instead of looking where your next step will be, look a few feet ahead of you. This way you can watch where you’re going without altering your posture."

      "title": "Put your heel down on the ground first when you take a step.",
      "content": "Put your heel down on the ground first when you take a step. Over time, wearing shoes may have altered your natural gait, so it’s important to make sure you’re putting your heel down first. Land each step on the center of the back of your heel. This keeps your walking gait smooth rather than heavy. Your gait may automatically be more natural when you’re going barefoot since your feet can feel the ground."

      "content": "Roll your foot down onto the ground from heel to toe. Once your heel lands on the ground, lower the rest of your foot.

      "content": "Walk on a soft surface that’s less likely to hurt your feet. Grass and soil are both a great option if you’re walking outdoors. You might also try an all-weather running track. If you’re walking inside, stay on carpeted areas or rugs. [9] X Research source If your feet start to hurt, you might try a softer terrain. For instance, hard packed soil may hurt your feet, so you might stick to grass."

      "content": "Start with a few minutes of barefoot walking a day to reduce injury risk. Even though walking barefoot may provide benefits to some people, it usually takes time for your feet to get used to it. Since your feet are used to shoes, going barefoot might stress them. Stick to short walks at first. [10] X Research source For instance, you might start with a 5-10 minute barefoot walk."

When you feel comfortable walking barefoot, add another 5-10 minutes to your walks. If your feet start to hurt, shorten your walks so your feet don’t feel stressed. [11] X Research source As an example, you might stick to a 10-minute daily walk for 2-4 weeks. Then, you might increase to a 20-minute walk. Once a 20-minute walk feels easy, you might walk for 30 minutes a day."

      "content": "Check the ground for objects that might harm you. You probably try to avoid stepping on hard or pointy objects even when you’re wearing shoes, but it’s extra important to watch out if you’re not wearing shoes. Items like glass or rocks may cut or bruise your feet if you step on them, so always look where you’re stepping. Additionally, avoid areas that commonly have debris that you might step on.

      "content": "Use caution if the terrain is wet or rough. It’s easy to slip on wet terrain, and you may not be able to see what’s under standing water. Additionally, rough terrain might scratch up your feet or could trip you. Check the land where you’re going to walk carefully so you don’t accidentally get hurt. [15] X Research source As an example, you might not walk outside right after a storm or along a riverbank. Similarly, you might decide to wear shoes if you’re walking on a rocky surface."

      "content": "Walk barefoot outside to possibly reduce your stress levels. Studies show that exposing your bare skin to the ground may reduce your levels of cortisol. Since cortisol is a stress hormone, this might mean you’ll feel less stressed and more relaxed and upbeat after going barefoot outside. Try walking around barefoot to see if it helps you feel better. Track your moods both before and after a walk, as well as on days you don’t do a barefoot walk.
