      "content": "As the first sign in the zodiac calendar, Aries aren’t afraid to chop off their locks and make a bold statement. An edgy pixie cut is the perfect style to match their confident personality, plus help them get ready in the blink of an eye. With just a dab of gel or pomade , they can walk out the door and conquer the day! [1] X Research source What to ask for: Request this style by name, and determine your face shape to choose the best cut for your features. If you have a shorter, rounder face, for example, adding volume at the crown and roots can make it appear more angular. Best hair colors: Bring out your inner Aries with a fiery red or platinum blonde color. Best male hairstyle: Choose a military cut to match your busy lifestyle—all you need is a bit of styling wax to keep it in shape. Shaving the sides and back into a “high and tight” cut is the most common request, but you can also ask your barber for 1-2 inches of length on top with a high to medium fade. [2] X Research source"
