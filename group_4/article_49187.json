      "content": "Cut your glitter paper about twice the size of your present. Lay your glitter paper flat and measure how much you’ll need by folding it over the top of your present. Leave about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of extra paper on the ends, then use sharp scissors to cut out your stretch of paper. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Fold your glitter paper in half from corner to corner, then cut the excess. Grab 1 corner of your glitter paper and fold it over to the corner across from it to make a triangle shape. Use scissors to cut off the strip of paper sticking out from the end of the triangle. You’ll end up with your glitter paper in a perfect square once you unfold it. [2] X Research source Try to make your cut as straight as possible so your glitter paper is in an even square."

      "title": "Place the present in the center of the glitter paper.",
      "content": "Place the present in the center of the glitter paper. Position your glitter paper so that it’s in a diamond in front of you with the glitter part face down. Then, put your present in the middle of the paper so you can start to wrap it up. [3] X Research source You can adjust the present later, so don’t worry if it isn’t perfectly centered."

      "title": "Wrap the top corner of paper over the present.",
      "content": "Wrap the top corner of paper over the present. Keep the present facing you and bring the top corner of the glitter paper over the present. Make sure the corner of the paper wraps over the bottom edge of the present. [4] X Research source Smooth down any wrinkles in the paper so that it lays flat over your present. This will make it easier to work with."

      "title": "Pull the right corner of the paper over the right side of the present.",
      "content": "Pull the right corner of the paper over the right side of the present. Keep one hand on top of the present to hold the paper down, and use the other hand to pull the right side of the glitter paper over the right side of the present. As you pull, use your middle finger to push the paper towards the present and guide it up over the side. [5] X Research source If you’re having trouble, crease the edges of the paper before you start folding."

      "content": "Grab the left corner of the paper and pull it over the left side of the present. Now, you can do the same thing to the other side.

Use one hand to hold the top of the present and use your other hand to guide the remaining flap of paper up and over the top of the present. Smooth the paper down so that it lays flat on top of the present. [7] X Research source This can be a little hard to do by yourself, so ask a friend for help if you need to."

      "title": "Wrap a ribbon around the edges for a cute look.",
      "content": "Wrap a ribbon around the edges for a cute look. Once your glitter paper is around your present, lay a ribbon or a piece of twine underneath the present. Tie the loose ends together on top of the present in a large bow to add a cute decoration with a purpose on your present. [9] X Research source You can do this after you’ve used the no tape wrapping method if your gift doesn’t look very secure."

      "title": "Glue down the edges for a more secure present.",
      "content": "Glue down the edges for a more secure present. Wrap your present in glitter paper like you normally would. Lift 1 flap of paper up and add a pea-sized dot of liquid glue on any areas where the paper overlaps, like the front and sides. Hold the paper together for about 1 minute to let the glue dry. [10] X Research source You can use a paint brush to add the glue if it makes wrapping your present easier."

      "content": "Add glitter to plain wrapping paper with glue for an easy solution. If you really can’t hold down your glitter wrapping paper and you’d like to switch to something else, wrap your present in plain wrapping paper and then draw a design in glue on the top. Then, pour some glitter on it and wait for the glue to dry to add your own glitter design to your presents. [11] X Research source You can also cover all of your wrapping paper in glitter and glue if you want full coverage."
