      "content": "Purchase an air quality monitor. There are currently quite a few indoor air quality monitors on the market that can effectively detect (and log over time) the quality of air inside your home. These devices typically check PM2.5 levels (tiny dust particles and other allergens in the air that you inhale), VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds – like chemical pollutants), temperature, and humidity (for mold). [1] X Research source Some of the most reliable air quality monitors on the market are the Foobot, Awair, Speck, and Air Mentor 6 in 1. These devices typically cost between $150-$250 US."

      "content": "Check for signs and symptoms of mold . You can typically tell if there is a mold infestation in your home by using your eyes and your nose. If you smell a musty odor coming from certain parts of your home, and a cleaning doesn't remove the smell, you might want to consider hiring a professional for a mold test.

      "content": "Use an air purifier. These machines can be very useful in improving the air quality in your home, especially for those who suffer from allergy problems. Electronic air purifiers/air cleaners are typically the most effective, as they can remove dust particles, mold spores, and other allergens from the air more efficiently than filtered purifiers. Place the air purifier in your bedroom for the best results. This will most likely give you a longer period of exposure to the benefits of the machine (while you're sleeping) than in any other location in your house."

      "content": "Install carbon monoxide detectors on every floor of your home. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless, tasteless gas that can be a byproduct of many appliances found in your home (like stoves, fireplaces, furnaces, water heaters, and grills). It can be deadly if inhaled, so it's important to always have carbon monoxide detectors installed on every floor of your home to alert you if there are high levels of CO in your home. [4] X Research source Place the carbon monoxide detectors close to your bedrooms so that you'll be more likely to hear the alarm when you are sleeping. Make sure you change the detector batteries regularly. A good rule of thumb is to change the batteries once every 6 months or so, though the duration will vary depending on the model."

You should change the air filters at least once every 90 days for the average family home. [6] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 1 April 2020.

If you (or others in your home) have allergies, you should change the air filters every 20-45 days. If you have a washable filter, vacuum it first to remove any big particles. Then, soak the filter for 15 minutes before rinsing it with water. [7] X Expert Source Victor Belavus Air Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview. 1 April 2020."

      "content": "Use a professional test if you need an official test result. If you are buying or selling a home, often testing the air for pollutants is a contingency of the loan you will be applying for. This is especially true in regions that have high levels of air pollution due to industry or even natural causes (like the common occurrence of forest fires). In these cases, at-home tests that you complete yourself will not be sufficient. Hire a professional who has experience testing air quality in homes, preferably one who is recommended by your realtor, lender, or home inspector. If you don't have a recommendation for a professional, try to do some online research by reading online reviews from actual customers of various professionals in your areas. You can also check a prospective professional for certifications in the field – such as membership in the Indoor Air Quality Association or the International Association of Certified Indoor Air Consultants.
