      "title": "Keep the turkey in its packaging from the store.",
      "content": "Keep the turkey in its packaging from the store. Manufacturers choose packaging that keeps bacteria out, maintaining the meat’s freshness. As soon as you remove the original packaging, you expose the meat to bacteria, increasing the potential for spoilage. [1] X Research source The packaging must be leak-proof. Check the turkey over before buying it. Avoid any turkeys with punctured or leaky packaging."

      "content": "Store uncooked turkeys in a freezer below 0 °F (−18 °C). At this temperature, the bird remains completely frozen. Freezing a turkey is the best way to retain its quality and freshness until you’re ready to use it. If you don’t plan on using the turkey right away, keep it on ice.

      "content": "Wrap fresh turkeys up before storing them in the freezer. Fresh turkeys are safe to store in the freezer, including hunted ones. If the turkey isn’t already packaged, wrap it tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Put it in an airtight bag and store it for up to a year. [3] X Research source Vacuum sealed bags are the best way to keep turkeys fresh. If this isn’t an option, put the wrapped turkey into a large bag, such as a garbage bag, and push the air out before tying it up tightly."

      "title": "Store the turkey for up to 1 year for maximum freshness.",
      "content": "Store the turkey for up to 1 year for maximum freshness. Whole turkeys last an entire year, but turkey parts tend to not last as long. Parts like wings and drumsticks stay fresh for about 9 months in their proper packaging. Ground turkey is best when used within 3 to 4 months. Technically, turkey can be stored indefinitely in the freezer. After about a year, turkey begins losing quality. Some turkeys last longer, while others take on freezer burn or odors from the freezer."

      "content": "Preserve frozen pre-stuffed turkeys in the freezer before cooking. These turkeys do not require thawing. When you’re ready to use them, heat them up in the oven according to the instructions on the packaging. Make sure whole pre-stuffed turkeys have been inspected and certified by your national government as safe for consumption. Proof of certification will be on the packaging."

      "title": "Store turkey in a refrigerator set lower than 40 °F (4 °C).",
      "content": "Store turkey in a refrigerator set lower than 40 °F (4 °C). When the temperature climbs higher than that, bacteria start spreading on the turkey. You have about 2 hours to start cooking the turkey once it surpasses 40 °F (4 °C). To avoid any risk, throw away any turkeys kept unrefrigerated for longer periods of time. [5] X Research source Bacteria will start growing on the turkey as soon as it reaches 40 °F (4 °C). Even if the turkey is in its original packaging and you put it back in the refrigerator, the bacteria will still be present."

      "title": "Check fresh turkeys for a use by date.",
      "content": "Check fresh turkeys for a use by date. The “use by” or “sell by” date indicates how long a fresh, store-bought turkey lasts when refrigerated. Look for the date on the turkey’s plastic packaging. Turkeys last approximately 2 days after the printed date. [6] X Research source The date shows how long you can safely refrigerate the turkey. These turkeys are often preserved and kept extra cold by the manufacturer and grocery store, so they last longer. The use or sell by dates are valid as long as you keep the turkey sealed in its original packaging. Freeze the turkey if you don’t plan on cooking it before it expires."

      "title": "Keep undated turkeys refrigerated for up to 2 days after they thaw.",
      "content": "Keep undated turkeys refrigerated for up to 2 days after they thaw. A turkey is safe in the refrigerator until it fully thaws. After that, it stays fresh for a few extra days as long as it is still in its original packaging. Use the turkey before it turns slimy or begins smelling like rotten eggs, signs that it has spoiled. [7] X Research source The same rules apply to turkey portions and ground turkey. They spoil about 2 days after thawing."

      "title": "Place the turkey on a tray on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Place the turkey on a tray on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. The coldest part of the refrigerator is typically the back end of the lowest shelf. Set the turkey on a baking tray to catch any juices escaping from the packaging. The pan keeps the refrigerator clean, preventing the spread of germs. Another good place to store a turkey is the meat drawer if your refrigerator has one."

      "title": "Defrost the turkey in the refrigerator if possible.",
      "content": "Defrost the turkey in the refrigerator if possible. Using the refrigerator is the safest way to defrost a turkey. All you have to do is put the frozen turkey in the refrigerator. Expect the turkey to need 24 hours per 5 lb (2.3 kg) of meat to defrost completely. After it defrosts, it then stays fresh for 2 more days in the refrigerator. [8] X Research source The most common alternative to refrigerator defrosting is a cold water bath. Put the turkey in a sink filled with cold water below 40 °F (4 °C). Replace the water every 30 minutes to keep the turkey safe. If your turkey is small enough, remove the wrapping and put it in the microwave. Use the defrost setting to heat it up quickly."

      "content": "Put a refrigerator-thawed turkey back in the freezer if you don't cook it. Leave the turkey in its original packaging to avoid exposing it to bacteria. Store the turkey in the freezer within 2 days of it thawing. It will last up to 1 year in the freezer. [9] X Research source Turkeys thawed in water or the microwave cannot be refrozen. They will already have bacteria growing on them."

      "content": "Store turkeys in ice-filled coolers while transporting them. If you’re traveling or don’t have a refrigerator or freezer handy, you still need to keep your turkey below 40 °F (4 °C). Line a cooler with ice packs or fresh ice. Fit the turkey into the cooler and shut the lid. Then, check the cooler every so often to make sure the turkey is still cold. [10] X Research source The best way to gauge the cooler’s temperature is with a reprogrammable kitchen thermometer. Set the thermometer to beep when the cooler’s temperature gets close to 40 °F (4 °C)."
