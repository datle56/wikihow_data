      "content": "Put the parrot's cage in a central room in your home. Parrots need to interact with you and anyone else in your household, so put yours in a room with a lot of traffic. The more you interact with it, the more social it will become. The more words it hears, the more likely it is to repeat them! [1] X Research source However, don't put it in the kitchen or the bathroom. Both have too much temperature variation, and the kitchen can have dangerous toxins in the air."

      "content": "Talk to your parrot like you would a 3-4-year-old. Parrots are very intelligent, so even when you're not trying to teach your parrot specific words, engage it by speaking sentences to it all the time. That way, it gets used to hearing you talk, and it will want to return the favor because it is a very social creature! [2] X Expert Source Marlene Mc'Cohen Parrot Advocate Expert Interview. 6 July 2023. [3] X Research source For instance, as you walk by the cage, you might say, \"How are you doing today, Bridget? Do you like the sunny weather? Your feathers are looking nice!\""

      "content": "Start with an easy, frequently used word. Simple words will be easier for your bird to pick up, especially at first. \"Hello!\" and \"Bye-bye!\" are a good place to start. Say them when you come and go from the room to help your bird understand what you want it to do. [4] X Research source You could also try \"bird.\" It really doesn't matter what the word is, as long as it's simple."

[5] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. The more you speak it around the bird, the more likely it is to say it back to you. If you're starting with a word like \"Hello!\" make sure you say it every time you enter the room with the parrot. Similarly, if you're trying to get it to say the word \"bird,\" repeat it to the parrot a few times when you walk by the cage. Make sure to emphasize the consonants of the word to help your bird learn the word."

When you're repeating the word to your parrot, make sure you're saying with the same inflection each time, the way you want your parrot to repeat it. This will help your parrot grasp the word better â€“ they mimic tone as much as other aspects of the word. [6] X Research source Try a higher pitch if your parrot is having trouble. Parrots seem to like higher pitches better, probably because their range is higher than yours. [7] X Expert Source Hayley Heartfield Bird Specialist Expert Interview. 23 June 2021. If your bird isn't quite getting a word, try changing your pitch to a higher one, and it may help. [8] X Research source"

Use the same technique for teaching names of objects that you did with treats. Hold it up and say the word, such as \"Ball!\" When the bird looks at you while you say ball, offer it a little treat. Soon, the bird will likely start to mimic you, and you can offer treats for that. [14] X Research source Parrots, like most animals, are food-motivated, so you can offer treats to help learn other words, too. Teach the parrot the word for the treat first, then try using it to help learn other words, particularly for objects."

For instance, maybe you've taught your parrot, \"Hello!\" and \"How are you?\" If you treated \"How are you?\" as one quick word (\"HowAREyou?\"), then simply putting them together shouldn't be too hard: \"Hello!
