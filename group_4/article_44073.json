Remove any stickers inside of your car screen and clean off all the adhesives or any sticky things that can create problems with the film sticking on the windows. Remove all the obstructions inside the car that can restrict your process and get in your way. Finally, vacuum the interior to get rid of dust. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean up the windows using soapy water and a 1\" razor blade.",
      "content": "Clean up the windows using soapy water and a 1\" razor blade. Lower the window slightly so that you can get the top as well. Mix a few drops of dish soap with warm water and spray or wipe it on the window, then use the blade to scrape away all the dirt and grime. Make sure you clean both sides of the window well, removing everything. Never use Windex, or cleaner with ammonia in it. It will tint your windows purple when you're done. Make sure you get all the edges and seals, and role the window up to get the bottom. You're going to need almost a gallon of soapy water throughout this process. Prepare the water ahead of time to make working easier. A spray bottle is highly recommended."

      "content": "Take a clean rag and dry the window. Wipe away the soapy water on both sides and dry off the edges as well. If you're using a spray bottle, refill it with more soapy water. A squeegee will help you get the window completely dry. [3] X Research source You will need a plenty of soapy water to ensure that the tint doesn't stick or rip. Make sure you get underneath the seals in the interior of the car. Use your finger to get under the seal and remove dirt and dust."

Unroll your tinting so that it covers the entire window, with at least 2-3\" of extra tinting over the edges. The liner (the part that will later adhere to the window), should be facing you.

You want a perfectly shaped line to ensure the tint fits. When done, two of the edges should fit perfectly, and the rest should still be square. As you cut, use the squeegee or your free hand to make sure the film is flush with the window. When done, cut the excess film away and discard."

Keep pushing downward, then run the heat gun along the bottom of the window to make sure it is all dried out. [11] X Research source You can leave the tint stuck to the outside of the window now.
