      "content": "Choose the right style brace. The type of brace you end up with will depend on how severe your injury is. If you only have a mild sprain, you may able to get away with a simple compression sleeve. [1] X Expert Source Kevin Stone, MD Board Certified Orthopaedic Surgeon Expert Interview. 19 November 2020. For more serious tears or fractures, you’ll probably need a heavier-duty hinged brace reinforced with plastic or metal. [2] X Trustworthy Source FamilyDoctor.org Family-focused medical advice site run by the American Academy of Family Doctors Go to source Your healthcare provider, usually a doctor or physical therapist, will usually supply you with a brace that’s best suited for your injury. There is some degree of trial and error in this process, so if your brace doesn't fit well initially, let them know and they can help you find the right size or style. It will also be important to find a brace in a size that fits you. Sizes are usually displayed on the backside of the packaging, and commercial models may be available in standard sizes. Ask your doctor about getting a second brace so that you can keep your braces clean. When you switch out braces, wash the one you just removed according to the instructions that came with the brace."

      "content": "Pull the brace on over your leg. Start by rolling up your pant leg to get it out of the way. Slip your foot into the top of the brace (the area where it widens to accommodate your thigh) and out through the bottom. Slide the brace up your leg until it rests over your injured knee. If the brace you’re using is a wrap style as opposed to a sleeve style, place the inside of the pad against your knee, then wind the straps around. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Center the brace on your kneecap.",
      "content": "Center the brace on your kneecap. Most braces have a small hole in the front to indicate which way they should go on. When worn correctly, the point of your kneecap should be visible through this hole. This will offer greater comfort and keep the skin beneath the brace ventilated. [4] X Research source Align the brace so that the hole doesn’t pinch or catch your skin. Make sure the brace won’t slide up or down before you secure it."

      "title": "Tighten the straps.",
      "content": "Tighten the straps. For compression sleeves, you’re done once you’ve got the brace on properly situated. If there are additional straps, guide these around the back of the brace and secure them in front using the hook-and-loop fastener strips. Your brace should be snug, but not too tight.

      "title": "Put the brace on under other clothes.",
      "content": "Put the brace on under other clothes. When it’s cold outside or you’re in a place with a strict dress code, like school or work, it may be necessary to keep your brace covered up. Pick out loose-fitting garments like jeans or sweatpants that the brace will fit underneath easily. This will also keep the outline from being quite as visible. Always strap on the brace first, followed by your clothes. It will work better the closer it is to the limb itself. Athletic style clothing tends to be baggy and offer a little stretch, which may be easier to manage than fitted pants."

      "title": "Wear shorts.",
      "content": "Wear shorts. Most people will find that it’s easiest to get the brace on and off with no extra material to get in the way. Shorts will provide immediate access to your injured leg while promoting airflow so you don’t get too hot and stuffy. Shorts are perfect for accommodating longer types of braces (like hinged functional braces) which sit higher up on the leg."

      "content": "Remove the brace periodically. This will relieve the pressure around your knee and give your skin a chance to breathe. Be careful not to put too much weight on your injured leg while you’re not wearing the brace. It will probably be best to remain sitting or lying down. You should remove your brace before showering or swimming to keep it from getting wet. Make sure to speak to your doctor about whether it’s okay to go unsupported, and for how long. Removing the brace periodically helps prevent marks and further injury, so it's an important step. Follow your doctor's instructions regarding brace removal."

      "title": "Keep your weight off your bad knee.",
      "content": "Keep your weight off your bad knee. Tread lightly when you walk to prevent placing unnecessary strain on the joint. When standing, try not to lean or shift your weight over your bad leg. Until your knee is strong enough to support your full weight, it will be unstable and vulnerable to changes in pressure. [9] X Research source If the injury is severe, you may also need crutches to walk for the first few days or weeks. Limping is normal and even helpful, since it limits the amount of time you spend on one leg."

Assuming your doctor has said it’s okay, you may be able to resume exercising or playing sports once your knee has begun healing. It will still be important to wear your brace correctly while active. Keep intense actions to a minimum, and avoid load-bearing exercise like weight lifting, unless otherwise instructed. [12] X Research source Don’t push yourself too hard. If you experience any unusual pain or discomfort, stop what you’re doing immediately.
