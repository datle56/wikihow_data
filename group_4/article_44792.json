      "title": "Ice the sore area every 3 to 4 hours for the first 3 days.",
      "content": "Ice the sore area every 3 to 4 hours for the first 3 days. Take a scoop of ice and wrap it in a clean cloth or paper towel. Next, sit or lie down while placing the ice onto the sore area for up to 20 minutes. If the pain continues, wait at least 3 hours before applying ice again. [1] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Don’t apply an ice treatment for more than 20 minutes at a time. Ice packs also work well for this. Your immediate goal is to lower the swelling, so ice is most effective in the early days of the injury. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Take pain medicine to reduce any soreness.",
      "content": "Take pain medicine to reduce any soreness. Use any over-the-counter NSAID to treat your pain. Before taking any doses, follow the packaging instructions so you don’t take too much medication at once. Since this type of medicine is hard on your stomach, don’t take it for more than 10 days straight. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source You might have different health conditions that interfere with NSAIDs and other pain medications. If this is the case, talk to your doctor before using these medicines. Don’t take more than the recommended dose within a day."

      "title": "Massage the sore area with ice in the first 72 hours.",
      "content": "Massage the sore area with ice in the first 72 hours. Fill a styrofoam cup with water and place it in the freezer. Wait 1 day or so for the water to completely freeze before removing the cup. Cut the rim of the styrofoam off the cup so a chunk of ice is exposed, then rub this ice over the sore section of skin. While sitting, work the ice cube in a circle for 5 to 10 minutes, and repeat the procedure every few hours as needed. [4] X Research source Don’t rub the ice on your skin for longer than 10 minutes, as this could cause skin damage. Give yourself ice treatments in the early days of your injury. After that, try switching to heat. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Give yourself time to rest and elevate your hip.",
      "content": "Give yourself time to rest and elevate your hip. Don’t exercise or put strain on your injury at any point. Instead, move slowly and carefully, allowing yourself plenty of time to lie down and rest. [6] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Whenever you sit or lay down, rest your hip on a pillow to keep it comfortable. As you relax, elevate your sore hip above your heart to keep the swelling down. If you overwork yourself, you could end up doing more damage the strained hip flexor. While you don’t have to bedridden when you have a strained hip flexor, you shouldn’t be moving around too much."

      "title": "Perform heat therapy after 72 hours.",
      "content": "Perform heat therapy after 72 hours. After icing your strained hip flexor for 3 days, apply low heat to the injured area for an extended period of time. To do this, take a hot bath or recline with a heating pad or lamp, which provide topical heat. Unlike ice, you can use heat therapy for extended periods of time, instead of 20-minute increments. [7] X Research source When possible, try to use a lower heat setting on your devices."

      "content": "Tilt your pelvis 8 to 12 times to stretch your hips. Lay face-up on a flat surface, keeping your upper body flat and your knees bent upwards. While your feet are flat on the ground, tighten your core and buttocks, so your upper body can serve as an anchor during the stretch. Next, lift one foot a few inches or centimeters off of the ground, keeping it in place for 6 seconds. Lower your foot, then do the same movement with your opposite foot. Repeat at least 8 reps of this to lightly stretch your hip muscles. [9] X Research source If your hip is in a lot of pain, don’t do any exercises."

After holding this pose for around 6 seconds, alternate the position of your legs in the stretch. [10] X Research source For the stretch to be most effective, try keeping your legs around 30 cm (1 ft) off the ground."

      "content": "Put your feet together to perform a seated butterfly stretch. Sit in an upright position, keeping your back straight. Place your feet together in front of your groin area, leaving your knees outstretched to the sides. Lean forward until your hip muscles feel tense, then stay still for around 30 seconds. After half a minute has passed, sit back up in your original position. [11] X Research source Repeat this exercise at least 2 times. Stop stretching immediately if you ever feel intense pain during this exercise."

      "title": "Perform a kneeling stretch 2 to 4 times.",
      "content": "Perform a kneeling stretch 2 to 4 times. Kneel on top of a folded towel with the knee attached to your sore hip, leaving your leg extended behind you. Bend your other leg forward at a right angle, with your opposite foot placed flat on the ground. While keeping your back straight, lunge forward from your hips. Hold this position for at least 15 seconds, then return to your original position. Tilting your pelvis forward during the stretch will provide an additional stretch to your flexor muscles and tendons. This exercise is better to do than a standing lunge, as it doesn’t put as much strain on your hip."

      "content": "Tug your knees into your chest at least 2 times. Lay on your back along the edge of a table, bed, or another flat surface, letting your knees and legs dangle off the edge. Grip your unaffected knee and pull it into your chest, letting your hurt hip and leg relax as you do so. Pull your thigh into your chest until you feel it stretching, then hold it in place for at least 15 seconds. [12] X Research source This stretch helps stretch your hips without pulling on your hurt flexor. Don’t do this stretch more than 4 times, as you don’t want to overwork your leg."

Place your forearms in parallel lines next to one another, then tighten your core and buttocks muscles. Lift your chest several inches or centimeters above the ground for 15 to 30 seconds, then let your body relax. [13] X Research source Don’t overdo this exercise. If your hip feels especially tired, give it a break."

      "title": "Visit your doctor if the pain is severe.",
      "content": "Visit your doctor if the pain is severe. If you’re suffering from debilitating pain, try reaching out to a healthcare professional. Mention the details of your strain to the doctor, and see if they suggest more intensive treatment. During this appointment, ask your doctor about the estimated recovery time, as well as the activities that you should be avoiding. If needed, try scheduling a follow-up appointment so your doctor can check on your progress. [15] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Consider why your pain may not be improving. For instance, ask yourself if your strain is caused by trauma or possibly a medical issue like septic infected joint, tumor, or bone necrosis (which can occur due to prolonged prednisone use). Similarly, you could have rheumatoid arthritis in your hip, sciatica pain in your back that's spread to your hip, or focal pain from your thighs. Finally, consider if you might have referred abdominal pain from a condition like appendicitis or an inguinal hernia. If you’re dealing with severe pain, ask your doctor if they can prescribe stronger pain medication. Before you go to the doctor, brainstorm different questions you may have."
