[1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source You can use it directly on the joints or drink aloe vera juice to decrease inflammation. Aloe vera may be useful for RA because of its anti-inflammatory properties, its property as a pain-reliever (likely due to the anti-inflammatory properties), and in speeding up wound healing. [2] X Research source Edwards, SE., Phytopharmacy: An Evidence-Based Guide to Herbal Medicinal Products. 1st ed. (2015), Wiley&amp;Sons, NYC. It is also a safe moisturizing and anti-aging agent.

The gel comes from the central part of the aloe leaf, known as the \"inner fillet.\" It contains larger complex sugars than aloe juice does. These complex sugars are thought to be responsible for the benefits of aloe.

      "content": "Get aloe vera gel out of the plant. If you have a mature aloe plant, cut off a leaf using a pair of sharp scissors and peel away the outer leaf to reveal the clear gel inside. Use your fingers to get the gel out or cut the end off the leaf and squeeze the gel out. If you want to purchase the gel, check online or at your local health food store. Buy organic aloe vera with no additives or preservatives."

      "content": "Apply aloe vera gel to your joints. At first, apply the aloe to a small area to test for any possible reactions. If a rash or other problems develop, stop using it. If there's no skin irritation, spread the gel onto the areas that are bothering you the most. Apply it like you would any other lotion. This will give you temporary relief from the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. As long as there's no skin irritation, you can keep treating the pain with aloe vera as long as you want. Most people don't experience side effects, but aloe may cause redness, a burning or a stinging sensation and rarely, a short-term rash.

Drinking aloe vera juice can lower blood sugar and interfere with diabetes medications, so don't drink the juice for more than 3 to 4 weeks. It can also decrease the absorption of steroid creams, and decrease potassium levels if you drink the juice. Always talk to a knowledgeable healthcare professional before combining any medications with supplements, including topical or oral aloe vera. While there are no long-term studies of internal aloe vera's effects, one study found a link between the juice and colon cancer.

Start with small amounts, like 2–3 fluid ounces (59–89 mL) once a day, to see how you react to the juice. Work your way up to 2–3 fluid ounces (59–89 mL) 3 times a day. It does taste a little bitter and may take some getting used to. You can try adding 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of honey to the juice or mix it with a fruit juice until you like the flavor. Never drink the gel, since it contains a strong laxative and can cause diarrhea. [9] X Research source"

Try to cook from scratch, using whole foods. This will preserve most of the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. A rule of thumb is that if the food is too white—like white bread, white rice, or white pasta—it has been processed. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice, and whole grain pasta.

Many people with rheumatoid arthritis have relatively mild pain and stiffness but experience periodic “flare ups” where the signs and symptoms get worse. Other people have constant, chronic symptoms. As the disease progresses, joints and bones can become damaged, leading to increasing loss of function, although early treatment can limit the damage.

These may include other autoimmune diseases (like Sjogren's Syndrome), vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels), anemia (lower than normal numbers of red blood cells that carry oxygen to tissues), and lung disease. Rheumatoid nodules, which develop in up to 35% of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. The nodules show up as bumps under the skin near the affected joint, most commonly near the elbows. They're not usually painful, are freely movable under the skin, and can range in size from a pea up to the size of a lemon. [26] X Research source"

[27] X Research source Men and women of any race or ethnic background can get rheumatoid arthritis, but it occurs in women more frequently than in men. Women are about 2 to 3 times more likely to get the disease, which most often begins in middle age."
