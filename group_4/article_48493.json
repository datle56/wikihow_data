      "title": "Confirm the date 12-24 hours beforehand.",
      "content": "Confirm the date 12-24 hours beforehand. Whoever initiated the date request can re-confirm the date 1 day before or earlier on the day of the date. If you prefer to know what your weekend will look like before the end of the day on Friday, it’s ok to check in earlier. [1] X Research source If you confirm your date too early (over 2 days beforehand), you may give the other person too long a period to reconsider or flake out. If you wait until an hour or 2 before the date, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment, because they’ll assume you don’t care. It’s also considerate to give them time to prepare for the date . [2] X Research source Confirming the details when you originally set the date is a good way to approach your plans, as long as you also confirm 12-24 hours before the date itself."

    {
      "title": "Be direct and specific.",
      "content": "Be direct and specific. When confirming a date the day of or the day before, use details that make it easy for them to respond with a yes. Include the date and time you’re planning to meet, and the exact location, and ask them if that still works for them. Your politeness makes a great first impression and lets them know you’re aware of how to act on a first date . [3] X Research source For example, you can say, “Hey, are we still on for dinner at Roberta’s this Friday at 8 pm?” Another example: “Hi there! Are you still up for grabbing a noon lunch at the cafe on 5th Street tomorrow afternoon?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay positive.",
      "content": "Stay positive. Even if you don’t hear back right away, don’t let negative thoughts overcome you. Everyone gets busy, and the other person may be at work or unable to look at their phone or answer a text or message. Always assume the best outcome, but if you don’t hear back from a 2nd follow-up text, don’t waste your time continually texting them. [4] X Research source For example, you can say, “Hello there. I wish it was tomorrow already because I know I’ll be meeting you by then. Are we confirmed for dinner at 9?” Another example: “The week needs to end already, so we can go on our much-anticipated date! Still ok for the movie at 6:30 Friday?”"

      "title": "Keep a sense of humor.",
      "content": "Keep a sense of humor. Your confirmation message can show off how great a sense of humor you have. Choosing your words carefully can help convey a lighthearted tone that helps put the other person at ease. For example, you can say, “Hi—this is the guy you said looked like a small-town version of that famous actor:) Are we still meeting tomorrow at 6 pm for drinks downtown?” Another example: “I know you can’t wait to take the world’s worst golfer to the mini golf course on Saturday😂…is 2 in the afternoon ok?”"

      "title": "Show enthusiasm.",
      "content": "Show enthusiasm. It’s important to let the person know how excited you are to meet up for the first time. If they get a sense that your date with them is one of 10 in a week, they may not care enough to follow through. Show them how happy you are to get to know them in person. For example, you can say, “I can’t wait to finally meet you! Are you still free for tomorrow night?” Another example: “I’m so excited about trying this new sushi place with you! Are we good to meet at 8 tomorrow night?”"

      "title": "Give them a few hours to respond.",
      "content": "Give them a few hours to respond. If you don't hear anything back in a few hours, it would be okay to send a short follow-up text (or call if you feel comfortable doing so). If you don’t hear anything at all, it’s likely that they’re not interested anymore, so it may be time to move on."

      "title": "Keep the communication short and sweet.",
      "content": "Keep the communication short and sweet. Once you’ve confirmed the date and the other person confirms back, leave it at that so they can concentrate on getting ready for the date . If you’re the one they send the confirmation text to, don’t answer them in the same minute. You can wait anywhere from a few minutes to an hour to confirm back to them. Don’t wait longer than that on purpose, because they might get the idea that you’ve lost interest or are ghosting them. For example, you could reply, “Perfect…see you there!😘” Another example: “Sounds good to me. See you soon!”"

      "title": "Keep your date informed.",
      "content": "Keep your date informed. Plans change, and things come up. It’s ok if you have to re-adjust your date to a different location, time of day, or reschedule. If you do have to set a new date, be sure to apologize and offer a reason why you’re postponing. Make a direct plan for the rescheduled date, so they know you’re not just trying to cancel altogether. [5] X Research source For example, you could say, “I’m so sorry—my work is going to keep me late tonight to finish a big project, so, unfortunately, I have to reschedule our date. Are you free next Saturday for the same plan we originally had?” Another example: “I’ve been looking forward to our date all week. I might not be able to leave work until 6 tonight now! Is there any way we meet at 6:30 instead? I’m so sorry for the slight delay!” Reader Poll: We asked 141 wikiHow readers how late a date has to be to give them a bad first impression, and 51% of them said they’d be okay with 5 to 10 minutes of lateness. [Take Poll] If you think you’re going to be late, give your date a head’s up!"

      "content": "Don’t panic if they choose to reschedule. If they have issues with keeping the date, allow them some time to reschedule or make new plans. It’s ok to send a follow-up text, but don’t chase them with multiple messages. Stay positive and give it a few days. If you don’t hear back from your follow-up text, let them make the next move. If they don’t communicate any further, brush it off and move on. [6] X Research source For example, you could say, “It’s no problem. When works best for you?” Another example: “I totally understand. Let me know when you want to reschedule.”"

      "content": "Use natural phrasing and a friendly tone when confirming a date. If you’re unsure of the exact time or place of the date, find out the information in your text. Use a positive tone and writing style that is welcoming to the other person. Be specific about any details that are missing from the initial plans themselves. “Hey, it looks like I'll definitely be ready for those cocktails tonight. Is 7 still good?” “Be sure to dress warm for ice skating tonight! See you at 8🕺💃?” “See you later! I'll be the hottie in the red dress😘.” “How's your day? Things have been pretty crazy over here! I’m so looking forward to grabbing those drinks tonight🍹 😎.” “I hope your day's going well! Are we still on for 7?” “Hey there, are you still up for grabbing a coffee tomorrow?” “Would you prefer to meet me later or would you like me to pick you up?” “I'm really looking forward to hanging out tonight. What time would you like to meet?” “Hello there- I’m just making sure we're still set for 9 tonight at the movies.” “I’ve been thinking about seeing you all week.

However, if you haven’t heard from them by then, feel free to send a “Are we still on for [date and time]?” text. One reminder text is fine, but if you don’t hear back from them, you don’t need to keep texting. It’s logical to assume the date is off until you hear from them."

      "content": "Does confirming a date come off as needy or annoying? It’s good etiquette to confirm a date beforehand. Because of how busy modern life is, people often forget about plans they’ve made. A reminder helps bring the date back into focus. As long as your message is casual and thoughtful, confirming a date lets the other person know you’re on top of things (and that meeting them is important to you)."

      "content": "Is it rude not to confirm a date? Not confirming a date is considered rude because it puts the other person out (and wastes their time). Even if they don’t hear from you, they may assume the date is on and show up, only to wait for someone who isn't coming. If you can’t make a date, simply reach out beforehand and reschedule with your apologies."

Statistics often show that women are more willing to date, while men consider themselves in a relationship after about 6 dates. This figure isn’t the same for everyone; some believe that it takes 1-3 months to really know if you’re in a relationship or not. If you’re not sure, it’s best to have a conversation with the person you’re dating to understand how they feel and where they’re at. [7] X Research source"
