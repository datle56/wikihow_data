      "content": "You may be experiencing something bad amongst other good things. It can be easy to believe that bad things only happen to bad people or that you deserve the bad things happening in your life. However, there’s no evidence that supports such claims. A mix of good and bad things happens to every single person. It may just be that you’re currently experiencing more bad things than good. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "You might not have formed good, proactive habits. While some things in life may be out of your control, there are things you can do in your daily life to prevent bad things from happening. When you form good habits that allow you to be more proactive, you’re able to more easily combat daily stressors and prevent small mistakes from happening. If you haven’t formed these types of habits yet, these stressors and mistakes are more likely to happen. [2] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source For example, you might be determined to pass a test, but you haven’t formed good study habits. So, when test time comes, you might end up feeling really stressed and even get a bad grade. Or, you might recognize that a certain work project is really important, but you have difficulty managing your time. Because of this, you might get reprimanded by your boss for not getting things in on time."

      "content": "You may have fallen into unhealthy habits. Falling into bad habits is different from not having good habits. A lack of good habits can make it difficult to complete tasks, but unhealthy habits can more severely affect your health, relationships, and lifestyle. For example, if you’re suffering from any type of addiction, your health, relationships with others, and finances can greatly suffer. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Other unhealthy habits include things like drug and alcohol use, gambling, eating unhealthily, and forming bad sleeping habits. You may have also formed unhealthy social habits, such as isolating yourself from friends and family or spending too much time on social media. These habits can lead to “bad” things happening, such as feeling lonely or depressed."

      "title": "You could have unrealistic expectations for yourself.",
      "content": "You could have unrealistic expectations for yourself. When you set goals for yourself that simply aren’t attainable given your resources and personal situation, it often leads to feelings of disappointment and like nothing is going right for you. For example, if you expect to get a promotion within the first year of working, it might feel like only bad things are happening when you don’t get selected. [4] X Research source It might also be that other people around you have very high and unrealistic expectations for you. If you aren’t able to meet their expectations, their disappointment can make you feel like only negative things are happening to you. Or, your current lifestyle and situation may not line up with your aspirations. For example, if you’re living in a place that you don’t like, it may feel like things aren’t going right."

      "title": "You may be surrounded by negative people.",
      "content": "You may be surrounded by negative people. Your outlook on and attitude toward life is greatly influenced by the people around you. So when your friends, family, or partner only focus on the bad things happening, it can be easy for you to slip into a similar mindset. If they only point out the negatives, you might find yourself also only focusing on the bad instead of the good. [5] X Research source Or, it may be that the people in your life are influencing you to do things that bring about negative consequences. For example, if you have friends who pressure you to go out drinking regularly, your work or studies may suffer."

      "title": "You might have a hard time recognizing the positives.",
      "content": "You might have a hard time recognizing the positives. You may be unconsciously distorting your thoughts by doing mental filtering, which is when you only focus on the negatives and disregard the positives. For example, if your boss compliments you but also gives you constructive feedback during a performance review, you might only focus on the negatives and tell yourself you’re doing a bad job. [6] X Research source Or, even though you might’ve received a lot of praise for a presentation you did, you might only focus on the mistakes you made and tell yourself that it was a bad presentation."

      "content": "You could have an “all or nothing” mindset. When you have this kind of mindset, you might tell yourself that you’ve failed when you don’t achieve perfect results. For example, if you got a B on a test instead of an A, you might tell yourself that you’ve flunked. Or, you didn’t get the promotion you wanted, so you tell yourself that you’re terrible at your job. [7] X Research source With this type of thinking, there’s no option between good and bad, and it can be easier for you to fixate on the negatives rather than appreciate the positives in life. Another example would be if you recently argued with a friend. Despite being friends for a long time, you might convince yourself that they don’t want to be friends with you anymore after your argument."

It’s not unheard of for some people to subconsciously seek out bad situations simply because that’s what’s familiar to them. This might be especially true if you’ve experienced some trauma in your past. [8] X Research source For example, if you grew up in a toxic household, you might find yourself seeking out toxic romantic partners because that’s what’s familiar to you. Or, if you had an overly critical parent, you might unconsciously look for a work environment that’s equally harsh because it’s what you’re used to."

      "content": "Accept the situation for what it is. When faced with stress or negative situations, some people try to simply ignore it in order to protect themselves. However, this can just end up prolonging the stress and worry you feel from the situation. To help yourself get through tough times , acknowledge the bad thing that happened and accept it for what it is. Tell yourself, “This happened today. There’s nothing I can do to change the past.” [10] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Also acknowledge the things that are out of your control. This can help you to rationalize your thoughts and view the situation from a more realistic perspective. For example, if someone was rude to you, remind yourself that other people’s feelings and thoughts toward you aren’t in your control.

To pull yourself out of a more negative mindset, focus on these positives and remind yourself that no bad thing can last forever. [11] X Research source Practice gratitude to help yourself focus on the good things in your life. One idea is to start a gratitude journal where you write down 3-5 things you’re grateful for each day.

Acknowledge your unhealthy behaviors and be honest with yourself about how they’re negatively affecting your life. Avoid situations that can make it easier to indulge in this bad habit and replace it with a healthy habit instead. [17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, if you have a habit of eating unhealthily, get rid of all junk food from your pantry and replace it only with healthy snacks. Or, if you drink often, decline your friend’s invitation to go out to a bar on the weekend. A healthy habit to focus on instead might be something like staying hydrated with water throughout the day. Get others to help you in your efforts to break bad habits. Recruit friends and family to monitor your progress and keep you in check if you start to slip back into old habits."

For example: [18] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Specific: I’ll learn new sales techniques to improve my performance at work. Measurable: My goal is to double my rate of sales from the current rate. I’ll keep a detailed log of my sales in order to track my progress throughout the year. Attainable: I’ve been working in sales for 3 years and so have a solid foundation. My company is also offering a mentor program and extra trainings I can take advantage of. Relevant: I want to feel more confident in my job and improve my skills. This will also make me a better candidate for a promotion. Time-bound: I’ll give myself 6 months to start seeing results. There’s a training next Monday that I’ll attend and put my new skills to use immediately after."

[19] X Research source Reach out to friends and make plans to hang out whenever you can. Stay in touch with your family and talk to them throughout the week.

      "content": "Reflect on your mistakes and learn from them . It might seem like bad things keep happening to you because you keep repeating the same mistakes. We all make mistakes, but the important thing is that we learn from them instead of ruminating on them. When something goes wrong, stop and analyze the situation. Ask yourself, “What caused me to make this mistake?” and “What can I change for next time?” Be sure to also point out the things you did well. It’s highly unlikely that you did everything wrong, and there might be some things that worked to remember for next time. Reach out to others for help in addressing areas you need to work on. For example, ask your boss for more detailed feedback to avoid future mistakes."
