      "content": "Gauge someone’s interest by checking how often they text. Look at your texting history, and see if there’s a difference between where you started and what you’re doing now. If the two of you started out texting multiple times a day, and now it’s every couple of days at best, then this person has either run out of things to say, or just isn’t making it a priority to text you anymore. [1] X Research source Where interested people want to stay in contact and are prone to texting whenever they think of you, someone who is pulling away will leave increasingly big gaps of time where the two of you aren’t texting at all. There’s nothing wrong with taking initiative and texting first, but if you’re always the one doing it, that’s a sign the other person isn’t as interested in you as you are in them."

      "title": "Taking a long time to text means it’s not a priority.",
      "content": "Taking a long time to text means it’s not a priority. Keep in mind that nobody can text back immediately all the time, and some excuses are perfectly valid! But, if this person used to reply to the majority of your texts quickly and now they never do, that’s a sign they’re trying to distance themselves from you. [2] X Research source When this happens, resist the urge to text more. You may feel like if you send another text to make sure the other person saw your first one, they might text back, but often this doesn’t change anybody’s mind. [3] X Research source Try not to obsess about the amount of time it takes for someone to text you back, either; it just adds extra anxiety, and you don't deserve that!"

      "title": "If they’re not interested, they stop putting effort into replies.",
      "content": "If they’re not interested, they stop putting effort into replies. Sometimes one word is all that’s needed to reply to a text, but that’s certainly not the case with every message. Short and unclear messages mean that the sender is not really putting a lot of thought into their communications with you—and, sadly, that they’re losing interest. [4] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Examples of this include: If you send a text asking about their day, or telling them about yours, and all you get is a “fine” or a “cool.” If you text, “Hey, are we still hanging out and watching a movie tonight?” and the reply is “Maybe, I’ll let you know later.”"

      "title": "People losing interest are no longer curious about their partner.",
      "content": "People losing interest are no longer curious about their partner. Does your special someone ask about how your day was, what your plans are, or about something important going on in your life? Questions like that are symbolic of your closeness and interest in one another. When your crush or partner stops asking, it means they’re not interested in knowing the details of your life any longer. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "A perpetual “I’m busy” reply means they’re putting distance between you.",
      "content": "A perpetual “I’m busy” reply means they’re putting distance between you. While everyone is busy sometimes, this shouldn’t be a regular occurrence in a relationship. Good communication between two people (and the desire to maintain it) means that even when life gets busy, both parties make the effort to connect when there’s a moment to do so. If your significant other isn’t making the effort, it’s because they don’t want to. [6] X Research source It’s fine if you or your date really do get busy for a few weeks, so long as you communicate that you’ll be busy and make an effort to work around the scheduling conflicts.

      "content": "Pet names are indicative of how your significant other sees you. Pet names are generally used between couples to show affection, and it’s been proven that being called by a pet name can actually increase your attraction for that person! [8] X Research source If your significant other used to call you “darling” all the time in texts, and now they’re using just your name instead (or not using names at all), their feelings towards you may be changing. Loss of pet names is a sign that they don’t see you the same way they used to, and are thinking of you as something other than a romantic partner."

      "title": "Compliments mean that a person is thinking about you.",
      "content": "Compliments mean that a person is thinking about you. When people are interested in one another, lots of thoughtful texted compliments are to be expected. There’s no real standard for how many compliments a person in a relationship should give, but it should happen regularly. At their core, compliments are a sign that someone is focusing their attention on you, so if you don't get them in texts anymore, then this person’s attention might be wavering.

      "title": "When people are interested, they follow through or reschedule at once.",
      "content": "When people are interested, they follow through or reschedule at once. Examine the last few times you’ve made plans over text to hang out with this person. If you’ve gotten more than a few last minute texts bailing on the plans you made, this shows that your date is not prioritizing your relationship anymore—and that it might be best for you to devote your time and energy to someone new . [10] X Research source When the relationship is new, you and your date should both be making an effort not to cancel plans during the first couple of months. If your date does that more than once, it’s a sign they’re brushing you off. If your significant other immediately offers an alternative date and time when they have to cancel plans, this is a good sign. If they cancel plans with no intention of rescheduling, that’s when you know they’re losing interest. It's okay to call your date out if they do this one too many times. Send a text along the lines of: \"Hey, it's me. I've been feeling like you're brushing me off lately. It's okay if you're not interested, but I would really appreciate if you would tell me either way.\""

      "content": "Making exclusive plans is another way to put distance between you. Being out of the loop is hard, especially when you’re being excluded by someone you care about! If you get a lot of texts saying that they’re busy with friends tonight, and can’t chat, then that person may be losing interest and reverting back into “single” life. This is especially true if you used to hang out with your significant other's friends and now you don't. [11] X Research source When people are serious about a relationship, they want their significant other and friends to meet and get along. If your date is making plans without you, then they’re trying to keep you and their circle of friends separate—because they don’t think there’s any need to combine the two. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Sweet little texts during the day mean they’re thinking about you.",
      "content": "Sweet little texts during the day mean they’re thinking about you. When someone constantly has you on their mind, they’ll send short texts to prove it; things like \"how are you\" and \"good morning.\" Those texts won’t necessarily lead to long conversations, as they’re just a method to check in with the person you like and make sure you’re in their thoughts as much as they’re in yours. However, when a person is beginning to lose interest, those thoughtful little texts stop. [13] X Research source"

      "content": "When you call and leave a message, you should get a call back in return. Texting is far more convenient than phone calls in many cases, but your significant other needs to be willing to call you back. If all you get after every missed call is a text reply, then they’re actively ignoring your desire to speak with them, and that’s not okay. [14] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source Even someone who says they prefer texting can afford to make a call sometimes! Ultimately, while these are signs that a person is losing interest, they're also signs that your needs aren't being met—and you deserve to have that in a relationship. If the signs listed here are happening to you, you can talk to your significant other to get on the same page about it, or let the relationship go . Don't beat yourself up over someone losing interest; just move on and look for something even better!"
