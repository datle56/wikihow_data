  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Air kiss",
      "content": "Air kiss Upon greeting, people lean their heads toward each other and purse their lips, but they don't actually touch each other. For many people all over the world, this is a sort of standard greeting for anyone they consider part of their social circle. [1] X Research source What it means: Custom dictates that the person air kissing you should treat you warmly, as though you are at least a close acquaintance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hand kiss",
      "content": "Hand kiss At an extremely formal occasion, a lady extends her right hand (always her right hand) to a gentleman, who takes it and lightly kisses the top of it. Typically, the woman is older or very important, such as a high-ranking government official. [2] X Research source What it means: Courtesy, politeness, and respect in a highly formal way. Most people are more likely to encounter this done in a campy way for humor. In formal situations, it's often best if the woman takes the lead here. If you raise your right hand with your palm facing down, the man will usually understand the greeting you expect. Often, a hand kiss isn't even really a kiss at all, in the sense that the gentleman's lips never actually touch the lady's hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Peck",
      "content": "Peck In terms of social kisses, you're usually talking about a peck on the cheek here. Sometimes it's just one, but in other places it's one kiss on each cheek, or even the right cheek, the left cheek, then back to the right. And for some people, the number of kisses might indicate how close they feel they are to you—you might even call it a \"pecking order.\" [3] X Research source What it means: Depending on the culture, it could mean that you're considered to be a very close friend, or it could just be a polite greeting. When in doubt about social customs, try to hang back in a group and observe others so you know what to expect. If that's not possible, just follow the other person's lead. If you feel awkward, you can just say, \"I'm sorry, I don't know the custom here,\" and let them teach you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Top-of-the-head kiss",
      "content": "Top-of-the-head kiss A top-of-the-head kiss is likely to happen if the person kissing you is quite a bit taller than you are, although it can also happen if you're sitting and they're standing. It's normally just a brief peck, although it might be accompanied by some other affectionate gesture, such as squeezing your shoulder or ruffling your hair. What it means: Affection, typically from parent to child or between adults if one is significantly taller (often in jest)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Forehead kiss",
      "content": "Forehead kiss This is generally just a peck on the forehead in passing, although they might hold the back of your head and press their lips against your forehead for slightly longer depending on the emotional context. This can often be a doting sort of kiss, such as with a parent and their children. What it means: Familial love and affection. Romantic partners also sometimes kiss each other on the forehead as a show of general love and affection."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cheek kiss",
      "content": "Cheek kiss A peck on the cheek is perhaps the quintessential friend kiss—the one you might've heard someone complain about after a date when they were going in for some lip-lock. Just a light brush of the lips on your cheek, maybe enough to leave a print if the kisser is wearing lipstick. What it means: Affection, but perhaps not romantic interest. If you've only recently met, it could also mean that the person would just like to take things more slowly. If you got a cheek kiss and you feel like you're getting mixed signals about the person's interest, speak up! Say something like, \"I was really hoping I could kiss you on the lips. Why did you turn away?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Nose kiss",
      "content": "Nose kiss If someone kisses you on the nose, they definitely think you're as cute as a button! This adorable little friendly kiss is typically reserved for little kids, although sometimes friends might kiss each other on the nose just to be silly. What it means: Love and affection from a protective point of view"
    },
    {
      "title": "Eskimo kiss",
      "content": "Eskimo kiss An Eskimo kiss isn't really even a kiss, if a kiss requires you to use your lips. To give someone an Eskimo kiss, you simply rub the tip of your nose against the tip of their nose. It's a great way to show affection when it's really cold outside and you don't want to open your mouth! What it means: Playful adoration for someone you care about a lot, whether they're a friend or a member of your family"
    },
    {
      "title": "Butterfly kiss",
      "content": "Butterfly kiss Like an Eskimo kiss, a butterfly kiss is a kiss that doesn't involve the lips—this time, you flutter your eyelashes against someone's skin. This is a very adorable, very sweet sort of kiss that often accompanies cuddling and nuzzling with someone who helps keep you safe. What it means: Love and affection from the point of view of someone who feels safe and protected Butterfly kisses are most common between daughters and their fathers—musician Bob Carlisle even wrote a song about them. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Single lip kiss",
      "content": "Single lip kiss For this kiss, lean forward as though you're about to give someone a regular kiss on the lips, but instead, wrap your lips around only one of the other person's lips. Sucking on the person's lip briefly can also be very sensual. What it means: This kiss shows that you're romantically attracted to someone and potentially interested in being more physically intimate with them. If you're doing a single lip kiss, you might also playfully nibble that lip if you want to transition into more sexual kissing."
    },
    {
      "title": "French kiss",
      "content": "French kiss You and your kissing partner lock lips, your tongues entering each other's mouth, darting in and out, occasionally twisting and tangling together. It's said that French is the language of romance, and the French kiss just might be the most romantic kiss there is. What it means: Someone who French kisses you feels very romantically (and maybe even sexually) attracted to you and wants to be physically close to you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Angel kiss",
      "content": "Angel kiss A normal sort of peck, only this time on your eyelid. Because it's so uncommon, you usually don't see this type of kiss except between romantic partners. Often, someone will angel kiss their partner after they've been crying. What it means: It's a sign of an intense emotional bond and a strong emotional and romantic connection. The person is showing how much they care."
    },
    {
      "title": "American kiss",
      "content": "American kiss If you've ever seen the photo of the American soldier kissing a woman in the middle of the street after he made it home from World War II, you have the blueprint for the American kiss. It's essentially the same as the French kiss, except you and your kissing partner don't get your tongues involved. What it means: If someone kisses you like this, they're definitely very romantically attracted to you, and likely also have a flare for the dramatic. American kisses are typically done in public, often when you haven't seen the person in a while."
    },
    {
      "title": "Earlobe kiss",
      "content": "Earlobe kiss Earlobes are an erogenous zone for a lot of people. [5] X Research source If someone starts kissing (or nibbling) on your earlobe, it likely means theirs are sensitive and they're curious if yours are as well. What it means: If someone is kissing your earlobe, they're most likely trying to turn you on or get you worked up. You can stimulate earlobes with your mouth in all kinds of different ways, including nibbling, kissing, sucking, and licking."
    },
    {
      "title": "Neck kiss",
      "content": "Neck kiss Some people associate neck kisses with vampires. But in the real world, if someone is kissing on your neck, it typically doesn't mean that they want to drink your blood—although they're probably interested in exchanging other bodily fluids. What it means: Anyone kissing your neck feels extremely passionate about you and wants further physical intimacy. If your kissing partner started at your lips and worked down to your neck, they're likely working their way down to exploring other parts of your body with their lips and tongue."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spider-Man kiss",
      "content": "Spider-Man kiss This one gets its name from the iconic upside-down kiss between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) in the 2002 Spider-Man movie. It might take a little planning to get it down right, but this will definitely be one you'll remember for years to come. [6] X Research source What it means: You and your kissing partner are either extremely creative, huge Spider-Man fans, or both."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bite kiss or hickey",
      "content": "Bite kiss or hickey This is the kind of kiss that lands you with a nice bruise marking the spot where you were kissed. And, depending on what you have to do the next day, that can be more than a little embarrassing. But you're usually not thinking about that at the time because you're too caught up in the moment. What it means: This is usually a sign of great passion—you might even consider the hickey itself a souvenir of a passionate night to remember."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lizard kiss",
      "content": "Lizard kiss With this kiss, you and your partner lean your faces toward each other as though you're about to French kiss. But instead of locking your lips together, you just stick your tongues out and wiggle them together. It might seem a little silly at first, but if you get into it you might find that it's actually really erotic. What it means: You and your kissing partner are really comfortable with each other and not afraid to look a little silly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Ice kiss",
      "content": "Ice kiss Put an ice cube in your mouth, and then lean over and French kiss your partner. As you're kissing, swap the ice cube back and forth between each other's mouths until it melts. This is a great way to make out on a hot day! What it means: Anyone who offers this kind of kiss is likely to be really open-minded and interested in experimenting a little. Have fun!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Emotional connection",
      "content": "Emotional connection When you kiss someone, you experience a sort of shared vulnerability that brings you closer together emotionally. Your bond strengthens the more time you spend being physically intimate with one another, including when you kiss. [7] X Research source Kissing also gives you and your partner a sense of togetherness. After all, you're sharing saliva and mouth germs—you're definitely bonded in that sense!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Stimulation of feel-good hormones",
      "content": "Stimulation of feel-good hormones When you kiss somebody you like, your body floods your nervous system with these feel-good hormones such as oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, that make you feel like you're on top of the world. All of these hormones can also give you a bit of an energy boost to get things done. [8] X Research source While the effects of these hormones do wear off after a while, kissing your partner on a regular basis can definitely help boost your mood and keep you thinking more positively. The energy you feel also comes with a bit of a boost in metabolism, which means kissing might even help you lose a little weight (although probably not anything noticeable)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Immunity boost",
      "content": "Immunity boost It might sound a bit gross, but when you kiss someone on the mouth, you're exposing yourself to the germs in their mouth (and they're being exposed to yours). Exposure to bacteria teaches your immune system how to fight it off, which strengthens your whole immune system. [9] X Research source All those feel-good hormones that kissing triggers have some immune-boosting effects as well."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stress reduction",
      "content": "Stress reduction Research shows all forms of physical affection help reduce acute signs of distress and generally calm people down. This effect can be seen with all types of physical affection, not just romantic affection. [10] X Research source For example, infants who were kissed a lot by their mothers smiled more and cried less often. Generally speaking, showing physical affection to people and having people who show physical affection to you will help you better handle stressful situations. Reader Poll: We asked 444 wikiHow readers, and 69% agreed that the most effective way to relieve stress with a partner is being hugged, held, or physically comforted by them . [Take Poll]"

    {
      "title": "Lower blood pressure",
      "content": "Lower blood pressure It could be because of all those feel-good hormones your body produces when you kiss. It might also be the result of the comfort and warmth you feel when someone is being physically affectionate to you. But whatever the cause, if you kiss and are kissed frequently, you'll likely have a lower resting blood pressure. [11] X Research source Since maintaining low blood pressure is a really important part of heart health, you might even say that you can literally hug and kiss your way to a stronger and healthier heart."
    },
    {
      "title": "Improved overall health",
      "content": "Improved overall health The main \"love hormone\" your body produces when you kiss, oxytocin, does a lot to really boost your body's overall health. While the differences aren't drastic, they do add up over time. And the feeling of connection that you have with the person you shared physical affection with endure over time. [12] X Research source Even better, because oxytocin feels so good, you naturally want to be physically affectionate again so you can get more of it. This is one cycle that's really a win-win for everybody concerned!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Relationship satisfaction",
      "content": "Relationship satisfaction A couple who kisses together stays together—or so it often seems. Couples who kiss often tend to report being happier and more satisfied in their relationships, no matter how long they've been together. [13] X Research source Often couples who stop kissing each other on a regular basis find that their relationship starts to lose some of that spark it initially had. Kissing is a great way to bring it back!"

    {
      "title": "Brush your teeth and rinse out your mouth.",
      "content": "Brush your teeth and rinse out your mouth. There might be times when your garlic breath just can't be helped, but ideally, your mouth is fresh and clean before you pucker up. Just as you'd probably straighten up your home before you invited over guests, it only makes sense to clean your mouth before you share it with someone else. [14] X Research source Don't worry about ruining the mood by taking a break to brush your teeth . You're showing the person how much you care about them and respect them by going that extra step."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the scene for romance.",
      "content": "Set the scene for romance. It's true that spontaneous kisses are often way more exciting, but there's nothing wrong with prepping your surroundings so a kiss is more likely to happen. Dim the lights, maybe light some candles, and put on some soft, romantic music. Does a romantic atmosphere make up for a lack of kissing skills? Sometimes, it can! [15] X Research source If you're out and about, you might keep your eyes open for more romantic-looking spots where the two of you could steal a kiss, such as in the corner of an old, arched doorway or under a streetlight in the mist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stay mentally present in the moment.",
      "content": "Stay mentally present in the moment. You can't be a great kisser if you're mentally checking out. Kissing is about passion, and you can't show passion if you're drafting a grocery list in your head while your lips are connecting. If you're having a hard time staying in the moment, think about keeping a running commentary of the kiss in your head. [16] X Research source This is something that you'll get better at with practice. But at the same time, if you're really into the person you're kissing and really in the mood to kiss them, you'll likely find that you don't have much trouble at all keeping your head in the game. Baller agrees that \"practice makes perfect. So you're gonna want to kiss a lot to get good at kissing, and you can.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Pay attention to how your partner responds.",
      "content": "Pay attention to how your partner responds. A good kisser is someone who works with their kissing partner rather than against them. It's not about having specific moves that you impose on others. Rather, you pay attention to what they're doing and try to mirror that. Go at the same pace they do with the same degree of passion and sense of urgency. [17] X Research source Baller notes that to be a good kisser, \"you want to match your partner, so whatever [their] movements are, it's gonna be like the yin and yang, the way they fit together nicely like that.\" \"That's the basic rule for kissing well,\" Baller continues. \"Look at it like puzzle pieces... You want to fit together like a puzzle, so it's comfortable and there's a lock or something, you just fit together. It fits nice. It feels good.\""
