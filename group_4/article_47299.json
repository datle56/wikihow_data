      "title": "Get a wool-specific soap.",
      "content": "Get a wool-specific soap. Merino wool requires a very gentle washing liquid that will prevent bleeding of its color or damage to its fine fibers. Pick a shampoo, soap, or detergent that’s especially formulated for wool, like Woolite or Laundress Wool & Cashmere Shampoo. Never use fabric softeners or products with bleach in them on wool. In a pinch, you can use a mild soap with a neutral pH, like a clear, fragrance-free dishwashing fluid for sensitive skin."

    {
      "title": "Fill a basin with soap and warm water.",
      "content": "Fill a basin with soap and warm water. Measure out your wool wash soap according to the guidelines on its packaging. Add it to a basin with enough warm water to cover your garments. The water should be between 30 and 40 degrees C (about 85-100 degrees F). If you have a really large Merino wool product, consider washing it in your bathtub or using a “soak” setting on your washing machine so that you have a big enough basin."
    },
    {
      "title": "Soak your wool for 3-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Soak your wool for 3-5 minutes. Completely submerge your Merino wool garment in the water, and let it soak for 3 to 5 minutes. Then, swish the water through the wool garment slowly and gently for about one minute. Don’t let your wool soak for more than a handful of minutes since doing so can warp the fibers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Rinse with warm water.",
      "content": "Rinse with warm water. Rinse your wool several times with a gentle stream of warm water to get the detergent out. Keep rinsing it until the water runs mostly clear of suds. Make sure that your rinse water is the same temperature as the water in which you soaked your Merino wool."

      "title": "Squeeze out excess water.",
      "content": "Squeeze out excess water. Take the garment and squeeze it to get as much water out as possible. [1] X Research source Do not twist or wring your Merino wool to drain the water."

    {
      "title": "Wash smaller garments in the washing machine.",
      "content": "Wash smaller garments in the washing machine. It’s best to avoid washing larger garments, like sweaters or leggings in a washing machine. However, smaller Merino products, like hats, socks, or mittens, will be able to hold their shape better."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wash with like colors and fabrics.",
      "content": "Wash with like colors and fabrics. Prevent any potential damage from your Merino wool bleeding by washing it with similarly colored garments, such as darks, brights, or lights. It’s also a good idea to wash it with clothing of similar weights or harder fabrics, like canvas or denim, for the sake of minimizing the pilling of the wool fibers. [2] X Research source To be completely safe, consider washing your Merino wool by itself. Keeping it separate from other laundry will preserve it and your other garments for longer."

      "title": "Pick the right cycle.",
      "content": "Pick the right cycle. You want to select a gentle, delicate, or knit cycle so that the rotation of the machine will not damage the wool fibers or shape of your garment. Note: if you cannot control the speed and/or temperature of your washing machine, stick to washing your Merino wool by hand."
    },
    {
      "title": "Set the right temperature.",
      "content": "Set the right temperature. You want to wash your Merino wool at a consistent warm, low, or cold temperature. Warm (about 30 degrees C or 85 degrees F) is the usually the best bet, but be sure to check the care instructions of your garment’s tag to ensure you have the right temperature guidelines for your particular product. [4] X Research source Never change temperatures for your rinse cycle. To avoid shrinkage and felting, you need to keep the temperature of your entire wash cycle constant. Either do all warm water or all cold water, never a mix of the two. Never use hot water since high temperatures can seriously shrink your wool."

    {
      "title": "Remove from the machine immediately.",
      "content": "Remove from the machine immediately. As soon as the washing cycle is complete, take your Merino wool out of the machine and dry it according to the care instructions. Leaving it wet in a pile of other laundry will stretch and misshape the fibers."

      "title": "Do not use a drying machine.",
      "content": "Do not use a drying machine. Unless the washing instructions on your Merino wool product specifically indicate that you can use a dryer, do not tumble dry it. If the care instructions do permit it, be sure to use a gentle, low-heat setting."

      "title": "Lay flat to dry.",
      "content": "Lay flat to dry. The best way to preserve the shape and texture of your garment is to reshape your Merino wool while it’s still damp and then let it dry on a flat surface. [7] X Research source You can use a flat drying rack for this. Some racks have a mesh surface that’s especially designed for garments that need to lay flat. You can also simply lay your garment on top of a dry towel on a flat surface, like a floor or bed. You don’t want to hang Merino wool on a hanger, line, or hook because the weight of the wet fibers can lead to sagging and stretched knits."

      "title": "Keep it away from heat.",
      "content": "Keep it away from heat. Don’t leave drying Merino wool near a heat source, like a radiator, or in direct sunlight. You should dry your wool in the open air and away from heat to prevent shrinkage. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "If necessary, use a steam iron on a wool setting.",
      "content": "If necessary, use a steam iron on a wool setting. Merino wool is not prone to wrinkling, but if you need to press it, wait until it’s completely dried. Then, use a steaming iron on a wool setting to press out the wrinkles. Don’t move the iron back and forth over the wool. Instead, lower the iron onto the fabric, press for a few seconds, and then lift it directly up. Repeat this process until you have the wrinkles out. If you have a delicate knit, cover the fabric with a clean, dampened dish towel before pressing it. This will protect the fibers."

      "content": "Spot clean stains immediately. Rinse the affected area with cold water and/or seltzer water to keep the stain from setting. Dab it out with a dry, soft, clean cloth. Avoid rubbing the stained area with your cloth since this will only encourage the stain to set into the fabric. For particularly stubborn stains, treat them with wool-specific soap. Dab a small amount of your mild wool detergent onto the affected area. Let it soak for a few minutes, and then rinse it with cold water. [9] X Research source"
