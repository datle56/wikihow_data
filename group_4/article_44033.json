      "title": "Exercise your facial and neck muscles.",
      "content": "Exercise your facial and neck muscles. There are several exercises that provide a good mix of stretching and working out your neck and lower facial muscles. Repeat them once or twice a day and this may strengthen your neck so that it appears firmer. Place one hand on your forehead. Push your head against it without letting it go forwards. You should feel your neck muscles working. Hold this position for about 10 seconds. Then clasp your hands behind your head, and push backwards to create pressure, and again hold for about ten seconds. Sit down with your back straight. Lift your head back so that your chin is pointing toward the ceiling with your lips closed. Next make a chewing motion with your mouth. You'll feel your neck and facial muscles being worked. Repeat about 20 times. Again, sit with a straight back and lift your head so that your chin points to the ceiling with your lips together. This time, pout your lips in a sort of kissing motion. Repeat this exercise twice. This may feel similar to the first exercise, but actually works different parts of your neck and face. Be careful with this one because it could strain your neck. Lie on the bed with your head hanging over the edge. Slowly and carefully lift your head up towards your torso, using your neck. Slowly and carefully lower it back down. Repeat this about 5 times. Stop immediately if you feel any pain."

      "content": "Avoid repeated facial expressions. Certain facial movements and expressions, such as tilting your head in disagreement, can weaken adjacent muscles. Observe any repeated facial gestures you may make to help keep your neck skin firm longer. Whenever you use facial or neck muscles, it causes a groove to form under your skin. As your skin loses elasticity over time, it can no longer fill this grove and may cause a permanent wrinkle or flap on your neck."

      "title": "Eat a healthy diet.",
      "content": "Eat a healthy diet. There is some evidence that a nutritionally well-balanced diet may protect your skin. Avoiding unhealthy and junk foods may help keep wrinkles and loss of elasticity at bay. Diets high in fat and sugar may slow cell turnover. Try not to eat too many fried foods or sweets — limit your simple sugar intake and instead focus on complex carbohydrates. Foods high in vitamin A and beta-carotene, including fruits and vegetables such as raspberries and carrots, may increase cell turnover for healthier skin. Yellow and orange fruits and vegetables are high in vitamin A and beta-carotene. These, combined with plenty of water, increase cell turnover resulting in healthy skin that is not prone to clog-causing damage. Food high in essential fatty acids (alpha-linolenic and linoleic fatty acids), such as walnuts or olive oil, may help skin cells stay hydrated. Unhealthy foods also take the place of foods you could be eating that provide the necessary vitamins and antioxidants to promote healthy skin."
