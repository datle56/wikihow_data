If the previous readings were both low and the current readings are both high, the transistor is good. If both readings you receive with the red probe are not the same, both readings with the black probe are not the same, or the readings don't change when switching probes, the transistor is bad."

After clamping the black probe to each of the 3 leads, if you don't get the same high resistance reading when touching the other 2 leads with the red probe, you either have a bad transistor or a PNP transistor."

[6] X Research source The collector accepts an input current from the circuit, but it can't send the current through the transistor until allowed to by the base. The emitter sends a current out into the circuit, but only if the base allows the collector to pass the current through the transistor to the emitter. The base acts like a gate. When a small current is applied to the base, the gate opens and a large current can flow from the collector to the emitter."

A PNP transistor uses an N-type material for the base and P-type material for the emitter and collector. The PNP transistor show an emitter with the arrow pointing in (\"Points In Permanently\" is the memorizer)."
