You are looking for two numbers whose sum is equal to the first degree coefficient, and whose product is equal to the constant. [11] X Research source For example, for the quadratic polynomial x 2 + 8 x − 20 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} , you need to find two numbers ( a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} ), where a + b = 8 {\\displaystyle a+b=8} , and a ⋅ b = − 20 {\\displaystyle a\\cdot b=-20} . Since you have − 20 {\\displaystyle -20} , you know that one of the number will be negative. You should see that 10 + ( − 2 ) = 8 {\\displaystyle 10+(-2)=8} and 10 ⋅ ( − 2 ) = − 20 {\\displaystyle 10\\cdot (-2)=-20} . Thus, you will split up 8 x {\\displaystyle 8x} into 10 x − 2 x {\\displaystyle 10x-2x} and rewrite the quadratic polynomial: x 2 + 10 x − 2 x − 20 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} ."

This expression should be the same for each group. The second binomial is created by combining the two terms that were factored out of each group. [14] X Research source For example, after factoring by grouping, x 2 + 10 x − 2 x − 20 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+10x-2x-20=0} becomes x ( x + 10 ) − 2 ( x + 10 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle x(x+10)-2(x+10)=0} . The first binomial is ( x + 10 ) {\\displaystyle (x+10)} . The second binomial is ( x − 2 ) {\\displaystyle (x-2)} . So the original quadratic polynomial, x 2 + 8 x − 20 = 0 {\\displaystyle x^{2}+8x-20=0} can be written as the factored expression ( x + 10 ) ( x − 2 ) = 0 {\\displaystyle (x+10)(x-2)=0} ."
