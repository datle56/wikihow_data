      "content": "Find a hashtag to use. Do you want to join an existing conversation or create your own fresh hashtag? Since hashtags are used to index topics, you'll usually want to add an existing hashtag. However, creating a new hashtag may start a trend. Some hashtags are obviously meant to be silly, while others are more serious. Make sure you observe these differences if you do not want to draw the ire of other X users. If you want people to find your tweet when searching for similar ideas or topics, use a trending hashtag or any popular hashtag that already exists. Make sure that your spelling is correct and that there are no spaces between the words in the hashtag. Capitalization does not matter—thus “#wikihow”, “#wikiHow”, and “#WikiHow” all produce the same result. If you want to create your own hashtag, think of something catchy that describes your topic that might inspire others to use it as well. When creating your own hashtag, you may want to include a similar existing hashtag so other people find your tweet and see your new hashtag."

      "content": "Type your tweet and include the hashtag. A hashtag always begins with the hash (#) symbol, and contains a string of letters and/or numbers with no spaces or special characters. You'll notice that people usually add hashtags to the ends of their tweets, but there are no specific placement requirements. X recommends using no more than two hashtags in a single tweet. This is not a hard rule, but it's good etiquette. Like all other well-meaning methods of connecting people online, hashtags can be loaded with spam posts. People often comb through trending hashtag lists and use them in irrelevant tweets just to bring attention to their accounts. This is considered poor etiquette and could even get your tweets flagged. Only use hashtags that are relevant to the topic you're tweeting about."

Hashtags are one of the most important and efficient ways of indexing keywords and topics on X. [2] X Research source Anyone can make a hashtag at any time, simply by typing a word (or series of connected words) using the form #topic in a tweet. For example, if you were tweeting about reading this article, you might say \"Reading #wikiHow article on using #hashtags with #Twitter.\" Then, anybody searching for #wikiHow, #hashtags, or #Twitter would see your tweet. After a hashtag has been created , other X users can use that hashtag in their own tweets to add to the larger conversation about that topic. Hashtags can be as general (#wikiHow) or as specific (#USPresidentialElection2020) as desired. They are a completely organic form of organization, created and managed by X users, not X itself."
