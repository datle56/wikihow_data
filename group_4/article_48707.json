      "content": "Bibles are put in hotel rooms to evangelize the Christian faith. The Gideons International, a Christian men’s organization, donates Bibles to hotels in an attempt to spread the message of Christianity to passing travelers. Back in 1899, two men bonded after being forced to share a room in a jam-packed hotel. Together, they created a Christian men’s organization dedicated to evangelism, and, in 1908, they began spreading physical copies of the Bible and New Testament to hotels. While the group is best known for their hotel-based ministry, they also donate copies via other public avenues, like prisons, hospitals, abuse shelters, and more. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "You’re allowed to take the Bible from a hotel room. The Gideons International website doesn’t have an official policy listed, but it’s well-established that people are allowed to take and keep their hotel room Bible if they feel so motivated. Gideon International simply sticks a new Bible in the hotel room for the next guest to potentially peruse. [2] X Research source The Gideons International group reports that about 1 in 4 people read through the Bible in their nightstand drawer, with each individual book crossing paths with up to 2,300 hotel room visitors. [3] X Research source There is no official data provided to back up these claims, though."

      "content": "Fewer and fewer hotel rooms have Bibles in them now. Back in 2008, you could find a copy of the Bible in about 84% of American hotel rooms. Eight years later, in 2016, that percentage hit 69%, with the total number continuing to fall in the years after.

      "content": "Many hotel chains aren’t required to put a Bible in each hotel room. While the Marriott hotel chain specifically requires Bibles in all of its hotel rooms (with a few exceptions), most hotel chains do not. Groups like Hilton or Hyatt let individual owners decide if religious texts are handed out or not. [7] X Research source Some hotels choose to take a more personalized approach by giving visitors the option to request a copy of their book of faith."

      "title": "Marriott hotels offer The Book of Mormon in many of their rooms.",
      "content": "Marriott hotels offer The Book of Mormon in many of their rooms. Unlike other American hotel chains, Marriott requires many of their establishments to supply copies of both The Bible and The Book of Mormon (since the Marriott family is a long-time fixture in the Mormon church). There are certain exceptions to this rule, though—some Milliennial-centric Marriott chains, for instance, don’t have Bibles in the hotel rooms to better cater to their potential guests. [8] X Research source Marriott also doesn’t leave copies of Bibles in non-Christian countries like Indonesia or Vietnam."
