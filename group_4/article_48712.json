      "content": "You’re feeling dehydrated. Water is considered the “building block” of our bodies for a reason—without it, you can really start feeling woozy and under the weather. Drowsiness and lightheadedness are common symptoms of dehydration, which may make you feel like you’re experiencing a drug-related high. [2] X Research source What to do: Make sure that you’re drinking plenty of water and other hydrating liquids throughout the day, like fruit juice or tea. [3] X Research source As a general rule of thumb, aim to drink 11.5 cups (2.7 L) of water each day if you’re a woman, and 15.5 cups (3.7 L) if you’re a guy. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "You haven’t gotten enough sleep.",
      "content": "You haven’t gotten enough sleep. Sleep deprivation (especially in severe, longstanding cases) can create symptoms that are fairly similar to a drug-induced high, like hallucinations, poor judgment, and slower reaction times. If you consistently get less than the recommended amount of sleep each night (8-10 hours for teens, 7-9 hours for adults), sleep deprivation could be contributing to your symptoms. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source What to do: For a short-term solution, try to nap for around 10-20 minutes to help yourself feel a little more refreshed. For long-term improvements, focus on building a healthy sleep schedule and writing down your sleeping patterns in a journal. If poor sleep is seriously impacting your life, talk to your doctor.

      "content": "You’re experiencing a panic attack. Panic attacks are brief but severe instances of extreme anxiety that can leave you with a racing pulse, a deep sense of fear, and other physical symptoms. Some of these experiences (like a heightened pulse) may feel similar to a high—but the average panic attack only lasts for a few minutes. [7] X Research source If your symptoms just don’t seem to go away, a panic attack probably isn’t the culprit. What to do: Focus on your breathing if you’re experiencing a panic attack . Try taking a really deep breath in through your nose, counting to 5 as you go. Then, exhale through your mouth, counting to 5 once more."

      "content": "You’re experiencing depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR). DPDR is an experience of feeling distinctly detached from your physical self, along with your thoughts and emotions (also known as depersonalization). Another element of DPDR involves feeling separated from the immediate world around you (also known as derealization). [8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Some people have reported feelings of DPDR after using marijuana. What to do: You don’t have to do anything to get rid of DPDR, as the symptoms often fade away on their own. If the feeling of disconnection and detachment never seems to fade away, though, visit a mental health professional for help—they may be able to help you overcome this disorder through specialized therapy."

      "content": "You’re experiencing euphoria related to a mental health condition. Euphoria isn’t just about “feeling really good”—it relates to an intense physical experience, which can involve symptoms like an elevated pulse, dilated pupils, and more. [9] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source While euphoria is sometimes associated with hard drug use (like cocaine), it’s also connected with certain mental health disorders, like cyclothymia (an uncommon mood disorder where a person’s mood shifts frequently). [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you’re experiencing mood swings in addition to your sober “high,” an underlying mental health condition could be the explanation. Mental health conditions like bipolar disorder can also create a state of energetic euphoria (officially known as “mania”). [11] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source What to do: Visit a psychiatrist to get an official diagnosis rather than self-diagnosing yourself. Mental health is an extremely complex field, and it’s always best to get a professional opinion. If an issue like cyclothymia is contributing to your “high,” your psychiatrist can suggest different treatment options, like medication."

      "title": "Your body has produced an excess of certain neurotransmitters.",
      "content": "Your body has produced an excess of certain neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are a special type of chemical that send messages throughout your brain, like the feel-good hormones endorphins , serotonin , and dopamine . [12] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source While these neurotransmitters are designed to make you feel good, you don’t want to have too many of them in your system at one time—otherwise, you may feel symptoms similar to a drug-induced high. Still, having an excess amount of these neurotransmitters isn’t a very common phenomenon, and this likely isn’t the cause of your symptoms. What to do (serotonin): Having too much serotonin in your system is known as serotonin syndrome—this is a dangerous condition where you experience a lot of serious symptoms (like a high heart rate, muscle spasms, and confusion). This condition typically happens when you take too much of a serotonin-impacting drug, like an antidepressant, though. Talk to your doctor right away if you think you’re experiencing this illness, and stop taking any medications that impact your serotonin levels. [13] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source What to do (endorphins): People only tend to overdose on endorphins when they’re taking a lot of heavy drugs, like opioids (such as heroin). In those extreme cases, medical treatment with a medication like naltrexone can help resolve the issue. [14] X Research source What to do (dopamine): Using drugs and alcohol can make a person lean a little too much on dopamine and the rush it brings, which causes your body to make less in the long run. Activities like practicing mindfulness meditation , getting regular exercise , eating healthy , and boosting your sleep habits can all help your body hit the “restart” button when it comes to your dopamine levels.

Natural supplements like licorice, ginseng, arnica, guarana, and ephedra are all important supplements to be on the lookout for in this regard. [16] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source What to do: Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplements; this way, you can be confident they won’t interfere with any of your existing medications. If you’re experiencing a medical emergency, call emergency services immediately."

      "title": "You still might be feeling the high.",
      "content": "You still might be feeling the high. The high you get from smoking or vaping weed doesn’t last that long—about 1 to 3 hours, in fact, depending on how much you smoke/inhale and what your baseline tolerance is. Edibles (like cookies, brownies, gummies, troches, etc.), however, can take a lot longer to wear off. If you’re still feeling high a few hours after taking an edible, the explanation could very well be that you are still high. What to do: Snack on a little bit of black pepper, pine nuts, or a lemon rind if there’s still THC in your body. As random as these foods may seem, they have ingredients that may help you start feeling more like yourself. Some people find that taking CBD products can help you recover from a THC high, as well as hopping into a cold shower. [17] X Research source"

Watching a TV show or movie, whipping up something in the kitchen, or reorganizing your closet are just a few ways for you to get your mind off the weird symptoms you’re experiencing.

Here are some ideas to help you get started: Learn a new craft like knitting or crocheting Work on a jigsaw puzzle Pick up a new video game Create a scrapbook with some of your favorite photos Tip: Try spending some time by yourself and doing a solo activity if you think that would better help your symptoms to go away."
