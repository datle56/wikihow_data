      "content": "Purchase a lotion that contains 1% permethrin. Products containing permethrin, pyrethrins, or piperonyl butoxide are very effective against pubic lice. You can purchase a lotion, cream, or mousse that contains permethrin without a prescription, or you can ask your doctor to prescribe one for you. Permethrin inhibits the crabs' nerve impulses, affecting their breathing â€“ in other words, it suffocates them and they die.

      "content": "Ask your doctor about ivermectin. If creams and lotions have not worked for you, talk to your doctor about ivermectin. Ivermectin is a prescription drug given in the form of tablets. A single dose of two pills is usually enough to treat the condition. [6] X Research source Common names are Heartgard and Stromectol.

Its use should be restricted to individuals who have failed treatment with or cannot tolerate other medications that pose less risk. Lindane should not be used to treat: premature infants persons with a seizure disorder women who are pregnant or breastfeeding persons with very irritated skin or sores where lindane is to be applied persons weighing less than 110 pounds [10] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If your doctor has prescribed Lindane for you, it may be because the potential benefits outweigh the risks, but you should talk to your doctor if you have concerns about using the product.

Be aware that regular petroleum jelly should not be used to treat pubic lice and nits in the eyebrows or eyelashes because it can be very irritating to the eye.
