      "content": "Purchase a lotion that contains 1% permethrin. Products containing permethrin, pyrethrins, or piperonyl butoxide are very effective against pubic lice. You can purchase a lotion, cream, or mousse that contains permethrin without a prescription, or you can ask your doctor to prescribe one for you. Permethrin inhibits the crabs' nerve impulses, affecting their breathing – in other words, it suffocates them and they die.

Be aware that regular petroleum jelly should not be used to treat pubic lice and nits in the eyebrows or eyelashes because it can be very irritating to the eye.
