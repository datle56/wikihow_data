Take deep, long breaths, and exhale slowly. Bring your attention to your body. Close your eyes if this helps minimize distractions for you. Try to zero in on the bodily sensations you’re feeling. Notice where your body is seated, feeling the support of the floor or the chair you’re sitting on. Bring your attention to one area of your body at a time—arms, hands, legs, feet, stomach, neck, throat, jaw—noticing any tension or tightness and trying to soften them as you come across them. After moving through these areas of your body, notice your whole body, present and relaxed. Take one more breath and slowly open your eyes.
