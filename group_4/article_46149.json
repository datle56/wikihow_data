      "title": "Fill an applicator bottle with equal parts JBCO and argan or coconut oil.",
      "content": "Fill an applicator bottle with equal parts JBCO and argan or coconut oil. Use an applicator bottle specifically for hot oil so it can be boiled. Place the cap on the bottle and shake it gently until the oils are consistently mixed. [2] X Research source If your hair is color-treated, coconut oil will keep the hot oil from stripping your color. Otherwise, you can use whichever other oil you prefer. Because coconut oil is so thick, you may want to heat it until it is about the same consistency as your JBCO before mixing."

      "title": "Wash and detangle your hair with a wide-toothed comb.",
      "content": "Wash and detangle your hair with a wide-toothed comb. For best results, your JBCO hot oil treatment should be applied to clean, untangled hair that is still wet. Make sure you've thoroughly rinsed out all product from your hair. [3] X Research source While you can use a regular conditioner, do not use a leave-in conditioner before applying a hot oil treatment. It may inhibit the treatment from permeating your hair follicles."

    {
      "title": "Place the bottle of oil in boiling water for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Place the bottle of oil in boiling water for 5 minutes. Boil water in a large pot. When the water comes to a rapid boil, drop the bottle of oil in the water. Make sure the cap is on the bottle so the oil doesn't mix with the water. [4] X Research source When the time is up, use tongs to get the bottle of oil out of the water – it will be hot. You may want to wrap it in a washcloth to protect your hands."
    },
    {
      "title": "Separate your hair into mid-sized sections.",
      "content": "Separate your hair into mid-sized sections. While your oil is boiling, comb through your hair again and separate it into about 6 mid-sized sections. Clip each section to keep it out of the way so you can work on one section at a time. [5] X Research source You can use smaller sections if you prefer. Think in terms of the sectioning that would allow you to move quickly and thoroughly through your whole head of hair."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply your oil treatment from the roots to the tips of each section.",
      "content": "Apply your oil treatment from the roots to the tips of each section. Unclip one section and use the applicator bottle to squirt a generous amount of the oil on your hair, starting from the roots and smoothing it down to the tips. Then braid that section of hair or clip it out of the way before starting the next one. [6] X Research source It's typically easiest to move from left to right and top to bottom. That way, any oil that drips will drip onto sections you haven't treated yet. Be careful, as the oil is very hot. Wear gloves while massaging the oil into your hair, and try to avoid squirting the oil directly on your scalp."

      "title": "Cover your head with a shower cap for 30 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover your head with a shower cap for 30 minutes. When you've covered all sections of your hair in oil, place a shower cap over your head, covering all of your hair. The cap seals in the oil and steam, allowing it to penetrate your hair for deep conditioning. [7] X Research source Be careful to keep your ears outside of the cap so they don't get burned."

    {
      "title": "Rinse out the oil completely and apply a leave-in conditioner.",
      "content": "Rinse out the oil completely and apply a leave-in conditioner. After 30 minutes, remove the shower cap and unclip or unbraid your hair. Rinse out the oil with warm water. A little shampoo may be necessary to loosen up the oil. [8] X Research source If you have a favorite leave-in conditioner that you like to use, it can help seal in the moisturizing benefits of your hot oil treatment. Hot oil treatments can be done as often as once a week, or even twice a week if you have extremely dry and brittle hair."

      "title": "Massage JBCO into your scalp at night.",
      "content": "Massage JBCO into your scalp at night. Since JBCO has natural antibacterial and antifungal properties, it can be an effective treatment for dandruff, dry scalp, and other scalp conditions. Apply a small amount to the roots of your hair and scalp before bed. Spend about 5 minutes massaging it into your scalp, then finish your bedtime routine. [9] X Research source You may want to wrap your hair in a scarf to keep the oil from staining your pillow or sheets. JBCO is a very thick oil, so keep your hair texture in mind before using it. If you have fine hair, use it once every other week; if you have thicker hair, you can use it once every 2-3 days. Since the oil is so thick, it has a tendency to clog the hair follicles and also weigh down the actual hair strand itself."

      "title": "Dip a mascara wand or cotton swab into JBCO for eyelashes or eyebrows.",
      "content": "Dip a mascara wand or cotton swab into JBCO for eyelashes or eyebrows. JBCO can help stimulate growth, giving you thicker, fuller eyelashes or eyebrows. Dab the oil onto your eyelashes or eyebrows gently. [10] X Research source Wait a few seconds after applying, then wipe off any excess oil with a tissue or clean washcloth. Take care not to drip any oil into your eyes. A little goes a long way here – you should only need a drop or two of oil to do both of your eyes. For best results, do this before bed. Then wash your face carefully in the morning to remove the oil."

      "title": "Rub 6 to 8 drops of JBCO into your beard.",
      "content": "Rub 6 to 8 drops of JBCO into your beard. JBCO conditions and stimulates the growth of facial hair just as it does the hair on your head. Just 6 to 8 drops can help you grow a stronger, thicker beard with more even coverage. [11] X Research source JBCO also moisturizes and conditions your skin beneath your beard, so your beard won't be as itchy."

      "title": "Use JBCO to remove your makeup makeup in the evenings.",
      "content": "Use JBCO to remove your makeup makeup in the evenings. Dab JBCO on a cotton ball or makeup removal pad, then wipe it on your face. JBCO is a more gentle way to remove makeup than harsh cleansers, especially around the eyes. JBCO has omega-9 fatty acids that also make it beneficial for acne-prone skin."

      "title": "Soak JBCO into scars to heal the tissue and promote new skin growth.",
      "content": "Soak JBCO into scars to heal the tissue and promote new skin growth. Soak a gauze pad in JBCO and place the pad on the scar you want to treat. Use cling wrap to hold the pad in place. You may need to use surgical tape to affix the cling wrap to your skin. You can leave the oil on for several hours or even overnight while you sleep. However, you will need to change pads at least once every 8 hours. It's safe to continually do this as long as you want or until you notice improvement in your skin."

      "title": "Massage the oil into sore muscles to relieve pain.",
      "content": "Massage the oil into sore muscles to relieve pain. Dribble some JBCO onto your fingers or directly on the sore muscle and massage deeply, allowing your skin to absorb the oil. Rub the affected muscle for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the oil is absorbed. Reapply as often as you want. You can also apply a JBCO pack of soaked cotton or gauze to the affected muscle. Secure the pack with cling wrap and surgical tape."

      "content": "Dab JBCO on your face to treat acne. Wash your face with a gentle cleanser and pat it dry. Use a cotton ball or makeup pad to smooth a small amount of JBCO onto your face. You can leave it on for several hours or even overnight. Wait a few seconds for your skin to absorb the JBCO before you go to bed, or you may end up with an oily pillowcase."

      "title": "Treat chronically dry hands and feet with JBCO.",
      "content": "Treat chronically dry hands and feet with JBCO. Apply JBCO liberally to clean, dry skin. Cover your hands or feet with clean, dry cotton socks (you may prefer gloves for your hands) and let the oil soak in. Leave it on for several hours or overnight. When you take off the socks or gloves, wash your hands and feet normally. JBCO can also help heal nail fungus and promote healthy nail growth. If you have issues with your nails, rub the oil specifically into your nails and cuticles."
