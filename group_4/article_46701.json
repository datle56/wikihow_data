Cleaning the phone before you use it can reduce your chances of being infected by any bacteria, viruses or other pathogens lingering on the surface. With COVID-19 remaining a global health threat, it is recommended to take extra precautions at this time to prevent the spread of the virus to yourself and others around you. Have a bottle of hand sanitizer with you and use some before you touch the phone. You can also wipe down the handle of a phone box if you wish."
