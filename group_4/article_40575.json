Empowerment coach Nicolette Tura says, “if it's not clear for you, it's okay,” but it’s still worth thinking about. [2] X Expert Source Nicolette Tura, MA Empowerment Coach Expert Interview. 23 January 2020. Questions to ask yourself: What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing? What are you passionate about? What makes you feel like you matter? Is it worth staying in your current life? What drives you? Where do you want to be 10 years from now? Think about what truly satisfies your life and makes you feel like you are making a difference and make that the core of your new life. Your purpose doesn’t have to be big or profound. If you love nature, maybe your purpose is spending as much time in nature as you can, or getting a job that helps you protect nature."

When you set your goals , make sure they line up with your purpose and values. Make them achievable, and consider setting them up in short chunks. If you set an unrealistic goal, you’ll just feel crummy when you fall short of it. [3] X Research source Break big goals into short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. Write them down and put them somewhere where you can see them daily (e.g., a refrigerator door or stuck to your bedroom mirror). It also helps to organize your life . Make a schedule and stick to it. Otherwise, you’ll just end up pushing your goals further and further back."

Do something different and surprise yourself; you'll probably learn something you didn't know about who you are and what you can do. [5] X Research source Expanding your horizons this way is key to learning, growing, and discovering who you really are. New things can be scary, but staying stagnant and never growing is even scarier. Go on a trip to some place you've never been. Start learning a language . Take up a new sport or exercise, whether it be gymnastics, kick boxing or cycling. You might fail, but that’s okay! It’s not the end of your path. You can still keep going and trying.

      "content": "Expect setbacks, but celebrate progress. Starting over and making progress doesn’t look like a straight line. Sometimes, you’ll fall into old habits, or things will seem hopeless, but it’s only temporary. That’s why it’s important to celebrate your little victories, and look at the big picture, not just get stuck on a few bad days. When you notice progress, celebrate it! If you’ve lost weight, for example, make yourself a nice healthy meal. A reward is a huge help in moving forward. Avoid moments of weakness by removing the temptation. Delete your ex’s number so you don’t text them, or buy healthy snacks instead of junk food, for example. Having moments of weakness is common. We all stumble and vacillate between what is best for us in the future and what is easy right now. Challenge your \"now\" and replace it with your vision for your life in the long term."

You don’t need to wait for a new year, or any other occasion. You also don't need to validate your choices to make a change in your life. It’s tempting to tell everyone you’re starting over, but announcing it is just an easy way to feel like you’re doing it without actually changing anything. Remember that only you need to feel comfortable with your choices and decisions, not other people.

Open your mind, and accept that other people may have more answers than you do, at least when it comes to certain things.
