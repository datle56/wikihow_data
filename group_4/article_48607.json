      "content": "At a “white lie party,” everyone wears a T-shirt with a white lie on it. This fun and unique party concept has been going viral on TikTok recently. The idea is that everyone shows up to the party wearing a white T-shirt with a little lie about themselves written on it with a black marker. [1] X Research source The lie is supposed to be something funny or clever, and it usually reveals a habit or quirk you have. For example, if someone’s white lie T-shirt said, “I can totally parallel park my car,” they’re actually revealing that they can’t parallel park. Your white lie could also be a funny joke about the party itself. For example, you could write “I’m not tipsy right now,” “I never get anxious at parties,” or “I can totally hear what you’re saying over the music.” Ultimately, white lie parties are meant to be a fun way to make people laugh, poke fun at yourself, and connect with friends over the silly quirks we all have, but don’t usually talk about."
