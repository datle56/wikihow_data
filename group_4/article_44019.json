The two open ends should be resting on your chest. [2] X Research source Some ascots come with a pre-sewn loop on one side. If you are using an ascot with a loop, simply thread the long end of the ascot through the loop and skip to Step 4. If you are wearing a button-up shirt, you will need to unbutton at least the top button."

If you are not wearing a waistcoat, you should tuck the ascot into whatever V-shaped neck of clothing you are wearing on your torso, such as a blazer. The focus of an ascot is the bib that forms around the neck, so just make sure that this part is exposed. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Create a casual, preppy look. If a suit isn't your thing, sport an ascot with casual apparel to relax the class a bit. Shirt : Short or long-sleeve button-up shirt. Choose a light, solid-colored shirt to help make your ascot stand out. You can also wear a polo shirt on top, just make sure that the material does not clash with your silk ascot. Unbutton your top at least one button to allow room for tucking your ascot into your shirt. You won't always need a jacket, but when you do, add a V-neck blazer over your shirt. Pants : Sport jeans with your ascot. A dark wash pair of denim jeans is perfect for a polished look that transitions well from day to night. For an even more casual look, you can rock some lightly destroyed jeans, but try to maintain a dark wash. Light wash jeans tend to clash with the fancy look of an ascot. Shoes : Here's where you can get creative depending on the time of day or type of event you are building an outfit for. For a formal, nighttime event, wear black or brown leather dress shoes. For a daytime affair, opt for a more casual look with a pair of topsiders, cloth or brown leather. You can choose a colored pair of topsiders that compliments your ascot, but be sure that your ascot and shoes aren't exactly the same color and don't have clashing patterns."
