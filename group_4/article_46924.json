IVs determine how high a specific stat is. The higher an IV is, the higher the stat is. IVs are indicated by stars, and for each star filled in, the Pokémon has an IV of 31 (the maximum possible) in a specific stat. The DexNav indicates hidden abilities, egg moves, and high IVs with a red circle with an exclamation mark next to the info."
