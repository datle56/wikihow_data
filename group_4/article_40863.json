      "content": "Do not act like a victim. The perfect victim for predatory people is timid, weak, unobservant, willing to compromise him or herself to \"do the right thing\". It is even easier to take advantage of such a person if they are alone, in an isolated place, or intoxicated. Act confident. Make appropriate eye contact with people in your surroundings. Walk with purpose. Be polite and helpful, but do not compromise yourself. [1] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. Sometimes predators will try to lure people by appealing to them for help. For instance, if someone in a car asks for directions, by all means help them - from a safe distance. Do not come to the car window. Be with friends or a crowd. It is harder to commit a crime if people have someone with them. Victims are easier to victimize if they are alone. Even having other people nearby make it less likely a crime will occur. Partake responsibly. If you do drink, or use other drugs, do not do so to excess. Having one's mind impaired makes it more difficult to sense danger, make safe choices, or react appropriately to a situation. If possible, do not drink at bars alone. Always have a safe way to get home if you are too buzzed to drive, whether friend, Uber, bus or cab. Pay attention to your drinks at bars, parties, even with a date. \"Date rape drugs\" slipped into unwatched drinks can lead to assault, rape, or the like."

However, being aware will keep you from accidents and show potential criminals that you are paying attention. [2] X Expert Source Saul Jaeger, MS Police Captain, Mountain View Police Department Expert Interview. 21 February 2020. Avoid constantly texting, talking on your phone, or otherwise allow devices to make you oblivious to your surrounding. Do not have your earbuds on blasting music. Pay attention to the people who are around you. If a drunk person is yelling obscenities down the street, you can notice him or her and avoid trouble."

      "content": "Wear brightly colored or reflective clothing. While this may seem counterproductive -- after all aren't you supposed to not draw attention to yourself? -- it actually helps you out in a couple different ways. Be visible. Brightly colored, reflective clothing and lights (such as a headlamp or bicycle lights) helps lessen the danger from car accidents. Wearing dark clothes at night can make you practically invisible. And traffic accidents are far more likely to happen than any crime. It also can make you less of a target. Bright colors have a correlation with confidence and it can make someone who was going to mess with you, less likely to do so, because you're so visible."

While unfortunate things can happen even in well-lit areas, someone can attack you much more easily in a darkened area and it will be much harder to get help should you need it.

If something happens to you, you definitely want to have at least one person who knows what you were doing and where you were going. If you have to walk somewhere at night, make sure that a friend or trusted person knows the route that you took. This way if something does happen to you they know where to start looking."

      "content": "Have emergency phone numbers memorized. In this day and age your phone contains so much information that it's tempting not to memorize any of those numbers. You need to make a contingency plan in case you lose your cell phone, it gets stolen, or it runs out of batteries. Along with the obvious emergency numbers (like the police or fire department) you should have a friend or two that you can call if you run into difficulty. If you can, try to have these numbers be people who live in your area. While it can be tempting to call mom, she might live thousands of miles away and not be able to help you out at all."

Make a plan before going out at night designating who is buddied up with whom. This way you'll only have to keep track of one other person and you'll know that someone is looking out for you, too. If there is a designated driver, have them be in charge of making sure that all the friends are okay.

You can't tell if someone has tampered with your drink (like if it has been roofied). Just remember that even if someone does tamper your drink, it isn't your fault.

Whether it's cab fare to get you back home, or it's money for the bus or subway, make sure that you always have the right amount to get you back from wherever you are. Keep your backup money separate from the money youâ€™re spending at night. This way you won't decide to spend your money on the night out, rather than on getting home. This is important even if you're just coming back from work at night. If something makes you uncomfortable or nervous you want to have enough money to get yourself out of the situation by taking a cab or bus, if you need to."

This way if you do miss it you don't have to wait around at the bus stop or tube station. Make sure to have a contingency plan for if you do get stranded. Keep the number of a local cab company with you, or have a friend that you can call if you need to. If you do take a bus late at night, sit near the driver.

Make sure that you have one or more fire extinguishers in the right places around the house: in the kitchen and by a fireplace are two good places. Also, you want to ensure that you and the people in your household know how to use the fire extinguisher in case there's an emergency. Place a flashlight in an obvious place.

Have multiple escape routes for if there is a fire. Make sure that everyone in your household knows what to do and where to go. Depending on where you live you might have an emergency plan for a tornado, a hurricane, an earthquake, and so on. You might also try to make an emergency plan for if you ever had a home invasion: you might also figure out escape routes out of the house, where you might hide in the house, where you would go for help, and so on."

Figure out which one works for you, or what your needs are. If carbon monoxide isn't a problem in your home, for example, then you won't need an early alert system for it. Always make sure that your alarm system is set and that it has all the appropriate batteries and wiring. There's not much point in having an alarm system that's never functional."

If you live in an apartment building and someone you don't know wants to buzz you in, avoid doing so unless you're absolutely sure of them. You also don't want to post on Facebook or other social media how you're home alone. This is especially important if you're a kid and you're at home alone.

The best thing to do with a spare key is give it to a trusted neighbor and get it from them if you lock yourself out. Otherwise you should make certain to hide the key really well. This means, don't hide it under the front mat, or a nearby flowerpot. That's the first place a potential intruder will look. An example might be hiding a key to the shed on a hook beneath the back porch and having to use the key to the shed to get the house key from a hiding place in the locked shed."

If you get home and see a broken window or the door open when it shouldnâ€™t be, then you should not go and investigate. Instead go to a neighbor's house and call the cops. If a light is on that shouldn't be on, call the home phone and check that it isn't a family member back when you didn't expect them.

Keep your duplicates in a different place than your actual documents. For example, if you have a purse you're keeping all the important documents like passport and so on, keep your duplicates in a different bag.

There are certain gestures in the U.S., for example, that are extremely rude in other parts of the world. Ask locals where is safe to go. The locals are the ones who are the most likely to recommend good places to go, as well as where to stay away from.

Valuables can mean jewelry, phone, laptop or wallet...but it may be less obvious things like a denim jacket or designer purse. You also want to not stand out too strongly as a tourist by wearing T-shirts from your hometown, keeping your camera out constantly for photos, or dressed like a stereotypical tourist.

[11] X Research source The reason people tend to be robbed while they're traveling isn't because other countries are more crime-ridden than your country. It's because you're more likely to be paying attention when you're home and you're more likely to notice when something is out-of-place. Thieves can orchestrate or take advantage of a chaotic situation to rob you. If a bunch of people are swarming around you, pay attention for any little hands in your pockets.
