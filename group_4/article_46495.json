      "title": "Perform a safety check before turning the grinder on.",
      "content": "Perform a safety check before turning the grinder on. Make sure the grinder is tightly secured to the bench. Check that the tool rest is in place on the grinder. The tool rest is where the metal item will rest as you grind it. The rest should be secured in place so there is a 1/8 inch (3 mm) space between it and the grinding wheel. Clear the area around the grinder of objects and debris. There should be enough space to easily push the piece of metal you are working with back and forth on the grinder. Fill a pot or bucket with water and place it near the metal grinder so you can cool off any metal that gets too hot while you grind it."

    {
      "title": "Work the piece of metal.",
      "content": "Work the piece of metal. Move so you are directly in front of the grinder. Holding the metal tightly in both hands, place it on the tool rest and slowly push it towards the grinder until it touches the edge only. Do not allow the metal to touch the sides of the grinder at any time."
    },
    {
      "title": "Dip the piece in the water pot to cool the metal.",
      "content": "Dip the piece in the water pot to cool the metal. To cool the metal off after or during grinding, dip it into a bucket or pot of water. Keep your face away from the pot to avoid the steam created by the hot metal hitting the cooler water."
    },
    {
      "title": "Grind a piece off the metal.",
      "content": "Grind a piece off the metal. Move the metal back and forth across the grinder until the chunk of metal is gone. Holding the metal against the grinder in one place for too long will warm it up, and could damage the piece."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cut through a metal piece.",
      "content": "Cut through a metal piece. Hold the metal on the tool rest and turn it gently until the grinder comes in contact with the spot you want the cut. Keep turning the piece until it breaks in half. Make sure you hold each end. Dip both hot ends in water when you are done."
    },
    {
      "title": "Shape a metal piece.",
      "content": "Shape a metal piece. Touch a piece of metal to the grinder at the spot where you want it to bend. Use a back and forth motion, as you would to grind a part off. When you see the metal turning orange, it is warm enough to be pulled away from the grinder. Use both hands to bend the metal to the shape you want. Dip it in water once it is the right shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sharpen a metal blade.",
      "content": "Sharpen a metal blade. Rest the piece on the tool rest and hold it securely with both hands. Slowly push the blade into the grinder, angling it slightly up or down so the grinder cuts metal away to create a pointed, sharp edge. Use the same forward-and-back motion, rubbing the blade across the bench grinder to prevent cutting into the blade or warming it up too much."
