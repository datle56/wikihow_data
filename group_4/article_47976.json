This can help you rule out problems with the atomizer as opposed to the mod or battery itself. If you don't get the error on your second device, you can rule out problems with the atomizer. If you do get the error on the other device, the issue is likely related to the atomizer. [1] X Research source"

To check, completely remove the tank or pod from the device, then reconnect it. [2] X Research source Be careful not to over-tighten the atomizer, as it can break the 510 connectors."

      "content": "An improperly seated coil can trigger \"No Atomizer\" on your vape. Remove the coil from the tank and reconnect it to see if that resolves the error. The coil should sit flush without tilting to either side. It should also not be touching any other tank components, including the cap that covers the tank. If the coil is touching metal it shouldn't be touching (a common problem with rebuildables), you might see a \"No Atomizer\" or \"Short Atomizer\" message."

      "content": "You'll also want to make sure you're using the right coil for your device. If the resistance is too low, especially on a rebuildable sub-ohm RDA device, your vaporizer may give you an atomizer error to prevent damaging the device."

      "title": "The coil could be old, flooded, burned, or even flawed.",
      "content": "The coil could be old, flooded, burned, or even flawed. If the coil is brand new and you're suddenly seeing \"No Atomizer,\" the coil might be faulty. If you've been using the coil for a while without problems and now seeing the error, it could just be time to insert a new coil . Vape coils usually last from 1 to 4 weeks. However, certain juices can wear out your coils more quickly. If you're using a vape cartridge or pod that doesn't have a removable coil, it could be clogged. You can try unclogging it by removing it from the device and blowing through the mouthpiece. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Excess e-juice or dirt on the 510 connectors is often the culprit behind the \"No Atomizer\" message.",
      "content": "Excess e-juice or dirt on the 510 connectors is often the culprit behind the \"No Atomizer\" message. Any liquids or grime on the connectors can prevent the tank or pod from properly connecting to the pins. You'll want to clean the connections on both the atomizer and the mod. Use a lint-free cloth or paper towel to clean the connector pins and posts on your atomizer or pod, as well as on your battery or device. Twist the cloth into the hole in the atomizer tank to absorb excess liquids. If you use a paper towel, make sure there's no paper residue on the connectors when you reconnect. For buildup around the 510 connectors, you use a paperclip to gently scrape away the gunk."
    },
    {
      "title": "If cleaning didn't help, take a closer look at connectors on your mod and atomizer.",
      "content": "If cleaning didn't help, take a closer look at connectors on your mod and atomizer. These are the metal pins and plates that create the connection between the two parts. Detach the atomizer from the mod and check the metal connectors on both sides. Are the plates damaged on either side? Is the screw threading intact? If you find any damage, you'll need to replace those parts. Is the plate pushed up too far on the atomizer or pod? If it is, gently try to maneuver it back into position. If the pins on your mod are recessed too far, they won't make contact with the atomizer. This can occur from overtightening the tank, dropping your e-cig, and even manufacturing defects. Gently tap the pins with a toothpick to see if they'll spring back into place. If you're unable to get the pin(s) back into place or suspect the pin(s) is/are damaged, you won't be able to get rid of the \"No Atomizer\" or \"Check Atomizer\" message until you repair or replace the device. If you have an RDA or RBA with screws securing the pin to the device, you might need to tighten or loosen the screws to get the pin into its proper position."

      "content": "If your mod has a factory reset feature, restore it to its original factory settings. Not all mods have a reset feature, but many do, including several Smok mods. Check your manufacturer's website for instructions specific to your mod. Depending on your mod, there could be a firmware update that resolves the issue. Many vape manufacturers offer software updates to fix known problems. Check the manufacturer's website for an update. If a reset or firmware update doesnâ€™t get rid of the atomizer errors, it's likely time to replace either the atomizer, the mod, or both. Replacing the atomizer will be the more affordable solution, so try that first. If that doesn't help, replace your mod."
