Unless the person whose hair you're cutting wants a buzzed, even length over their head, definitely use shears to trim the top so you don’t cut too much off. [1] X Research source"

For a long-length hairstyle, you can leave the hair at least 5 or 6 in (13 or 15 cm) long, so it can frame the sides of the head. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Use hair clippers to keep the sides and back short and tapered. Clippers are a great option if you’d like to achieve a clean-cut look along the sides and back of the head. Whenever you use clippers, you’ll need to pick out the right guard—this is a special cover that helps keep your hair a short, consistent length. The right guard length really depends on how short the person wants the back and sides of their hair to be. [3] X Research source Clipper guards are labeled with different numbers—the smaller the number, the shorter the hair will be. For reference, a number 1 guard will leave hair 1 ⁄ 8 in (0.32 cm) long, while a number 8 guard will leave hair 1 in (2.5 cm) long. [4] X Research source"

Sometimes, damp hair looks longer than it actually is, which can lead to some unwanted surprises once the haircut is done. Dry cutting makes it a lot easier to tell where the curls will naturally fall, and how they’ll look in real time. [7] X Research source"
