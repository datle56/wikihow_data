      "content": "Weigh the toy (optional). Stuffing can take a long time to dry once it's wet all the way through. If you weigh the toy before it gets wet, you'll know that it's mostly dry once it's back to its original weight. If you skip this step, there's a chance you won't give the toy enough time to dry. The internal moisture could cause rot or sagging."

      "content": "Pre-treat stains (optional). You'll have the highest chance of removing dry stains if you rub on a mild laundry detergent and let it sit on the toy for ten minutes before you begin the laundry. A specialized stain removal cleaner may work, but test it on an inconspicuous area of the toy first to see if it causes discoloration."

[5] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If none of your laundry detergents are labeled mild, look at the eco-friendly brands. In a pinch, you can use shampoo or dish detergent, but use ¼ or ⅓ of the recommended amount, as it will create a large amount of suds. If the stuffed toys are white, add chlorine bleach to the washing machine to sanitize them. [6] X Research source If they are colored, use color-safe bleach. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Air dry. Swing the toy sharply in the air a couple times to fling off surface moisture, then hang up to drip dry in a well-ventilated area. Once the toy has stopped dripping, move it to a well-ventilated area on a towel and leave it for several days to finish drying. Direct sunlight can cause color fading. You can sometimes feel damp lumps when you squeeze the toy. Once it feels normal again when squeezed, it is probably done drying."

      "content": "Remove dust and odor (optional). If you're cleaning toys without noticeable grime or stains, or extremely delicate toys, try one of these extra-gentle options. In most cases, you can skip down to the next step and start mixing soapy water instead. To remove dust, wet a cloth in plain water, then wring it out until it is almost completely dry. Gently wipe away the dust. Alternatively, use the hose attachment on a vacuum cleaner. To remove odor, put the toy in a paper bag with a spoonful or two of baking soda. Close and shake the bag to coat the toy, let it sit 30 minutes, then brush out the baking soda with a dry towel. To remove light dirt on extra-fragile toys, put it in the bag with cornmeal instead, or brush the fur with a plastic comb that has not touched human hair or hair-styling products."
