[1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you shave or tweeze your nose hairs, checking the internal and external nasal areas will help figure out if you have an ingrown nose hair. An ingrown nose hair may present itself as an inflamed area with or without pain, and there may be a tiny, pimple-like bump where you removed the hair and it is trying to grow back. You may see these symptoms either on the outside or inside of your nose. Make sure to not stick your fingers or any other objects deep inside your nasal cavity. Instruments can lodge themselves in your nose, causing severe harm to you. If you can’t locate the source of the pain or your ingrown hair, either leave it alone or see a doctor."

Gentle, circular rubbing the inside or outside area of your nose affected by the ingrown hair may help release it. It’s not unusual to see a small amount of pus or blood if you do this."
