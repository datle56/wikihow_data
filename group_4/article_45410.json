      "content": "Blow out the lint with a leaf blower for a quick solution. Place a rag around the end of a leaf blower to serve as a seal, and slide the edge of the end of the leaf blower into the dryer vent. Switch on the appliance, and wait a few seconds for the built-up lint to fly out of your vent. Keep the leaf blower on for around 20-30 seconds, or until you’ve confirmed that no more lint is blowing out of the vent. [10] X Research source This rag keeps lint and dust from blowing back in your direction. Be sure to turn off the leaf blower before pulling it out of the vent. Since you probably won’t be able to see it from the laundry room, have a friend or family member wait outside to confirm that the lint is blowing out."

[12] X Research source You probably won’t be able to reach all of the vent duct with this attachment. However, if you have a shop vacuum, you can set it to reverse and blow the lint out."
