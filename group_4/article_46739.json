      "content": "Choose a pad of the appropriate thickness, absorbency, shape and style. With nearly 3.5 billion people having periods on this planet, there are a whole bunch of options out there to accommodate all our different needs. Here's the general rundown on your choices: [1] X Research source Thickness. The lighter your period, the thinner your pad can be. Thin pads can still be quite absorbent, and they're often very comfortable to wear. You may even forget they're there! Absorbency. Look at the rating (light, average, or super), and try a few different brands and styles before settling on one you like. You may need more absorbent pads during heavier days of your period, and less absorbent pads on lighter days. Shape . There are different shapes of undies out there, so naturally there are different shapes of pads. There are pads for regular undies and thongs, as well as pads designed to wear overnight while you sleep. Overnight pads have a longer shape to prevent leaks when you’re lying down. Style. There are two things here: with wings and without. \"Wings\" are flaps that adhere to your underwear and help the pad stay in place, so they’re generally good to have. There are options without wings, though, if you don’t like how they feel. In general, stay away from scented pads, especially if your skin is sensitive. They can be irritating to your skin, and they aren’t necessary. There are also panty-liners, but those are a different type of product. You can wear panty liners when you think your period is starting or when it's ending — that is, when it's really, really light—or to protect against leaks if you’re wearing a tampon. [2] X Research source Disposable or reusable. Reusable pads are good for the environment and your wallet, as they produce less waste and can be washed and worn again. They also come in different sizes and absorbencies and tend to be pretty comfortable to wear.

      "content": "Remove any wrappers or boxes from the pad. Many pads come individually wrapped, so you’ll need to remove their plastic outer wrappings. You could discard these wrappings at this point, but you can also use them to wrap up your used pad once you take it off. Many people who use period products choose to do this so that their pad isn’t visible in the trash. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Unfold the wings and take off the backing that covers the adhesive on the center. Expose the adhesive on the wings too, and dispose of each of these paper backings in the trash or a sanitary bin (you won't need them for wrapping). In some brands of pads, the wrapper doubles as the backing. It's more eco-friendly and simpler — if this is the case, one less step for you! Reusable pads don't have adhesives, so you don't need to worry about this step."

      "title": "Stick the adhesive parts to your underwear.",
      "content": "Stick the adhesive parts to your underwear. You want the pad to be centered in the seat of your underwear (the part between your legs), not creeping too far to the front or the back. [6] X Research source Most pads are a bit thinner on one end and wider at the other—the thinner side is the top and the wider side is the bottom. Got wings? Make sure to fold those around the outside of your panties so that they stick. They'll keep the pad from shifting around as you move, which will be way more comfortable and feel a lot more natural. It also helps prevent leaks during heavy flow. For reusable pads, simply put the shiny part of the pad on your underwear, with the softer side up. Fold the wings around your underwear and use the popper button to close the pad and keep it in place."

Wearing a pad shouldn’t be uncomfortable or distracting, so if your pad is itchy or irritating your skin at all, remove it and try out a different kind. It's possible it needs recentering, it's saturated, it smells, or that specific kind/size/shape isn't right for you."

      "content": "Do a routine check, especially on heavy days. After a while, you’ll find that you know how often you'll need to change your pad, and how long a pad lasts you on certain days of your period. But at least at the beginning, do routine checks to prevent any leaks or mishaps, especially if your flow is heavy. No need to run to the bathroom every half hour–checking in on your pad every 2-3 hours should be just fine."

      "content": "Opt for more comfortable clothes. Although it may feel strange at first, the pad will generally not be visible, and you can wear any type of clothes while wearing one. It will follow the curve of your body and be well hidden. However, if you feel uncomfortable in tighter pants or shorts, wearing loose pants or a skirt in breathable fabrics may help. [7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source A good rule of thumb is to wear the panties you care about the least when you're on your period in case of any leaks. You can also wear period underwear for extra security (period underwear can also be worn on their own instead of pads if you prefer)."

If your period is over or a wrapper is unavailable, wrap the used pad in toilet paper. If there is one available, make sure to place it into a sanitary bin so that it is disposed of properly, but if you can’t find any, place it in the trash. [10] X Research source Never dispose of anything that isn't toilet paper into the toilet. Don't flush your pads or tampons—this can harm drainage pipes and the environment.
