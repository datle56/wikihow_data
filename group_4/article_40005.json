      "title": "MRDs (mandibular repositioning devices)",
      "content": "MRDs (mandibular repositioning devices) When it comes to scientifically-backed and professionally-approved snoring devices, mandibular repositioning devices (MRDs) are largely said to be the most effective in stopping snoring. Also called “mandibular advancement devices,” MRDs are actually dental appliances that hold the lower jaw forward in order to enlarge their airway and address the root causes of snoring. [1] X Research source Traditionally, MRDs were custom-made and prescribed by a dentist or orthodontist who specialized in sleep medicine, with a hefty price tag of $4000 or more. Fortunately, innovators, such as The PureSleep Company, have made MRDs more accessible to the everyday sleeper (and snorer). Their PureSleep device was the first self-fitted MRD available directly to consumers, at a fraction of the typical price. It’s a \"boil-and-bite” MRD, as opposed to the custom-made MRDs used by most dentists. Boil-and-bite MRDs are fitted to a patient’s teeth after being boiled in water so that a custom impression of the user’s teeth can be made. Most boil-and-bite MRDs cost about $100, or even less. Custom MRDs, on the other hand, require patients to visit the dentist at least 2-3 times for adjustments to the mouthguard. This process can be time-consuming and inconvenient. All MRDs typically cause some soreness of the teeth and gums for the first two or three full nights of use. After this acclimation period, they can be very comfortable."

      "title": "Nasal Dilators & Nasal Strips",
      "content": "Nasal Dilators & Nasal Strips Nasal dilators—also known as nose vents—can be inserted into your nostril to physically widen your nasal passages. Nasal strips, similarly, are adhesive strips placed on the outside of the nose that widen the nostril and increase airflow. According to the product manufacturers, both of these devices are meant to improve airflow through your nasal passages and reduce snoring. [2] X Research source Do nasal dilators and strips really work? Nasal strips and dilators can improve nasal airflow, which can be quite helpful for many people, but they do not address the root cause of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea, which is an obstruction of the upper airway."

      "title": "Chinstraps",
      "content": "Chinstraps Chinstraps are placed around the wearer’s chin, ears, and head to hold their mouth closed as they sleep . As a result, the wearer shouldn’t be able to open-mouth snore throughout the night. [3] X Research source Do anti-snoring chinstraps really work? Chinstraps reduce mouth-breathing during sleep, which can have important positive health benefits, including better dental and gingival health. It can also muffle the sound of snoring, which originates in the upper airway. However they don’t address the root cause of snoring, which is a partial blockage of the upper airway, so the snoring will still happen, and may actually be worse because chinstraps tend to pull the jaw in, which is exactly the opposite of what MRDs do. Chinstraps may also feel uncomfortable and inhibit one’s ability to breathe."

      "title": "Smart Pillows",
      "content": "Smart Pillows Smart pillows are designed to sense when you start snoring and adjust accordingly. Depending on the model, the pillow may inflate or otherwise move. Some, such as Smart Nora, use this movement to arouse you enough to stop snoring, but not enough to fully awaken you. Snoring is always minimized if you sleep on your side or stomach, but if you can only sleep on your back, other smart pillows are best. They move so that your head is gently turned to the side, ideally opening up your airways and reducing snoring. [4] X Research source Do anti-snore pillows really work? Smart pillows may work to alleviate snoring, but when you start snoring, it’s normally because you’re starting to enter REM or deep sleep, your most restorative stages of sleep. So when a smart pillow arouses you whenever you snore, it may also prevent you from getting the most important types of sleep. The ones that turn your head to the side when sleeping on your back are shown to reduce snoring by approximately 67%, which may seem great, until you realize that you will also get a huge improvement by simply sleeping on your side or stomach. Also, smart pillows are not FDA-approved, meaning they are not proven to be certifiably safe or effective."

      "title": "Tongue Retention Devices",
      "content": "Tongue Retention Devices In the same way that MRDs hold the base of your tongue forward to open the upper airway, tongue retention devices hold your entire tongue forward, even to the point where it is protruding from your mouth. Do tongue retention devices really work? Most people find that it takes a concerted effort to acclimate to using a tongue retention device, given that it holds the tongue in an unnatural position which makes swallowing difficult. However if you can get comfortable with using one, it should work to at least reduce your snoring, and it could completely eliminate it."

      "title": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)",
      "content": "Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) The most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has always been CPAP. Since OSA is caused by a complete blockage of the upper airway while snoring is caused by a partial blockage, it seems like it ought to work for snoring as well as OSA. Does CPAP work to treat snoring? Absolutely. CPAP is highly effective at opening the airway, so can certainly treat snoring as well as OSA. However most people who snore think of CPAP as a pretty heavy-handed form of treatment for snoring without OSA."

      "title": "Expiratory Positive Airway Devices (EPAP)",
      "content": "Expiratory Positive Airway Devices (EPAP) It is well known that CPAP devices work by blowing pressurized air into the nose, or into both the mouth and nose. This pressurized air opens the upper airway, alleviating any obstructions. EPAP works in a similar way, by allowing you to easily inhale through your nose but then creating “back-pressure” when you exhale through your nose while keeping your mouth closed and your lips sealed. This back-pressure inflates your upper airway. Do EPAP devices really work? When the upper airway is inflated during exhalation, it tends to remain “inflated” when you inhale, so yes, it does work. However, like tongue retention devices, it can take some time and effort to get comfortable using an EPAP device. For them to work during sleep, you must keep your mouth closed and your lips sealed. However when you first go to sleep, your metabolism is too high for you to breathe without opening your mouth. Therefore you must fall asleep while breathing through your mouth, and then when you fall asleep, you will naturally start to breathe entirely through your nose. It may sound impossible, but it’s not…but it does take patience."

      "content": "Elevating Your Bed Some beds can be adjusted such that your head is elevated during sleep. Some even have the ability to sense when you snore and to respond by raising your head. Does elevating my bed really work? If you sleep on your back, yes, it will reduce snoring, but not much. It will reduce your snoring more if you sleep on your side or stomach."

      "content": "Special Pillows Here, we’re not talking about “smart pillow.” We’re talking about pillows that are intended to improve your posture during sleep in a way that will help to open the airway. Normally, they provide a lot of extra support to the neck. Do these kinds of pillows really work? Anything you do to improve your posture during sleep is a good thing, especially if it helps you keep your spine straight and your airway from getting blocked because your neck isn’t straight. Specially designed pillows can definitely help, but really, any pillow or pillows that you can use to position yourself properly are good. Will they stop your snoring? Perhaps, but only if your snoring was previously caused by poor sleep posture. Most people who snore loudly enough to read this article will snore regardless of their posture."

      "content": "Throat Exercises Many YouTube videos showcase exercises you can do to reduce or eliminate your snoring. You can also find products that can assist with these exercises, which are intended to tighten and tone the muscles which surround the upper airway. Can throat exercises really stop my snoring? If you actually do the exercises, yes. Not everyone wants to take the time for this unusual type of “bodybuilding,” but if you're a fitness fanatic anyway, why not? If not, perhaps you can learn to play the didgeridoo, as it exercises the same throat muscles."

      "title": "Everything Else",
      "content": "Everything Else There are many “snoring cures” that are not based on science and simply are not proven to work at all. In many cases, their claims may seem plausible. For example, there are “micro-CPAP” devices that use tiny little fans and tiny little rechargeable batteries to blow tiny little amounts of air into your nose. They sell clips you put on the septum of your nose which have little magnetic balls on them. There are countless throat sprays, herbal supplements, copper bracelets, acupressure rings, and devices that you attach to the bottom of your jaw. None of these “cures” are backed by science."

[5] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source The companies that make these devices must demonstrate that they are safe and effective. Also, unless they have been additionally cleared for over-the-counter (OTC) use, MRDs may only be legally sold with a prescription. A very small number of MRDs have been awarded OTC clearance by the FDA, including PureSleep , SnoreRx, ZQuiet and Zyppah. This means that the makers of these products have demonstrated that the general public can safely use them and get good results when used as directed. Unfortunately, most over-the-counter snoring devices are not cleared by the FDA at all, and are therefore being sold illegally, and you have no guarantee that they will stop your snoring, that they are safe, or that they are made with materials that are approved for use in devices that are appropriate for this type of use. Many such devices are made in China and sold illegally online."

      "title": "Consider factors like material and customization for your mouthpiece.",
      "content": "Consider factors like material and customization for your mouthpiece. When choosing an anti-snoring mouthpiece, you want something that is both comfortable and effective. Here are some things you should consider when choosing: [6] X Research source Customization & Comfort: For the sake of comfort, it’s best to choose a mouthpiece that can be closely customized and adjusted to your mouth. Some MRDs, such as ZQuiet, don’t need to be fitted to your teeth, which makes it a good option if convenience is your top criterion. However this type of design cannot adhere to the teeth as well as the other devices, limiting its effectiveness, and many people find it to be less comfortable than devices that you fit to your teeth by boiling the device in water then biting into the softened plastic to make an impression of your teeth. Ability to Accommodate Different Bite Types and Jaw Sizes and Shapes: Some MRDs, such as SnoreRx, allow you to adjust how much you would like to advance your jaw after the fitting process. This can be quite helpful, but the mechanism that allows this type of adjustment makes such devices bulkier, and the device can also slip out of adjustment. In contrast, some devices, such as PureSleep , can be molded onto your teeth regardless of your jaw size, jaw shape or bite type. While it may not be readjusted after the fitting process, it also cannot slip out of adjustment, and their patented mechanism adds minimal bulk, making it unusually comfortable. Material Quality: Most MRDs are made from silicone resin, plastic, thermoplastic, or a combination thereof. [7] X Research source For the best quality and peace of mind when picking out an item that you’ll leave in your mouth each night, look for a mouthpiece that’s made from 100% BPA-free materials, like PureSleep , ZQuiet, or Zyppah. Prescription Requirements: Most of the over-the-counter snoring devices aren’t as effective as the professionally fitted, custom-made options. However MRDs such as PureSleep, SnoreRx, ZQuiet and Zyppah are all OTC-cleared by the FDA, making it possible to get professional-grade mouthpieces without a prescription from a dentist."

      "content": "All snorers, but especially chronic ones, should consider an MRD. Many adults experience snoring—roughly 90 million across the United States. [8] X Research source Some of these individuals experience snoring at a chronic level or even on a nightly basis. In general, this snoring results from a restricted airflow through the breathing passages, and the problem can be exacerbated by chronic congestion, nasal issues, alcohol use and back-sleeping. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Anyone who experiences symptoms of snoring—whether on an occasional or chronic level may benefit from an anti-snoring mouthpiece. If you’re not sure if this option is the best one for you, consult with a medical professional, and if your snoring is loud or chronic, it’s a good idea to get tested for obstructive sleep apnea. Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, morning dry mouth or sore throat, mood changes, episodes of stopped breathing during sleep, and episodes of gasping or choking during sleep.
