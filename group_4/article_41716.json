      "content": "Touch your thumb to your palm, then extend it. Hold your arm out so that you're looking at your palm with your fingers extended. Tuck your thumb in so that it's in full contact with your palm—your thumb tip should be near the base of your pinky. Hold this position for 5-10 seconds, then extend your thumb to the starting position. Complete 10 repetitions (reps), then switch to your other hand. Do 3 sets per hand every day."

      "title": "Curl your fingers and thumbs with an open hand.",
      "content": "Curl your fingers and thumbs with an open hand. Extend your fingers and hold your hand out so that your thumb is pointed toward you. Keep your thumb extended, but curl your fingertips down against their bases. Hold for 5-10 seconds, release, and repeat 10 times. Switch hands and repeat the exercise. Complete 3 sets per hand per day. You can also make this a combination exercise. Curl your fingers, open your hand, make a closed fist (with your thumb still extended), then open your hand again to complete a rep. To make it a triple combination exercise, add a straight fist—putting your fingertips flat against the base of your palm—to each rep."

      "title": "Touch your thumb to each fingertip, back and forth.",
      "content": "Touch your thumb to each fingertip, back and forth. With an open hand, palm facing you, lightly pinch the pads of your thumb and index finger together. Hold for 5 seconds, open your hand, then touch your thumb and middle finger. Repeat the process with your ring finger and pinky, then work your way in reverse back to your index finger. This completes a single set. [1] X Research source Do 3 sets with each hand each day."

      "content": "Open and close your hand, on a table or at your side. Lay your forearm on a table, with your hand open and positioned as if you are trying to chop the table in half. Close your fingers and thumb into a full fist, hold it for 5 seconds, then open your hand. Complete 10 reps, then switch hands. [2] X Research source Alternatively, hold your upper arm at your side, bend your elbow 90 degrees, and complete the reps without a table. Aim to do 3 sets per day with each hand."

      "content": "Extend a rubber band wrapped over your fingers and thumb. Hold your hand in front of you and touch the tips of your fingers and thumb together—as if your hand is a flower that hasn't opened yet. Place a rubber band around your fingers and thumb, just below the fingernails. Extend your hand to “open the flower” as wide as you can, hold it open for 5-10 seconds, then close your fingers again. [3] X Research source Complete 10 reps, then switch hands and do 10 more reps. Do 3 sets with each hand every day. Use additional rubber bands to increase the resistance."

Keeping your forearm rigid and your palm flat on the table, bend your wrist to the left, hold for 5 seconds, then return to the starting position. Then, bend your wrist to the right for 5 seconds and return it to complete 1 rep. [4] X Research source After 10 reps, switch hands. Complete 3 sets each day with each hand."

Lay your forearm at the edge of a table so that your wrist and hand extend over the side. Keeping your forearm rigid, use your wrist to chop downward. Hold the downward chop for 5 seconds, return to the starting position for 5 seconds, chop upward for 5 seconds, then return to the starting position to finish 1 rep. If you feel some discomfort where your forearm meets the edge of the table, fold up a tea towel or sock and place it under your arm at that spot. Do 10 reps to complete a set, and complete 3 sets per hand per day."

Bend your wrist upward for 5 seconds and back to the starting position to finish a rep. Place a towel or sock under your lower forearm if you feel discomfort where it meets the edge of the table.

      "title": "Add hand weights to increase the difficulty of your wrist exercises.",
      "content": "Add hand weights to increase the difficulty of your wrist exercises. Nearly all wrist exercises can be adapted for use with hand weights—make sure you start with a very light weight, however, to reduce the risk of injury. Try the following: For side-to-side wrist bends, skip the table and tuck your elbow to your side. Hold the weight in your hand and move your wrist from side to side. Likewise, with palm flips, tuck your elbow to your side instead of resting your forearm on a table. Grip the weight in your hand as you flip your hand over and back. For wrist chops, extend your wrist and hand off the end of the table as before, but hold the weight in your hand as you bend your wrist up and down. Do the same for palm lifts and drops—grasp the weight in your hand with your wrist extended off the edge of the table."

      "content": "Pick up a dumbbell by the head and hold it. Set a dumbbell upright on the floor. Stand beside the dumbbell, bend at the knees, and grasp the head of the dumbbell with one hand. Stand upright and hold the dumbbell at your side for 5-10 seconds, then bend your knees and lower the dumbbell back to the floor. [9] X Research source Do 10 reps per set, and 3 sets per hand each day. Not all dumbbells will stand upright—they need to have fairly flat heads. Also, some dumbbells may have heads that are too large or small to grip securely. Start with a lighter dumbbell weight, and make sure not to drop it on your toes!"

Stand in place and hold them for at least 30 seconds, or, better yet, walk around while keeping them hanging at your sides. [10] X Research source If you're walking around, don't swing your arms—keep the dumbbells steady. Instead of dumbbells, try using reusable shopping bags filled with cans of food. Do 10 reps per set, and 1-2 sets per day."
