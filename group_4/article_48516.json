      "title": "He acts shy around you before opening up.",
      "content": "He acts shy around you before opening up. Taurus men tend to be a little shy and introverted when catching feelings. But while he may be reserved and cautious at first, a Taurus man will give himself completely to you once he’s decided that you’re the one. [1] X Research source A Taurus man who’s falling for you may act confident and self-assured around others, but they'll get tongue-tied and act adorably awkward whenever you’re around."

      "title": "He makes time for you.",
      "content": "He makes time for you. A Taurus man who’s serious about you will make you his top priority and seek out ways to spend time with you. He’ll want to spend quality time together in order to nurture your relationship and bring it to the next level. Taurus men tend to be homebodies, so it’s extra meaningful when they go out of their way to hang out with you. A Taurus man “simply liking your Instagram story isn’t proof that they’re interested in you,” says psychic astrologer Stina Garbis. Tauruses love to hang out at home and scroll on their phones, continues Garbis, “so if they’re making any effort to physically see you, then they must be seriously interested in you.”"

      "content": "He’s attentive. When he’s decided you’re the one, a Taurus man will go to great lengths to take good care of you. He’ll really listen to you when you express your needs and he’ll do anything he can to meet them. [2] X Research source You’ll know a Taurus guy is serious about you because he’ll take the time to listen to all the little parts of your day—and he’ll remember them! If you told him two months ago that your favorite ice cream flavor is rocky road, don’t be surprised if he shows up with a pint."

      "title": "He’s protective of you.",
      "content": "He’s protective of you. Taurus men are very protective of the things and people they care about. Your Taurus fella will do everything he can to keep you safe and make you feel comfortable. The flip side of this Taurus trait is that they can become very jealous if they feel like someone else is threatening their relationship or connection with you. [3] X Research source This jealous side usually comes out once a Taurus already feels deeply for you, then hears you talking about your ex or sees you getting approached by other men. [4] X Research source Understand that this jealous nature comes from the Taurus man’s deep need for commitment and loyalty from his significant other. Set boundaries with your jealous Taurus man and reassure him of your love and loyalty to him. However, if his jealousy consistently escalates to yelling, emotional outbursts, or other behavior that makes you feel unsafe, you may want to assess if you’re in any abusive relationship . Other signs of unhealthy jealousy in a Taurus man include him checking in with you frequently on a night out or trying to control who you talk to and spend time with. [5] X Research source"

A Taurus man who is really into you will constantly find ways to touch you, whether through hugs, kisses, handholding, or more sensual activities. [6] X Research source Taurus’ touchy-feely tendencies come from them being ruled by Venus, also known as the planet of love. According to Stina Garbis, astrology expert and owner of Psychic Stina, this ruling planet is the reason why Taurus men have such a “highly sensual and physically affectionate side that’s very tactile.”"

      "content": "He treats you to nice dinners and gifts. While Taurus men are big fans of romancing the object of their affection, they often opt for simple pleasures over grand gestures. As a practical sign that tends to focus on material things, a Taurus spending money on you is a big sign that they think you’re the one. [7] X Research source Spending money on you is one of the top signs that a Taurus man likes you, confirms astrologer Angel Eyedealism. As Eyedealism explains, a Taurus man “wants to impress you with how much money or property he has, so he’d want to buy you a gift that [makes] it obvious he spent money on something with a label attached to it.” Aside from material goods, a Taurus man’s romantic gifts may often focus on sensory experiences like an elaborate meal, an elegant wine tasting, or a couples massage."

      "title": "He’s extremely loyal.",
      "content": "He’s extremely loyal. Tauruses are probably the most loyal sign in the Zodiac, but they take time to really trust someone and commit to them.

Psychic astrologer Stina Garbis recommends “offering to help him clean his house, help him decorate, or get him a gift of decor, a richly scented candle, or a fancy pillow.” Taurus is also a very sensual sign, continues Garbis, so “you can make a fast track to his heart by breaking out the massage oil and giving him a sensual rub down.” Professional astrologist Angel Eyedealism also confirms a Taurus man’s love of food and expensive gifts. Eyedealism recommends impressing your Taurus beau by “inviting him to a very expensive restaurant…they’re really the money sign and [they value] the status that goes with money."

      "content": "Show him that he can trust you. Emotionally connect to a Taurus man by opening up to him gradually and being vulnerable about how you feel. Follow through on things you share with him—even minor or unintentional lies will cause a lot of damage in a Taurus relationship. [11] X Research source Taurus men need to build a foundation of trust and emotional security before they commit to a romantic partner. “They need to know that you’re loyal,” explains astrologer Angel Eyedealism, but “they’re not that trusting because they share the opposite passageway with Scorpio.”"

      "title": "Be consistent and reliable.",
      "content": "Be consistent and reliable. Tauruses need stability, so they’ll gravitate towards partners that know what they want, don’t change their minds often, and don’t cancel plans unless they have to. Taurus doesn’t like to chase their partners because, as tarot card reader Stina Garbis puts it, “Taurus is a lazy sign…you have to somehow make it easy for them to be with you.” Garbis suggests “finding reasons to bring them things or being helpful in some way to where they will need or want your help again.”"

They don’t like change, and they can hold grudges for a long time. [12] X Research source Work on making compromises with your Taurus man and working together to come to a mutual agreement. By showing your guy that you’re willing to meet him halfway, he’s more likely to see you as someone who respects and understands his needs. Taurus men also really value active listening . Since it’s hard for them to open up and trust people, giving him your full attention and putting away any tech distractions will go a long way."

Even if you’ve laid your cards on the table when it comes to your romantic feelings, avoid putting any pressure on your Taurus man to do the same. He lives life at a slow and steady pace, especially when it comes to relationships, so don’t take it personally if he needs time to consider how he feels about you. [14] X Research source Allow him to come to you in his own time. He’s most likely just scared of moving too fast and rushing into something he’s not sure about. If you’re ready for a committed relationship and he’s not, however, it’s okay to move on! It may be bad timing, or he may not be the guy for you!"

      "title": "Taurus men take a long time to commit.",
      "content": "Taurus men take a long time to commit. This attribute can make them seem uninterested or detached, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. A Taurus man just really values stability and security and needs to build a foundation of trust before committing to and opening up to you. [15] X Research source Some people think that Taurus men have commitment issues, but, in general, they really take commitment seriously and want to get to know you on a deeper level first. However, if you’ve been dating a Taurus man for a few months and he doesn’t seem any closer to commitment, this may be a sign that he’s playing you or is genuinely not that interested. Look for these types of red flags in Taurus men, like being hot and cold or inconsistent with giving you attention, refusing to be exclusive, or not introducing you to any of his close friends or family."

      "content": "Taurus men are more traditional when it comes to relationships. They value stability and traditional values. Astrologer Angel Eyedealism gives the example that a Taurus man loves if his partner cooks for them, “even if you’re not a good cook but really put in the effort to make a meal from scratch…[Taurus men] will really appreciate the heartfelt efforts of a handmade gift.” Further explaining Taurus’ tendency toward conservative and traditional values, Eyedealism described how a Taurus man may “like to know that you went to a good accredited school…or that you won’t embarrass them in public.” Or, if you “showed up on a date with a Taurus man and wore some wild outfit,” Eyedealism continues, “they'd be like, ‘Oh, I’m canceling.’”"

      "title": "The Taurus personality values stability, security, and material goods.",
      "content": "The Taurus personality values stability, security, and material goods. Due to their “fixed Earth natures,” explains tarot card reader Stina Garbis, Taurus people “tend to be loyal, materialistic, stable, financially secure, honest, and sometimes stubborn.” These qualities apply to every aspect of a Taurus’ life, including their romantic relationships. Because Venus rules Taurus, Garbis continues, Tauruses also “enjoy luxury, the best of everything, and having luxurious houses filled with velvet and satin and lots of pillows and fine art.” Reader Poll: We asked 826 wikiHow readers what the most negative traits in Taureans are, and 56% of them said stubbornness and resistance to change. [Take Poll] So, don't overlook just how stubborn the Bull can be."
