      "content": "Ft stands for FaceTime. If someone asks if you want to “ft,” they’re asking if you want to video chat. FaceTime is Apple’s built-in video chat program for the iPhone. FaceTime isn’t integrated with Snapchat, so you’ll need to close the app and open it up to FaceTime someone. [1] X Research source “Do you want to ft?” means, “Do you want to video chat right now?” Someone might say, “Hmu to ft” which means, “Hit me up to FaceTime.” A sole “ft?” is an invitation to video chat."

      "content": "It means they want to video chat with you. A lot of people use “FaceTime” as a general term for “video chat,” kind of the same way people say “Kleenex” even if it’s just a generic tissue. Snapchat has a built-in video call feature, so feel free to use that if you don’t have an iPhone. You do not need to exit the app to video chat with someone if you’re using Snapchat’s software. You can only video chat with someone if they’re on your friends list."

Wait for the other person’s video to pop up and you’ll be connected. The phone logo next to the camera will connect you via voice chat only. You can video chat with up to 15 friends at a time. To initiate a group call, start a text group chat with everyone you want to include and click the camera logo. You can swipe down on a video chat window to minimize it. Be careful! The other person can see your video before they accept your invite. Don’t pick your nose or anything while you’re waiting."
