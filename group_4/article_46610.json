      "content": "It works by creating an environment similar to an outdoor grill. When you put food on your grill, the exterior of the food gets nice and brown while the inside cooks slowly and evenly. A grill microwave has a heating element inside that radiates heat to simulate the same cooking environment as an outdoor grill. Grill racks allow you to move food closer to the heating element and creates those tasty char marks."
