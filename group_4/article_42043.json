      "content": "Do or think about something distracting. A boring history lecture. An episode of your favorite TV show. When it comes to self-distraction, the sky’s the limit, as long as it gets your mind off your erection (and any arousing thoughts that might be causing it). [1] X Research source If you get an erection in the middle of class, try focusing on something else in the classroom, like something written on the whiteboard or a page in your textbook. If you get an erection in public (like while you’re on the bus), focus on something else that’s happening nearby, like a conversation someone is happening. If you get an erection randomly, think of a really gross sensation, like stepping in dog poop barefoot or drinking milk that’s gone bad. Enjoying a quick snack or meal is a great way to distract yourself from an ongoing boner, and may even help it go away."

      "content": "Take a warm or cold shower. People everywhere agree—nothing quite stops an erection in its tracks like some water. If you’re at home, take a warm shower to wash your erection away. [2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source If you’re at a pool or waterpark (where a boner could be especially obvious), take a dip in the water instead. Some people swear by cold water, while others find warm water work best. Try both to see what works for you."

[3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source When you're erect, your body closes the opening to your bladder so that semen won't enter it. Trying to pee can trick your body into easing the erection to allow for urine flow."

      "content": "Give your thigh a gentle pinch. Pinch your thigh firmly to cause a distracting sensation and get your attention to focus elsewhere. Only do it for a second or two, and then stop if it doesn't work. Never pinch or otherwise injure your genitals to stop an erection. You may stop the erection, but you could do some serious damage in the process."

[6] X Research source If you feel comfortable doing so (and can find a private place to do so), try to reposition your boner so it’s a little less obvious to the naked eye. You’ll probably have to sneak away to the restroom to do this."

Erections can most definitely be reflexogenic or psychogenic (related to physical or mental arousal), but they can also be nocturnal—in other words, they happen during the night. It’s completely normal for a penis to switch between erect and flaccid while a person sleeps, which is why some people wake up with a random boner (often known as “morning wood”).
