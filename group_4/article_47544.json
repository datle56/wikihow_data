      "title": "Use a bandeau for comfortable support.",
      "content": "Use a bandeau for comfortable support. Bandeaus are strapless bras made of a stretchy jersey material. If you’re wearing an off the shoulder top and you want to stay comfy, slide one of these on underneath. Be warned, though: since the material is so stretchy, it might not offer much support, especially if you’re a larger cup size. [1] X Research source You can find bandeaus with padding in them if you’d like a little extra support. Make sure you buy a bandeau that has a large enough band. If the band is too small, your bra will probably fall down underneath your shirt throughout the day."

      "title": "Try a dedicated strapless bra for the most support.",
      "content": "Try a dedicated strapless bra for the most support. Strapless bras are just that: bras made with underwire that don’t have straps. They still have a back and a clasp, though, so you can put one on underneath your shirt without anything peeking out the top. [2] X Research source Go for a strapless bra that’s one size down in the band size than your normal fit. That way, it won’t slip down as you wear it throughout the day. If you want more support while you’re out and about, this is the bra to wear. Most strapless bras have an adhesive strip on the front so they stick to your skin more than a normal bra would."

      "content": "Wear a convertible bra to switch from straps to strapless. If you don’t want to buy a dedicated bra just for your strapless shirts, you can find one with removable straps to convert it from normal to strapless. When you wear an off the shoulder shirt, simply unhook the straps on the front and the back of the bra and you’re good to go! [3] X Research source Make sure you put the straps somewhere you can find them later on so you don’t lose them. You can also wear just one strap if you have an off the shoulder shirt that covers up one shoulder."

      "title": "Put on a plunging bra for a deep neckline.",
      "content": "Put on a plunging bra for a deep neckline. If you’re wearing an off the shoulder shirt that also has a deep V-neck, it can be tricky to find a bra that works. Go for a plunging bra that sticks on without straps to avoid any part of your bra peeking out from underneath your shirt. [4] X Research source You can also find stick-on plunging bras so you don’t have to deal with clasps in the back, either. Those are great for backless shirts and dresses."

      "title": "Try an adhesive bra to avoid clasps and straps.",
      "content": "Try an adhesive bra to avoid clasps and straps. Stick on bras don’t have a band going around the back or straps. Simply stick them onto your chest with the adhesive strips on the inside and put on your shirt! You can also wear backless dresses and shirts with these bras since they don’t have anything going around to your back. [5] X Research source Some adhesive bras hook in the front and adhere on the sides. These will give you a push-up feel, and they offer more support. [6] X Expert Source Susan Kim Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 30 April 2019. If you have a smaller chest, you can buy a silicone adhesive bra that will stick over your nipples. [7] X Expert Source Susan Kim Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 30 April 2019. You can usually wear these bras around 30 times before the adhesive loses its grip."

      "title": "Wear a bra with clear straps.",
      "content": "Wear a bra with clear straps. To get the support of a classic bra without visible straps on your shoulders, look for a bra with clear straps. Then, you can wear your bra underneath your off the shoulder top with only the thin, clear straps sticking out. [8] X Research source Clear straps are a little shiny in the sun, so they might be slightly visible up close or in natural light. You can also find clear straps to clip onto your strapless bra for extra support."

      "title": "Show off your straps.",
      "content": "Show off your straps. There’s no rule saying you have to hide your bra straps! If you want to wear your regular bra underneath an off the shoulder top, pick one with bedazzled straps, double-wide straps, or colorful straps to make your outfit look intentional. [9] X Research source Exposed bra straps aren’t great in a professional setting, but they’re fine almost everywhere else."

      "title": "Tuck your straps underneath your armpits.",
      "content": "Tuck your straps underneath your armpits. The simplest solution is to put on your normal bra, then slide the straps off your shoulders and underneath your arms. Tuck the straps into the band and the cups to keep them contained, then put on your off the shoulder top. [10] X Research source Since normal bras aren’t made to stay up on their own, you may catch your bra sliding down a bit throughout the day. Just keep an eye on it."

      "title": "Clip your straps in the front if your top has coverage around your neck.",
      "content": "Clip your straps in the front if your top has coverage around your neck. Some off the shoulder tops literally only show your shoulders but wrap around in the front for a collar in the front and the back. If that’s the case with your top, put on your bra like you normally would, then pull the straps toward each other until they meet in the middle of your chest. Secure the straps together with a safety pin or a paper clip to keep them in place all day. [11] X Research source If you’re ever wearing a halter top, you can use this trick in the back of your shirt instead."

      "title": "Stick on pasties to just cover your nipples.",
      "content": "Stick on pasties to just cover your nipples. If you’re only worried about your nipples showing through your shirt, grab a set of adhesive pasties and stick them onto your nipples. When you get undressed for the night, simply peel the pasties off and set them aside. [12] X Research source You can usually use pasties 20 to 30 times until they lose their sticking power. To wash your pasties, just use a little bit of soap and water, then lay them out to dry."

      "content": "Give yourself some support with body tape. Cut a length of body tape that’s about 2 feet (0.61 m) long. Peel the backing off the adhesive, then slide the tape underneath the lowest part of your bust. Lift up just slightly (to give yourself some support), then stick the tape underneath your chest and around to the back. [13] X Research source Make sure you’re using tape specifically made for your skin! If you use normal tape, you could cause irritation or rip off any little hairs along your torso (ouch). Body tape isn’t reusable, so you’ll have to buy more if you plan on wearing it a lot."

      "content": "Put on a tube top underneath for extra support. Grab a tight-fitting tube top that’s similar to your shirt color and slide it on, then put your off the shoulder top over it. The tightness of the tube top will keep your chest in place, kind of like a bandeau would. [14] X Research source If you’re wearing a sheer top, put on a nude tube top."

      "title": "Sew your bra cups into your shirt for a permanent solution.",
      "content": "Sew your bra cups into your shirt for a permanent solution. Take an old bra that you don’t really wear anymore and cut off the straps and the band (leaving just the cups). Place the bra on the inside of your strapless shirt and position it so it sits right where your chest is. Thread a sewing needle with thick sewing thread, then bring your needle down through the edge of the bra and the shirt, then back up again. Keep going with your stitch until your bra is secure inside of your shirt. [15] X Research source This can be a little tedious to do by hand, so if you’ve got a sewing machine, you can try that instead. You should only do this if you’re absolutely sure you don’t want to wear that bra with any other shirt."
