      "content": "A torso rotation machine is a common piece of gym equipment. Torso rotation machines (TRMs) come in a couple different forms. Usually, it has a stationary chair, with handles that pivot around the chair to swivel your torso. Other times, the chair swivels while the handles stay in place. In either case, the machine targets your core by making you swivel your torso against a certain amount of resistance. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "The torso rotation machine works your obliques and abs. The twisting motion of the torso rotation machine (TRM) targets your core, but particularly your obliques, which can be tricky to engage. Your obliques are the muscles on the sides of your torso, which control your torso’s side-to-side rotation. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The machine also works your abs, though it’s not the most direct or effective ab workout."

      "content": "TRMs strengthen your core and improve your posture. Your abs and obliques are the primary muscles of your body’s core, and working them can have great effects on your entire body. Having stronger obliques can relieve lower back pain, improve posture and balance, and make your core stronger overall. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the machine to your height and preferred weight. Before you start, it’s vital to calibrate the machine so you don’t hurt yourself. Take a seat (or kneel on the pads, depending on the machine’s design), and adjust the seat’s height so that you can comfortably reach the appropriate pads and handles. [4] X Research source With most machines, you want your chest to be level with the front pads if the machine has them. Set the weight low to begin with and adjust it as needed. When using the machine, you should feel a good amount of resistance without exerting too much effort. Torso rotation machines come in many different configurations, so it’s good to familiarize yourself with the machine’s parts first. There’s often a sign or label on the machine that explains this. On some machines, you may need to adjust the direction of the machine with a pin. Other machines accommodate both twist directions at once."

      "title": "Rotate your torso to the end of its range, then return slowly.",
      "content": "Rotate your torso to the end of its range, then return slowly. Most torso machines have you swivel your upper body. Grasp the machine’s handles, and make sure you’re sitting straight with your back, chest, or both against the appropriate pads if they’re present. Then, slowly twist your torso in one direction until you can’t anymore, then slowly return to the starting position. [5] X Research source Don’t overexert yourself! Twist only as far as is comfortable, and stop twisting as soon as you feel your body approach its limit. Usually, you’ll want your elbows and knees at a 90-degree angle when sitting in the machine. Again, this may vary with the machine’s design. Some machines keep your torso stationary while your lower body moves. Others have you twist your torso until it’s straight, then return to a contorted position. In any case, the principles are the same."

      "content": "Do 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps for each side of your body. When using the machine, twist in 1 direction at a time—to the left or to the right. Each set, perform 10-12 reps per direction. [6] X Research source Aim for 2-3 sets per workout. Remember to keep the motion of your body slow, steady, and controlled at all times."

      "title": "Yes, a torso rotation machine effectively works your obliques.",
      "content": "Yes, a torso rotation machine effectively works your obliques. Studies show that using a torso rotation machine regularly, about 2 times a week, effectively strengthens your obliques, abs, and core. [7] X Research source That said, you’ll probably hear differing opinions from fitness enthusiasts, who say there are more effective workouts. Ultimately, fitness is personal, and so it’s up to you! If the TRM is comfortable and easy to operate for you, then it’s a good choice, but feel free to explore other workouts, too. However, you may risk injury if you’re not careful. Like any fitness equipment, proper form and knowing your limits are key. If you misuse the machine, you may end up injuring your hips or spine, which the machine engages. When using the torso machine, stay within your limits, move slowly and steadily, and stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort."

      "content": "Standing Weighted Twist This exercise is like using a TRM without the TRM. Simply hold a medicine ball or a comfortable weight in both hands in front of you, with your elbows bent and forearms parallel to the ground. Then, keeping your hips straight, swivel your torso 90 degrees to the side, then back to starting position, then 90 degrees to the other side, and back. [9] X Research source Keep your feet slightly wider than shoulder width, and your spine straight. Do 2 sets of 15 reps."

Take your position in the chair, using your arms to hold your body off the floor with your back flat against the backrest. Slowly raise 1 knee so that your leg makes a 90-degree angle with your hips. Then, while lowering the knee, raise the other one, like you’re pedaling a bicycle. [10] X Research source Lift each knee 15-30 times, and do this workout twice."
