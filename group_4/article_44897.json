      "content": "Christopher Smith offers 3 possible interpretations of the film. The director of the film was adamant that all of the ambiguity in the film is intentional. He didn't want to have a defining twist that might please some people but disappoint others. In an interview with indieLondon the year the film came out, he provided 3 equally legitimate understandings of the film: [1] X Research source The Bermuda Triangle: It's a weird Bermuda Triangle story. All of the timey-wimey weirdness can be attributed to the supernatural reputation of the Bermuda Triangle. Insanity: Jess is suffering from a mental illness, such as schizophrenia (which is also alluded to in the movie), or she's having a nervous breakdown. She's dissociating and may also be hallucinating. Coma: Jess was in a car accident and didn't die, but is in a coma. Her damaged brain is trying to make sense of what happened and where her son is. All of the loops are dreams in her head as it tries to process the trauma."

      "content": "Smith encourages fans to think about and analyze the film. There are so many symbols and themes to choose from in the movie that it can become like a treasure hunt as you pick it apart. In one online interview, Smith noted that he was going for the kind of intellectually satisfied feeling you get when you're still thinking about a movie days after the fact. [2] X Research source He has also indicated that he's delighted to hear new fan theories. [3] X Research source It's important to keep in mind that even though you can consider the 3 interpretations above \"canon,\" in the sense that they were all intended by the director, the director has also made clear that none of them are definitive, nor are they the only possible interpretations. Smith has also left many questions open to interpretation and without any true or intended answer, such as why Jess even had to deal with this loop situation in the first place, when did the loop start, and what really happened to Tommy."

      "title": "The end of the movie reveals the source of the main time loop.",
      "content": "The end of the movie reveals the source of the main time loop. When the driver appears, both Jess and you realize that he's not \"normal.\" He can see Jess, but it's likely that the other bystanders can't see either of them. The driver takes Jess to the harbor as she requested, securing her promise that she'll return. It's her violation of that promise that sets the main time loop, the death loop, in motion. If Jess chooses to keep her promise to the driver and return to the taxi, she will die (or perhaps awake from a coma), and all of the time loops will cease to exist. By choosing to go sailing with Greg, Jess is returning to the Aeolus loop. When she breaks the Aeolus loop, she ends up back in the death loop. The film leaves it as an open question whether Jess is deliberately choosing to return to the loop. Jess briefly falls asleep in the taxi, which means she could have forgotten everything that happened before (and there's nothing that follows after to suggest otherwise). This open question is important for a lot of the interpretations of the film."

      "title": "Triangle",
      "content": "Triangle deals with heavy themes of trauma, punishment, and fate. The very nature of a time loop suggests that very little is actually in your control as an individual. When you couple that reality with feelings of guilt and shame, the whole cycle becomes an earned punishment for the trauma Jess put her son through. Here are some other themes you can follow through the movie: Memory: Jess's memories become more unreliable the more cycles she passes through the time loop, calling reality into question Time: The existence of a time loop challenges the notion that time is linear Motherhood: Jess always sees her duty as to her son and feels guilty for doing something for herself Fate: Jess's inability to stop specific time loop events from happening suggests humans have less free will than they think Trauma: Jess's experiences in the time loop are a manifestation of the trauma her brain experienced during the accident"

She seems to be everywhere at once, gathering laundry, cleaning some spilled paint. She hears a knock at the door and stands, inadvertently wiping paint on her dress. When she answers the door, no one's there. Back inside, Jess stuffs the paint-stained dress in a duffle bag and zips it up. She's wearing different clothes, leaving it open for you to assume that she simply changed clothes off-camera. Outside at the clothesline, she notices seagulls flying overhead and a sailboat overturned in a wading pool before going inside to get her son. On the fridge inside, Jess looks at a sticky note with the name \"Greg\" along with the words \"The Triangle,\" \"Harbor,\" and the time \"8:30.\" There doesn't seem to be any recognition. In the next scene, she's loading up the trunk. Pay attention to the camera angles in these opening scenes. When you see Tommy painting through the window, for example, you're looking through Jess's eyes. Notice how she really does seem to be everywhere at once."

When Jess arrives, she seems really off but says she's just tired. She seems a little confused about everyone's questions and gives mysterious responses. She meets the rest of Greg's friends, and they all sail off together. Jess soon drifts off to sleep. The sailing party consists of: Greg : skipper of The Triangle and regular customer of Jess's at the diner where she works Sally: friend of Greg's who he briefly dated in 8th grade Downey: Sally's husband, also a childhood friend of Greg's Heather: a friend of Sally's who Sally wants to set Greg up with Jess: a single mother with an autistic son who works at a diner and has been invited to go sailing by one of her customers. You don't realize this at this point in the movie, but this Jess is not the Jess from the start of the film, the one who spilled blue paint on her dress."

But then she blinks again and she's on a bed in Greg's boat, The Triangle. Victor, who had previously said he didn't think Jess was okay, tells Greg that when he asked her where her little boy was, she said she couldn't remember. Sally judges Jess pretty harshly and reveals that she has some rather close-minded views about people with disabilities. Her friend Heather tries to get her to empathize, but Sally is convinced that Jess is just after Greg's money. But keep in mind that Jess never sees this conversation take place. Greg tells Jess that he came into the diner where she works the day before to invite her to go sailing with him. She doesn't remember. Jess seems tired and disoriented, but that makes sense given she's just woken up from a nap. She's trying to make sense of where she is and what's going on around her."

Water floods into the hull, and the wind captures the mast, tossing the ship upside down. The storm disappeared as quickly as it came up. Heather doesn't surface, but everyone scrambles aboard the upturned boat. Jess seems concerned and in shock afterward (who wouldn't be). Greg presumably assumes she's thinking about her son and mentions the fact that he's at school, and says he'll be alright until they get back. Although you don't know it at the time, the boat is the only location in the movie where there is only one Jess present."

Jess feels extreme dejà vû as she and Greg explore the ship and she argues with Greg about it. Downey and Victor talk about the ship, noting it was built in 1932, and discuss the mythology related to its namesake. It's revealed that the ship was named for Aeolus, who in Greek mythology was the father of Sisyphus, a demigod who was punished for cheating death. Victor asks what time it is. Greg says 11:30, but Jess notices that her watch has stopped at 8:17. They eat food in the ballroom, then see someone and chase after them. Greg opens the door of Room 237 to reveal \"Go to theater\" written in what appears to be blood on the mirror.

Greg has been shot and claims that Jess shot him. Then shots ring out, and the hooded figure pokes over the ledge of a balcony. Pay attention to the vantage points you are shown by the camera as the group moves about the ship. Remember that the camera is typically showing you the scene through Jess's eyes. You might also notice that it's not clear how Sally and Downey know that they're supposed to go to the theater.

The figure in the hood was a time loop version of Jess. She has returned to the time loop. She has always been in the time loop. But this Jess doesn't realize she is in the time loop. Jess is replaying the events in her head, struggling to process and make sense of it all. Everything feels so intensely familiar—the truth seems so close she can taste it."

She hears a commotion outside, and when she goes back to the deck, she sees herself and her friends on the capsized boat, calling for help. Looking down, she becomes the hooded figure that she had looked up at from the capsized boat (and that new Jess is now looking up at). The same basic events and conversations repeat, just as when she boarded the ship, with the new copies. Jess now understands that she's in a time loop. She sees the notes on the floor that she's tried to leave for future cycles of herself, telling her to kill everyone on board. Despite seeing all of these notes, she writes another one. She can't stop herself from doing this. The locket gives you another glimpse of the power of the loop. Her locket nearly falls down a grate, but she grabs it just in time. She sighs as she sees the piles of lockets that had fallen below, only for her locket to slip through her fingers and also fall. These small incidents let Jess (and you) know that there are certain events in the loop that Jess cannot change, no matter what she does. Jess also tries to let new Victor in on the secret of the time loop. He doesn't believe her, and they get into a bit of a confrontation about it. Jess pushes new Victor up against a wall, not seeing the spike that would impale new Victor in the skull. Recall that when Victor tried to attack Jess, he had a puncture wound in his skull that she was able to use to get away from him."

She believes she has changed the pattern and enabled their escape. At the same time, Jess realizes she still has to kill everyone on the ship. She just can't let the new people get on board. She entices new Downey and new Sally to Room 237, saying she knows how to escape, but once there, she stabs them. So now you know where the blood came from to paint the message on the mirror."

Jess realizes this has happened many times before and is starting to feel a little guilty about putting all of these people through all of this. She wraps her sweater around new Sally to stanch the bleeding from her wounds and promises her she'll return. Notice that all of the other Sallys have identical sweaters wrapped around them. This is another time loop event that Jess can't change. When new Sally dies and Jess hears another round of shouting, she realizes that the cycle repeats when everyone else is dead."

Because Jess is on one of the upper decks with Sally, she can't get down to the lower deck before the group from the capsized boat boards the ship again. She looks down and sees 2 other Jesses fighting. She realizes that there are multiple versions of her on the ship because she doesn't have to die for the Aeolus time loop to repeat. She looks down the stairs at the group boarding and overhears a conversation. You were shown this same angle when you saw Jess board the ship. Every camera angle on the ship is on a Jess. Because the main events of the Aeolus loop will always happen, you can very generally tell which Jess you're dealing with by what little things happened differently in the cycles that you've seen. For example, one Jess has blood on her face while another doesn't. There's only ever one hooded Jess at a time. The hooded Jess is the one who will go overboard. But there's no way of knowing how many cycles it takes to get to a Jess who will be able to put the pieces together enough to become hooded Jess. At this point in the film, you might also realize that every time other people interact with Jess, they're not necessarily interacting with the same Jess they boarded the ship with. This also explains why Jess always seems so confused whenever anyone talks to her."

After the horrible ordeal of the time loop—which Jess believes is real, and she has escaped—she can come home to her son. Recall, though, that there were things that happened before Jess awoke on the shore before. When Jess awoke on the shore previously in the movie, she was in a dream. When she blinked, she was on Greg's boat.

She throws the bird over onto the shore and sees piles of rotting seagull carcasses there. Now Jess knows she has not, in fact, made it out of the loop. She rushes back to the car, convinced that the best thing to do is to get as far away from the harbor area as she can. At this point, Jess doesn't know what the pattern of this loop is or what she has to do to break it.

He tells her there's nothing that could bring back the boy, then asks if she wants a ride and she tells him to take her to the harbor. At this point, what she's doing is intentionally choosing to re-enter the loop. The driver, who she figures must somehow be \"in on\" everything, tells her that her son can't be saved, but she knows that he can. She knows that she can have a few more minutes with him—all she has to do is go back and \"beat the loop\" again. It's safe to assume that none of the bystanders can see either Jess or the driver.

This theory posits that the entire concept of a time loop is designed to force Jess to deal with a horrific version of the sameness and routine Tommy craved. The idea of this being a very personal punishment that's related in some way to her offense of being an abusive mother to a disabled child lines up with the structure of the Sisyphus myth as well.

She will only escape the loops entirely and permanently when she's willing to finally accept that her son is dead. You can see this in the fact that ppl around Jess frequently ask her questions about her son, seemingly out of the blue. They are giving her an opportunity to accept his death, which she never does. If at any point she had replied when someone asked about her son and told them that he was dead, would the whole thing have ceased to exist?

[9] X Research source For example, the room on the ship where the message is written on the mirror in blood is Room 237, the same room number as in The Shining . The ship's halls are also reminiscent of the hallways in The Stanley Hotel, where the story of The Shining took place. It's also worth noting that a time cycle, by definition, requires you to go through a loop of the same events, trying to escape but ultimately repeating the same cycle. This alone might be proof of insanity—as Albert Einstein once said, \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\" [10] X Research source"

She feels guilty for spending time away from her son and, when she's trapped in the loop and doesn't realize it, she's worried about getting back to it. Then, it's guilt that drives her back to save her son, and guilt that overtakes her and makes her kill the version of herself in the paint-stained dress, the version of her who yelled at her son and slapped him. From the guilt standpoint, you might see the gauntlet of the Aeolus loop as a sort of penance she must fulfill before she can be with her son again. The idea of the whole thing being a guilt trip falls under the theory that all of this is somehow happening in Jess's head, because for that to be the reason, she has to be the only character with any true agency."

Jess's interaction with the driver happens after she (or her soul) gets out of the car after the accident. She promises to come back, but she breaks that promise, returning to the loop. Once in the loop, she forgets what she's uncovered about the loop and only wants to get back to her son. Figuring out how to get back to her son means figuring out about the time loops and uncovering the truth about how she treated her son shortly before the accident. In one sense, you can imagine her motivations continually cycling, just like the loop itself, keeping everything enclosed in an infinite loop."
