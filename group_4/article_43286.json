      "content": "Look for a notification. If you have push notifications enabled for Snapchat, you'll see \" Name took a screenshot!\" pop up on your phone's screen when someone screenshots one of your Snaps. If you don't have notifications enabled, you can still see if someone screenshotted your Snap other ways (detailed below). If you want to enable Snapchat notifications, learn how in this wikiHow article ."

      "content": "Look for a chat icon of two overlapping arrows. The screenshot icon is a right-facing arrow outline over the top of a left-facing arrow that displays to the left of a contact's name. You'll also see \"Screenshot\" followed by the time it was screenshotted (or the day of the week) listed below the icon. The icon color simply refers to what type of Snap it was. A red icon means the Snap had no audio, a purple icon means the Snap had audio, and a blue icon means a screenshot was taken of your chat. If you see any of the following icons, a screenshot was not taken: [1] X Research source Filled-in arrow: You sent a Snap that hasn't been opened yet. Arrow outline: You sent a Snap that has been opened. Filled-in square: You have an unopened Snap. Square outline: You've read but not replied to this Snap. Circular arrow: Your Snap was replayed."

      "content": "Open the chat to look for a message in your chat. If someone screenshots your chat, there will be a message in the chat that says \" Name took a screenshot of chat!\" in small gray letters. This message will be displayed even if you take a screenshot of the chat."

      "content": "View your recent activity to see if a friend screenshotted your Story. To do this, swipe down from the top of your screen on the main camera screen. This will open recent activity with your account, including if a friend took a screenshot of your Story. [2] X Research source If there has been a lot of activity, the screenshot message may get pushed down and off the activity feed. Some users have reported that this method doesn't work 100% of the time. Snapchat does not notify you if someone who isn't your friend screenshots your Story, but the fact that your Story was screenshotted will show up in your insights."

      "title": "Is there a way to take screenshots of Snaps without notifying someone?",
      "content": "Is there a way to take screenshots of Snaps without notifying someone? There are a few ways this is possible: By using a rooted/jailbroken phone and using a tool to download your Snaps directly. Jailbreaking isn't recommended, so it's best not to try this unless you know what you're doing. By using a third-party app that can save or download Snaps. By using another phone or camera to take a photo of the Snap. For example, if you're using Snapchat on an iPad, you can use your iPhone camera to take a photo of the Snap."

      "content": "Is there any way to see who screenshotted my Story? If someone who isn't your friend screenshots your Story, there is no way to see who exactly did this. The most you can do is see in your analytics that your Story was screenshotted. Snapchat used to offer this feature previously, but it is no longer part of the app."
