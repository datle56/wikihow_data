      "content": "Identify the kind of burn you have. There are three kinds of burns you can get on your skin. Each type requires a different kind of treatment, so you’ll need to be sure what you have before doing anything else. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source First-degree burns are the most common and least serious. These are minor burns that you can treat yourself. A first-degree burn will have redness, swelling, and pain. [2] X Expert Source Indy Chabra, MD, PhD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 10 March 2022. If the burn involves most of your face, though, treat it more seriously and get emergency medical help. Second-degree burns are more serious, and your treatment will depend on the size of the burn. A second-degree burn may have red, white, or splotchy skin, swelling, pain, and blisters. If the burn is 3 inches or smaller, you can treat it like a minor burn. If it is larger, treat like a major burn and get medical help immediately. Third-degree burns are the most serious, and involve burning off all the skin and underlying fat. The area may be charred black or white. If you have a third-degree burn, you may also experience difficulty breathing, carbon monoxide poisoning, or other toxic effects from smoke inhalation. You probably won’t get a third-degree burn from a curling iron, but it is something you should be aware of."

      "content": "Cool the burn. Running water is not recommended for any burn, as it can damage the swollen, injured skin and increase blistering/scarring. However, you can hold a cool, clean wet cloth on the burn for 5 minutes to help cool it down. [3] X Research source The water should be cool, not cold, so avoid ice or cold water. Water is the best choice for cleaning. Irritants like harsh soap, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and alcohol will probably only delay healing, making a scar more likely."
