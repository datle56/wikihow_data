Most International departures take off from the unconnected Terminal 5. There is a connection using the ATS (airport monorail) and the rest of the airport, but you'd have to exit on the unticketed side first before entering the other buildings."

      "content": "Learn about the Rainbow Walkway. Terminal 1 has one of the most picturesque bridges between its buildings. However, you'll have to take escalators to get you down there to cross between the two terminal buildings through a mile-long \"bridge\" that most people consider picture and video-worthy (due to its rainbow-lights of Neon tubes which seem to waver). From the C gates, you'll find it near the United Customer Service Center across from the C18 and C18A gates. From the B gates (in the other building, described momentarily), you'll find this between the B8 and B9 gates across from Starbucks and Oakley. Many people have traveled this, and some even stopped to submit this journey to YouTube. If you want to see this, type \"rainbow walkway at ORD,\" and you'll pull up several from different people at different times."

Gates B22-B24 extend a little further at the easternmost edge down the same walkway. Once you get past B18 and B19, the terminal curves to include gates facing North, but the B21 through B24 gates face east."

At first, this hallway connects terminals on one side with gates starting with E, and on the other side starts gate letters with F. Learn about the divergence point. Near a McDonalds, the two lettered gates split and create two separate sets of gates housed with a short walking path between the two near a Delta Sky Club and United Club entrance. Starting at E4, gates are numbered in a straight path terminating towards the one end at E16 (in even-numbered intervals), then coming up the other side with E17 following back towards the Sky Club near E7 in odd-numbered intervals. Going down the F gated side, at first, you'll see F4 followed by F5 and F6, but then at the split, it begins with F7 and F9 and all the odd-numbered intervals on the eastern side until you reach F27. At the endpoint, you'll see gates F28, F26, and F24, but then on the opposite side, you'll see the even numbers heading back towards F10 in even-numbered intervals, stopping gates on that side as you reach the United Club."

Terminal 2 is rectangular, with the walkway corridor edging more southward and around a centrally-placed atrium/foyer near the Security Checkpoint. It would be best if you turned right to enter Terminal 2 (from the walkway from Terminal 1) and walk past the long corridor up and towards the Rotunda. The Rotunda is part of Terminal 3 but will get you back on track if you need to ask an airport employee for help navigating to your destination. This can be the trickiest part of this terminal - getting into Terminal 3 without going out the exit. The walkway corridor is super close to the exit from Terminal 2, and you'll need to follow instructions carefully when things get trickier."

Although K1 is along the main corridor walkway nearest the terminal exit, the next four gates along the K gated sides run consecutively named (K2-K5), which they then split. (There is no K7, yet numbering can be confusing running along the northeastern-pointing side of the terminal's Y shape. You'll have K9, then K15, and K15, but you'll see K19, K20, K18, and K16 all in one corner at the farthest end of this building. (At the edge, you'll see that K further splits and rounds to the K16, and K18 aide just near the Starbucks, Brioche Doree, BJ's Market and Bakery, and Facades Bar.)

The first set of L gates you'll encounter directly on the corridor walkway are generally labeled with A, B, and/or C designations facing south (even-numbered) from L2A/L2B/L2C to L10A/L10B/L10C, with odd-numbers on the opposite side from L1-L9 without the extra sub-gate information. However, if you continue and head towards the additions, just past the last exit in the corner of the terminal, you'll spot signage to get you to the other portion of the terminal, which is in a brand new building just a teensy bit from the main corridor's walkway. Between the two gates, there are no gates labeled L11-L19!"

All gates are facing south on one side as of right now, but because of other buildings in the way, there probably won't be any gates on the other side any time soon. On the opposite side, there are sparing choices of dining (Burger Federation and Starbucks. You will also find a connecting shuttle back to terminal 1 at the farthest end of this gate, with no gates to the other terminals from here."
