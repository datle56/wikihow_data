If you notice thinning hair around your temples and the beginnings of an exposed scalp the next time you’re in clear lighting, you may be developing a receding hairline. If you’ve noticed your scalp becoming more sensitive to the sun, it may be due to a diminishing amount of hair."

That said, if you notice clumps of hair falling out while brushing, on your pillow, or in the drain, you may be developing a receding hairline and/or male pattern baldness. Though other factors such as stress, weight loss, or a lack of sleep can cause hair loss, excessive shedding is one of the most common signs of a receding hairline.

      "content": "Male pattern hair loss Either biological sex can develop a receding hairline or androgenic alopecia, also known as male pattern baldness (MPB) or female pattern baldness (FPB). [6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source That said, men are more likely to develop this condition with age, particularly if hair loss runs in the family. High dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels are another significant contributing factor in male & female pattern baldness and a receding hairline. DHT can shrink hair follicles, alter growth cycles, and cause hair to not grow past a certain length. For example, if you noticed your biological father’s hairline receding with age, you’re likely predisposed to androgenic alopecia and may develop a receding hairline yourself."

By prematurely forcing our hair follicles into the telogen (shedding) phase of the hair growth cycle, your follicles are more likely to fall out around 2-3 months after a stressful event, such as having a child or the loss of a loved one and may last for about 6 months.

      "content": "Hairlines typically recede in 7 stages. To determine which stage of hair loss you’re at, a board-certified dermatologist will assess your symptoms based on the 7-stage Norwood scale, which can be described as the following: [12] X Research source Stage 1: The hairline begins to recede gradually at and around the temples. Stage 2: Hairline recession becomes exaggerated at the temples, resembling an “M,” “U,” or “V” shape. Stage 3: Hair loss at the center of the forehead becomes more visible and pronounced. Stage 4: A bald spot begins to form at the crown of the head. Stage 5: The hair around your temples recedes further as the bald spot at the crown increases, resulting in a thin strip of hair between these areas. Stage 6: Hair loss around the crown, and the temples begin to connect. Stage 7: Hair loss at the top of the scalp becomes easily visible, as only a band of hair remains around the head, also known as a “hoop.”"
