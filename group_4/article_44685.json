Sound generators drown out ringing and buzzing with white noise, relaxing sounds, or soft music. Options include small, in-ear devices, headphones, and white noise machines. You could also try using household items, such as an air conditioner, air purifier, fan, or a television on low volume. [3] X Research source Although sound therapy doesn’t cure tinnitus, it could make your symptoms less noticeable, improve your concentrate, and help you fall asleep. Medical-grade sound therapy devices can be expensive, and aren’t covered by insurance plans. If you need a more affordable solution, find environmental sounds or soft, relaxing music on music or video streaming services. Stable, neutral sounds, such as white noise (which sounds like a steady “Shhh”), are more effective than sounds with varying intensities, such as waves.
