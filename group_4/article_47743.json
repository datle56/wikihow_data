      "title": "“Well said” means you approve of what someone said and how they phrased it.",
      "content": "“Well said” means you approve of what someone said and how they phrased it. It’s a phrase that compliments someone on their articulate or thoughtful way of speaking. For example, if someone explained a project very clearly and concisely at a meeting, you might say “Well said!” to show you thought they spoke in an easy-to-understand, audience-appropriate manner. [1] X Research source It’s like saying “You spoke well” or “You articulated that well.” Saying “Well said” implies that you generally agree with the points the person is making, too. It would sound strange to reply with “Well said!” after someone makes a point that you don’t agree with."

    {
      "title": "Yes, “well said” is a grammatically correct phrase.",
      "content": "Yes, “well said” is a grammatically correct phrase. In this phrase, “said” is a verb in the past tense (meaning a thought or idea was spoken aloud previously) and “well” is an adverb that describes how the thought or idea was said. It may help to think of this phrase as a shortened version of a fuller sentence, “That was well said.” Phrases like “well say” or “well saying” are grammatically incorrect, and also sound awkward in English."

      "title": "Say “Well said” after someone speaks to express your approval.",
      "content": "Say “Well said” after someone speaks to express your approval. When a person has finished speaking on a topic (especially a complicated one), chime in with “Well said” to let them know you admire the way they articulated their thoughts and approve of their ideas or statements. “Well said” means more when someone is communicating something very difficult to put into words, like deep emotions or really niche topics that most people wouldn’t understand easily without prior knowledge. Them: “...and that’s why we’ll have to modify our marketing budget in order to hit our ticket sale goals.” You: “Well said! Thanks for explaining those numbers so clearly.” Them: “Basically, the pilgrimage to Canterbury in The Canterbury Tales is an allegory of the journey from earth to heaven.” You: “That was very well said. I can tell you understood the reading very thoroughly!”"

      "content": "Offer “Well said” to give a compliment to someone who spoke before you. You don’t always have to say “Well said!” immediately after someone speaks. You can offer your feedback to them later or, if you’re both speaking to large groups, share how much you enjoyed their speaking with the audience. “Hey! Your take on late-stage capitalism in class yesterday was super well said. I was thinking about it all night!” “Our company’s current position on climate change must change, as was so well said by my colleague Jeremy earlier this afternoon.”"

      "title": "Swap “well” with another adverb like “nicely” or “beautifully.”",
      "content": "Swap “well” with another adverb like “nicely” or “beautifully.” An adverb modifies the meaning of the verb in a sentence. [2] X Research source In “Well said,” for example, “well” describes how someone “said” (the verb) something. So, replace “well” with another positive adverb that matches what you feel. Hint—a lot of them end in -ly ! Here are some examples: Nicely said Beautifully said Poetically said Eloquently said Meaningfully said Rightly said Tip: Add “very” before your adverb to up the intensity of your praise. You could say “Very beautifully said” or “Very well said” to show you really liked the way someone said something."

      "content": "Replace “said” with a similar verb like “articulated” or “expressed.” To shake things up more, you can also use a different verb than “said.” There are a lot of different verbs in English to describe the way you say or communicate something, so swap them in from time to time to avoid sounding repetitive or insincere. You can keep “Well” as the adverb, or mix and match new adverbs and verbs to create entirely new statements. For example: [3] X Research source Well put Well articulated Well stated Excellently communicated Beautifully delivered Eloquently expressed Aptly presented Clearly explained"

      "title": "Or, just tell someone what specifically you liked about what they said.",
      "content": "Or, just tell someone what specifically you liked about what they said. You don’t have to stick to the “Well said” formula to compliment someone on their speaking abilities. Point out something specific you enjoyed to show the person you were listening well , understood their message, and took something away from their talk. You can say you “liked” something, or use deeper words like “appreciated,” “identified with,” or “resonated.” For example: “I really liked the way you put your feelings into words.” “I appreciated your choice of words just now. You were very sensitive to the people around you!” “I liked the way you expressed your anger so calmly in that town hall meeting. It was admirable!” “I identified a lot with your story. All the details made me remember similar moments in my life.” “Your speech really resonated with me.”"

      "title": "Reply with a simple “Thank you” when someone tells you “Well said.”",
      "content": "Reply with a simple “Thank you” when someone tells you “Well said.” Because “Well said” is meant as praise, you can just say something like “Thank you” or “I appreciate that” to accept the compliment . Or, if you’d like to continue the conversation, you could also reply with something more specific or personal, like “I’m glad you understood what I was trying to say,” or “That’s great to hear because I struggle to articulate my points sometimes.”"

      "title": "Something well said is usually concise, clear, and targeted to the listeners.",
      "content": "Something well said is usually concise, clear, and targeted to the listeners. Opinions vary on what exactly makes for good speech, but there are several factors that most people agree make for easy-to-understand communication. These include things like: [4] X Research source You don’t over-explain. You recognize the knowledge your listeners have and don’t explain things that they already know. You have a main point. You may touch on multiple topics, but have a primary concern, idea, or information you want your listeners to take away and understand. You know your audience. You speak in a way that your listeners can relate to or understand easily. Using complex language and long words may make you well-spoken in a corporate meeting, but not as a preschool teacher, for example. You cut out “fluff” words. You say exactly what you need to say without adding fillers, hedging your language, or providing unrelated information. For instance, “Let’s meet at 2pm for coffee tomorrow” is more direct and concise than “If you have time around 2pm, maybe we could try meeting up for coffee or something.” You highlight important information. You use phrases like “To sum it all up,” “Most importantly,” or “The main issue is” to flag your main points for listeners. You prepare in advance (when possible). You can still be well-spoken when you’re improvising, but you generally know what you’re going to say ahead of time or have spent time thinking about your points before speaking."
