Your employee assistance program might offer free consultations with lawyers. Check the details of your plan. You also could meet with a lawyer for a half-hour of advice.

Because my job requires that I shelve books and boxes above my head, I have been unable to complete a shift since August 16. My enclosed letters from two coworkers explain the details of our job and how I had to leave early two times because I could not complete tasks. I have been out of work since.
