    {
      "title": "Be descriptive.",
      "content": "Be descriptive. This first rule is the most important. Tell the reader exactly what is going on in the picture or figure. Why exactly are you including this image? The reader should be able to answer that after reading your caption. [2] X Research source For instance, if you’re including a picture of a field in a paper about biology, your caption should tell why the field is important to your discussion."

      "title": "If you are describing a table or graph, talk about variables.",
      "content": "If you are describing a table or graph, talk about variables. What does each side of the bar graph represent? Your reader should have enough information from the caption, the key, and the graph to be able to make sense of it without reading your paper. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Save humor for elsewhere.",
      "content": "Save humor for elsewhere. Unless you are writing a humorous paper that includes humorous graphics, generally captions are better left serious due to the need for conciseness."

    {
      "title": "Keep it concise.",
      "content": "Keep it concise. That is, it should be no longer than a paragraph, but really, a sentence should be sufficient, at most. In fact, captions don’t even need to be complete sentences. For a photograph, it’s okay to make it shorter than a sentence, such as “Kayley on the Ferris wheel.” [4] X Trustworthy Source University of North Carolina Writing Center UNC's on-campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students, faculty, and others during the writing process Go to source"

      "content": "Remove anything that isn’t strictly necessary. For instance, the above caption could have said “Kayley waves her hand on the giant green Ferris wheel,” but the extra information that provides isn’t necessary for the reader to understand what’s going on in the picture.
