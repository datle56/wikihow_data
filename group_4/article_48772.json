      "title": "Smelly septum piercings are caused by a buildup of organic material.",
      "content": "Smelly septum piercings are caused by a buildup of organic material. During healing, your nose tissue will release sebum (an oily, waxy substance your body produces to keep your skin moisturized). Sebum doesn’t smell by itself, but it can trap dead skin cells, bacteria, or dried blood from your piercing if you’re not cleaning it regularly. [1] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Eventually, this buildup may start to smell. “Septum funk” has a distinctive smell that some people describe as cheesy or like a foot, although it varies from person to person. Don’t worry about other people smelling your piercing. It’s obvious to you because it’s in your nose, but the “septum funk” doesn’t waft very far. Unless your piercing is infected, the smell will go away with regular cleaning or after the piercing is fully healed."

      "content": "Clean your septum piercing twice a day until it’s fully healed. Spray every exposed part of the jewelry with sterile saline spray or soak a clean cotton pad in saline or piercing care solution and hold it to the piercing for 5 minutes to clean it . Then, rinse your piercing and the inside of your nose—just cup some warm (not hot) water in your hands and blow bubbles in it with your nose for 15 seconds. Try to rotate or twist the jewelry a few times while it’s wet to keep it from sticking to your skin. [2] X Research source After your piercing heals, continue to clean it once a day (or at least a few times a week) to prevent further smells or infection. [3] X Research source If you need saline in a pinch, make your own at home (mix ¼ tsp (1.5 g) of sea salt dissolved in 8 fl oz (240 mL) of boiled water). Avoid hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or rubbing alcohol for cleaning. These harsh chemicals will kill healthy, new cells and slow down your healing."

      "title": "Keep your septum piercing dry outside of cleaning and showering.",
      "content": "Keep your septum piercing dry outside of cleaning and showering. Steer clear of pools, hot tubs, and lakes or rivers, especially while your piercing is healing. Try to avoid excessive splashing in the bath or shower as well. The water contains microorganisms that can irritate or infect your piercing, leading to a stronger or longer-lasting smell. The drier the piercing, the faster it will heal (and stop smelling). [4] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Think of your piercing like an open wound. You wouldn’t want it to be soaked for long periods of time! Generally, the older a piercing is, the better it holds up in water."

      "title": "Keep makeup, sunscreen, and other facial products out of the piercing.",
      "content": "Keep makeup, sunscreen, and other facial products out of the piercing. Apply your moisturizers and cosmetics very carefully around your nose and upper lip. When products linger on your piercing, they can cause inflammation or infection (which can smell), or they can combine with your sebum buildup and make odorous buildup smell even worse. [5] X Research source If you do get makeup or lotion on your piercing, rinse out your nose with water and spray the piercing with saline. Don’t use your new piercing as a reason not to apply sunscreen, though. A burn on your nose could irritate a new piercing and slow down healing."

      "content": "Take out your jewelry and wash it if your piercing is fully healed. If the smell persists or comes back once your septum is healed, remove the jewelry and sterilize it by boiling it in water or soaking it in saline for 5 minutes. If there’s crusty buildup stuck to it, wash it with hot water and antibacterial soap until all debris is gone. [6] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Rinse the jewelry thoroughly if you used saline or soap on it. Allow the jewelry to air dry or wipe it down with a fresh paper towel. Avoid cloths or towels, since the fabric can hold bacteria and transfer it to the jewelry. Always wash your hands before handling and removing your jewelry. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Touch your piercing as little as possible whether it’s healing or old. Try not to handle your septum piercing (especially while it heals) outside of cleaning it, changing it , or flipping it up to hide it . When you do have to touch it, wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap for at least 20 seconds beforehand. Germs from your fingers are the #1 cause of piercing infections and irritation, which can lead to piercing odor. [8] X Research source Try not to pick at any scabs or crust that form during healing, either. Some crusting is normal and can be rinsed away with saline or saltwater. The less you touch your piercing, the faster it will heal (and the less likely it is to start smelling)."

      "title": "Your septum piercing may smell on and off for 2-3 months while it heals.",
      "content": "Your septum piercing may smell on and off for 2-3 months while it heals. The sebum buildup is more pronounced when the piercing is fresh and will eventually stop forming as the piercing ages and heals (although it can come back after healing, like if the jewelry snags on something and reopens the wound). For many people, full healing takes 2-3 months, though some people heal after just a few weeks while others may take up to 6-8 months. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Every person’s body is different, so healing times can vary from individual to individual. How well you clean and protect the piercing affects healing time, too. If your septum piercing goes through the cartilage between your nostrils instead of the softer flesh at the base, healing (and potentially smells) will last longer. Speed up your healing time by consistently getting a good night’s sleep , eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and vitamins, and staying hydrated ."

      "title": "Choose high-quality, implant-grade material for your septum jewelry.",
      "content": "Choose high-quality, implant-grade material for your septum jewelry. For silvery looks, go for titanium , implant-grade stainless steel, or biocompatible white gold jewelry. Choose 14-karat gold , titanium anodized rose gold, or biocompatible yellow jewelry for gold looks. Stay away from cheap jewelry or any pieces that are plated or coated—low-quality metal or coated jewelry can slowly break down in your nose, resulting in odors, irritation, or potentially infection. [10] X Research source Low-quality metals include surgical steel, nickel, copper, brass, or anything coated with those metals. Try wood, bamboo, glass, or silicon jewelry. These tend to smell less than some metals because they don’t interact with your tissue the same way. Wait until your piercing is fully healed before swapping your jewelry. Changing your septum piercing too soon can result in a potentially stinky infection.

      "content": "Look for infection symptoms like swelling, redness, or bleeding. A bad smell alone does not mean your septum piercing is infected. A stinky sebum buildup actually means your piercing is healing normally (the opposite of an infection!). However, a smell that lingers past the 2-3 month healing phase or that’s accompanied by other symptoms may be a sign of infection. Major piercing infection symptoms include: [12] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source Redness or tenderness around the piercing (some tenderness in the days after piercing is normal) Blood or pus oozing from the piercing Swelling The skin around the piercing feels hot and turns very red or dark Shivering, chills, or fever"

      "content": "Clean an infected septum 2-3 times a day and see a doctor if it worsens. Wash the piercing and the skin around it with saline or saltwater at least twice a day (morning and night). Make sure any crustiness is cleared away so the wound can drain easily and bacteria don’t get trapped in the piercing. If the infection spreads or worsens after several days of home treatment, visit a doctor for antibiotics. [13] X Research source Antibiotics may be necessary for severe infections or infections in cartilage, which are harder to treat than other piercing infections. Do not remove your piercing, even if you suspect it’s infected. If the hole closes up while you have an infection, the infection can get trapped inside your body."
