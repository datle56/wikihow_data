      "title": "Consider taking the elevator.",
      "content": "Consider taking the elevator. If you see escalators, chances are there is a lift nearby. It may be positioned between the escalators, directly next to an escalator, or in the corner or center of the building. Elevators are designed to carry wheeled vehicles including strollers with minimal risk of injury. Only use the escalator if there are no other options for transporting your stroller between floors. The American Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination based on disability and so requires all buildings to be made accessible to persons with disabilities. Because of this, you will find shuttles that can carry people in wheelchairs, but not strollers."

      "title": "Tuck in everything hanging down.",
      "content": "Tuck in everything hanging down. Straps, shoelaces, and anything hanging down can get caught in the escalator, potentially causing a disaster. Make sure to tie shoes, buckle straps, and to pull up anything that’s hanging down before getting on the escalator."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strap your kid into the stroller.",
      "content": "Strap your kid into the stroller. If your stroller comes with safety straps like a harness, make sure your kid is strapped in before entering the escalator, regardless of their age. This step is especially important when you're going down, as you'll be tipping the stroller forward as you go down."

    {
      "title": "Put the bags away.",
      "content": "Put the bags away. Dangling bags off a stroller can also get caught in an escalator. Either tuck them underneath or pack them away in your purse or pocket if it’s possible."

      "title": "Check to make sure that you have some space.",
      "content": "Check to make sure that you have some space. If the escalator is especially crowded, wait a few minutes for it to clear out. You want to have enough space to maneuver on the escalator safely."

    {
      "title": "Pick up the front wheels.",
      "content": "Pick up the front wheels. As you enter an up escalator, lift the front wheels over the comb-plate (the start of the escalator). Continue pushing forward with the wheels up. Let the front wheels rest on a higher step and the back wheels on a lower step. [1] X Research source If you're going down, do the opposite. Let the front wheels rest on lower step and the back wheels rest on a higher step. Also, make sure you step over the comb-plate when entering the escalator, not through it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold on to the stroller.",
      "content": "Hold on to the stroller. Make sure to hold on to the stroller the whole time you are on the escalator. Because it is balanced on two steps, it can easily start moving, especially since the escalator is moving."

      "title": "Push hard when existing.",
      "content": "Push hard when existing. Sometimes, you'll need to give the stroller a hard push as you get off. That way, you'll be sure the back wheels go over the comb-plate."

      "title": "Fold up the stroller as small as possible.",
      "content": "Fold up the stroller as small as possible. Make sure all the straps are tucked inside the folds and not dangling. Also, carry bags in the same hand as a stroller if possible, so you have a hand to grab the rail."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put one person in charge of the stroller.",
      "content": "Put one person in charge of the stroller. Try holding it with one hand only so you have a hand to hold on to the handrail. Balance it on one step if possible, pulling it behind you. If you need to balance it on more than one step, push it in front of you. Be sure to lift the wheels over the comb-plate."
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the other person carry the child.",
      "content": "Let the other person carry the child. Also, be sure to hold onto the handrail while carrying your child. Stand in the middle of the escalator, and make sure the kid doesn't stick his or her hands out, as they can get caught."

      "title": "Pay careful attention to the wheels.",
      "content": "Pay careful attention to the wheels. You can't place both sets of wheels on one step. Therefore, make sure you keep the stroller balanced. If you don't pay attention, the stroller could flip on you."

    {
      "title": "Stay in the middle.",
      "content": "Stay in the middle. You are safer in the middle of the escalator and so is your child in the stroller. The middle is safer because hands, shoelaces, and clothing can get caught in the sides of the escalator."

    {
      "title": "Keep both hands on the stroller.",
      "content": "Keep both hands on the stroller. You can lose control of the stroller if you don't do so. With the escalator, it's easier to keep the stroller still with both hands."

      "content": "Watch your own balance. Obviously, you need to hold onto the stroller. Therefore, it's very hard for you to also hold on to the rail. Make sure you stay upright, or you could take you and the stroller down the escalator."

      "title": "Avoid using your phone.",
      "content": "Avoid using your phone. That is, pay attention to what you're doing instead of looking at your phone, texting, calling someone, etc. In addition, holding your phone ties up one hand you should be using for holding the stroller."
