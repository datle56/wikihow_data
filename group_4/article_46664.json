Your ingredients just need to be small enough to fit into the Magic Bullet container, which has a diameter of 4.75 inches (12.1 cm). If you're having trouble getting an even consistency, try cutting your ingredients into 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces."

The first is the Cross Blade for mixing, grating, and puréeing most foods, and the second is the Flat Blade for grinding and chopping harder ingredients like coffee beans or nuts, as well as whipping foods like whipped cream or butter. [2] X Research source If your Magic Bullet came with only one blade, it’s probably the Cross Blade."

However, make sure you never keep the blade running for more than 1 minute at a time, or you can burn out the motor on your Magic Bullet, causing permanent damage. [5] X Research source If you turn the cup clockwise while you’re holding it down on the base, you can put it into “Lock” mode for hands-free blending. To release, turn it counter-clockwise and release the cup. [6] X Research source"

Allow the blade to stop moving completely, then press down again. This is called “pulsing.” Shake the cup if your ingredients are thick. If you’re having trouble with your ingredients clumping in your cup and not reaching the Magic Bullet blade, try shaking the cup. You can either remove the cup from the base and shake it, then replace it on the base, or you can hold the entire assembly securely in 2 hands and shake while you’re pulsing."

[9] X Research source This recipe makes about 1 cup (120 grams) of thin salsa. If you prefer a thicker consistency, drain off some of the liquid.
