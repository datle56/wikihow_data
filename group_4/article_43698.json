In other words, you can go wherever you want to go, experience whatever you want to experience, and achieve whatever you set your mind to. [1] X Research source People often use this phrase to encourage young people to go after their dreams as they transition into adulthood. Here are a few examples of the phrase in sentences: “Congratulations on getting into your dream college!

With the experience you’re going to get in that position, the world will truly be your oyster!” “It’s normal to be stressed about your career in your 20’s. Remember, you’re young, and you have so many paths open to you. The world is your oyster!”"

      "content": "“The world is your oyster” is a metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes one thing by comparing it to another (life is a rollercoaster, laughter is the best medicine, etc). [2] X Research source In this case, the world is being compared to an oyster that has a pearl within. It’s tough to break open the shell of the oyster, but once you do, you reach something beautiful and valuable inside. Similarly, it’s difficult to make your way in the world, but with a little hard work and perseverance, you can achieve and experience amazing things."

      "content": "The phrase comes from Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of Windsor. In the play a character named Sir John Falstaff and another character named Pistol share an exchange about money. Falstaff says, “I will not lend thee a penny,” to which Pistol replies, “Why then, the world’s mine oyster, which I with sword will open.” [3] X Research source In the context of the play, the phrase means that Pistol will get what he wants by any means necessary. If Falstaff won’t give him money, he’ll resort to violence to get it, just like someone would use a knife to pry open an oyster to get to the pearl. [4] X Research source Many people believe that our modern version of the phrase comes from this line, though it has evolved to have more of a positive, inspirational connotation."

      "content": "Be true to yourself and your passions. Living like the world is your oyster means going after what you truly want, even when you're pressured to choose a different path. “Sometimes people think, ‘I can’t do this job–there’s not enough money,’ or ‘I’m going to be looked down upon,’” but this is the wrong mindset, explains Shahbazyan. “The number one most important thing is to sit with your own mind to decide who you want to be, and to not let external stimuli shape who you are,” she says. For example, maybe your parents are pressuring you to pursue a career in medicine, but you’re more interested in law. Or, maybe you want to work in a creative field, but people are telling you this is an unrealistic dream. Whatever your situation, it’s important to remember that this is your life, so your passions and goals should inform your decisions more than other people’s expectations of you. Plus, passion is a key ingredient for success, so you’ll likely reach even more impressive heights when you’re pursuing something you truly care about and enjoy!"

      "content": "Build up your self-confidence. If you’re embarking on a new journey in life, like starting college or moving out of your childhood home, you may be nervous about your ability to cope. To make it through, Shahbazyan recommends reminding yourself that you are strong and capable. “Know that you have all the tools you need in order to succeed,\" says Shahbazyan. \"Most people have a lot more ability than they give themselves credit for, and any problem has a solution.\" Try reciting positive affirmations to increase your confidence in your abilities. You could say something like, “I am a strong, determined, and capable person,” or “I have the ability to succeed, and I’ll persevere until I do.” When you approach life with this go-getting, motivated attitude, the world will truly be your oyster!"

      "content": "Set some goals, and persevere until you achieve them. Once you’ve decided what you’re passionate about, start making a plan to achieve your goals . This usually means breaking up your overarching goal into smaller, do-able steps, then working through the steps methodically. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source For example, if your goal is to become a lawyer, start by breaking this major goal up into smaller stepping stones. The first step might be applying to a university and getting a bachelor’s degree. Then the next step might be taking the LSAT and filling out your law school applications, and so on. Remember, it will likely take some time to crack open the oyster and reach the pearl you're going after, but with a little hard work and determination, there’s nothing you can’t achieve!"
