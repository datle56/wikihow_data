      "content": "Use shampoo and conditioner to clean your beard. Your beard hair builds up natural oils and needs to be maintained to be kept healthy, which means removing dry skin, dirt, and excess oils from it. Use standard shampoo to clean your beard, and rinse it thoroughly. Then, apply conditioner to soften the hairs before you rinse it out as well. [2] X Research source Allow the conditioner to sit in your beard for about 2-3 minutes so the hairs have a chance to absorb it. Make sure you rinse out all of the shampoo and conditioner."

      "title": "Dry your beard thoroughly with a towel.",
      "content": "Dry your beard thoroughly with a towel. Before you apply wax to your beard, it needs to be completely dry for the best results and so it doesn’t take on an oily appearance. Take a clean towel and pat your beard dry with it. [3] X Research source If you prefer to air-dry your beard, wait until it’s completely dry before you add any products to it. Avoid using a blow dryer to dry your beard. The heat and air will strip your beard hairs of their natural oils and will make your beard frizzy."

      "title": "Brush your beard with the grain of the hairs.",
      "content": "Brush your beard with the grain of the hairs. Use a stiff-bristled brush designed for beards to brush the hairs and line them up before you apply the wax. Start at the top of your beard and brush downwards to the ends of the hairs. Then, run the brush upwards from the top of your neck where your beard growth starts up towards your chin and jawline. Brush with smooth, even strokes. [4] X Research source Be sure to brush every section of your beard including your sideburns, mustache, and the undergrowth. Regular brushing will distribute the natural oils in your beard, keeping it healthy and giving it an even shape."
