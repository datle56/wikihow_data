      "content": "Keep your arm straight as much as possible. Don't sit for long periods of time with your elbow bent, and try to avoid repeatedly bending your elbow. Whether this involves setting up your work desk differently, taking frequent breaks from typing, or taking time off from playing tennis, do what you can.

      "title": "Sleep with straight arms.",
      "content": "Sleep with straight arms. Lots of people sleep with their elbows bent. Try not to do this. Wrap a towel around your arm with tape to prevent yourself from bending it while you sleep. Wrap the towel over your elbow while your arm is straight and secure it with tape on both sides of your elbow - loosely enough so you don't cut off circulation, but tightly enough so the towel acts like a splint, keeping your arm straight. If this doesn't work, ask your doctor for a splint that you can wear at night. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Using a rigid splint for your arm is very effective. Be patient, though. If your doctor prescribes a splint, you'll need to wear it for up to 3 months. Talk to your doctor again if you still don't notice any relief after 6 weeks."

      "content": "Avoid the activity that irritated the nerve. If you're aware of what is causing the nerve to get inflamed, stop doing that activity.

Ask your surgeon to discuss the risks and benefits of each, and help you determine which is best for you: Cubital tunnel release: this cuts the ligament that may be restricting your ulnar nerve. Ulnar nerve anterior transposition: this moves the ulnar nerve from its place behind the elbow bone to in front of it, which prevents it from getting caught. Medial epicondylectomy: this removes part of the bone that the ulnar nerve catches on. If there is a tumor or cyst in your elbow that is rubbing on the nerve, surgery can remove it."
