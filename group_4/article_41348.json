      "content": "Accept that you're thinking too much. Just like eating, thinking is something we need to do to survive, so it is sometimes hard to judge when you are doing too much of it. However, there are several red flags that you are doing too much thinking for your own good. Here are a few of them: [1] X Research source Are you consumed by the same thought over and over again? Are you not making progress by thinking about this particular thing? If so, this may be a sign that you should move on. Have you analyzed the same situation from a million angles? If you've found too many ways to look at something before you decide how to act, you may be being counterproductive. Have you enlisted the help of your twenty closest friends in thinking about a particular thing? If so, then it's time to realize that you can only ask for so many opinions about the same idea before you drive yourself insane. Are people constantly telling you to stop over-thinking things? Do people tease you for brooding, being a philosopher, or staring out of rainy windows all the time? If so, they may have a point."

      "content": "Meditate . If you feel like you don't know how to stop thinking, you need to learn what it's like to \"let go\" of your thoughts, so that it's something you can do deliberately.

[2] X Research source Just spending 15-20 minutes meditating every morning can make a dramatic impact on your ability to stay in the present and let go of all of your nagging thoughts. You can also meditate at night to help yourself wind down."

Whether you're writing on paper or a computer, you should first define a problem , write down your options, and then list the pros and cons for each option. Seeing your thoughts in front of you will also help you stop cycling through them in your head. Once you can't think of anything more to write, your mind has done its job, and it's time to stop thinking. [7] X Research source If making a list still doesn't help you make a decision, don't be afraid to follow your intuition . If two or more options seem equally appealing, thinking more will not make things clearer. This is when you should listen to something deeper."

Unless \"brooding\" is on your list of priorities, this will force you to see that you have more important things to do than to sit around pondering the meaning of the universe! The quickest way to organize your thoughts is to put them into something actionable.

If your problem is that you think too much about nothing, worry for no reason, or think about things you can't control, then there's not much you can do to \"solve\" the problems that are plaguing your thoughts. But think of the ones you can solve and make an active plan for going about doing so, instead of thinking, thinking, thinking without it going anywhere. Here are some ideas for what you can do: Instead of thinking about whether or not your crush likes you, take action! Ask him or her out. What's the worst that can happen? If you're worried that you're falling behind in work or school, make a list of all of the things you can do to succeed. And then do those things! If you like to think, \"What if...\" a lot, try to do the things that are feasible."

Make sure to get out of the house at least a few times a week, and make a point of working to develop lasting and meaningful relationships with at least two or three people in your area that you can hang out with. You'll be much more prone to thinking if you spend a lot of time by yourself.

Put on your sunblock and your sneakers and stop being cooped up in your bedroom. [13] X Research source Even if you're not into hiking, running, biking, or surfing, make a goal of walking through a park at least once or twice a week, taking a weekend trip to something nature-related with your friends during your next vacation, or just going somewhere were you can stare out at a big blue lake or ocean. And if that seems like too much work for you, just go outside. Being out in the sun will make you happier, healthier, and less likely to brood."

And reading books can also not make you want to do anything except for escape to a new world for a while, which is also nice."
