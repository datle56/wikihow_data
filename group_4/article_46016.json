They also tend to be smokeless, sulphur-free, and/or don't produce chlorine-based formations.

      "content": "While fireworks in firework displays also contribute to air pollution, having one display being viewed by a large group of people is better than having many people setting off their own firework displays. These displays also tend to be higher quality. If you don't have a display anywhere near you, you can instead watch a neighbour's or friend's display. This reduces how many fireworks are set off. If you are having your own firework display, invite others to view it to reduce how many fireworks are set off. Large displays are still damaging to the environment, especially as they involve many fireworks. Some people may be organising a boycott of these big displays because of the environmental impact. If this is the case, you may want to take part in the boycott."
