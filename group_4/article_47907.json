We totally had homework.” Them: “FS, Andy…” You may see “fFS” occasionally. This is shorthand for “for f*cks sake.”"

When it’s used this way, it’s kind of a joke about something not going right or someone hurting themselves. [2] X Research source For example, if someone shares a video where a news anchor falls over while reporting on an ice storm, people might say “Fs,” or “Fs in chat” as a way of poking fun at them. In a Twitch chat (which is a live chat), “Fs in chat” is usually a call for other audience members to spam “F” over and over again."
