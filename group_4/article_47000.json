But those were uncirculated bills, meaning they were never released to the public and were preserved in pristine condition. Most circulated $2 bills are worth face value ($2), although some may be worth a little more depending on their condition and rarity."

[10] X Research source 1928 was also one of only 3 years that the current-sized bills were printed with a red seal. These bills can be hard to find in good condition, so uncirculated examples in pristine condition can be especially valuable. How much is it worth? The value of these depends heavily on the condition and the letter after the serial number (known as the series). Uncirculated examples from the B series can be worth up to $1,000 or more, while a circulated bill from a more common series like D, F, or G might only be worth $4 or $5. [11] X Research source"

[18] X Research source Unique serial numbers can make a bill collectible, too.

Green seals are used today, and they’re the most common. Star notes: If a run of bills has to be reprinted, the reprints will feature a star by the serial number. Not many star notes are produced in a run, so these tend to be collectible. Errors: If your bill has a printing error, smudged ink, or another error, it could be more valuable."

If it's not already graded, consider having it professionally evaluated—especially if you think it's very valuable.
