      "content": "Yes, you can do laundry with dish soap in a pinch—just don’t do it often. If you’re desperate to do laundry and have no detergent, you can use a very small amount of liquid dish soap like Dawn to wash your clothes (just a few drops, and definitely no more than about 3 teaspoons (15 mL). However, you shouldn’t make this a regular habit like some viral trends suggest. Here are the risks of using dish soap in your washing machine: [1] X Trustworthy Source Consumer Reports Nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing Go to source Dish soap suds up way too much. Laundry detergent is low sudsing, while dish soap gets extra sudsy. The bubbles could overflow and flood your laundry room, and the excess soap will just form a smelly film inside your washer that makes your clothes feel soapy. Dish soap is harsh on fabric. Detergent is designed to be gentle on fabric and fibers, while dish soap is meant to cut through tough grease, grime, and oil on hard surfaces. Delicate fabrics like silk can be damaged, and your clothes will feel stiff if they aren’t rinsed thoroughly. Dish soap can irritate your skin. Fragrance ingredients and other chemicals in dish soap are tough on sensitive skin (especially if you’re someone who uses gentle and.or unscented detergent normally)."

      "content": "Use no more than 3 teaspoons (15 mL) of liquid dish soap per load. Do not add the same amount of dish detergent as you would when using laundry detergent. If you add too much dish detergent, it will foam up and spill out of the machine. Here’s how much you need based on the size of your load: [2] X Research source Add 1 teaspoon (5 mL) for small loads. Add 2 teaspoons (10 mL) for medium loads. Add 3 teaspoons (15 mL) for large loads."

Pour the dish detergent into the washing machine just like you would if you were using laundry detergent—it’ll work the same if you pour it into the detergent dispenser or directly into the washer. After the dish detergent is added, you can run your washing machine as normal. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Use gentle or all-natural dish soap, if possible. If you’re really in a bind, any liquid dish soap you have on hand will do (lots of influencers say blue Dawn is their go-to). However, for the safety of your clothes, it’s best to use dish soap that’s phosphate-free and bleach-free. [4] X Research source Phosphates help soften water and tackle tough stains, but can be irritating on your skin. Bleach can discolor your clothing (most dish soaps do not contain bleach, but there are some that may—read the label carefully before pouring it into your laundry). You can use any scent of dish detergent that you would like."

      "title": "Rub dish soap into soaked or rinsed stains, then wash as normal.",
      "content": "Rub dish soap into soaked or rinsed stains, then wash as normal. First, soak the stained area of your garment if the stain has dried, or rinse it with cool water from behind if it’s new (hot water may set the stain). [5] X Research source Then, use your fingers or a soft brush to work dish soap into the stain using gentle circular or up-and-down movements. [6] X Research source Let the dish soap and water sit for at least a few minutes (and as long as overnight for tough stains). As the garment dries, you should see the stain begin to fade away. Launder the garment as normal with your usual detergent and cycle to remove the stain. Important: Check the stain carefully before putting the garment in the dryer. If you still see it, do not heat dry the garment (the heat will only set the stain). Instead, air dry your clothes and repeat the stain removal process. Dish soap is a very common and effective stain pre-treatment and is safe to use on most fabrics (test a drop on your garment to make sure it won't discolor the fabric before using it, just in case). As long as you only use a drop or two, your clothes should be just fine. What kinds of stains can dish soap remove? Dish soap is most effective against grease and oil stains from food or other substances like lipstick. However, it may work for other stains too."

Add about ½ cup (170 g) to 1 cup (340 g) directly to the drum before you start your load, then launder as normal. [7] X Research source You can also add up to 1 cup of baking soda to your laundry with your usual detergent for an extra cleaning boost. Try adding ½ cup (118 mL) of white vinegar to then wash when the rinse cycle starts for a natural fabric softener. [8] X Research source Baking soda is a natural deodorizer that can cut through acid and grease on your clothes."

The acetic acid in vinegar can break down stains and odors, leaving your clothes smelling fresher than when they went in (don’t worry about the vinegar smell—it will fade as your clothes rinse and dry and the vinegar evaporates away).

Add it to the detergent dispenser or directly to the drum or water and run your wash cycle as normal. [10] X Research source Alternative: Shampoo works well for handwashing clothes (especially delicate fabrics). If you just need to wash a garment or two, fill a lean sink or tub with cool or warm water, squirt in a small amount of shampoo, and gently agitate the garment to work the shampoo into the fabric. Let it soak for 10 minutes and rinse thoroughly."

Grate about 1 cup (340 grams) of any bar of soap or body wash you have and mix it with hot water to dissolve the shavings. Add the mixture to your detergent dispenser like normal to wash. [11] X Research source When you get to the rinse cycle, add ½ cup (118 mL) of white vinegar or lemon juice to the cycle to help remove the remaining soap residue. You may need to rinse the load twice to make sure your clothes aren’t sappy or stiff afterwards."

Just add 3 ounces (89 mL) of whatever unflavored vodka you have to your wash cycle. [12] X Research source Or, if you’re in a huge rush, just spray a 50/50 mix of vodka and water on your smelly clothes—as the mixture dries, the odor will vanish. [13] X Research source Keep in mind that vodka will not improve stains."

Set your wash cycle to Hot and the soil setting to Heavy (if your machine has that option). Or, select steam options like normal, bulky, or sanitizing. [14] X Research source To dry, set your dryer to heavy-duty or sanitizing and dry for at least 40 minutes on high heat. Avoid the delicate or speed settings when you’re only using hot water. Warning: Some synthetic fabrics, like polyester or nylon, can be damaged in high heat. Check the labels of your clothes before throwing them in the wash to make sure they can withstand high temperatures. Tip: If you have just a bit of detergent left (not enough for a whole load), try running a cup of hot water through the detergent dispenser after you add detergent to dissolve and carry and lingering soap into the washer."
