      "title": "A twin flame friendship is a deep soul connection.",
      "content": "A twin flame friendship is a deep soul connection. A twin flame friend is someone you see a part of yourself in, whether in interests, worldview, or insecurities. Unlike romantic twin flames, twin flame friends connect emotionally and intellectually but typically aren’t attracted to each other. [1] X Research source Twin flames may also share a slight physical resemblance like similar noses, hands, or freckles in the same locations or patterns. These shared physical traits are believed to be a result of the twin flames’ shared soul. [2] X Research source Twin flame friends may have started with a romantic relationship but decided they were better as friends. Twin flames deeply impact each other's lives even without a romantic connection (or with a romantic connection that burns out). Just because these connections are instant doesn’t mean they’re easy. Twin flame friendships can quickly turn toxic because the two people will mirror each other’s issues and unhealthy habits. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Twin flames are thought to be the other half of each other’s spirit.",
      "content": "Twin flames are thought to be the other half of each other’s spirit. The idea of twin flames or souls comes from Plato, who theorized that humans originally had two sets of every body part. These humans were split into two, and the person with the other half of our body is our twin flame. [4] X Research source This is different from soul mates , which are two separate souls that are linked. They are both deeply linked by destiny, but a soul mate is more likely to make a stable life partner or close friend. [5] X Research source Unlike twin flames, people can “have more than one soulmate,” as professional psychic Joanna Gerard explains. “It’s what you learn from each person that makes them a soulmate.”"

      "title": "Their connection is instant and unspoken.",
      "content": "Their connection is instant and unspoken. Two twin flame friends feel instantly drawn to each other’s energy. They immediately understand each other and their feelings without having to say it. Each person innately understands how significant and special the other person is. [6] X Research source The depth of this connection is described by spiritual life coach and psychic Jennifer McVey, who says that when you're apart from your twin flame, \"you can tap into that frequency that you have with them [and] know exactly where they are and what they're doing.”"

    {
      "title": "They share a feeling of recognition.",
      "content": "They share a feeling of recognition. Even when just meeting for the first time, twin flame friends often feel like they’ve known each other forever. There’s an instant comfort level between two twin flames and a shared understanding of who the other one is. [7] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They can be the most authentic version of themselves.",
      "content": "They can be the most authentic version of themselves. Because they understand each other so well, twin flame friends can be totally themselves around each other. Twin flame friends love each other for who they are and can share their secrets and imperfections without judgment."
    },
    {
      "title": "They have intense conversations.",
      "content": "They have intense conversations. Twin flame friends are emotionally connected and understand the depths of each other’s souls. They are not worried about being judged or misunderstood when revealing their thoughts and feelings. This connection leads to intense emotional conversations about life, the world, and each other. [8] X Research source Twin flames may also find themselves finishing each other’s sentences. This habit comes from their unspoken bond and ability to sense what others think or feel before it’s even been said."
    },
    {
      "title": "They are deeply loyal to and supportive of each other.",
      "content": "They are deeply loyal to and supportive of each other. Twin flame friends support each other unconditionally and always lend a shoulder to cry on or space to vent. They are extremely loyal to each other, even when they disagree. Their deep connection makes this a very hard relationship to walk away from, and both know that they would be lost without the other person. [9] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "They feel protective over each other.",
      "content": "They feel protective over each other. One may feel the need to step in or defend their twin flame friend when they are in trouble. Since twin flames are thought to be an extension of ourselves, it’s natural that we want to help them when they’re in need. [10] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They’re willing to work through conflicts.",
      "content": "They’re willing to work through conflicts. Twin flame friends won’t sweep problems under the rug or walk away when challenges arise. Rather, these deeply connected friends will have difficult conversations and resolve their issues with open and honest communication."
    },
    {
      "title": "Their energy is in sync.",
      "content": "Their energy is in sync. Since twin flame friends are thought to share two parts of the same spirit, their emotions and energies are directly linked. Consequently, when one is feeling low, the other is too. Similarly, they both may feel happy at the same time. These matching energies sometimes pose conflict because it’s challenging to simultaneously deal with two sets of intense emotions. For example, if twin flame friends feel sad or anxious, supporting and balancing each other can be hard."

    {
      "title": "They have shared goals, values, and interests.",
      "content": "They have shared goals, values, and interests. Twin flame friends have similar worldviews and often share a calling or life’s purpose. They also share similar interests, whether a love of books, nature, cooking, exercise…you name it! [11] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They spend a ton of time together.",
      "content": "They spend a ton of time together. Twin flame friends enjoy spending lots of time together and usually spend more time with each other than anyone else. Not only do they share common interests and hobbies, but they feel most comfortable and safe in each other’s company. [12] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They feel physically connected to each other.",
      "content": "They feel physically connected to each other. In a twin flame friendship, the two friends may feel a natural need to be close to or affectionate with each other. They may want to cuddle and feel intimacy, although this doesn’t mean their connection is sexual or romantic. [13] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "They both repeatedly see the same number patterns.",
      "content": "They both repeatedly see the same number patterns. In numerology, seeing twin flame numbers means that they are close to meeting and beginning their friendship. Look for twin flame numbers in bill totals, phone calls, clock times, license plates, road signs, building numbers, and event dates. While seeing any shared and repeat number pattern is significant, the most common are angel numbers , which are usually three-digit numbers made up of the same digit. [14] X Research source For example, angel number 444 is believed to signify that you’ll overcome the challenges you’re currently facing with the help of your intuition and the angels guiding you. This may be a sign to trust that the universe will connect you with your twin flame soon. [15] X Research source Another example of angel numbers is given by numerologist Michelle Arbeau, with the number 911: “The number 9 symbolizes the end of a cycle…The double 1’s indicates two individuals…Therefore, there is very high change energy coming in for your twin flame relationship and it could be on any (or all) level(s)...Typically, however, the 9 is also called the humanitarian number and the “dreamer” vibration, so it could be safe to assume the changes may be positive in nature.”"

      "title": "There are seven common stages in a twin flame friendship.",
      "content": "There are seven common stages in a twin flame friendship. These twin flame stages range from initially recognizing a twin flame to a twin flame separation and reunion. Every relationship and friendship is unique, so not every twin flame friendship will follow these steps. [17] X Research source Yearning: The twin flames haven’t met yet, but they feel like something big is about to happen. Awakening: The twin flames feel a deep connection to each other and feel like they were destined to be in each other’s lives. Conflict: Because twin flames are so similar, they’ll recognize some of their own worst traits in each other. These traits will likely bother or irritate them, bringing conflict into the friendship. Crisis: This stage will test the twin flame friends and show how their friendship can handle a difficult situation. While challenging at the time, how two people resolve problems together may bond them more deeply. Chase: This stage is known as twin flame separation, when one twin flame distances themselves from the other. The other twin flame will try to chase their friend, resulting in a push and pull they eventually have to give up on. Surrender: the twin flames need time apart to reflect on the relationship and grow as individuals. They must surrender their need to control and trust that they are destined to be in each other’s lives, although maybe not now. Reunion: After surviving the previous stages of meeting, separating, and growing independently, twin flame friends can come together even stronger. A twin flame friendship where both people are accepting of and dedicated to the other is a special relationship that will likely last all their lives! [18] X Research source"
