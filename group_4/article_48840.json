      "title": "Her feelings are hurt by something you did.",
      "content": "Her feelings are hurt by something you did. A lot of people use the silent treatment because they aren’t sure how to approach someone about a conflict. Maybe you two got in a fight, or you did something that hurt her feelings. This could be why she’s shutting you out—she doesn’t have the emotional capacity to deal with whatever it is right now. [1] X Research source Using the silent treatment isn’t a great way to deal with conflicts, because it keeps the line of communication closed. However, many people don’t have the emotional intelligence to talk about their feelings clearly, so they bottle them up and ignore the person who hurt them."

      "title": "She’s playing hard to get.",
      "content": "She’s playing hard to get. Do you find yourself getting mixed messages constantly? One day she’s hot, and the next day she’s cold. Some women like a guy to “chase” them, or work hard for their attention. She may be ignoring you because she wants you to put more effort into the relationship. [2] X Research source Playing hard to get isn’t the most mature way to handle a budding relationship, and it can often break down communication pathways."

    {
      "title": "She’s being passive-aggressive.",
      "content": "She’s being passive-aggressive. People who are passive-aggressive show their negative emotions in a subtle, indirect way. This is similar to being hurt or upset by something you did, but it’s slightly more nefarious—she’s punishing you by withholding her attention. Fortunately, people who are passive-aggressive can learn to speak openly about their feelings instead of keeping them inside, especially if you talk to them about it . [3] X Research source We’re all passive-aggressive sometimes, and while it’s not the healthiest way to communicate with other people, it definitely sends a message."

    {
      "title": "She wants to feel in control of the situation.",
      "content": "She wants to feel in control of the situation. In some cases, a person might be feeling vulnerable or like the relationship is moving too fast. She may be pulling away because she wants to take back that control: she’s scared of falling in love or developing feelings. [4] X Research source This is especially likely if she’s been hurt by relationships in the past."

    {
      "title": "She’s stressed out by something else in her life.",
      "content": "She’s stressed out by something else in her life. Maybe her job just got super busy, or maybe she’s swamped with school work. If you’re noticing a change in her communication patterns, there’s a good chance it has absolutely nothing to do with you—she might just be pulling back because she needs a break from everything. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source If you two haven’t been dating for long (or you’re not quite dating yet), she might not feel comfortable opening up to you about the problems in her life."

      "title": "She’s naturally a quiet person.",
      "content": "She’s naturally a quiet person. Maybe you two had been in the honeymoon phase for a while now—the relationship is fresh, new, and exciting. During that phase, it’s normal for couples to talk more often than usual. However, once the honeymoon phase is over, people tend to change a bit. It could be that she prefers to chat with you a little less than you’d like to chat with her. It’s important to talk about these things with your date, especially if you’re feeling bad. Talk to her about how often you’d like to chat, text, or hang out throughout the week, and see how she feels, too."

      "title": "She’s not interested in you anymore.",
      "content": "She’s not interested in you anymore. In some cases, a woman will give you the cold shoulder instead of telling you that she doesn’t want to see you. [6] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is similar to ghosting: maybe she takes a really long time to respond to your messages, or she won’t make concrete plans with you anymore. Other signs of ghosting include one-word, impersonal responses and the other person never initiating the conversation. If she just isn’t interested in you , the mature thing would be to let you know. However, if she’s scared of confrontation or she’s worried about hurting your feelings, she might be trying to let the relationships slowly fade away (especially if you’ve only been dating for a little bit)."

      "content": "Let her know you’d like to talk. Reach out to her and let her know that you’ve noticed she’s giving you the cold shoulder. Try not to blame or shame her—instead, let her know that you’d like to hear what’s bothering her and talk about what she’s going through. [7] X Research source “Hey, I noticed you’ve been a little quiet lately. Is everything okay?” “Just checking in. How are you doing? You’ve seemed a little down the past few days.

Go to source “I totally understand if you’re feeling hurt or upset right now, but giving me the silent treatment makes me feel like you don’t care.” “I want to be there for you, but I can’t if you just keep ignoring me.

If you find that you’re constantly dealing with the silent treatment, it may be time to reevaluate your relationship together. [12] X Research source Give your partner a chance to work on things by saying something like, “I care about you a lot, and I want this relationship to work. But you can’t keep shutting me out like this.” Or, “I don’t want to part ways, but getting the silent treatment every week isn’t fun for me. I really need us to work on communicating with each other.”"
