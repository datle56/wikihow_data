      "content": "Track the length of your illness. In general, viral infections are milder than bacterial infections, but they tend to last longer. You will feel very sick for 1 to 3 days and then you will start to feel better, but some of your symptoms may linger. Symptoms that linger for a week or more may be a virus. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source It's important to stay vigilant and talk to your doctor about antibiotics if symptoms last for a while. Viruses can morph into things like sinus infections or increase the risk of middle ear infections, which may result in you developing a bacterial infection as well."

      "content": "Pay attention to the color of your mucus. When you blow your nose or cough up mucus, pay attention to the color. While it may feel a little gross, color can be an indicator of whether you have a viral or bacterial infection. Thin and clear mucus is more likely to be a viral infection. Dark, greenish mucus is more likely to be a bacterial infection. However, mucus color is not a 100% accurate indicator of whether you have a viral or bacterial infection. Make sure to weigh in other factors. [4] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Observe your throat. A sore throat is common for both viral and bacterial infections. Checking for a sore throat is the most common test that will be performed in your doctor’s office to determine if you need antibiotics right away. Certain types of sore throats can indicate a bacterial infection. For example, white spots are generally caused by bacteria. A sore throat without other symptoms, such as a runny nose or sneezing, may be a bacterial infection such as strep throat.

      "content": "Evaluate your fever. Fevers can be present in both viral and bacterial infections. However, fevers differ slightly with different types of infections. In bacterial infections, fevers tend to be higher. With a bacterial infection, fevers get worse after a few days while they tend to improve a few days in with a viral infection.

[8] X Research source If the flu is going around your office or place of work, remember it's highly contagious. If you've interacted with people with the flu recently, there is a good chance your symptoms are caused by the flu. [9] X Research source Keep in mind that there are treatment options for the flu if you are diagnosed and your symptoms started within two days of being diagnosed. Make sure to contact your doctor's office about your symptoms during flu season."

      "content": "Think about age. Younger children are more prone to certain viral infections. Upper respiratory infections specifically are more common in younger children. If your child is displaying symptoms like a sore throat, sneezing, and coughing, they may have an upper respiratory infection.

      "content": "Recall recent sinus infections. Sometimes, bacteria can start as a viral infection and morph into a bacterial one. If you recently had some kind of viral infection, such as a sinus infection, you may have developed a secondary bacterial infection. If you have had two illnesses close to one another, you may be more likely to have a bacterial infection. [11] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source In some cases, other viral infections could lead to a bacterial infection. Any illness that lingers for more than a couple of weeks should be evaluated by a doctor."

      "content": "See a doctor right away if you have certain symptoms. Most viral infections can be managed at home with self care. However, under certain conditions you should see a doctor right away. It's especially important these symptoms are addressed in children. See a doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms: [12] X Research source Urinating less than three times in 24 hours Difficulty breathing No improvement over three to five days Worsening of symptoms, or severe symptoms If you or a member of your household has a compromised immune system, you should be seen sooner to prevent complications."

      "content": "Take antibiotics for a bacterial infection. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and will not do anything to stop a viral infection. Doctors may not always prescribe antibiotics, even for bacterial infections, but they may be necessary if your infection is serious. [13] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source The only way to know for sure if you have a viral or bacterial infection is to get evaluated and discuss options with your doctor. A doctor will collect mucus or do a throat swab and send the sample to a lab. Your doctor may want to test you for a bacterial infection if they believe you would benefit from antibiotics.

It is important to stay current with all recommended vaccines as they are meant to prevent serious complications from both viruses and bacteria. Get a flu vaccination to protect you from the virus that causes the flu. While the flu is a viral infection, viral infections can some time lead to a bacterial infection. A flu shot can reduce your risk of developing viral and bacterial infections. [16] X Research source A flu shot will not protect from all viruses or bacteria. While it reduces your risk, you may still get sick. Many people qualify for pneumonia vaccinations as well. Make sure to discuss this with your doctor.
