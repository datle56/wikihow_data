      "title": "Use a 1:1 ratio.",
      "content": "Use a 1:1 ratio. In general, you don't need to change the amounts when swapping coconut oil for vegetable oil in a baking recipe. If a recipe calls for a cup of vegetable oil (240 mL), you can add a cup of coconut oil (240 mL) instead and it should still turn out fine. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Melt the coconut oil before use.",
      "content": "Melt the coconut oil before use. Coconut oil is usually solid when you first purchase it. If you want to use it as a substitute for vegetable oil, it needs to be melted to a similar consistency.< Coconut oil will generally melt on its own if stored at 76 °F (24 °C). If it's not melted when you want to use it, simply set the jar in a bowl of hot tap water and let it sit until it melts."

    {
      "title": "Let the other ingredients come to room temperature.",
      "content": "Let the other ingredients come to room temperature. Coconut oil mixes best with room temperature ingredients. An hour or two prior to baking, set out ingredients like eggs and butter. This lets them reach room temperature before you bake with coconut oil."

      "title": "Opt for coconut oil to balance bitter tastes.",
      "content": "Opt for coconut oil to balance bitter tastes. If you're cooking sweeter ingredients, like fruits or sweeter veggies like carrots, coconut oil may not be a great substitute. It has a sweet flavor, which can be overwhelming when mixed with sweeter foods. However, coconut oil can be great to use when you're cooking with bitter ingredients, such as broccoli, kale, or spinach. It can add a sweet flavor to balance out the bitterness. [2] X Research source When cooking sweeter ingredients, try substituting olive oil or something similar for vegetable oil."

      "title": "Fry meat and vegetables with coconut oil.",
      "content": "Fry meat and vegetables with coconut oil. Recipes frequently call for vegetable oil to cook things like vegetables or meat. If you want to use coconut oil instead, simply grease your pan with coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. It should work just as well in terms of preventing ingredients from sticking to the pan.

      "title": "Substitute coconut oil for a tropical flavor.",
      "content": "Substitute coconut oil for a tropical flavor. Coconut oil can be great for dishes like stir fries or curries, as it adds a mild tropical flavor. For a little flare on a traditional dish, like chicken and broccoli, cook with coconut oil over vegetable oil. You can also use coconut oil for marinades or salad dressings that call for vegetable oil. [4] X Research source For most recipes, you can use the same amount of coconut oil as vegetable oil."

    {
      "title": "Go for extra virgin coconut oil for a stronger flavor.",
      "content": "Go for extra virgin coconut oil for a stronger flavor. Coconut oil, like olive oil, comes in different varieties. If you love the taste of coconut oil, and want a dish with a strong flavor, go for extra virgin coconut oil. The flavor tends to hold up better during cooking. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Opt for refined or pressed coconut oil for a mild flavor.",
      "content": "Opt for refined or pressed coconut oil for a mild flavor. If you want the health benefits of coconut oil, but dislike the flavor, look for refined or pressed coconut oil. This does not have a taste or smell like other oils. It may be hard to find in stores, but it can be purchased online. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Measure ingredients by weight over volume, if possible. If you have a kitchen scale, use it when baking. Weigh your vegetable oil and then measure out an equal amount of coconut oil. While measuring using measuring cups works well enough, it's generally best to substitute based on weight over volume."

      "title": "Avoid refrigerating coconut oil.",
      "content": "Avoid refrigerating coconut oil. Coconut oil usually needs to be melted if you're using it as a vegetable oil substitute. If kept in the fridge, coconut oil will harden. Each time you want to use it, you'll have to wait until it melts. If you frequently use coconut oil as a vegetable oil substitute, keep it in a kitchen cabinet over the refrigerator so it stays melted."
