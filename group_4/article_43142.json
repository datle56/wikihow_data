      "content": "Sour smell Smell the stem end of a pineapple to test its ripeness. A good, ready-to-eat pineapple has a sweet, fresh smell, whereas a rotten pineapple will smell fermented, sour, or like vinegar. Similarly, if a pineapple doesn’t smell at all, it’s likely underripe."

Keep the fruit in a cool, dry place for ideal freshness. [5] X Research source You can also store a whole pineapple in the fridge for up to 5 days; however, be sure it’s near the bottom of the fridge to avoid freezing. Avoid placing a whole, uncut pineapple in the freezer, as it won’t thaw properly and cause too much moisture in the fruit, speeding up the rotting process."
