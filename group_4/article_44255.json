      "content": "Try interval training to get the most out of your workouts. Interval training involves alternating between short high-intensity and long low-intensity activities to make your workouts more effective. When you develop your workout routine, look for activities that push your limits and are difficult to complete and plan to do them in 30-second bursts. Then choose less strenuous activities and complete them for 3-4 minutes at a time. For example, you may incorporate 30 seconds of jogging or sprinting followed by 3-4 minutes of brisk walking. Continue alternating between them until you finish your workout. Aim to exercise at least 4-5 days each week with interval training. Interval training also allows you to burn more calories than a regular workout."
