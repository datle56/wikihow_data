      "content": "Give yourselves some space to cool down. After a breakup, tensions are high, so let everything simmer. Even though it might be hard, try to stick to the \"no contact\" rule : in other words, avoid seeing, texting, or calling your ex for 30 days. While it seems counterintuitive, this tactic actually has a pretty high success rate. If your ex doesn't hear from you, then they may end up pining for you and picturing the best parts of your relationship. [1] X Research source Traditionally, the \"no contact rule\" is used to move on from an ex, so your old flame might worry that you slipped through their fingers. If you stay strong and follow this rule by the book (that means not even one random text), you'll create a sense of mystery and anticipation. Not only does the \"no contact\" rule allow your ex some time to wonder if ending the relationship was the wrong choice, but it also allows you time to regroup so you'll be calm and collected when you eventually speak again."

      "content": "Spend reflecting on your own needs and expectations. Believe it or not, it can actually be incredibly empowering to be alone after a breakup . To make the most of this period, pursue your own interests and reflect on whether the relationship really brought out the best in you. As you explore all your feelings related to your dynamic, you might discover that there were ways to be a better partner or advocate for yourself. [2] X Research source Make a list of what you loved and disliked about your relationship. For example, jot down, \"He was always great at giving me lots of compliments and supporting my dreams. I just wish that we had more novelty in our dynamic and went on more dates.\" Review what you wrote down to see if you want to move forward: \"You know, all of this seems very surmountable. He was a really nice guy, and I bet if I handled the logistics, he would be down to go to more concerts or vacations.\" Remember to prioritize your own self-care , too. Not only will you enjoy yourself, but when you brim with confidence, your ex may find you irresistible if you meet up again."

      "content": "Own up to your part in the breakup. Hey, it's never easy to look back on what you're not exactly proud of, especially when it involves the one you love. Still, when you consider your own patterns in relationships or your communication style, you'll be armed with invaluable knowledge. When it's time for your next \"at bat\" as you reconnect with your ex, it might just be a home run. Identify your attachment style ‚Äîwere you ever distant and avoidant? On the other hand, did you ever feel like you needed continual reassurance because you were insecure about the relationship? Think about your love languages‚Äîdid each of you express affection in the same way? Did you show your partner a lot of appreciation, or did you sometimes overlook the positive ways they contributed to the relationship? Consider your communication skills ‚Äîdid you speak up about what you needed, or did you sweep your concerns under the rug? Did you discuss matters calmly, and were you an active listener?"

To respect their boundaries, ask if they're okay with catching up and staying in touch. If they are, just sprinkle in a cute check-in here and there‚Äînothing too serious. Your upbeat and laidback attitude could rekindle things in just a few days. Try to sound like it's no big deal to you: \"Hey, stranger. üòä Is it cool to text?\" For a few days, or even a couple weeks, just give random updates: \"Work is finally settling down, yay!\" Then, bring up a low-stakes way to meet up again: \"What do you think about grabbing coffee? ‚òïI'm free on Saturday.\" If they're not ready to hang out yet (or express that they'd rather not stay in touch), respect their wishes: \"I completely understand. I wish you the best.\" Reader Poll: We asked 1567 wikiHow readers and only 9% of them would reach out to an ex by calling and sharing their feelings. [Take Poll] So a casual, pressure-free text or email may be the best way to re-establish contact."

That's understandable, but ask yourself: are you looking for a fling or the real deal? If it's the second option, then pace yourself: savor your time together and you'll send the message that you two are destined for romance. [3] X Research source Even if they look totally yummy, stick to respectful and polite openers, like, \"You look great. How's everything been for you these days?\" Feel free to indulge in a little nostalgia to sweeten the date: \"You are so funny! I love how we can always goof off with each other. Remember how wild we got at that wedding?\" To keep the sparks flying, thank them for coming out and suggest another meetup: \"I had a blast. Wanna get together next weekend?\""

To make sure you're on the right track and make awesome progress, carve out some time to sit down and chat about what you're both looking for this time around. [4] X Research source Decide whether you need more time to find your groove or if you'd like to be \"official\" again: \"I think I'm ready to put a 'relationship' label on this. It just feels right to me. What are your thoughts?\" Speak up about your needs: \"Now that we're together again, I just want to make sure we stay invested in each other. I'd love if we could have two special date nights every month.\" Check in about what your former ex wants: \"I know that you really value your personal space.

As long as you both remain transparent, you have what it takes to go the distance. [5] X Research source If you two are slipping into old patterns, gently bring this up and offer a solution: \"It seems that we're getting a little distant again. I really love you and want to avoid drifting apart. Why don't we talk it out, cuddle, and watch a movie tonight?\" When you two have made amazing strides, shine a light on that: \"We're doing so much better this time around! Look at us resolving problems like total pros.\" Take time to regularly assess your relationship: \"Overall, I'm really happy we got back together.

Steer clear if you see warning signs like: [11] X Research source Making promises without ever following through. For example, your partner might reassure you they'll remain open and transparent, but they still keep secrets from you. Setting unrealistic standards for a \"fantasy\" relationship. If either of you spend more time describing how you wish each other would be like rather than accepting one another, then it's a sign you'll both remain unsatisfied. Playing the \"blame game\" and bringing up past mistakes. If one of you still hasn't let go of what's already said and done, then arguments will continue to crop up.
