[1] X Research source Turn both of your feet out slightly (approximately a 30-60 degree angle), so you look like a ballerina. Raise your arms out in front of you at shoulder height, and bend your knees to begin to squat. Try to get low enough into the squat that your knees are bent at a 90° right angle. Keep your back straight as you lower into the squat. Do these squats for about 1 minute. [2] X Expert Source Monica Morris Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. You can do as many repetitions as you like. Try to keep your knees behind your toes as you bend into the squat. [3] X Research source Squeeze your butt to keep a tight, controlled form to your squat. To add some dimension to this workout, gently bounce at the bottom of the squat for the last 20 seconds of the workout.

For example, if you squat to the right, your right knee will bend as you keep your left leg straight and turn your left foot to point your toes up. As you squat, raise your arms out in front of you at shoulder height and slightly lean your torso forward for additional stability. [6] X Research source Extend and straighten out your squatting leg to return to the starting position. Do this same Cossack squat on your opposite leg to complete one full rep.

Begin this workout by lunging as usual: Take a forward step with one of your feet, and dip your back knee down until your front thigh is parallel with the ground. Keep your arms relaxed at your sides. Instead of pushing off your forward foot to come back to your starting position, you are going to shift all of your weight onto your front foot and stand up, keeping your other leg (that was previously back) up and bent at the knee.

However, if you don’t have a gym membership, the same resistance results can be found using a fitness band to carry out the identical mechanics. If you’re using a cable machine, attach the cable around your innermost ankle (closest to the machine) and adjust the added weight settings. [36] X Expert Source Monica Morris Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 18 November 2019. If you’re using a fitness band, wrap the band around something immobile (like the leg of a table) and then attach the band around your innermost leg (closest to the table leg). Put all of your weight on the foot furthest from the table or machine. Flex your foot up that the cable or band is attached to, and pull your leg across the midline of your body, past your weight bearing foot. Let the cable or band travel in front of your weight bearing foot. Then slowly bring your foot back into your starting position. Each time you come back to your starting position, is one rep. Do this on both legs to complete this exercise. Keep the center of your body straight and your core muscles tightened as you pull your leg past your body’s midline. If you feel pain in your knees, try wrapping the band higher up on your leg. Complete approximately 3 sets of 10 reps on both of your legs."

Keep your body facing forward as you find balance on the ball. With the foot that is on top of the ball, push and roll the ball away from your body. As you push, your other weight bearing leg will have to bend at the knee to accommodate the movement. Do this movement on both legs to complete the workout. As you do this exercise, do not lead with a squat. Rather, have your other leg that is propped up on the ball lead the roll, and your squatting leg will follow. This will ensure that you are working your intended thigh muscles. Do approximately 2 sets of 10–15 on both legs."
