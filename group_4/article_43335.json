These could all be signs that she likes you. [1] X Research source Let her know you’re into her too by keeping your eyes on her.

She'll likely value punctuality, so plan to be on time (or a little early!) when you get together. German women value being treated as equals in relationships, so don't be surprised if she offers to split bills at restaurants, and doesn't look someone to open doors for her or make other grand gestures. Germans tend to take things slowly in relationships, so don't expect things to develop super-quickly. Take your time and enjoy the journey!"
