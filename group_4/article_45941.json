      "title": "Get the right equipment.",
      "content": "Get the right equipment. Chatroulette is a video-based chat service, so you won't be able to get much use out of it without the right gear and accessories. Make sure that your computer has a working webcam, that the latest version of Flash is installed on your computer, and that your speakers are working. If you'd like to talk, make sure your microphone is working, as well. This isn't essential, as text chat is also possible."

      "title": "Set up an account.",
      "content": "Set up an account. At first, Chatroulette allowed absolutely anyone at all to use the site anonymously. However, to curtail malicious misuse, Chatroulette now requires users to sign up with a free account before using the site's features. Making an account requires choosing a username and specifying an email address and password for the account to be associated with. To make an account, visit www.chatroulette.com (don't worry, you won't be exposed to anything graphic yet). Click the \"Start\" button in the top left of the window and you'll receive a pop-up prompting you to create an account."

      "title": "Test out your webcam.",
      "content": "Test out your webcam. On the main Chatroulette screen, you should see two black squares on the left side of the screen. When you use Chatroulette, the bottom square will display your webcam feed, while the top square will display your partner's. Click the \"Preview your webcam\" button on the bottom square to activate your computer's webcam. If it is functioning correctly, you should see whatever is in front of its lens. Usually, this is your own gorgeous face! When you preview your webcam you may receive a pop-up prompt asking for your permission to activate the webcam. In this case, simply click \"Ok\" or \"Accept\" or the equivalent option to turn your webcam on."

      "content": "Start chatting! When you've created an account and gotten your camera working, you're ready to spin the Chatroulette wheel! If you're not already there, visit www.chatroulette.com. When your mind is prepared and your nerves are steeled, click the \"Start\" button in the top left. Your mic and camera should activate and you'll enter into a chat session with a random user from anywhere in the world. Have fun!"

      "title": "Be ready to skip to the next user or stop the feed entirely.",
      "content": "Be ready to skip to the next user or stop the feed entirely. After you click the \"Start\" button, the text on the button will change to \"Next\". This button now allows you to instantly end video chat with the current user and switch to another random user. If you're sheepish, you may want to keep your mouse hovering over this button so that you can quickly skip over any offensive content. Additionally, the \"Stop\" button in the upper left will immediately cut your video feed without reconnecting you to another user. As you can imagine, this button is useful when you'd like to stop the feed entirely. Finally, if you come across offensive or exploitative content, click \"Report and next\". If a certain user is reported often enough within a certain amount of time, s/he will be temporarily blocked."

Take stock of your surroundings - is there anything visible in your camera's field of vision that can identify you? If so, conceal these items or remove them entirely. Below are just a few of the types of things that can be used to identify you: Your real name Your address Financial information Birthmarks/tattoos"

      "content": "Gussy up your appearance and surroundings. It's easy to forget when you're hunched over a laptop screen at 3 o'clock in the morning that your partner can see you , too. Before going onto Chatroulette, you may want to take a moment to ensure that you and the area around you is looking as nice as possible. Style your hair, wash your face, and remove any garbage from the surrounding area to avoid harassment at the hands of a merciless stranger. If you have different lighting options available, you may want to opt for a soft, warm light source, as, if you're like most people, you won't look your best in the harsh pale glow of a monitor."

If used correctly, Chatroulette allows you to strike a genuine connection with someone from another part of the globe that you would never have met otherwise. Make the most of this opportunity! Behave on Chatroulette as you would if you were actually meeting someone from another part of the world - be polite, friendly, and open-minded. Common sense will get you far! Chatroulette does have a few rules for its use. These are displayed on the main Chatroulette page before you begin chatting and are: Users cannot broadcast nudity or offer to do so Users must be 18 or over Users cannot broadcast spam (advertisements) Users cannot fake the video stream of another person"

Take advantage of the Chatroulette's randomness, world-wide reach, and relative anonymity to surprise and/or amuse a stranger! You may, for instance, want to prank unsuspecting partners by having a friend suddenly pop in front of the camera. Or , you may want to plan a hilarious lip synched song-and-dance performance. Your imagination and Chatroulette's rules for use are the only limits!"

Though the majority of Chatroulette users are normal, everyday people, a significant minority are pranksters or perverts, many of whom are bold, brazen and malicious. A study published early in the site's run found that about 1 in 8 \"spins\" connected the user to \"R-rated\" content. [1] X Research source Though recent efforts to curtail this misuse have had major success, it is still not entirely rare to encounter graphic content on Chatroulette. Seriously, don't use Chatroulette if you're a kid and don't let your kids use Chatroulette if you're a parent. It's easy to see something truly horrible on Chatroulette. You've been warned!"
