You may also receive a prescription for a topical medication to apply to the granuloma.

      "title": "Wash the affected area.",
      "content": "Wash the affected area. Clean the area that you plan to treat to remove any bacteria at the site or on your surrounding skin. Gently wash with a mild, unscented soap and warm water. It’s common for pyogenic granuloma to bleed easily and you shouldn’t be scared by this; however, if you are treating someone else, be sure you are wearing gloves to protect yourself from exposure to their blood. Consider using an antiseptic solution to clean the area if you like, though soap and water disinfects just as well. Dry off your skin around the granuloma by patting it. This can prevent excessive bleeding."

      "title": "Dab the topical treatment on the granuloma.",
      "content": "Dab the topical treatment on the granuloma. If your doctor has prescribed you imiquimod or timolol, apply the treatment gently to the affected area. Repeat as many times per day as your doctor prescribes. Be sure to use as little pressure as possible when dabbing the medication on your granuloma. This can minimize any bleeding that may occur. Follow the instructions for application by your doctor, who will determine the proper dosage. Let your doctor know if you experience any reactions to the medication."

    {
      "title": "Cover the granuloma with a non-adhesive gauze.",
      "content": "Cover the granuloma with a non-adhesive gauze. Because skin affected by granuloma tends to bleed easily, it is important to keep it clean, dry, and protected. You can do this by keeping it covered with a non-adhesive sterile bandage until any bleeding stops, which may be one to two days or longer. Hold the bandage in place with medical tape. Apply it to the bandage on an area of your skin that is not affected by the granuloma. Ask your doctor how long you should keep the granuloma covered. Change your dressing at least every other day or when it is soiled. It is important to do this because a dirty bandage could lead to a secondary infection."

      "content": "Avoid picking at granulomas. It may be tempting to pick at a granuloma or crust that may form over it. You should avoid doing this because it could spread bacteria or injure healing skin. Allow the granuloma to complete it’s course of topical treatment and consult your doctor if you notice any potential problems.

      "title": "Get a silver nitrate treatment.",
      "content": "Get a silver nitrate treatment. Your doctor may opt to apply a silver nitrate to your granuloma. This will chemically cauterize, or burn off, your granuloma. This antiseptic solution can help with bleeding and may effectively reduce your pyogenic granuloma. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Watch for severe reactions to silver nitrate treatments such as black scabs and skin ulcerations. See your doctor as soon as possible to prevent infection or further injury."

      "title": "Remove and prevent granulomas with curettage.",
      "content": "Remove and prevent granulomas with curettage. Surgical removal is the most common treatment for granulomas, as there is a lower rate of recurrence with surgery. Many doctors remove granulomas with curettage and cauterization. This involves scraping off the granuloma with a tool called a curette and then cauterizing the surrounding blood vessels to minimize the chances of regrowth. It may also help stop bleeding.

      "content": "Consider cryotherapy. Your doctor may also suggest cryotherapy, especially for smaller lesions. [10] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source This treatment involves freezing off granulomas with liquid nitrogen. The low temperature of the treatment can reduce cell growth and inflammation through vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. [11] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Observe your wound after the treatment and follow any instructions from your doctor. A granuloma wound caused by cryotherapy generally heals within seven to 14 days. Pain will generally last for three days."

      "content": "Undergo surgical excision. If you have large or recurrent granuloma, your doctor may suggest excising them. This treatment has the highest cure rates. [12] X Research source This procedure involves removing the granuloma and its related blood vessels to reduce the risk of it growing back. Your doctor may also send a small sample to a lab to examine for any possible malignancy. [13] X Research source Allow your doctor mark the excision site with a surgical marker. This won’t stain your skin. They will then anesthetize the site to minimize any discomfort you may have. After this, the doctor will remove the granuloma with a scalpel and/or sharp scissors. You may smell some burning if the doctor uses cautery to stop bleeding, but this won’t harm you. If necessary, you may get stitches at the excision incision site."

      "title": "Consider laser surgery.",
      "content": "Consider laser surgery. Some doctors may suggest laser surgery to remove the lesion and burn its base or shrink smaller granulomas. [14] X Trustworthy Source DermNet NZ Online clinical resource website written and run by dermatologists providing evidence-based information about dermatology and skin health Go to source Consider this procedure before getting it, as it is not necessarily better at removing or preventing pyogenic granulomas as surgical excision. [15] X Research source Talk to your doctor about the benefits of laser surgery over surgical excision for your granuloma. Ask any questions you may have about the procedure including about healing, care, and recurrence."

      "title": "Bandage the surgical site.",
      "content": "Bandage the surgical site. The surgeon or doctor may have you cover the area where your granuloma was removed. This helps protect the wound from infection and can absorb any blood or fluid leakage. [16] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Put on a new covering with light pressure if you experience any bleeding. If you have a lot of bleeding, contact your doctor. Wear the bandage for at least one day after your medical professional removes the granuloma. Keep the wound as dry as you can, which helps it heal and keeps bacteria out of the site. Avoid showering for at least a day after the procedure, unless your doctor advises that it is safe."

[17] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Use bandages that let your skin breathe. Air flow can promote healing. You can get breathable bandages at most drug stores and at many grocery stores. Your doctor may also provide you with dressings for the wound.
