      "title": "Measure 3 - 5 tablespoons of coconut oil into a bowl.",
      "content": "Measure 3 - 5 tablespoons of coconut oil into a bowl. The amount of coconut oil you'll need depends on the length and thickness of your hair. If you have long, thick hair, use 5; if your hair is shorter and thinner, you only need 3 or 4. Use unrefined, cold pressed (not refined or solvent extracted). Refined coconut oil has additives and is put through processes that remove some of the natural compounds that make it so healthy for your hair and skin. Unrefined coconut oil is complete in its natural, healthy goodness. Similarly, solvent extracted oil usually contains traces of the hazardous hexane solvent. Make sure not to use too much; focus the oil on the middle section and bottom of your hair. If too much is used, especially near the scalp, this can cause the hair to look greasy even when washed out thoroughly. Your hair produces its own natural oils that come from the scalp."
