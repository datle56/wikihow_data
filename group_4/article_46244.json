      "title": "Reach for a set that feels relevant to the information you seek.",
      "content": "Reach for a set that feels relevant to the information you seek. Whether you’re sorting through your collection or browsing oracle card decks in a shop, focus on imagery that speaks to your soul. Study the boxes of cards and look for symbols that seem connected to your quest for answers. Let inspiration guide you. A dragon deck might represent your hope for power. Hold a deck and see how it makes you feel—the right one should energize you."

      "title": "Align yourself with the cards so that they’re attuned to you.",
      "content": "Align yourself with the cards so that they’re attuned to you. When you're ready to use your oracle cards, go to a quiet place—like an altar—you find sacred. Perform grounding exercises, like deep breathing, as you hold your deck. Help your oracle deck receive your energy by picturing your aura, essence, or spirit. When you can clearly visualize your energy, infuse your deck with it. [1] X Research source If you have passion on your mind, you might wash your deck with a red aura. If you feel a bit lost or confused, you might charge your deck with curiosity. If you sense you're a free spirit, you might activate your deck with a wanderlust."

      "title": "Clarify your question so the deck can provide the best answer.",
      "content": "Clarify your question so the deck can provide the best answer. Set your deck down and consider your query. Once you're certain about the information you seek, pick your deck up again. Concentrate on your question so your cards can \"hear\" it clearly and absorb it. Say it out loud in order to dedicate yourself and your deck to finding an answer. For example, ask: [2] X Research source \"Is now the right time to date?\" \"What is my calling or purpose?\" \"Where should I travel next?\""

      "title": "Enter a state of mindfulness by focusing only on your query.",
      "content": "Enter a state of mindfulness by focusing only on your query. Shuffle the cards with your favorite technique to shut out the world around you and promote a flow state. Think just about your question. While you meditate and shuffle, more mental images or feelings may come up during your flow state. Stop shuffling when you feel called to do so. If you stop because you feel a spark, your deck may be excited to answer you. If you pause since you feel calm, your deck may want to reassure you. If you quit shuffling within seconds, your deck may sense your urgency."

      "title": "Choose the amount that feels right to access the wisdom of the cards.",
      "content": "Choose the amount that feels right to access the wisdom of the cards. First, fan out your cards or cut them and arrange them in stacks—make sure they're face-down. Draw just a single card, a random selection, or the right amount for a specific spread. Look over the cards and pick out the ones that you feel drawn to. Some cards may seem to \"glow\" or just strike you as very powerful. Some cards may have small details you find endearing, like nicks or creases. Some cards may soothe or calm you down when you look at them. Some cards may have \"jumped\" out of the deck after you shuffled them."

      "content": "Lay cards out in a formation that’s designed to address your query. If you just chose one card, that's okay—you've just performed a one-card spread. On the other hand, if you've pulled out multiple cards, then set up a specific spread. Invent your own by associating a separate theme—like \"the key to unlocking happiness\"—to each card, or try a popular spread: [3] X Research source For 3 cards, try a Mind - Body - Spirit or a Situation - Action - Outcome spread. For 5 cards, try a Spread For Deeper Intuition : Card 1: What is my higher self telling me? Card 2: What does my soul want me to know? Card 3: What are my spirit guides sharing with me? Card 4: What path should I take? Card 5: What should I welcome into my life? For 7 cards, try a Deep Dive Spread : Card 1: What is my divine purpose? Card 2: What is my greatest strength? Card 3: What do I need to release? Card 4: How do I step into my most authentic self? Card 5: What obstacle should I be aware of? Card 6: What should I invite into my life during my journey? Card 7: What am I moving toward right now?"

      "content": "Observe the imagery on the cards and interpret their messages. Notice what draws your attention right away—it can be a major symbol in the foreground, like a guardian angel, or a small detail in the background, like an apple tree. Also look for numbers or phrases. Then, focus on the unfiltered and honest feelings that come up for you. You might make comments like: [4] X Research source \"That apple tree reminds me of the color red and vitality.\" \"The number '8' makes me picture eternal love.\" \"The phrase 'crossing bridges' seems connected to a transition.\""

      "content": "See if the meanings associated with the cards resonate with you. Once you've engaged with the oracle cards on your own and avoided outside influences, open the guidebook that's included with your deck. Flip through the pages and read about the symbolism and messages according to the authors. Compare their perspective to your own: Write down insights you agree with. You might note, \"The concept that apples represent good health really resonates with me.\" Also share a different outlook. Maybe you'll say, \"I don't think crossing the bridge means I'm rejecting anyone—I just think it means I'll make wise choices.\""

Study the positions of your cards and the themes—like your divine purpose—and create your own lesson out of them: [5] X Research source \"I should pursue people romantically after I commit to my own health.\" \"I am called to lean into activism and speak up about what's right.\" \"I should move to a place where people share my values.\""

      "content": "Remove excess or negative energy so your future readings are clear. Select a method to wash away any influence from people who might've held or been around your deck. Use protective magic that banishes residual—leftover—energy. To fully connect with your deck, try cleansing techniques like these: [7] X Research source Bathe your deck in moonlight or sunlight. Hold your deck over an essential oil diffuser. Wrap your deck in silk or velvet. Place crystals around your deck for 3 hours. Smudge your deck with burnt herbs or incense. Visualize washing your deck with a purifying light."
