House mice really love to cozy up in “nests” that are made from loose, soft scraps of material around your home, like cotton, insulation, strips of paper, and fabric. Keep a close eye on the floor for small pieces of these materials around your home; if you spot some, there’s a good chance that there are rodents nearby. In general, all rodents prefer dark and isolated spots where they won’t be bothered. You’ll probably find a mouse nest in this kind of spot."
