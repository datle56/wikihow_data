      "title": "Wear comfortable clothing.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable clothing. The general admission floor is going to be hot and packed with people, so when it comes to dress, choose comfort over style. T-shirts, tank tops, shorts and jeans are safe bets. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Do not bring jackets or hoodies to the event.",
      "content": "Do not bring jackets or hoodies to the event. Even if it’s cold outside, the floor itself will be too hot for layers. Leave your coat in the car, and if you must bring a layer, choose a light sweater or flannel that you can tie around your waist."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear durable, close-toed shoes.",
      "content": "Wear durable, close-toed shoes. You’ll be standing and dancing for hours on end, so you’ll want to choose comfortable shoes. Flip-flops, sandals, high heels are bad ideas - your feet will ache, and your toes might get trampled! Instead, opt for sneakers, flats, or any other close-toed, comfortable style."
    },
    {
      "title": "Opt for contacts over glasses.",
      "content": "Opt for contacts over glasses. If you typically wear glasses, consider wearing contact lenses for the concert. General admission floors can get rowdy, and you don’t want to risk breaking or losing your glasses in the commotion. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply deodorant.",
      "content": "Apply deodorant. Regardless of whether the concert is inside or outside, the general admission floor is bound to be hot. Avoid stinking up the floor by applying deodorant before you go to the concert."
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat a meal before the event.",
      "content": "Eat a meal before the event. The concert experience will likely be long and exhausting, so you’ll want to fuel up before you face the crowds. Eat a substantial meal with plenty of carbs and protein, and be sure to drink plenty of water as well. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Pack a small bag of the essentials.",
      "content": "Pack a small bag of the essentials. A larger bag or backpack might get in the way on a packed general admission floor, so limit your personal items to a small purse, fanny pack, or drawstring backpack. Avoid bringing any valuables that can be lost, broken, or stolen. [4] X Research source Be sure to pack your tickets! Some other essential items include your phone, money, keys, and medication. Bring a water bottle, or plan on buying bottles at the concert to stay hydrated. If the concert is outdoors, bring a travel-sized container of sunscreen."

      "title": "Arrive up to 6 hours in advance to get a spot close to the stage.",
      "content": "Arrive up to 6 hours in advance to get a spot close to the stage. The earlier you arrive to the concert, the more likely you are to find a good spot on the floor. If you want a front-row spot for a large, sold-out event, it is recommended that you show up to the venue up to 6 hours early in order to secure your space."
    },
    {
      "title": "Arrive at least 1-2 hours early for any general admission event.",
      "content": "Arrive at least 1-2 hours early for any general admission event. If you’re not stoked on the front row, it’s still recommended that you show up at least 1-2 hours early in order to find a decent spot on the floor. Otherwise, you'll risk getting stuck in the back where you're unable to see the action onstage."
    },
    {
      "title": "Use the bathroom before you enter the floor.",
      "content": "Use the bathroom before you enter the floor. It's nearly impossible to get back to your original spot once you've left the floor, so it's best to visit the restroom before you enter. Besides, you won't want to miss any of the action once the show starts!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Secure a standing location with a clear view of the stage.",
      "content": "Secure a standing location with a clear view of the stage. Once you’ve entered the floor, scope out your surroundings to find a spot where you’ll be able to see the show. Try to place yourself behind someone shorter than you. If you’re on the taller end, be courteous to other concert-goers and look for a spot near the side or back of the crowd. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Choose a spot near the front and center for a mosh pit experience.",
      "content": "Choose a spot near the front and center for a mosh pit experience. If you want a rowdier floor experience, try to find a spot as close to the stage as possible. You'll be sure to get in on some moshing and crowd-surfing action!"

    {
      "title": "Find a spot near the side or back of the floor to avoid the mosh pit.",
      "content": "Find a spot near the side or back of the floor to avoid the mosh pit. If you're more interested in watching and listening to the show than you are in a sweaty mosh pit experience, opt for a spot a bit removed from the stage. Side and back spots on the floor are also ideal if you're concerned about you ability to enter or exit the floor without much hassle."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stand your ground.",
      "content": "Stand your ground. Once you find your spot, stand with your feet planted firmly on the ground at a shoulder’s width apart. This stance will help stabilize your balance and establish your personal space. The crowd will probably get rowdy, and people might try to push ahead of you, so it’s important to stand your ground in order to maintain your place."

      "title": "Locate the emergency exits.",
      "content": "Locate the emergency exits. Be sure you have a mental plan for how to leave the floor as quickly as possible in case of an emergency. If you're worried about your ability to enter or exit, consider choosing a spot on the floor closer to the exits. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Keep your money and valuables in a safe place.",
      "content": "Keep your money and valuables in a safe place. Packed crowds on the general admission floor are often prone to theft and pick-pocketing. Avoid getting targeted by keeping your money hidden and concealed at all times while you're on the floor. Keep your money in a small bag, purse, or fanny pack with zippered openings, and keep your bag on the front side of your body where you'll be able to keep an eye on it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be aware of the people around you.",
      "content": "Be aware of the people around you. Especially if you’re standing in or near a mosh pit, be aware of the people around you to avoid taking a stray fist or elbow to the face. Similarly, if you enjoy thrashing around at the height of a concert, take note of the bodies around you to avoid hurting anyone. [7] X Research source Watch out for crowd-surfers to avoid getting kicked in the head. Avoid violence at all costs. If someone pushes or shoves you, keep a cool head and assume it was an accident. If you accidentally shove into a person, be courteous and apologize."

    {
      "title": "Drink water throughout the show.",
      "content": "Drink water throughout the show. Nothing will stunt your fun on the floor like a bout of dehydration. You’ll be sweating a lot, so you'll need to replenish those fluids in order to keep having fun. Be sure to buy water bottles or bring your own onto the floor, and drink up in between songs and sets."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limit your alcohol intake.",
      "content": "Limit your alcohol intake. If you're consuming alcohol at the event, be sure drink in moderation. Getting drunk will put you at a greater risk of getting injured in the tussle of the crowd, so it's best to stick to 1-2 alcoholic beverages."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear earplugs.",
      "content": "Wear earplugs. Because standing room on the general admission floor tends to be close to the main speaker systems at concert venues, it's extremely important to protect your hearing while you're on the floor. Even if you're young and believe your eardrums are invincible, it's best to wear earplugs to be safe."
    },
    {
      "title": "Take breaks when necessary.",
      "content": "Take breaks when necessary. If you get hurt, feel claustrophobic, or need a breather from all the action, exit the floor and take a break from the concert. The floor can get rowdy, and if you’re hurt or exhausted, staying in the crowd will only make the problem worse. Take care of yourself throughout the show, even if that means losing your spot on the floor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Enjoy the concert!",
      "content": "Enjoy the concert! Dance, sing, move your body, and have fun! On the general admissions floor, no one will judge you for having a good time. Don’t be afraid to let loose and enjoy the moment."
