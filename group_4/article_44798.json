Apply an ice pack or even a bag of frozen vegetables to the finger. Or, dip your finger in cold water. Leave it there for 15 minutes, then let your finger get back up to room temperature.

      "title": "Buddy tape",
      "content": "Buddy tape the injured finger to keep it still as it heals. Taping your finger to an adjacent finger will keep it stabilized and immobile as it heals. To do this, hold your 2 fingers side by side, and use gauze or medical tape to wrap them firmly together (but not so firmly that you cut off circulation). Change the gauze or tape once a day, and leave the buddy tape on for 3 to 5 days. [4] X Research source To provide a little more support for your jammed finger, you can use a wooden craft stick along with the tape. After 3 to 5 days, take the tape off and see how your finger feels. If it’s still very sore or you can’t bend or straighten it, seek medical attention."

Keep your hand with the jammed finger steady on a table or counter, then grab the top half of your finger with your other hand. [7] X Research source Popping a jammed finger is usually easier if someone else does it for you. However, you can pop it yourself, too. If you don’t feel comfortable popping your own finger, visit a chiropractor. They can do a joint adjustment and assess your finger professionally. Some people recommend unjamming a finger by pulling it, while others are firmly against it. If you’re not sure whether you should pop your injured finger or not, talk to your doctor."
