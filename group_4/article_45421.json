      "content": "Turn the valve behind the toilet if it’s overflowing. Since you’ll be adding more water to the toilet bowl in just a second, it’s important to stop the flow of water into the bowl. Reach behind the toilet near the floor and turn the valve in a clockwise direction. If the valve is stuck, use a little bit of WD-40 to loosen it up. [1] X Research source After you’ve unclogged your toilet, simply turn the valve counterclockwise to turn the water back on."

      "content": "Heat a 1 gallon (3.8 L) pot of water. Turn your stove on high heat and place a water-filled pot onto the stove. Cover your pot with a lid and wait until the water heats up, but don’t let it boil (this should take about 5 minutes). If the water starts steaming or it gets above 120 °F (49 °C), it’s time to take it off the stove. [2] X Research source Pouring boiling water into the toilet can crack the wax ring around the toilet or even the toilet bowl itself. Get your water hot, but don’t let it boil. [3] X Research source If you’re worried about getting your water too hot, just use hot water from the tap."

If the clog is minor, the hot water may be enough to loosen it up all the way. [4] X Research source Depending on how clogged your toilet is, you may have to pour a little water in, stop, and then wait for the water to go down before pouring the rest."

      "content": "Pour about 8 ounces (230 g) of dish soap into the water. The dish soap will float to the bottom of the bowl because it is heavier and denser than water. Don’t be afraid to use too much—in this case, the more the better. [5] X Research source Use grease-fighting dish soap to break up the clog."

      "content": "Plunge your toilet if it's still clogged. Even if you've already tried to plunge the clog, dish soap can weaken it, so it's always worth a second shot! Place the plunger into the bowl directly over the hole. Press down sharply in short, fast strokes, and be sure to lift sharply to create suction. After 4 or 5 full strokes, lift the plunger on the last upward motion. [12] X Research source Run the plunger under hot water for 30 seconds before plunging to warm the rubber up. If the clog still doesn't come loose, call a plumber."
