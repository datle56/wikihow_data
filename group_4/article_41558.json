      "content": "Choose an airtight container. Storage containers that work well for dried mushrooms are plastic resealable bags and glass canning jars (such as Mason jars). The glass jars should have tight fitting, screw-on lids. If you are using resealable plastic bags, make sure that they are designed specifically for freezer use, rather than thinner sandwich bags. Because dried mushrooms will not be expanding in the freezer (as liquids will do) Mason jars are safe to use for freezer storage. [2] X Research source"

If you are using a resealable plastic bag, do your best to squeeze any excess air out of the bag before sealing it. If you bought the dried mushrooms in a vacuumed packed, sealed bag and are not planning on using them immediately, there is no need to re-package the mushrooms right away. However, as soon as you open the package and use a portion of the mushrooms, re-pack the remainder in an airtight container."

      "content": "Place the repackaged mushrooms into your fridge or freezer. Avoid putting weighty items on top of bags of dried mushrooms in your freezer, as they may get crushed. If you notice freezer burn develop on the dried mushrooms, they will likely still be usable, however, their texture might become a little rubbery."

However, as soon as you open the package and use a portion of the mushrooms, it is a good idea to find an airtight container for the remaining mushrooms. If you live in a particularly humid climate, you can consider using oxygen absorbing packets in your resealable bags or jars. These packets contain iron powder which absorbs most of the oxygen out of the packaging they are in, which can keep food items from spoiling for a longer portion of time. Oxygen absorbing packets are not totally necessary to store with mushrooms, but aren’t a bad idea, particularly if you are storing the mushrooms at room temperature in a kitchen cabinet.

      "content": "Place the dried mushrooms in the back of the cabinet. Dried mushrooms, like their fully-hydrated counterparts, are very sensitive to light and moisture. It is best to keep the dried mushrooms in the rear of a storage cabinet where they are less likely to come in contact with light."
