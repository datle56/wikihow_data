      "content": "Start by cleaning the chain. If your motorcycle has a chain, getting the dirt and grease off of it first is a smart move. This keeps the grime from splashing all over the rest of your bike while you’re trying to clean it. Use an approved chain degreaser if you can find one at your local shop. Spray it on the chain to loosen debris, then wipe it away with a clean cloth. [3] X Research source WD-40 will also work as a solvent to loosen grease and dirt. Make sure to apply lubricant to your chain again once you are done cleaning your motorcycle."

Vinyl seats are quite tough, but can fade and crack over time. Use an approved vinyl protectant to halt these problems. Leather seats are more delicate, but using a leather care cream will protect yours. Protectants for vinyl and leather can be found at any auto or motorcycle supply store. Do not use detergents on leather."
