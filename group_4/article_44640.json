      "title": "Apply rubbing alcohol.",
      "content": "Apply rubbing alcohol. You can apply rubbing alcohol to your skin to dissolve the poison ivy or poison oak oils. Because the toxic oil from the plant seeps into your skin gradually, adding rubbing alcohol to the area will prevent the further spread. It won't provide immediate relief, but it will stem the spread. You can also use an over-the-counter cleanser like Tecnu or Zanfel. Only apply the rubbing alcohol in a well-ventilated room, preferably with an open window or vent. The fumes from the rubbing alcohol can make you feel lightheaded."

      "title": "Rinse the area with cool water.",
      "content": "Rinse the area with cool water. Never use warm or hot water, as this will open your pores and allow more of the toxins to sink in. If you're able, keep the affected area under cold running water for 10-15 minutes. If you're outdoors in the woods when you're exposed to poison ivy or poison oak, then you can rinse your body off in a running stream."

    {
      "title": "Completely clean the area.",
      "content": "Completely clean the area. Regardless of the location on your body, make sure that it was thoroughly rinsed with water. If you touched the area on your body at all or the poison affected your hands, scrub under your fingernails with a toothbrush in case any oil from the plants was deposited beneath them. Throw the toothbrush away after you're done. Use a dish soap that is used for oil removal to rinse the area of your rash. Because the toxins have been transferred to your skin in the form of an oil, using an oil-obliterating dish soap may help to reduce the spread of the rash. You can use any brand that's labeled for oil-fighting or breaking up oil. If you use a towel to dry yourself after washing the affected area, be sure to wash the towel with the rest of your exposed clothes immediately after use. In some cases, you may have to throw out the towel."

      "title": "Don't scratch the rash.",
      "content": "Don't scratch the rash. Even though the rash is not contagious, you could break the skin and allow bacteria to enter the wound. Don't touch or pop any blisters that may form, even if they are weeping. If necessary, cut your nails short and cover the area to keep yourself from scratching it."

    {
      "title": "Cool off the exposed area.",
      "content": "Cool off the exposed area. Apply cold compresses or apply an ice pack for 10 to 15 minutes. Make sure that you don't apply ice directly to your skin; always wrap your ice pack or compress in a towel before application. Also, allow the area to air dry instead of rubbing it with a towel if you get your rash wet. If you need the area to dry faster, it's okay to pat it dry. However, never rub it."

Khadavi, MD, FACAAI Board Certified Allergist Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Don't do this immediately after contact with the plant (as rubbing the lotion could spread the oils), but after a few hours or days when the itching feeling begins. Capsaicin cream, usually sold in drugstores labeled for arthritis pain relief, burns a bit at first but suppresses itching for hours. If you're in a hot, outdoor environment, hydrocortisone cream may not work. Try capsaicin cream instead."

      "content": "Take antihistamines. [4] X Expert Source Alan O. Khadavi, MD, FACAAI Board Certified Allergist Expert Interview. 26 August 2020. Antihistamines are medications that treat for allergies, and since poison oak and ivy cause allergic reactions on contact, taking these drugs may offer minor relief. Antihistamines generally offer only mild relief from the symptoms of poison ivy, but if you take oral medications before bedtime, their combination of anti-itch and drowsiness-inducing effects can help you get some rest. Only take these orally, and do not apply the creams to your poison ivy as this can worsen your rash."

If you need a quick fix without running to the store, blend a cup of oatmeal in a food processor or blender and add it to your warm bathwater. Avoid using water that is very hot, especially right after being exposed to the poison as this will open your pores. [5] X Research source"

Leave the baking soda paste to dry, and allow it to crack or flake off. Reapply this paste every few hours for the best results. Keep in mind that baking soda can irritate your skin, especially if you're sensitive to it. It's best to only try this if you know you aren't sensitive to baking soda."
