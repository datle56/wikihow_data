      "content": "Shake your hands until the numbness subsides. If numbness persists for longer than 30 seconds after changing positions, try shaking your hands at the wrists. Sometimes, median nerve compression (also known as carpal tunnel syndrome) caused by prolonged wrist extension can be alleviated by gently shaking the hand. [4] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Avoid shaking your hands so hard that your wrists pop or crack. [5] X Research source If you sleep on your hand, your nerves and circulation are compressed for a long duration. Numbness might stick around longer than if you held your hand in an awkward position for a few minutes."

[7] X Research source Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common nerve condition related to numbness in the hands and forearms. Less common causes include fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, and spinal disorders.

Your doctor can perform tests to accurately diagnose nerve compression or damage. They’ll examine your forearms and hands, have you move your hands and fingers, and, if necessary, perform an x-ray. [8] X Research source Numbness in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers (and the side of your palm with these fingers) is a symptom of carpal tunnel syndrome. If your ring and little fingers become numb when you bend your elbow, cubital tunnel syndrome could be the issue. Numbness or pain concentrated at the top of the hand could be due to a compressed radial nerve."
