      "content": "Your call was sent to voicemail, either automatically or manually. The recording you're hearing is the default voicemail greeting for most cell phone owners who haven't set a custom greeting . \"When a person doesn’t answer their phone or sends a call to voicemail, the call is actually \"forwarded\" to their voicemail inbox, which allows you to leave a message . There are many reasons why you may hear the \"Your call has been forwarded\" message, including: The person you're calling has turned their phone off. The person doesn't have a good cellular signal. They may have turned on Do Not Disturb or airplane mode . The person may have blocked your phone number. They may have rejected or declined the call. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Hearing \"Your call has been forwarded\" does not mean you are blocked. It usually just means that the person you're calling didn't answer your call. However, if the person has blocked your phone number , your call may be forwarded to voicemail automatically, depending on how the person blocked you. [2] X Research source If the person blocked you through their Android or iPhone settings, your call will be forwarded to voicemail automatically instead of ringing through. In this case, you may hear \"Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system\" (or \"to an automated voice messaging system\" for some carriers) or the person's custom greeting. You'll be able to leave a voicemail, even if you've been blocked. [3] X Research source If you're blocked through the person's mobile carrier, you may either hear the \"Your call has been forwarded\" message, or a message that says \"Your call cannot be completed as dialed.\" In most cases, if you've been blocked by the carrier, you won't be able to leave voicemail. [4] X Research source Even though \"Your call has been forwarded\" could mean you've been blocked, there are many other reasons why your call might be sent to voicemail. Don't assume you've been blocked if you hear this recording—the recording is extremely common and typically nothing to worry about."

      "content": "The person you're calling likely didn't receive the call. If you hear \"Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system\" without hearing a ring first, the person's phone may be turned off, or they could be in an area where they don't have a good cell phone signal. It's also possible the person has blocked your calls , but this isn't always the case. [5] X Research source If you only hear one ring, a half-ring, or two rings before hearing \"Your call has been forwarded,\" the person you're calling may have manually sent your call to voicemail. The person may have also rejected the call, either on purpose or accidentally."
