This difference causes a person to put more weight on the front end second metatarsal, which can lead to calluses and pain. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source [16] X Research source Morton’s toe can also lead to gait issues, as the foot may need to make extra adjustments in order to walk properly.
