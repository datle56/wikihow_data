    {
      "title": "Place your face directly in front of the stereogram.",
      "content": "Place your face directly in front of the stereogram. Whether you’re looking at a printed stereogram or one on your computer monitor, get as close to the image as you comfortably can. Don’t worry about focusing on it; in fact, try to look through the image, not at it. [1] X Research source It's usually easier to view the stereogram in printed form rather than on a monitor, so if you're having trouble seeing it on your computer, print out a copy to work with instead. If you normally wear glasses or contact lenses to help with your vision, wear them when you look at the stereogram."
    },
    {
      "title": "Slowly start to back up.",
      "content": "Slowly start to back up. As you move away from the stereogram, your natural instinct will be to try to focus on the image. Keep your eyes from doing so by continuing to look through the image as you step back. If your eyes start to focus on the image at any point, move closer to the stereogram again, and repeat the process. [2] X Research source Don’t get discouraged if your eyes keep managing to focus on the image as you back up. It’s normal for it to take several tries before you get it right. It can help to pretend that the stereogram is a window and you're trying to look at something through it to avoid focusing on the image itself."
    },
    {
      "title": "Move your head back and forth.",
      "content": "Move your head back and forth. At the right distance, you’ll begin to see that the patterns overlap one another and blurry 3D images may begin to appear. Continue to look at the blurry 3D image at the same distance and in the same position. It will eventually sharpen and come into focus. [3] X Research source Remember to have patience. It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for your eyes to naturally bring the hidden stereogram image into focus. If you lose focus on the image at any point, repeat the process from the beginning to refocus your eyes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find an object to focus on.",
      "content": "Find an object to focus on. With the stereogram image in your hands, identify an item in the room that you can gaze at, such as a photo on the wall, a vase on a table, or a lamp. Even though you’re holding the stereogram, make sure to focus exclusively on the object that you’ve chosen. [4] X Research source The object that you focus on doesn’t necessarily have to be right at eye level, but it’s best not to choose an item that’s too high or low. You should be able to look at it comfortably while standing. Make sure that the item isn't too small either because it may be more difficult to focus on a smaller object. The easier it is to maintain your focus on the item, the better chance you'll have of seeing the stereogram image."
    },
    {
      "title": "Raise the stereogram.",
      "content": "Raise the stereogram. While you’re still focusing on your chosen object, you should begin to lift the image until it eventually blocks the item. However, you should still keep your focus on the object, not the stereogram. If you find yourself switching your focus to the stereogram, start the process over again. [5] X Research source When the stereogram is blocking the object that you're focusing on, you should be trying to look \"through\" it. That will keep you from focusing on the stereogram, so your eyes are ready to see the 3D image."
    },
    {
      "title": "Change the distance between you and the object.",
      "content": "Change the distance between you and the object. While still holding the stereogram so it blocks the object, move closer and further away from it to try a variety of distances. At the right distance, if you keep your gaze focused on the object, the hidden image in the stereogram will appear. [6] X Research source The hidden image will likely be blurry at first. Continue looking at it at the same distance until the image eventually becomes sharp and clear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the stereogram in front of you.",
      "content": "Hold the stereogram in front of you. For the best results, you should have the image approximately one foot in front of you. As with the other methods, don’t try to focus on stereogram. Instead, try focusing on an object or even an imaginary dot behind it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Relax your eyes.",
      "content": "Relax your eyes. With the stereogram in front of you, look at the image but allow your eyes to naturally diverge so it becomes blurry or even doubled. This can be a difficult thing to master, but it should be similar to what happens when you’ve been reading for a long time and your eyes can no longer focus on the words. [7] X Research source If you’re having trouble relaxing your eyes, try “daydreaming” as you look at the stereogram. That can often help you naturally unfocus your gaze. If you relax your eyes, they naturally look apart, which is why the images you see are blurry. To see the stereogram's hidden image, you need to allow your eyes to diverge at different angles until you find the right one for the image to appear."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wait for the image to come into focus.",
      "content": "Wait for the image to come into focus. Continue you look at the stereogram with an unfocused gaze until you begin to see a blurry 3D image take shape. It make take a few minutes, so it’s important to be patient. Eventually, it will sharpen until you can see the stereogram image clearly. [8] X Research source It may help to \"blink\" at the stereogram. Close one of your eyes and look at it with just the other one. When the image starts to come into focus, open the eye that you'd previously closed to help make it sharper and clearer."
