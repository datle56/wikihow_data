      "content": "People with Type B personalities are usually more laid-back than Type As. According to Oliver, personality types “refer to general patterns in how people behave, approach tasks, and handle stress.” In many ways, the Type B personality is the opposite of the Type A personality. People with Type B personalities tend to be easygoing and laid-back, and they often work toward their goals without a sense of urgency. They don’t often feel the need to prove themselves to others and have low levels of competitiveness. On the other hand, the Type A personality can seem more uptight. Oliver lists some Type A traits: “Competitive and driven, goal-oriented and highly motivated to succeed, often thrives on deadlines but can be impatient or stressed when things move slowly, may struggle with perfectionism or workaholic tendencies, [and] typically prefers structure and control.” In summary, Oliver says, “Type A personalities are go-getters who love structure but can burn out, while Type B personalities are more easygoing and take life as it comes. Most people fall somewhere in between the two extremes!” If you want to know which personality type you are, take our quiz !"
