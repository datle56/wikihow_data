      "content": "Make a slip knot . For the very first crochet stitch, you need to create a slip knot on your finger. [2] X Research source Lay the yarn over your left index finger. Holding the yarn from the free end, wrap it around your finger — going under then over — making sure to cross over the original yarn. When you’ve finished, the original yarn should be on the right, and the free end should be on the left. Both the free end and the end attached to the skein should be pulled down. Pull the “original yarn” loop on the right up slightly. Cross it over the “free end” loop so they switch positions. Pull the “free end” loop, which is now on the right, up as you remove your index finger from the knot. Pull to tighten the knot."

      "content": "Hold the yarn and hook properly. [3] X Research source When crocheting, you will always be working toward the left, so you will hold the yarn in your left hand and the crochet hook in your right hand. Make sure to work with the yarn that is attached to the skein, not the free end. The crochet hook should have a flattened section, where you should place the thumb and index finger of your right hand. Wrap the rest of your fingers comfortably around the lower half of the crochet hook, away from the actual hook/head. Lay the yarn across the fingers of your left hand. Raise your index finger and wrap your pinkie and ring fingers around the yarn. You will use the raising of the index finger and the grip of the pinkie and ring fingers on the yarn to create the necessary yarn tension. Let there be enough tension on the yarn. But let it be loose enough to slide through your fingers while crocheting.

From that position, move the head over the yarn and back to the front, catching the yarn in the hook as you do so. Pull the yarn through the loop being stabilized by your middle finger and thumb."

If you're not following a pattern, make sure you keep track of (count and write down) how many chains you're creating per row, so your end product has an even edge."
