After 1 to 3 pumps, pulls, or rotations, let go and wait for the basket to stop spinning. [8] X Research source Salad spinners with knobs and handles typically require you to manually spin the basket using circular motions. Salad spinners with strings use a single pull to get spinning. Salad spinners with pumps need you to push a button-like mechanism repeatedly. If you spin your salad and it’s not drying, drain the water from the bowl and try again. It may take a few cycles to get completely dry depending on your spinner and the amount of lettuce."

Use a screwdriver or butterknife to move and rotate the 3 plastic lock tabs on the outside of the enclosed mechanism. Pull the pump off the lid so you have 3 pieces: the pump, lid, and spring. Clean the parts using soap and water, making sure they dry completely before reassembling. Put the spring back on the lid around the center pole.
