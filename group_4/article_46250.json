Both manual and sport modes enable the user input of paddle shifters to change gear. Some vehicles may have both manual mode and sport mode available. Regardless, both modes will still support paddle shifter input. [2] X Research source What is sequential mode? Sequential mode is a rare option on some sports and racing cars. It’s functionally identical to sport mode, except it turns your transmission into an F1-style gearbox where the car cannot shift up or down by more than one gear at a time."

The upshift paddle is usually the paddle on the right and, in most cars, has a + on it. You'll notice an audible change in the engine speed as well as the sensation of changing gear.

If you want to maintain that speed for a great distance, be sure to keep shifting up gears until your tachometer value is between 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm. Keeping your value within this range will ensure that you maintain good fuel efficiency while at your desired cruising speed.

For spirited performance driving, you'll want to pick a shift point closer to your redline limiter. On the tachometer, this is indicated usually by red tick marks and red lettering.

In fact, there are two clutches! Use whichever clutch is on the opposite side of the shift button or shift pedal to change gears manually. To do this, simply press the clutch pedal on either side to activate it. [13] X Research source F1 gearboxes are semi-automatic, so you can completely ignore the clutch if you don’t want to change gears manually. Do you have two sets of pedals? If you have paddle shifters and paddle clutches, the clutches are on the bottom."

They’re buttons, located on the front of the wheel. Look for the (usually color-coded) buttons marked where your thumbs would naturally sit on the wheel. [14] X Research source Like traditional paddle shifters, the button on the left shifts down, and the button on the right shifts up. Do you not have shift buttons? Some (especially older) F1 wheels have the traditional paddles on the back of the wheel. If your wheel has pedal shifters, the left is down, and the right is up. What makes the F1-style gearbox/shifter unique? F1-style gearboxes are sequential, which means you can’t shift over/past a gear. You must move either up or down one gear at a time. Also, these gearboxes are semi-automatic, which means they shift automatically via the on-board computer unless another input is provided. [15] X Research source"
