      "content": "Prepare the fabric or clothing that you plan to use. Mark where you would like the hem to be using a pin or any other means while you are wearing the pants. Flip the clothing article inside out to expose the inside of the garment. Using a ruler and a marking pen, mark where the pants will be folded. If you donâ€™t have a washable pen or air erasable pen, chalk is a good substitute."

      "content": "Cut the item a little longer than your desired length. Remember you will need to fold it and then apply the hem tape over. Depending on your tape width it can vary. Usually, it's about 25mm or 1 inch."

      "title": "Cut your adhesive tape to the length of the hem of the pants you will be covering.",
      "content": "Cut your adhesive tape to the length of the hem of the pants you will be covering. Cut a little more than necessary. Half an inch is more than enough. Depending on your hem tape, you will soak the tape in water. It is recommended to soak for 3-5 minutes. After it is soaked, take out and apply the adhesive side over the raw hem. The adhesive side is the one with the white woven strings. It will look shinier on the sides than on the non-adhesive side. Other hem tapes do not need soaking. Check the instructions that came with it to confirm. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Place the adhesive side down over the raw hem.",
      "content": "Place the adhesive side down over the raw hem. Place the tape near the edge of the cut hem, straight and covering all of the edges."

    {
      "title": "Press the hem tape.",
      "content": "Press the hem tape. If your material is not cotton, it is recommended to use a press cloth in between the iron and your item. Using your iron on medium heat (150*C or 302*F) press on the hem tape. Do not slide the iron. Only press applying your weight for about 10 seconds. Move on to the next section."

      "title": "After you have completed the iron presses, wait for the material to cool.",
      "content": "After you have completed the iron presses, wait for the material to cool. If you happen to make a mistake, take a damp press cloth and iron over the hem tape. After it has heated, you may peel the tape off gently. There may be residue left so it's best to try again with fresh tape. [3] X Research source"
