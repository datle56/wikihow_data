      "title": "Watch for contradictions in speech.",
      "content": "Watch for contradictions in speech. A psychopath may end a conversation with a statement that opposes what they said at the beginning. Dishonesty and pathological lying is a sign of psychopathy. The person may talk about how disrespectful it is that your coworker always shows up late and does things they are not supposed to, and then moments later the person will break the rules without apology. [4] X Research source The contradictions may not occur within the same conversation, so keep track of what is said over time. Log in a journal important information that you think might later be contradicted."

    {
      "title": "Double-check what is said.",
      "content": "Double-check what is said. Psychopaths talk excessively about the people in their lives because they view them as extensions of themselves. A psychopath will lie about the people in their life; they will even lie about their children. [5] X Research source Psychopaths are prone to giving out half-truths or disinformation. They have no problem keeping important information away from you. If the person has told you stories of betrayal or tragedy to explain their damaged family, friend, or romantic relationships, see if you can verify these stories independently."

      "title": "Take note of scapegoating.",
      "content": "Take note of scapegoating. A psychopath refuses to take responsibility for their own actions and will blame others for things they have done. [6] X Research source If there is irrefutable evidence that they are at fault, they may then admit it, but will show no remorse. [7] X Research source A psychopath will also try very hard to control the narrative by professing an altered version of events, which may be very different from what you experienced. This can cause you to question yourself and is known as \"gaslighting.\" On the other hand, because the psychopath displays a grandiose sense of self-worth, they may brag about or inflate their achievements, or even take credit for the work of others."

      "title": "Watch for quick changes in conversation.",
      "content": "Watch for quick changes in conversation. Notice if they quickly and smoothly change topics when you broach a subject that might reveal their anti-sociality. They may rapidly dismiss discussions of their odd behavior by accusing you of causing too much drama, or by insisting that you are mentally ill and need professional help. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Assess reactions to emotionally troublesome events.",
      "content": "Assess reactions to emotionally troublesome events. Because they lack empathy, psychopaths may respond to hearing of emotionally troubling events in a bland or robotic way, or in a way that seems forced and artificial. [9] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. [10] X Research source For example, a psychopath may repeatedly express their disappointment with words only, but in a way that lacks emotion. Psychopaths, upon hearing troubling news, may make no real effort to resolve the issue, no matter how much they talk about it. However, they may also have a very strong reaction when you least expect it. This could be due to fear of being caught, taking offense to something minor due to their poor self-esteem, or misreading a situation and thinking they should \"fake\" a response. Reader Poll: We asked 2574 wikiHow readers and 50% of them agreed that the most telling behavior of a psychopath is a lack of empathy . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Watch for signs of self-victimization.",
      "content": "Watch for signs of self-victimization. A psychopath may attempt to toy with your emotions by making you feel sorry for them. Watch for signs such as tones of voice and deflecting of blame to gain your sympathy. This is another way for them to deny responsibility of their own actions. [11] X Research source Watch for this manipulative behavior especially when the person needs an excuse as to why they made a faux pas or blunder (e.g., \"forgot\" your birthday). Another red flag is if they make everything about them and how hard they have it, without ever apologizing or taking responsibility."

      "title": "Assess how often you are questioned.",
      "content": "Assess how often you are questioned. If you want to spot a prosocial psychopath, keep track of each time they bug you with questions about how you would act in certain emotion-inducing situations. This may indicate that, because they lack empathy and a conscience, they don't naturally feel what is normal or appropriate in some situations and have to get the data elsewhere. For example, they may ask: \"What would you do if you came out of your apartment and saw me hiding in the bushes?\" This is something a normal person would not need to ask."

      "content": "Analyze desire to move quickly into a close relationship. If you are thinking of getting into a relationship with someone but you are worried they might be a psychopath, try to get a sense of how fast they want to move. There are several signs that might indicate psychopathy: Do they, after no time at all, call you endearing terms? Do they insist that you should freely bring them into your circle of trust? Do they want you to share living quarters or share a business venture very soon after meeting?"

      "title": "Look for drastic changes in attention given to you.",
      "content": "Look for drastic changes in attention given to you. A psychopath may set up a dynamic in which they lavish you with attention, then inexplicably give you the cold shoulder. When you return to their good graces, you experience maximum elation and feel high from the boost of dopamine (the \"love\" chemical) and endorphins. [12] X Research source They manipulate you into pretty much being addicted to them, so you repeatedly forgive whatever transgressions they perpetrated against you."
