      "title": "Consume a high calorie diet to help you absorb more nutrients.",
      "content": "Consume a high calorie diet to help you absorb more nutrients. You'll likely need to eat more food to meet your nutritional needs because your body isn't absorbing everything you eat. Talk to your doctor or dietitian to set a daily calorie goal. Then, eat enough food that consist of high fat and protein to give you the calories you need. If you're at a healthy weight or overweight, your doctor may give you a moderately higher calorie goal. However, you may need to go on a very high calorie diet if you're consistently losing weight or are already underweight. Your calorie goals may change over your course of treatment."

This might help reduce digestive problems that make it harder for you to eat enough food to balance out your malabsorption. Common triggers include dairy, gluten, soy, wheat, sugary foods, and high-fat foods.
