      "content": "Fold your sling. Before you can master the different methods for wrapping your baby in a sling, you need to learn how to fold and secure the sling itself. If your sling does not have rings, you’ll cross the fabric and secure it with a knot. To begin, fold the entire length of the fabric so that it isn’t as wide. Do not twist the sling. You want it smooth and even."

First, put the side of the sling with the rings along the shoulder opposite to the hip or arm you typically use to carry your child. In other words, if you usually carry your baby on your right side, then set the rings on your left shoulder. Let the part of the sling without rings fall freely down your back. [3] X Research source"
