      "content": "Notice how she flirts. Just because she flirts with your boyfriend does not mean she’s trying to steal him. She might flirt with him to build up her own self-esteem or because she wants to be friends with him. Does she flirt with everyone, or just with your boyfriend specifically? If she generally comes off as flirty, it’s doubtful that your boyfriend is a special case. If she makes special effort to flirt with your boyfriend, she might have a crush on him.Here are some flirty behaviors to watch for: She puts her hand on his arm or touches him frequently. She makes eye contact with him. [1] X Research source She laughs at all of his jokes. She moves her body so that she faces him. She initiates conversation with him. [2] X Research source"

Make note of when they spend time alone together. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source Look out for the following things: She invites him for outings where it will be just the two of them, such as the movies or lunch at a coffee shop. She asks him to do her favors (such as change a lightbulb) where he would go somewhere alone with her. She asks him to go on walks with her. When he says he’s going to do something, such as get a glass of water in the next room, she invites herself and goes with him."

      "content": "See if she texts or calls him frequently. Is your boyfriend secretive about his texts with her? Does she call or text him more than you would with a platonic friend? Although this communication does not mean that she wants to be more than friends, it can be a red flag. [5] X Research source If you see your boyfriend texting someone frequently, ask him who it is. If he is dodgy or defensive about it, it might be her. Going through your boyfriend’s texts might be an invasion of privacy. If he seems as though he is lying, have a conversation with him about trust."

[11] X Research source Here are some examples of specific situations that might make you uneasy: The girl touches your boyfriend in what you think is an inappropriate way.

      "content": "Set boundaries for the relationship. Each couple has their own \"rule book\" — some couples would see going to the movies with another girl as highly inappropriate, whereas other couples would consider this and other intimate contact okay. Having an open conversation about what each partner expects is key to guiding acceptable behaviors. Be clear about your needs — your boyfriend may have no idea his friendship or flirtation with this other girl upsets you. [12] X Research source [13] X Research source Work on defining these expectations with your boyfriend. You might say something like, \"I don't want you to give up your friendships with other girls, but I would appreciate it if your focus is on me when we spend time together, and not on texting her.\" Don't set boundaries that are vague or manipulative. Something like, \"I want to spend more time with you\" isn't specific enough. Try saying, “I want to spend more time together just the two of us. Could we designate a date night?” Let your boyfriend know what is and is not acceptable to you. If you are not comfortable with him giving another girl a back massage, let him know that feels disrespectful to your relationship. Be open to listening to your boyfriend's perspective and his boundaries as well."

Here are some examples of what you could say: “I feel really uncomfortable when you choose to go to the movies alone with her on Friday night. I would like to go with you or would prefer you go in a group with other people, too.” “I feel hurt when we're spending time together and you spend that time texting with her and laughing at your inside jokes.”"
