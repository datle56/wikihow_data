Always thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water before and after touching the area. This includes before and after you start the process of draining the boil. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Press a warm compress onto the boil for 20-30 minutes.",
      "content": "Press a warm compress onto the boil for 20-30 minutes. This treatment helps draw the pus out of a boil so it drains safely. Take a towel or washcloth and soak it with warm water. Press it against the boil and hold it there for 20-30 minutes. Rewet it if you need to. [3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source While a wet towel is best, you could also use a warm pack wrapped in a towel for a similar effect. If the boil is in a hard to reach spot, try taking a warm bath instead of trying to hold a compress against it."

      "title": "Repeat this treatment 3-4 times per day until the boil starts draining.",
      "content": "Repeat this treatment 3-4 times per day until the boil starts draining. Soaking the boil won’t produce an immediate result, so be patient. You’ll have to repeat the treatment for a few days in a row. After a few days, the boil will come to a head and start draining on its own.

This is the pus coming to the surface."

      "content": "Clean the pus that drains from the boil. Once the pus starts draining, wipe it up right away with a clean tissue or paper towel. Then wash the area gently with warm water and antibacterial soap. Blot the area clean with a dry, clean towel when you’re finished.

These can irritate the area and cause more pain."

      "title": "Continue using heat for 3 days after the boil ruptures to drain all the pus.",
      "content": "Continue using heat for 3 days after the boil ruptures to drain all the pus. When the boil starts draining, that doesn’t mean all the pus is out yet. Ensure the boil is empty by continuing the draining treatment for 3 days after the boil ruptures. This removes any remaining pus so the boil doesn’t come back. [6] X Research source You’ll probably be tempted to squeeze the boil when it starts draining, but resist that urge. You could end up pushing the pus deeper into your skin and making the infection worse. The boil might look a bit more irritated and red right after it starts draining because the skin is broken. However, it should start shrinking within a few days as the pus drains. If the inflammation doesn't clear up in a few days, you might have an infection, so see your doctor for an exam."

This shouldn't cause much pain, but could leave your skin open for infections. Cover the area with sterile gauze pads or a bandage until it heals. This prevents bacteria from entering or exiting the boil. [8] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source Make sure the area is dry before you cover it. Moisture can help bacteria grow. If you use a sticky bandage, make sure only the non-sticky part touches the boil. Otherwise, it could rupture when you pull the bandage off."

      "content": "Change the bandage at least once a day. The bandage could trap bacteria, so change it regularly. Remove it carefully and put a new one on at least once a day. The best time to do this is the evening because the bandage will pick up bacteria throughout the day. [9] X Research source Also change the bandage any time it gets wet or blood soaks through it."
