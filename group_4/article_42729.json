If you spot a girl across the room who keeps looking in your direction, smiling and making eye contact are great ways to let her know you’re interested, too.

      "content": "Look for opportunities to talk with her when she’s alone. Watch for times when she’s by herself and approach her if it seems like a convenient time. Since she likes you, she might even try to create these types of opportunities, such as walking away from a group at an event or approaching you when you’re on your own. [3] X Research source For example, you might approach her between classes at school or during your lunch break at work. Assuming you already have her number , you could also text her to find out a good time to meet up, such as by saying, “Hey! I was hoping we could hang out sometime. Are you free after school on Friday?”"

[4] X Research source Try saying something like, “Hey, I have a question about that math assignment we just got, can we go talk about that for a minute?” Then, when you get her alone, you can say, “That was actually just an excuse to talk to you alone for a few minutes.” Or, you could say something like, “It’s so loud in here. Do you want to go sit outside for a little while and talk?” You could also text her something to get her away from the crowd, such as “Meet me on the patio in 5 minutes! I need a break from all the noise and I’d love to chat with you.” Make sure that you introduce yourself if you’ve never talked with her before. A simple, “Hi! My name is Greg,” is fine."

      "content": "Join a conversation with her and her friends if you can’t get her alone. If she never seems to be on her own, you might need to dive into a conversation with her and her friends to start getting to know her.

      "content": "Make small talk about your surroundings. Turning to your surroundings can be an easy way to start a conversation, and since she already likes you, she probably won’t mind if you start the conversation off this way. Make a comment about your surroundings and then ask her a question about what you just commented on to get the ball rolling.

What about you? What do you think of this place?”"

      "content": "Talk about your day and ask about hers if you’re not sure what to say. Discussing your day-to-day activities with a girl who likes you and finding out about hers is another way to keep the conversation going, whether she is an old friend or a new acquaintance. Try giving her a brief recap of your day and then ask what she did so far today. She’ll probably be thrilled that you care enough to ask. [7] X Research source For example, you could say something like, “I have had a crazy day so far. I almost got hit by a car on my way to work, had a presentation to give and I was really nervous, and then went to my HIIT class after work and I dropped my phone and cracked the screen! It’s nice to be out relaxing now. What did you do today?” Remember to keep the conversation light, friendly, and entertaining. Avoid telling the girl anything too personal or that might be a turn-off. Even if she already likes you, it is possible to change her mind by sharing unappealing information about yourself.

I hope that’s okay with you.” Avoid telling her you're not interested in her in front of other people because this can make her feel embarrassed and hurt her feelings more. Make sure that you tell her this when you are alone with her and no one else can overhear your conversation."
