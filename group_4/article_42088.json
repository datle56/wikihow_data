Even if you're used to hitting the snooze button a few times before you finally get up, if you're going on little to no sleep, that snooze button will do you more harm than good. Those brief moments of light sleeping will only make you feel more tired, and you also run the risk of sleeping through your alarm. [1] X Research source Instead of hitting the snooze, set your alarm for the latest possible moment you can wake up. That way you'll get as much uninterrupted sleep as possible, even if it's only a few hours. Reader Poll: We asked 1394 wikiHow readers what they found most helpful for establishing a morning routine, and 55% of them said Setting an alarm. [Take Poll] Hitting snooze only makes it harder to get up because you aren't sticking to your routine."

Instead, have a light breakfast of whole grains and protein, with a little fresh fruit.

Go to source For example, you might have a piece of whole-wheat toast smeared with avocado and an apple or an orange. Yogurt is also a good breakfast option. If you've had little to no sleep, you'll likely be craving sugary foods and simple carbs, so it may take a little self-discipline to force yourself to eat right. A small cup of coffee or tea with breakfast is fine, but try to avoid overloading on caffeine after a night with no sleep. It'll just leave you jittery and you'll end up more tired than before."

It's typically a good idea to let those around you know that you're coming off of an all-nighter â€” especially people who work closely with you or depend on you. You don't have to go into personal details if you don't want to, but at least let them know that you're not at 100%. [5] X Research source If there's anything in particular that you want them to do to help you out, let them know. For example, if you have a secretary or assistant, you may ask them to hold all of your calls.

If you get the important things done, your boss may take pity on you and let you leave a little earlier.

For example, if you're a first responder or work in the medical field, you may have to make life-or-death decisions on a regular basis. If you have that kind of job, it's probably best to call out if possible, rather than risk someone's life or health by making a bad decision while exhausted from lack of sleep. If you are faced with a relatively high-stakes work issue, do what you can to take your time and work through the options objectively and logically. See if you can get other coworkers to pitch in and help you out."

If you're only doing routine work that doesn't require a lot of brainpower, you can afford to zone out a little. If this isn't possible, take the time you need to make sure your work is done properly. If you can, have a coworker look over what you've done before you submit it. For example, if you work in accounting or bookkeeping, you might have a coworker double-check your numbers before you submit them."
