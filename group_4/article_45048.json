Right now, AOD on iPhone means that your notifications are constantly displayed in their entirety, while Android users only have an icon of the app for that notification, which isn't a privacy issue. You can, however, change notifications to only show when your iPhone is unlocked or never , but you also won't get push notifications as instantly as you'd like. You can also change notifications so previews don't share your text message, which might keep someone sitting next to you from reading your screen.

To change the notification settings for a specific app, like Messages, scroll down and select it from the list of apps in the Notifications menu."

Android avoids the potential for screen burn-in since the clock and notifications blink around the screen, but iPhone's AOD has static information. iPhone also has OLED screens, which are prone to screen burn-in. You can either fix a burned in screen yourself or have a professional do it . But you can avoid AOD burn-in by either disabling the AOD feature or by turning your phone face-down when you don't need to see the AOD."

So this really isn't too much of an issue for Android users, but iPhone users can avoid this being a distraction by using focus modes ."

      "content": "It can drain your iPhone's battery. Since Android's AOD turns the screen black , it doesn't use as much battery as an iPhone's AOD. The iPhone AOD merely dims the current lock screen, so all those pixels on your screen need to remain on, which in turn drains your battery. This means that AOD does not work with power-saving modes on either iPhone or Android . You can make your Lock Screen wallpaper a black screen to save your battery power on iPhone."
