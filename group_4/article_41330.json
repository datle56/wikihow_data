      "content": "Expect withdrawal symptoms to last around 1-2 weeks. Stopping zolpidem can come with a wide range of side effects, ranging from fever, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, rebound insomnia, cramps, sweating, mood swings, and more. Don’t worry—while these symptoms may seem alarming, they’re very common for people who have weaned off the medication. [8] X Research source Typically, you’ll experience the worst, most intense symptoms during the first 3-5 days. Within 2 weeks, your physical withdrawal symptoms should go away. [9] X Research source The length of your withdrawal symptoms really depends on your original dose, the length of time you took it, and whether you used the extended-release version. The extended variety of the pill comes in a higher dose, which leads to a more severe withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms tend to be worse if you take zolpidem with alcohol or other drugs."
