[1] X Research source You can no longer access the original Soap2Day website, but many other websites have cropped up with the name \"Soap2Day.\" This is one Soap2Day copycat site that is safe to use, as of the writing of this article.

      "title": "Avoid clicking ads on any Soap2Day copycat sites.",
      "content": "Avoid clicking ads on any Soap2Day copycat sites. Most of these websites aren't inherently dangerous, but contain many ads (both pop-ups and banner ads) that may install viruses on your computer. These ads can be difficult to close out of, and you may accidentally click on them, thus infecting your computer. While uncommon, getting a virus or malware by simply visiting a website is possible. If you don't trust a website, it's safest not to click it. [2] X Research source If you want to tell if a URL is safe to click, there are a few URL checkers online you can use (such as this one by VirusTotal or this one from Google). However, hackers know how to get around these types of URL checkers, so they may not accurately catch every malicious URL. The safest way to check a URL is to use a virtual machine, but setting one up takes time, money, and a little know-how and may be excessive for only checking if a Soap2Day copycat site is safe."
