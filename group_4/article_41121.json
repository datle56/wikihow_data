      "content": "If the twitching just won’t go away, ask your doctor about Botox. Uncontrolled eye twitching is called blepharospasm, and it’s extremely common. Luckily, the occasional botulinum toxin (Botox) injection can keep your twitches from acting up. Botox will keep the twitching muscle from moving, which will completely prevent your tic from coming back for at least a few months. [15] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Opthamologists Professional medical organization focused on advocating for public health and supporting sight-related research Go to source Botox might sound like kind of a radical remedy to an eye twitch, but these injections are really no big deal. Doctors administer Botox all the time for everything from lazy eye to bladder dysfunction. This is a very mundane procedure these days."

This is especially important if you experience facial weakness, drooping, or your eyes start to turn red. Also, see a doctor if your vision changes at all (i.e. double vision, light sensitivity). It’s probably nothing, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. [16] X Research source Common mundane causes of an eye twitch include blepharitis (inflamed eyelids) or hemifacial spasms. In extremely rare cases, the twitching may be a sign of a nerve disorder or a neurological issue."
