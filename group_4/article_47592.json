      "title": "Choose a loose cami when you’re wearing it by itself.",
      "content": "Choose a loose cami when you’re wearing it by itself. Since a cami shows off a lot of skin, wearing a tight cami can make you look overexposed. Instead, pick a loose cami to help balance out your look. Plus, the loose fabric will help you stay comfortable. [1] X Research source Try on the cami to check that it’s not skin tight. You don’t need to choose a baggy cami. Just make sure that it’s a little flowy."

      "title": "Pair your cami with a structured skirt for a dressed up look.",
      "content": "Pair your cami with a structured skirt for a dressed up look. A pencil skirt, A-line skirt, or maxi skirt will look feminine, sexy, and polished with just a cami. Tuck your shirt in for a professional or ladylike style, or leave your shirt untucked for a slightly relaxed twist on a polished look. [2] X Research source For example, you might wear a lace cami tucked into a pencil skirt for date night. For a weekend day look, you could leave a silk cami untucked over a maxi skirt, or you could tuck a brightly colored cami into a patterned A-line skirt."

      "content": "Opt for a relaxed skirt and cami for a boho look. Choose a cotton cami or a flowy silk cami. Then, wear it untucked over a loose mid-length or maxi skirt for a relaxed, boho look. [3] X Research source If your skirt is patterned or colored, stick to a solid color top. If you have a patterned cami, look for a skirt that’s solid colored. This look is great for daytime or a day spent at the beach."

      "title": "Wear the cami with jeans for a casual look.",
      "content": "Wear the cami with jeans for a casual look. Camis are often viewed as intimate wear, especially when they have lace. Pairing your cami with jeans creates a more down-to-earth look that’s good for daytime or a night out, depending on the style of the jeans. Pick relaxed jeans for a casual day look. For a relaxed going out look, pick skinny jeans or a bootcut. A silky cami, especially one with lace, will look best with jeans. However, you can wear a basic cotton cami with jeans, as well. It’s best to pick a cotton cami that has a trim or pattern to dress up your look. Try tucking in the cami to accentuate your waist.

      "title": "Partner your cami with trouser pants or slacks for a masculine twist.",
      "content": "Partner your cami with trouser pants or slacks for a masculine twist. Since camis often look feminine, it’s fun to pair them with masculine pieces, which help balance your look. Pick trouser pants, whether they’re slacks or denim, for a sophisticated look. As an alternative, opt for slacks to create a classy, sexy look for date night. For instance, wear a lacy black cami with houndstooth slacks for a date night look, or pair a brightly colored silk cami with trouser jeans for a fun weekend look. While this look is a little professional, it’s likely not right for the office. You’ll still be showing off a lot of skin."

      "title": "Wear a sexy lace cami with conservative pants or a skirt for a club look.",
      "content": "Wear a sexy lace cami with conservative pants or a skirt for a club look. Camis can be a great club look because they’re flirty and show off some skin. However, they can also look a little like underwear, so it’s best to pair your cami with a solid bottom piece. For instance, you might choose slacks, linen shorts, or a short pencil skirt. Decide how much skin you want to show off before you pick your bottoms. Since your cami is showing off a lot of skin up top, you might not want to wear very short bottoms."

      "title": "Avoid pairing a cami with sweatpants or a silky bottom.",
      "content": "Avoid pairing a cami with sweatpants or a silky bottom. Wearing a cami with pants that look like pajamas will create a messy, dressed down look. Similarly, pairing your cami with silky pants or a silk skirt will create an overdone lingerie look. Both of these styles make it look like you didn’t plan to leave the house."

      "title": "Wear a tight cami under a top or sweater for a slimming effect.",
      "content": "Wear a tight cami under a top or sweater for a slimming effect. Camis are great for creating a sleek look under tops and sweaters. Choose a cami that matches your top or sweater, or stick with a neutral color like white, tan, brown, gray, or black. Put your cami on over your bra, if you’re wearing one, then put on your top or sweater. [6] X Research source It’s okay if you don’t see the cami under the top or sweater. If your sweater or top is low cut, consider choosing a cami that has lace trim that will peek out."

      "content": "Pair a silk cami with a blazer or cardigan for a feminine, professional look. You can wear a silk cami in place of a regular top under your blazer or cardigan. Pick a cami that covers your cleavage and extends past the waistband of your pants or skirt. Tuck the cami into your pants, or let it hang loose. [7] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 3 November 2020. This look works with a plain silk cami or a lacy silk cami. Don’t remove your blazer or cardigan while you’re wearing this look, as you may expose too much skin. This looks great with skinny jeans, wide-legged pants, or a pencil skirt.

Put on a form-fitting top or t-shirt, which can be short-sleeved or long-sleeved. Then, put your cami on over it. [9] X Research source For a casual day look, wear a cami over a plain t-shirt. This will also provide more coverage if you want to wear your cami into the office. For a dressed up look, wear a top that has a bow or ruffles that peek out over the top of the cami.

      "content": "Layer it under a sheer top for added coverage. Camis are a great way to make a sheer top look less sexy. Wear a plain or silk cami under your favorite sheer tops so that you show off less skin. Choose a cami that’s the same color as your top or that brings out 1 of the colors in the top’s pattern. [10] X Research source For example, you could wear a black cami under a sheer black top. If your top had a pink and red floral pattern, you might decide to wear a pink cami to bring out the pink in the print. It’s best to wear a tight cami if you’re working this look, but a loose cami can look great, as well."

You might pick a collar necklace, chunky bead necklace, or a large pendant. Select something that reflects your personal style and complements your outfit. [11] X Research source For example, you might wear a collar necklace if you layered a cami over a blouse or if you’re wearing a cami alone over a skirt.

      "content": "Layer several necklaces for a more put-together look. Since a cami leaves a lot of skin exposed, wearing multiple layers can make your look more balanced. You’ll still be showing off skin, but the necklaces make you appear more clothed. [12] X Research source For instance, you might wear several short necklaces to cover more skin. Alternatively, pick several long necklaces to create a sexy, date night vibe."

Then, lightly wrap the scarf around your neck, or tie it loosely . For example, you might wear a scarf to accessorize a cami worn with jeans.

      "title": "Wear a smooth, strapless bra or bandeau for invisible support.",
      "content": "Wear a smooth, strapless bra or bandeau for invisible support. Camisoles have thin or spaghetti straps, which don’t hide a bra. To achieve a sleek look while still getting support, choose a bra that doesn’t have straps. Look for a strapless bra or bandeau that has plain, molded cups that will provide good nipple coverage. [14] X Research source Choose a plain color, like beige, brown or black, that won’t show under your cami."

      "title": "Opt for a bra with thin, pretty straps if you want more support.",
      "content": "Opt for a bra with thin, pretty straps if you want more support. If you’re very busty or just prefer to wear a regular bra, look for straps that are thin and compliment the cami. For instance, you might choose basic black or white straps, or look for a bra that has lace, striped, or spotted straps for a fun look. This will allow you to wear your cami while still feeling supported. [15] X Research source This works best for a casual or weekend look. Try to pick straps that are close to the same size as your cami straps, though they’ll likely be a little bigger."

      "content": "Choose a cami with a built-in shelf bra to go bra-less. Some camis have a stretchy layer of fabric sewn into the bust, which offers you bra support. If you don’t need much support, you may be able to wear these camis without a bra. [16] X Research source You might prefer to wear nipple covers if you decide to go bra-less so that your nipples are less noticeable."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wear a regular, low cut bra if you’re layering over the cami.",
      "content": "Wear a regular, low cut bra if you’re layering over the cami. When you’re layering, you don’t need to worry about your bra straps showing because your top or blazer will cover them. However, choose a bra that doesn’t come up so high that it peeks over the top of your cami. As long as the bra isn’t a full-coverage bra, it should work great. The best bra for you depends on your needs. If you have larger breasts, you might want to wear a bra with thicker straps. However, you might not need a bra if you have small breasts."
