      "content": "Understand the anatomy of a balloon. In order to make sense of these instructions, we should know how to refer to each area of the balloon that we’ll be dealing with. Memorizing these terms—or just consulting this list if you become confused—will help immensely in the task ahead of us. The body is what we might consider the main area of the balloon; it’s the spherical or oval-like chamber that we fill with air. The lip is that ring of thicker material that surrounds the balloon’s opening and is where air enters and exits the balloon. The neck is that slightly elongated area leading from the body to the lip."

      "title": "Blow up",
      "content": "Blow up the balloon. Whether you’re using an air compressor, pump, or just your own good, old-fashioned lungs, start blowing into the balloon through its lip. If you’re having trouble keeping the balloon steady while you inflate it, delicately grip it by the neck. [1] X Research source The balloon should feel full, but not as though it has been filled to its utmost capacity. Stop inflating once it can hold its form with little give. A balloon that’s filled too full can easily pop, and will be difficult to tie off. Ensure that the balloon still has a discernible neck. If you can’t tell where the body ends and the neck begins, your balloon is likely too full."

    {
      "title": "Stretch its neck out.",
      "content": "Stretch its neck out. You’ll need the balloon’s neck good and loose for the next step, so you’ll want to gently, rapidly tug on the neck a few times with the hand you’re not using to pinch the balloon shut. Three or four times should be sufficient. [3] X Research source Shoot for 3-6 inches of give when you stretch out the neck. You'll need it stretchy enough so that it can wrap around two fingers. Any less and you’ll likely have a hard time trying to tie this balloon off; any more and your balloon might not be fully inflated."

Bring the lip all the way around and underneath your pinching fingers, without wrapping up your middle finger. If you’re unable to pull the neck far enough, this could be an indicator that your balloon is too full, or that your neck wasn’t properly stretched. Loosen your grip on the balloon to slowly, slightly deflate it."

      "content": "Stretch the opening of the balloon's lip around the faucet. Hold the lip in place around your water source, to ensure that it doesn’t slip off as the balloon begins to take on water weight. If you have any trouble with slippage, use your other hand to support the expanding balloon from below. The \"lip\" of the balloon is that thick ring of material that surrounds the balloon's opening, through which water and air can flow. You should make sure the area around you can handle an accidental water balloon explosion, as even seasoned pros will have their fair share of these. Make sure there are no electronics or non-waterproof valuables nearby."

    {
      "title": "Fill the balloon",
      "content": "Fill the balloon with water. Ensure you’ve firmly secured the balloon before turning on that faucet, hose, or spout. Experience will help you determine the speed at which to fill the balloon but opt for a slower pace at first, increasing water flow only as you gain practice with the procedure. Water balloons are typically smaller than balloons designed to be filled with air or gas mixtures, so keep this in mind if you’re used to dealing with air-based balloons. If you overfill the balloon, it will let you know by politely exploding on you. If your balloon does indeed burst, take note of the point at which this happens to ensure you don’t fill your next balloon to that point. If you are going to fill lots of water, support the balloon from the bottom. Otherwise, the weight of the water will stretch the neck so much, that it will tear apart."

      "content": "Remove the water balloon from the faucet, with its neck between the index and middle fingers of one hand. The lip should be pointing up, and the weight of the full balloon should stretch its neck. If the sagging balloon doesn't appear to have enough neck—you'll likely require 2-6 inches—you've likely overfilled your balloon. The \"neck\" of the balloon is that slightly elongated section of the balloon where the main body of the balloon meets the lip."
