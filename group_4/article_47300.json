For maximum cleaning you will want to use both of these cleaners, but either one will work well. Do not use vinegar and baking soda at the same time as they simply cancel each other out. One is an acid and the other is a base so mixing them results in a chemical reaction that reduces the cleaning ability of these chemicals. Vinegar is great for removing smells and getting your nets a bright white color once again. They will also remove mildew and mold. Baking soda is excellent at removing mildew and mold, can remove bad odors and will help whiten your curtains. [2] X Research source"

Most curtains can be washed in a normal washing machine on the delicate cycle, especially if they are made from cotton or polyester. Most modern net curtains are made from polyester. If you curtains are particularly delicate then you may have to hand wash them. Delicate curtains include those that are antiques or look like they might fall apart if washed. This also includes net curtains made from wool or silk, which should again be hand washed. Hand wash by placing in a basin of cool water with a little laundry detergent or dishwashing soap. Gently agitate the water to allow the soap to penetrate fully. Rather than squeezing out the delicate material, simply hang it up outside while wet and allow it to dry. This will prevent major wrinkles. Silk cannot be hung up to dry or else it will yellow. Rather roll the net curtain in a towel to remove excess water and then iron on low heat to dry.
