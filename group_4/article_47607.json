      "content": "Iron your dupatta to remove wrinkles from the fabric. Most dupattas are silk, although some are cotton. For silk dupattas , hand wash them in warm water and then iron the backside with the matte finish on low heat by pressing the iron down across the surface of the fabric. If your dupatta is cotton, dampen it with a spray bottle and water and then press down on the surface of the fabric with the iron on high heat. Never leave the iron in the same place for more than 1 to 2 seconds."

Start rolling it up loosely until it fits easily into each of your hands. Now, shift the dupatta left and right until equal lengths hang from both sides.

Cover as much of your head as you'd like. [3] X Research source If you're going to a Muslim function, cover your entire head so no hair shows.

If you wear your hair down, twist together 2 sections at your crown—where the top of your head curves downward to the back—and pin them together.
