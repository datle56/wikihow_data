      "content": "Evaluate your circumstances before the rash appeared. Where you were and what you were doing before the onset of the rash can provide important clues as to what caused the rash. Think about anything new or unusual that you might have been exposed to. [2] X Expert Source Corey Fish, MD Pediatrician & Chief Medical Officer, BraveCare Expert Interview. 17 March 2020. If you wore a new necklace for the first time, tried a new lotion or soap, or ate a new food, your rash may be an allergic reaction. Make note of how much time passed from the initial exposure until the development of the rash. This might give you some insight into the severity of your allergy. [3] X Expert Source Corey Fish, MD Pediatrician & Chief Medical Officer, BraveCare Expert Interview. 17 March 2020. Retinoids, found in many personal care and cosmetics products, may sometimes cause a rash or irritation around the neck. Allergic reactions may develop with age. Consider substances you haven't come into contact with in awhile, even if you never had a reaction to them before. Your rash may have resulted from an insect bite, poison oak, or poison sumac – particularly if you've recently spent time outdoors."

      "content": "Examine the rash more closely in a mirror. The appearance of the rash can give you some clues as to what caused it, as well as how you should treat it. Note the rash's color, texture, and location. It may cover a relatively continuous area, or be more spotty. Consider the condition of your skin as well. If your skin is dry, flaky, or scaly, it may need to be moisturized. If your skin is swollen or inflamed, this typically indicates some sort of allergic reaction. This type of rash may also be itchy. Do your best to avoid scratching a rash – scratching usually makes it worse and may prolong the healing process or result in spreading the rash to other locations."

      "title": "Look for a sting or bite mark.",
      "content": "Look for a sting or bite mark. Insect bites and bee stings are common causes of rashes. Commonly, the rash will seem to emanate from the bite or sting mark. However, look for a mark not just on your neck, but also along your scalp, shoulders, back, and chest. For example, a bull's eye rash surrounding a tick bite may be a sign of Lyme disease."

      "title": "Figure out if the rash is spreading.",
      "content": "Figure out if the rash is spreading. A rash may spread on contact, or it may gradually spread on its own. If you can't tell whether the rash is spreading, you might draw a line around the rash with a pen or marker. Check later to see if the rash has extended beyond your line. If the rash was caused by contact with poison oak, poison sumac, or similar, it will easily spread. If you've touched or scratched at the rash with your bare hands and then touched somewhere else on your body without washing your hands, you'll likely have the rash there as well. A rash from an insect bite or bee sting may continue to expand after the bite or sting occurs. This typically indicates that the venom or other substance that caused the rash is still in your system."

      "content": "Wash the area well with gentle soap and warm water. The skin on your neck is delicate under ordinary circumstances, but you want to take special care when that skin is inflamed by a rash. Use lukewarm water and a gentle cleanser, and don't rub or scrub the skin. [7] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source If your rash was caused by contact with an item or substance you're allergic to, the rash may start to calm or disappear the moment that item or substance is removed from your skin. For example, if you wore a new necklace and developed a rash, taking off the necklace and cleaning your neck may be all you need to do to treat the rash. After washing your neck, dry your skin well by patting it down with an absorbent towel. Avoid rubbing your skin to dry it – you could spread the rash."

      "content": "Make a baking soda compress. To make a compress, use one part baking soda to three parts lukewarm water. Dip a clean washcloth into this mixture and press it gently to your neck. You can also use coconut oil instead of water. After 10 to 15 minutes, remove the compress and wash your skin gently. Leaving baking soda on your skin for too long may cause further irritation."

      "content": "Use an ice pack to calm heat rash. If you've been out in the sun and have a heat rash, cool the skin with an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables) wrapped in a soft towel or an old t-shirt. Leave the ice pack on your skin for no longer than 20 minutes. [8] X Research source Avoid placing an ice pack (or ice cubes) directly on your skin. It could burn your skin and irritate it even more."

      "content": "Add a nutritional supplement to your diet. There are several nutritional supplements available that can treat and help heal an inflammatory rash. If your rash was likely caused by inflammation or an allergic reaction, these supplements may provide you some relief. Vitamin C has antihistamine properties that can reduce inflammation, and is also a powerful antioxidant that boosts your immune system. Take up to 2,000 mg daily. Nettle leaf extract has antihistamine properties as well, and can be effective in treating hives. Take up to 300 mg three times a day. Quercetin is the anti-inflammatory flavonoid present in green tea, red wine, and onions. In supplement form, it can reduce inflammation and calm allergic reactions. Take up to 1,000 mg three times a day."

If you have access to essential oils, mix 2 or 3 drops of geranium, rose, or lavender oil with about a half a teaspoon (2 to 3 ml) of coconut oil and apply it directly to the affected area.
