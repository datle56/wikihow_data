      "content": "Adjust the ISO and aperture settings on your camera. Go into the settings of your camera and set it to manual mode, if it isn't in that mode already. Set your camera to your preferred ISO and aperture settings. [1] X Research source You'll need to do some experimenting with both of these settings to find the ideal settings for the photo you're trying to get. The ISO setting determines your camera's sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO, the more sensitivity to light. Generally, lower ISO settings produce clearer pictures while a higher ISO will cause graininess, but there are some scenarios where you'll need a higher ISO, such as when shooting a subject in motion. [2] X Research source The aperture setting changes the size of the lens, and therefore how much light the camera lets in. This setting is described using the unit f/stops. A larger aperture number, like f/11, means a smaller lens size, and a smaller number, like f/1.4, means a larger lens size. Aperture affects your photos' depth of field and shutter speed. [3] X Research source A large aperture creates a blurrier background, while a small one brings the background into more focus. When you’re using film, Bear explains that “your ISO is based off of the film, so most of the time people buy 400 ISO.” [4] X Expert Source Crystal Bear Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 21 January 2021."

      "content": "Prepare the sensor of the light meter. Depending on what light meter you are using, you may need to twist the knob around the white dome (lumisphere) on your light meter to prepare it or slide it over a sensor. The lumisphere is what measures the light. [6] X Research source Most lumispheres are domed, but many light meters also come with a flat sensor (called a lumidisc) that may be better for directional shots (like a portrait). Some domed lumispheres also recess into the light meter, which makes them function more directionally (like a lumidisc)."

      "content": "Set your light meter to the “ambient light” or “flash” mode. Most light meters have two modes: one for ambient light and one for flash. If you're going to be using the flash of your camera, set it to that mode, and if not, use the ambient setting. [7] X Research source The flash changes how much light is hitting the subject. If you don’t account for the flash, you may end up with an overexposed photo."

It is often on a swiveling or rotating head. Point it toward your main light source, whether that’s a window or a studio light. [9] X Research source Most handheld light meters are incidental, meaning they measure the light falling on your subject. If your meter is reflective , that means it’s designed to measure the light reflecting off the subject. If your meter is reflective, point it at the subject (not the light source).

The meter will evaluate the degree of light from the flash and determine the correct aperture and shutter speed for the subject. [12] X Research source"

After hitting the measure button, most light meters will allow you to then scroll through the combinations of shutter speeds and apertures that are appropriate for the amount of light measured. Go to the settings in your camera and input the numbers provided by your light meter into your camera. [13] X Research source According to Bear, “[the light meter reading] is just an easy way to tell the camera exactly what [settings] it needs because sometimes the internal sensors on a digital or film camera aren't 100% accurate.” [14] X Expert Source Crystal Bear Professional Photographer Expert Interview. 21 January 2021. Adjust the numbers from the light meter to achieve alternative image results. Input a higher aperture (a lower f-stop number) for an image that reveals more light. A lower aperture (a higher f number) will darken the image. You can also alter the shutter speed, which allows more light in with a slower speed and increases potential blurring of any moving things in the scene."

On most cameras, pushing the shutter release button halfway down triggers the light meter to appear in the view for a few seconds (it might take you a few tries—and a few accidental photos—to get the feel for it). Double check your camera’s user manual if you can’t pull up the light meter this way. [16] X Research source"

      "content": "Adjust the aperture and shutter speed according to the meter. Different cameras display different types of meters. Some will show a scale of negative to positive numbers with “0” being the correct amount of light. Other displays may show a green dot, a highlighted number, an arrow, or a highlighted bar to show you’ve got the right exposure. Adjust your settings until the meter shows that you've achieved the right exposure. [17] X Research source Double check your user manual to confirm how your camera displays and fidget with the aperture and shutter speed until you have it set where you want it. You don’t have to set your camera to the “correct” exposure—it all depends on what effect you want. For example, having a bit more light can make your photo brighter, while a bit less can darken it and make it look more moody."

      "content": "Light meters show the camera settings you need based on your lighting. Basically, they measure the light entering the camera and convert that information into a reading that tells you the best aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to use to get an evenly exposed photo. They can be used for digital or film photography, but are more commonly used with film because you can’t get a preview or see what the image will look like on a screen beforehand. [18] X Research source As Bear puts it, “It's an external device that you can actually place on somebody's forehead or wherever you want to take the photo and it reads the light where that person is. What's great about it is it tells you ‘Hey, your aperture needs to be at 2.8. Your shutter speed needs to be at 1500 and your ISO needs to be at 100,’” for example.
