Here's what you need to do: [2] X Research source You'll need to \"borrow\" from the 3 in \"32\" (also known as regrouping), in order to turn that 2 into a 12. Cross off the 3 in \"32\" and make it a 2, while making the 2 a 12. Now, you have 12 - 7, which is equal to 5. Write a 5 below the two numbers you subtracted, so it lines up with the ones column in a new row."

[5] X Research source For the problem 15 - 9, visualize a pile of 15 poker chips. Remove 9 of them and you'll see that 6 of them remain. Therefore, 15 - 9 = 6. You can also think of a number line. Think of the numbers from 1 to 15 and then remove or go back 9 units to get 6. For the problem 2 - 30, the easiest thing to do is to reverse the numbers and then make the answer negative after you've subtracted them. So, 30 - 2 = 28, since 28 is just two less than 30. Now, make your answer negative since you determined at the beginning that it would be negative because the second number is larger than the first. Therefore, 2 - 30 = -28."

If you have a problem where both numbers don't have the same amount of numbers after the decimal point, write a 0 in the empty spaces until they even out.
