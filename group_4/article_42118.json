      "title": "Do not panic.",
      "content": "Do not panic. If you're being charged by a lion, you'll be extremely frightened. Do everything you can not to panic. Staying calm and thinking straight can help save your life. Knowing what to expect can help you stay calm. For example, know that the lion is going to growl while they charge. This can shake the ground beneath you but know this is normal for a lion attack.

    {
      "title": "Do not run.",
      "content": "Do not run. Stand your ground. You need to take charge of the situation and show the lion that you're a threat. Turn so that you're side-on-side with the lion while clapping your hands, shouting, and waving your arms. This will make you appear bigger and more threatening to the lion. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Lion behaviors differ from region to region. The biggest tourist attractions have lions that are more habituated to vehicles and therefore less afraid of humans. However, many lions with early encounters of humans will perform mock charges. Making yourself appear threatening will make them turn away."

    {
      "title": "Retreat slowly.",
      "content": "Retreat slowly. Do not turn your back. Keep flailing your arms and showing, but slowly step away sideways. If you run, the lion may sense your fear and chase after you. Remain threatening to the lion while you retreat. [4] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Avoid retreating to a thicket (such as a forest). Instead, retreat to an open area."
    },
    {
      "title": "Be prepared again.",
      "content": "Be prepared again. The lion may charge you again while you're trying to retreat. If this happens, shout as loudly as possible and raise your hands again. Truly yell from the depths of your stomach. This time, when it turns away, stop the aggression. Turn sideways and walk away. This can help avoid a fight. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Remain standing.",
      "content": "Remain standing. If these precautions don't work for any reason, the lion may charge. If this happens, remain standing. The lion will likely go for your face and throat. This means that it will jump and you'll have a full view of the giant cat. While this sounds terrifying, it will help to have a good view of the animal. If you were to crouch down, you would have much less of a chance to fight back if it attacked you at this angle. [6] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Aim for the face.",
      "content": "Aim for the face. When the cat jumps at you, fight back. Punch or kick the lion as it leaps at you. Aim for the head and eyes as you continue to fight the predator off. The cat is likely to be much stronger than you but using hitting it in the head and eyes will have a great impact and could turn the lion off of you."
    },
    {
      "title": "Seek immediate help.",
      "content": "Seek immediate help. Lion attacks have been fought off by humans before. The humans that were attacked and fought off the cats were able to seek immediate medical help. Especially if the lion was able to get its jaw on you and bite you, you need to stop the bleeding. Tend immediately to any deep gashes from its teeth or claws."

    {
      "title": "Seek psychological help.",
      "content": "Seek psychological help. Even if the attack was a mock attack, it may be a good idea to seek professional psychological help about it. Getting past such a traumatic experience is no easy feat. It's a very rare situation to have been positioned in. Seeking help with aid you in moving on soon."

      "title": "Stay away from mating lions.",
      "content": "Stay away from mating lions. Mating lions and lionesses are extremely aggressive. They are easily triggered during this time. There is no specific time of year that lions reproduce. However, it is very easy to know when lions are mating because when the lioness is in the heat, the couples mate up to 40 times a day. This lasts for several days."

      "title": "Stay away from cubs.",
      "content": "Stay away from cubs. No matter how tempting it may be or how cute lion cubs are, you should never interact with a lion cub. Lionesses are ferociously protective of their young and should therefore be given extra space. Do not attempt to interact with it in any way, shape or form. In the event you encounter cubs, try to find a route to take you as far from them as possible to avoid an attack."

      "title": "Keep a night watch.",
      "content": "Keep a night watch. Lions are predominantly nocturnal. This is when they do a substantial amount of their hunting. If they're in predator mode, they are much more prone to attack. If you're in an area of high lion density overnight, maintain a night watch so that you aren't caught off-guard.
