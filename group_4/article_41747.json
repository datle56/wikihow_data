      "content": "Reach for your toes to stretch the backs of your legs. [1] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPT Physical Therapist Expert Interview. 17 March 2021. Start by standing with your feet hip distance apart. Slowly bend over and reach for your toes, stopping at your knees, shins, or ankles as needed. Let your upper body hang for 30 seconds, then slowly lift back into your starting position. [2] X Research source Repeat this stretch again for another 30 seconds to stretch your hamstrings and glutes, as well as your calves and lower back. [3] X Research source If you’re just starting out, let your upper body hang so that gravity gently pulls you down and stretches the backs of your legs. As your flexibility improves, you can start to actively pull your upper body closer to the floor."

      "content": "Do a cross-legged standing toe touch for a deeper hamstring stretch. Standing up straight, first cross your left foot over your right so that all your toes are pointing forward. Carefully bend over your crossed legs and reach towards your toes, keeping both legs as straight as possible. Let your upper body hang for 30 to 60 seconds before standing back up and repeating this stretch with your other leg in front.

      "content": "Stretch your legs with a wide-legged forward fold. Stand straight up and spread your legs about 3 feet (0.91 m) apart. Keeping your feet pointing forward, slowly bend over at the waist until the top of your head hangs towards the floor. Place your hands on the ground or a stool or yoga blocks if you don’t reach the ground yet. Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds before slowly standing back up. [5] X Research source If you want to get in a bit of an extra stretch for both your legs, rotate your torso and grab your left ankle while you’re bent over. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds, then slowly rotate over to your right leg and hold this position for another 30 seconds. [6] X Research source This also stretches your lower back and calves."

      "content": "Try a sitting stretch to gently loosen your hamstrings and glutes. Sit on the floor with one leg straight in front of you and the other leg bender in towards the opposite leg’s inner thigh. Hold your arms out long over the extended leg, then fold forward and reach towards your toes. Reach as far as you can without overextending your muscles, then hold your feet or let your hands fall to the floor on either side of your extended leg. [7] X Research source Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds, then slowly release out of the stretch, switch out your legs, and repeat this stretch for your other leg. If it bothers your knees to fold one leg in, you can also do this stretch with both legs extended out long at the same time."

      "content": "Lie on your back to do a supine hamstring stretch. First, lie down on your back with your legs extended straight. Bend one of your knees into a 90 degree angle, placing your hands behind your thigh just below your blended knee. Keeping your straight leg flat on the floor, slowly extend your bent leg towards the ceiling until it’s as straight as you can comfortably go. Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds, then release your leg and repeat this on the other side. [8] X Research source If your hamstrings are too tight to keep your straightened leg on the floor, you can bend your knee to make it easier to straighten the bent leg you’re stretching."

Let the momentum build and swing your leg back and forth a few times, then slowly replace your foot on the ground and repeat this with the other leg. [10] X Research source You can hold onto a bar or the wall if you need a bit of extra support to stabilize you while you swing your legs. This dynamic swinging move helps release your hamstrings and glutes, increasing your flexibility so you can kick higher."

Cross you left leg behind your right leg, then lean your left hip into the wall. [11] X Research source Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds before turning around and repeating this stretch for your right leg. This abductor stretch helps release the muscles in your outer legs, giving you more height and range of motion for side and front kicks."

Twist until you can hook your left elbow over the outside of your right knee. [12] X Research source Hold this stretch for 30 to 60 seconds, then gently release and switch your lefts and arms to stretch your left outer thigh and glute. If you aren’t able to twist enough to hook your elbow over your knee, just grab onto your bent thigh with your hand and gently pull inward until you feel a stretch in your outer leg."

Rest your elbows on your knees and hold this position for 3 to 5 minutes or as close to 3 minutes as you can. [13] X Research source Staying in the sumo squat position also helps release your lower back and reduce lower back pain, which can help you safely and comfortably perform high kicks.

Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds, then slowly release and repeat this process on your other leg. [16] X Research source If you aren’t able to reach the floor in a forward fold, place yoga blocks in front of you and reach for the top of the blocks instead. Try to keep your hips square to the ground as you hold this pose. If you don’t feel stable enough to hold this pose, you can lift your leg against the wall for support. [17] X Research source In addition to loosening your adductors, hamstrings, and quads, this stretch also improves your lower body stability, which helps you kick higher without losing your balance."
