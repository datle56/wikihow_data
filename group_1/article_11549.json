      "content": "Reach out when you feel ready. If it’s only been a few days since your breakup, it’s probably too soon. Try texting or calling your ex when you feel like you can handle a rejection, not when the breakup is still fresh. [4] X Research source This can be a little tough since there’s no set timeline for when you might feel “ready.” If you just feel lonely or in need of a relationship, you should probably wait a little longer. You can start the conversation by saying something like, “Hey, could we meet up? I wanted to talk about maybe dating again, if you’re interested.”"

      "content": "Express your feelings and the reasons why you want to date again. Most people treat breakups like the absolute end of a relationship, so your ex probably isn’t expecting this. Sit down with your ex and try to list the reasons why you think your relationship could work this time, and be prepared to answer any questions they might have. [5] X Research source You could try saying, “I know our relationship was rocky in the past. I’ve really been working on fixing my bad habits, and I think we could really make it work this time.” Your ex may also say no or be hesitant about trying your relationship again, which is valid. Listen to their concerns and try to work it out together.

      "content": "Talk about relationships you had while you were apart. If you dated someone after you two split up, let your ex know. If they dated someone for a while too, ask about it. You don’t have to get into specifics, but you should both know about any other relationships that happened when you weren’t together. [6] X Research source It can be tough to hear about what your ex did when you weren’t together, but it’s better to find out now than be blindsided later on. If your ex is upset that you dated someone else, try to address their fears or concerns before jumping into your relationship to avoid problems down the road."

As you two talk about your new relationship, be sure to address the problems that happened in the past and what you can both do to avoid them in the future. Try to stay away from the blame game, and instead focus on actionable steps that you can both take. [7] X Research source For example, if you fought a lot about money, agree to be more open with your finances to avoid any surprises. Or, if you weren’t on the same page about marriage, talk about your life plans and where you see yourself in 5 years.

If you were living with your partner, engaged, or even married, just treat your relationship like you’re dating again for the first time. Taking things slow can also help you both correct any negative behaviors that led to your breakup. If you were living together, consider living separately for a while, even after you’ve gotten back together."

Go to source Good communication is one of the biggest indicators that a relationship will work. When your communication breaks down, that’s when the problems really start. For example, you could say, “I noticed that you’re staying out late again without calling me, and that’s made me upset in the past. Could we talk about this before it turns into a huge issue?” If you’re having trouble communicating, consider seeing a couple’s counselor."

Focus on enjoying the now, not living in the past with your bad memories. When you agree to rekindle your relationship, make sure you’re over the issues that caused your breakup. If you aren’t over them or you haven’t made your peace with them, you’ll probably bring them up to hurt your partner in the future."
