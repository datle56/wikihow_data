      "content": "Check your unofficial transcript before ordering an official transcript. This can be done through your university’s website. Go over your unofficial transcript to make sure that all of your grades, accolades, and the classes listed are correct. [2] X Research source The information on your unofficial transcript will be reproduced on your official transcript. If you receive your official transcript and there is an error, it will take time and money to correct the mistake. Make sure your most recent information is on the transcript. If you have just recently graduated, or will be graduating shortly, your most recent grades should still be on your official transcript, so long as the professor has turned them in on time. Double check that your grades are correct. Go over each grade on your unofficial transcript and make sure that they match the grades that you know you received for each class."
