      "content": "Make the first move and ask him out on a classic, conventional date. While some Taurus guys are risk-takers, most of them are pretty traditional (like all earth signs). Rather than hitting up an escape room or going skydiving, your Taurus will probably enjoy going something a little more conventional, like dinner and a movie or hanging out one-on-one at home. [3] X Research source Taurus guys are usually not as brash and forward as men born under other zodiac signs. This means that you may have to take the first step and ask him out! The more you spend time and get to talk to your guy, the more he’ll desire your company. While they aren’t super chatty, Taurus are great listeners."

      "content": "Let him take charge in the relationship. Even though they’re quiet and gentle, Taurus men have an inner drive (and obstinate streak) that pushes them to take the lead. They like to be decisive and feel like they’re in control. Of course, that doesn’t mean letting him dictate your life; instead, try reaffirming things you agree with so he feels like he’s the one making the final decision (even if he’s not). Remember, letting a partner take charge doesn’t mean changing who you are as a person. If you really don’t want to do something, tell him so—and put your foot down. Taurus men often want authority over finances, so as your relationship gets serious, have a conversation about what you both want (and are comfortable with) in terms of finances.

If you have the budget, you could even plan to travel to another state or city for the show and enjoy a special trip together. Taurus guys have expensive tastes and will enjoy good seats regardless of cost—but don’t feel any pressure to break your budget!

Try doing something from the heart to show him how important he is, like taking him on a date to where you first met, making him breakfast in bed, or writing him a love letter. If you get him a gift, think of something high-quality and practical—like a luxurious candle or a meal at his favorite restaurant.

Leo and Taurus love romantic gestures and luxury, but fiery Leo’s dramatic side (and desire to live in the spotlight) might be too exhausting for Taurus. On the other hand, the intellectual air sign Aquarius might come off as too distant and detached for Taurus—and because both are fixed signs, their stubbornness could clash. [7] X Research source However, neither pairing is impossible—they just require a little more time and effort. Compromise, understanding, and appreciation for each partner’s differences can help these relationships work."
