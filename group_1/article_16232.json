      "content": "Review the basics of factoring. Factoring is when you break a large number down into it's simplest divisible parts. Each one of these parts is called a \"factor.\" So, for example, the number 6 can be evenly divided by four different numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 6. Thus, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. [1] X Research source The factors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Both \"1\" and the number you're factoring are always factors. So, the factors of a small number, like 3, would simply be 1 and 3. Factors are only the perfectly divisible numbers, or \"whole\" numbers. You could divide 32 by 3.564, or 21.4952, but this won't lead to a factor, just another decimal."

      "content": "Place the binomial's terms in order to make them easier to read. A binomial is simply the addition or subtraction of two numbers, at least one of which contains a variable. Sometimes these variables have exponents, like x 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}} or 5 y 4 {\\displaystyle 5y^{4}} . When first factoring binomials, it can help to reorder equations with ascending variable terms, meaning the biggest exponent is last. For example: [2] X Research source 3 t + 6 {\\displaystyle 3t+6} → 6 + 3 t {\\displaystyle 6+3t} 3 x 4 + 9 x 2 {\\displaystyle 3x^{4}+9x^{2}} → 9 x 2 + 3 x 4 {\\displaystyle 9x^{2}+3x^{4}} x 2 − 2 {\\displaystyle x^{2}-2} → − 2 + x 2 {\\displaystyle -2+x^{2}} Note how the negative sign stays in front of the 2. If a term is subtracted, just keep the negative in front of it."

When solving an equation with binomials, especially complex binomials, it can seem like there is no way everything will match. For example, try to solve 5 y − 2 y 2 = − 3 y {\\displaystyle 5y-2y^{2}=-3y} . One way to solve it, especially with exponents, is to factor first.

The expression x 4 {\\displaystyle x^{4}} is another way of saying x ∗ x ∗ x ∗ x {\\displaystyle x*x*x*x} . This means you can factor out each x if the other term has one as well. Treat variables no different from a normal number. For example: 2 t + t 2 {\\displaystyle 2t+t^{2}} can be factored, because both terms contain a t. Your final answer would be t ( 2 + t ) {\\displaystyle t(2+t)} You can even pull out multiple variables at once.
