      "title": "Trim, file and clean your nails",
      "content": "Trim, file and clean your nails before you paint them. Use your clippers to cut your nails to your desired length. Then, buff the top of your nails with a nail file. Next, soak your nails in warm, soapy water for 2-3 minutes before scrubbing them lightly with a nail brush. Finally, use a cuticle pusher or orange stick to push your cuticles down toward your nail bed. You can finish your quick manicure with hand lotion. However, the nail polish won't stick to nails that have lotion on them, so wipe nail polish remover over your nails before you paint them."

      "content": "Apply a clear base coat to protect your nails. You don’t have to use a base coat, but it will help your nails stay healthy after you apply the polish. Additionally, a base coat will increase the coverage of your polish and reduce chipping. Put on one even layer, then wait 5-10 minutes for it to dry. [1] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Paint on 2 or more coats of a neutral polish.",
      "content": "Paint on 2 or more coats of a neutral polish. Choose a natural or pastel-colored nail polish for your main color. Carefully paint it on your nails in a thin, even layer. Wait for it to dry, then apply another layer. Repeat to make the color more vibrant, if necessary. [2] X Research source French ombre nails look best with neutral or pastel colors, like peach, light pink, beige, or light blue. Lighter colors make the fading effect look more natural."

    {
      "title": "Place liquid latex tape around your nail to keep your skin clean.",
      "content": "Place liquid latex tape around your nail to keep your skin clean. Apply a thin coat of liquid latex tape all around your nail, reaching down to your top knuckle and around your fingertip as well. Let the liquid tape dry for 5-10 minutes, until it hardens slightly. [3] X Research source Liquid latex tape protects the skin around your nail and makes the cleanup process easier when you’re done. If you don’t have liquid latex tape, try placing thin strips of Scotch tape around your nail instead. It won’t be quite as effective, but will still catch some of the polish."

      "title": "Apply a thick coat of white polish to the end of a makeup sponge.",
      "content": "Apply a thick coat of white polish to the end of a makeup sponge. Take out a wedge-shaped, disposable makeup sponge and use your nail polish brush to paint a thick, straight coat of white polish on its tip. Paint until you have a strip of white polish that’s as wide as your nail and long enough to cover the tip of your nail. [4] X Research source For a glittery look, use a shimmery polish for both the white and colored parts of the ombre. To make sure your sponge is clean before you apply the polish, use a piece of scotch tape to remove any dust or debris. Stick the tape onto the sponge, then slowly pull it off."

      "title": "Add your base color to the sponge, overlapping it to create a gradient.",
      "content": "Add your base color to the sponge, overlapping it to create a gradient. Take out the neutral nail polish that you just applied to your nails. Paint it on the makeup sponge, just above the white polish, then continue down the sponge to overlap the color with the white. Leave a small strip of white untouched, as wide as you want the white part of your nail to be. When you’re done, you should have a strip of white, a blended section, and a strip of your neutral color, creating a fading, ombre effect. [6] X Research source Go back with your white color afterwards and mix the colors a bit more, if necessary. Apply the nail polish liberally."

      "content": "Dab the makeup sponge onto your nail. Hold your makeup sponge with the white part lined up to the tip of your nail. Gently dab the sponge against the nail to transfer the polish, tilting it slightly to hit the sides. Slowly move the sponge part-way down your nail away from your tip as the polish layer becomes thinner. Continue dabbing your nail with the sponge until you see the French fade effect. [7] X Research source Don’t worry if you get polish on the tape or liquid latex tape around your nail. That’s what it’s there for!"

      "content": "Let your nails dry, then peel off the liquid latex tape. Give your nail 10-15 minutes to dry. The ombre layer isn’t very thick, so it shouldn’t take long. Once they’re dry, peel off the liquid latex tape with a toothpick or a small brush, or remove the regular tape with your hands. [8] X Research source If any polish got onto your skin, dip a Q-tip or nail brush into nail polish remover and brush it over the area to remove it."

To smooth it out, make it shinier, and help it last longer, brush on a clear top coat. Let it dry for 10-15 minutes to finish your French ombre nails! [9] X Research source For a subtle, shimmery look, use a clear, sparkly top coat."

      "content": "Dab white polish onto your nail with a paintbrush, making it thicker near the end. To start, use an acrylic nail brush to place a dab of white polish on the tip of your nail. Brush it down towards the cuticle, fading from a thick layer near the nail tip to a thinner, translucent layer closer to the nail bed. Use the flat of the brush to shape and press the polish into shape. [10] X Research source"

Paint it in a thin layer on top of the white to create a blended color. Thicken the layer as you paint towards the cuticle to make the color more vibrant. [11] X Research source Lighter colors create a more natural looking gradient for your French ombre. Try going with a pink, peach, beige, or baby blue shade."
