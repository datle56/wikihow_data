      "title": "Use a black fabric dye designed for your kind of fabric.",
      "content": "Use a black fabric dye designed for your kind of fabric. If your fabric is made out of natural fibers like cotton, linen, silk, and wool, most fabric dyes will work. If your fabric is made out of synthetic materials like polyester, spandex, and acrylic, look for a black fabric dye that says “synthetic fibers” on the label. Non-synthetic fabric dyes may not dye fabrics made with synthetic materials. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Fill a large container with boiling hot water.",
      "content": "Fill a large container with boiling hot water. If you're dyeing natural fibers, a large bowl or bucket will work. Make sure the container is large enough to hold the piece of fabric you're dyeing, then fill the container with enough water that you'll be able to completely submerge your piece of fabric. If you're dyeing synthetic fabrics, heat a large pot of water on the stove to a temperature of 200 °F (93 °C) or higher and maintain it for the duration of the dye bath. Otherwise, the fabric may not absorb the color effectively. Avoid using bowls or utensils that you also use for food."

      "title": "Pour black fabric dye into the container of water.",
      "content": "Pour black fabric dye into the container of water. Read the label on the back of the fabric dye to see how much you should use. Keep in mind that the more fabric dye you use, the darker the final color will be. If you want your fabric to be a dark, solid black, you may want to use an entire container of fabric dye. Stir the dye thoroughly with a spoon. [2] X Research source You can find a black fabric dye online or at your local fabric store."

    {
      "title": "Add table salt to the dye bath if you want a more vibrant color.",
      "content": "Add table salt to the dye bath if you want a more vibrant color. Use .25 cups (59 mL) of salt per .5 pounds (0.23 kg) of fabric you're dyeing. Thoroughly stir the salt into the dye bath with a spoon. [3] X Research source For example, if you're dyeing 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of fabric, you would use 1.5 cups (350 mL) of salt."
    },
    {
      "title": "Put the fabric in the dye bath.",
      "content": "Put the fabric in the dye bath. Wet the fabric in plain water before submerging it in the bath. Press it down into the water using a long metal utensil, like a spatula or spoon, to get out any air bubbles. [4] X Research source Wear gloves and old clothes during this process so you don't stain your skin or ruin whatever you're wearing if the dye bath splashes."

      "title": "Stir the fabric in the dye bath periodically with a metal utensil.",
      "content": "Stir the fabric in the dye bath periodically with a metal utensil. As you're stirring it, turn the fabric over in the container and unfold it with the utensil. That way all of the fabric will be exposed to the dye. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Let the fabric soak in the dye bath for 30-60 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the fabric soak in the dye bath for 30-60 minutes. The longer you let the fabric soak in the dye bath, the darker the final color will be. Make sure you let the fabric soak for at least 30 minutes or the dye may not stick to the fabric."

    {
      "title": "Dump the dye bath out in a sink or bathtub.",
      "content": "Dump the dye bath out in a sink or bathtub. Once all the dye is down the drain, leave the piece of fabric in the sink or tub. [6] X Research source Avoid dumping the dye bath out outside or down any sink except stainless steel, as the dye may stain porcelain and non-steel surfaces. If you don't have a stainless steel sink, remove dye stains from the porcelain in your sink or tub with rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, or baking soda."

    {
      "title": "Apply a dye fixative before you rinse the fabric for an enhanced color.",
      "content": "Apply a dye fixative before you rinse the fabric for an enhanced color. Dye fixative will help the dye cling to the fibers in your fabric so the final color looks more vibrant. If you decide to use a dye fixative, spray it over the entire surface of the fabric so the fabric is heavily coated. Let the dye fixative soak into the fabric for 20 minutes. [7] X Research source You can find dye fixative online or at your local fabric store."

      "content": "Rinse the excess dye off of the fabric with hot water at first. Rinse the fabric in the sink or tub you dumped the dye bath out in. Unfold the fabric so that it's all exposed to the running water. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Rinse the fabric under cold water until the water runs clear.",
      "content": "Rinse the fabric under cold water until the water runs clear. Make sure you wait until the water runs clear or there could still be leftover dye in the fabric. Once the water runs clear, stop rinsing the fabric and ring out any excess water. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Machine wash and dry the fabric by itself on a normal setting.",
      "content": "Machine wash and dry the fabric by itself on a normal setting. Washing the fabric by itself will prevent any leftover dye from transferring to your other laundry. After its first wash, your fabric should be OK to wash with your other laundry. [10] X Research source If you're worried about your fabric shrinking in the dryer, hang dry it instead."
