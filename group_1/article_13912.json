Back up your essential files to an external drive, CD/DVD, or another form of storage. Make sure to get files from all of the possible locations, including My Documents, Desktop, and any other folders you may have created and placed files in. You should also track down your Windows Product Key in case you end up needing to do a complete reinstall. Your Product Key is typically located on the case that the Windows disc came in, or on a sticker affixed to your computer."
