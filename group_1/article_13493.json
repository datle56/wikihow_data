[1] X Research source [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Throughout a lunge exercise your arms and hands can be in any position that helps you maintain your balance. Some people may prefer to put their hands on their hips while others may prefer to keep their arms held out to the side or in front of them. Keep your back straight throughout a lunge exercise. This means you should try to keep your head upright while looking straight ahead; however, if you need to look down to ensure you’re in the right position, that’s okay. Some people find it helpful to stare at a particular space on a wall (or another object) directly in front of them to help keep their balance."

Instead of stepping forward and back each time, rise up from the lunge by straightening your legs, but don't change the positioning of your feet.
