      "content": "You need space from your ex to get over them, so establish a “no contact” rule. You’re not doing this to create tension or make the person miss you—you’re doing it to give yourself the opportunity to heal and start fresh without them. [1] X Research source If cutting contact with your ex is too difficult, get accountability and ask friends to help you stay away. You might also temporarily move your ex’s phone number and email addresses to your block list. You can always unblock them once you’re in a better place. If you share kids or pets or study/work in the same place as your ex, it may not be possible to totally cut contact. In this case, limit contact to discussions relating to the immediate context only, such as discussing a work project. If your ex wants to stay in touch with you, ask them to respect your desire to cut off contact for a while. If they continue to contact you, consider changing your phone number and email address."

This also helps you avoid the temptation of reaching out to your ex. [2] X Research source You can always re-follow them later.

      "content": "This keeps you from ruminating about the breakup or the “happier times.” Get rid of gifts, personal items, and miscellaneous things that make you think of your ex. Mail anything you think they may want back, box away mementos that you’d like to keep, and donate or trash the rest.

[6] X Research source If you need to vent, tell the people you care about what you’re feeling and offer ways they can help. For instance, you might say, “I could really use a hug right now.” While it can be healthy to vent a bit and get your feelings off your chest, resist the urge to talk about your ex all the time, or to ask people if they know what your ex is up to.

Initially, take the pressure off yourself of finding “the one” and simply focus on meeting new and interesting people. [8] X Research source Dating someone else can help you feel attractive and wanted, some things you may have struggled with after the breakup. While casual dating can be fun, be sure not to use it as a bandage for your pain. Only start back dating when you have gotten some degree of closure about the breakup. Before you start dating someone new, take time to assess your own expectations for a relationship and think about what you need from a partner."

[12] X Research source For example, if you are overcome by memories of your ex, you might say aloud, “I wish him/her a healthy, happy life.” Breathe in deeply, exhale, and continue with your day.
