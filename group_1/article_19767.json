Learning more about your own speaking habits will help you to recognize when you’re slipping into a a more \"southern\" speech pattern.

Focusing on the new words will force you out of your accent comfort zone, and will go even further to help you present a more educated and professional image For example, minimize the use of \"ain't\" and \"y'all, replacing them with \"am not\" and \"you\" or \"you all,\" respectively. Additionally, say \"preparing to\" instead of \"fixin’ to.\""

Avoid double-prepositions like stating that an object is \"Up under\" something. Instead, just use the preposition “under.”"

Leaving out letters sounds less professional, and also indicates a regional accent, and so gives a less polished impression. For instance, pronounce the “r” in “library,” to avoid saying “liberry.” Other examples are the “y” in “crayon” and the second “a” in “caramel;” Without those letters, they sound like “crown” and “carmel.” Include the final /ng/ sound at the ends of verbs and gerunds, such as “walking,” so that you say “Are you walking to the park?” instead of “Are you walkin’ to the park?” Be sure to include both words in short phrases like “going to” and “want to,” and avoid saying “gonna” and “wanna.”"
