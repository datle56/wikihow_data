You may feel like you couldn't ever feel sadder than this. You may want to scream and shout. You may want to lock yourself away alone. All of these are normal feelings and it's perfectly okay to feel this way. [1] X Expert Source Ken Breniman, LCSW, C-IAYT Licensed Clinical Social Worker Expert Interview. 24 April 2020.

      "content": "Recognize normal ways grief can affect people. Coping with loss is more than just being \"sad\" or \"mad.\" It can affect your energy, focus, daily habits, and more. Here are some things you and your loved ones may experience: [3] X Research source [4] X Research source Withdrawing from social interaction Low empathy Apathy Sleep problems Changes in appetite Trouble focusing Stress-related aches and pains (stomachaches, headaches, joint pain, etc.) Questioning religious beliefs Occasional, passive thoughts of death (without wanting to harm yourself)"

      "content": "Talk about how you feel. Keep talking about how you are feeling as much as possible. It may not always be easy to put into words but try to explain to others around you how you are feeling. Close friends and family will want to help you as much as possible but won't always know how, so telling them how you feel and how you need them to act around you will help them to figure out how best to help you."

      "content": "Be aware you may need time to yourself. Whilst it is good to keep talking to others as much as possible, you may also need some time to yourself to process your own thoughts and feelings. This is perfectly fine. You may find that going to a particular place helps you to focus your thoughts—this may be a place that was special to your sibling, your sibling's resting place, a quiet park, or even your own room. You may also find writing down your thoughts and feelings helps you to get things a little more straight in your mind. [5] X Research source"

You might find yourself wondering, \"Why did I start so many petty fights?\" or, \"How come I couldn't let go of that grudge?\" It's natural to wonder why you didn't make better use of the time you had together after the death of someone close. It's also beneficial to forgive yourself for your all-too-human flaws. [6] X Research source Try to remember the good and kind ways you treated your sibling instead of regretting bad ways you treated them."

      "content": "Know the signs you need professional help. Therapy or grief counseling could be helpful regardless of how well you think you're coping. But if any of these things are happening, get in touch with a grief or mental health professional: Abusing pills or alcohol in order to sleep Neglecting your basic needs (e.g. not bathing or eating) Obsessing about or obsessively avoiding reminders of the loss, so much that you're not doing important life tasks Self-destructive behavior Wanting to die Recurring thoughts of hurting yourself Symptoms of mental illness (delusions, hallucinations, panic attacks, etc.)"

      "content": "Take good care of yourself. Grieving the loss of a loved one is both emotionally and physically draining. You may lose your appetite, be unable to sleep, or fall into unhealthy habits in the hope of feeling a little better. Because physical and emotional health are intertwined, make time to support both. [7] X Research source Concentrate on eating a healthy diet . If you've lost your appetite, try to eat frequent, healthy snacks and drink lots of water . Maintain a consistent sleep schedule and create a welcoming sleep environment to help you get more quality rest . Make time to maintain your previous level of physical activity, or even begin an exercise program that may be beneficial to you. Avoid unhealthy, temporary \"fixes\" such as excessive alcohol consumption, illicit drug use, self harm, eating unhealthy foods, or engaging in risky behaviors. You'll probably find that talking about your feelings with someone is far more effective."

      "content": "Communicate openly, honestly, and frequently with other family members. Each of you had a unique relationship with the deceased and will deal with grief in your own unique way. Having said that, the deceased's other loved ones are best suited to understand what you're going through as a result of this particular loss. Share your emotions and listen to others compassionately and without judgment. These people are likely just trying to help and may not feel comfortable asking you directly how you are feeling. But always remember that your emotions, and your ways of grieving and coping, are just as valid as anybody else's."

Other siblings, your parents, cousins, grandparents, friends, aunts and uncles will all be touched by your sibling's death in different ways. Remember this and treat their wishes and emotions with the same respect you want yours to be treated. You may get asked a lot how your parents are coping, and this may seem hurtful and disrespectful if it feels like people are ignoring your feelings over that of your parents. Don't judge your family members for coping differently. Some may cry openly while others act numb or throw themselves into problems they can solve. All this is normal. When someone is upset, you can validate their feelings , offer tissues or a hand to hold, and ask what they need right now. Even just sitting with someone while they cry can mean a lot."

Turn to other people for comfort when needed, and do your best to comfort other people when grief overwhelms them. Don't feel like you need to \"stay strong\" for your loved ones.

Could we go out and do something fun?\" \"I'm just so upset and I need someone to talk to. Are you available to listen?\" \"I don't want pity from coworkers or anything, just some understanding if I'm not at my best for a little while.\" \"People at the church have been so kind sending casseroles, but our fridge is overflowing. But if anyone is available, some babysitting or help with chores would be a blessing.\" \"I know we need to clean my brother's room, but I'm struggling. Would you be willing to join me?\""
