      "content": "Use Lineman’s pliers to splice or cut electrical wires. Lineman’s pliers have their cutting device on the side, and they are used for many different construction and electrical jobs. If you need to grip, strip , or cut any sort of electrical wire, this is the safest choice. [1] X Research source Lineman’s pliers are also known as “side cutting” pliers."

      "title": "Select long-nose pliers if you are cutting a small-gauged wire.",
      "content": "Select long-nose pliers if you are cutting a small-gauged wire. Long-nose pliers have a slim, pointed end, and the ends of the pliers may be either straight or bent. These are often used to reach small wires or get into awkward places. Use these if you are cutting 8- to 24- gauge wire. [2] X Research source Since they have a narrow tip, long-nose pliers also work great to bend loops into wires and attach multiple wires together. If you are cutting wire for a jewelry project or trimming guitar strings, this may be a good option."

      "content": "Go with diagonal cutting pliers for a standard, all-purpose option. If you don’t have many tools but need a basic wire-cutter, this is the tool for you. [3] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 30 July 2021. Diagonal cutting pliers have a sharp, rounded tip, making them great for stripping and cutting wire. You can use these for nearly any type of wire. [4] X Research source Diagonal cutting pliers are also widely used for removing pins and nails as well. If you want to cut a wire hanger, for example, this is a good option. Diagonal pliers are also called \"dikes.\" [5] X Expert Source Ryaan Tuttle Home Improvement Specialist Expert Interview. 30 July 2021."

      "title": "Try end-cutting pliers if you want to make a close cut.",
      "content": "Try end-cutting pliers if you want to make a close cut. End-cutting pliers have a short, stunted tip, which works great for trimming wire without taking much off the end. These work great for projects where you don’t have much wire left over or if you need to splice 2 wires close together. [6] X Research source You can also use end-cutting pliers to cut nails and rivets."

      "title": "Avoid using scissors to cut wire.",
      "content": "Avoid using scissors to cut wire. It is best to use a wire cutter or plier hand tool rather than using scissors or a blade. Even a sharp pair of scissors may not cut through wire without damaging the internal metal. [7] X Research source It is also easy to slip and cut yourself when cutting wire with a pair of scissors, since the blade may not grip the wire as well as a set of pliers."

      "title": "Wear safety glasses to protect against flyaway pieces.",
      "content": "Wear safety glasses to protect against flyaway pieces. While you are snipping and stripping wire, pieces of the coating or the wire can fly up and pierce your eye. To prevent this, always put on safety glasses or goggles to cover your eyes. [8] X Research source If you'd like, you can also wear protective gloves to prevent poking your fingers with the wires. While this is not required, it can be helpful if cutting lots of wire at the same time."

      "title": "Put your wire on a flat work surface so you can stand comfortably.",
      "content": "Put your wire on a flat work surface so you can stand comfortably. Place the object you are working with on a table or countertop. You want to stand comfortably without having to bend forward or backward when you make your cuts. This way, you have less chance of injuring yourself. [9] X Research source If you are leaning forward or backward and happen to lose your balance, you have a greater chance of hurting yourself with your tool or hitting your head."

      "title": "Shut down the power source if you have one before snipping any wires.",
      "content": "Shut down the power source if you have one before snipping any wires. If you are cutting electrical wires, audio wires, or computer wires, be sure to power down your device before you get started. If your device is still on, you could get shocked as you make your snips, or your wires can get damaged. [10] X Research source For instance, if you are cutting the wires in your computer, make sure the computer is powered off before you begin."

      "title": "Unravel the wire from the spool if cutting new wire.",
      "content": "Unravel the wire from the spool if cutting new wire. If you are cutting a fresh piece of jewelry wire, barbed wire, or electrical wire, for example, find the end of the wire and pull it off of the spool to your desired length. [11] X Research source This way, you can have a smaller piece of wire to size and shape as needed."

      "title": "Ensure your tools are clean, sharp, and in good condition.",
      "content": "Ensure your tools are clean, sharp, and in good condition. If the blade of your tool is dull or if there is a lot of rust, the tool may not cut the wire correctly. Also, wipe down your tool with a clean cloth before you get started. If your pliers or wire cutters are dirty before you use them, this can cause you to slip up as you make the cut. If your tools are not in proper working condition, do not use them. [12] X Research source Additionally, apply a drop of oil to your tool every 1-3 weeks to keep them in good condition. The oil makes the hinge work better over time."

      "title": "Grip the handles of your tool properly and securely.",
      "content": "Grip the handles of your tool properly and securely. Hold the pliers in your dominant hand so your thumb sits on top of one end of the handle and your other fingers fit around the other end. This helps you control the tool when making your snips. [13] X Research source If you hold the tool incorrectly, you can slip when you make your cut, injuring yourself or damaging the wire."

      "title": "Bring the tool to your wire where you want to make your cut.",
      "content": "Bring the tool to your wire where you want to make your cut. Open the handle of your tool all of the way, and place your wire at the inner snipping section of your pliers or cutters. Place the wire in your tool so the spot you want to snip is exactly centered with the tip of your tool. [14] X Research source The inner snipping section is slightly different depending on your tool. For instance, diagonal cutting pliers will have a diagonally-shaped blade."

      "title": "Make your cut at a right angle so you don’t damage the wire.",
      "content": "Make your cut at a right angle so you don’t damage the wire. For a clean, even cut, position your tool at a right angle after you bring the tool to the wire. This way, the blade of your plier or wire cutter can easily make a clean cut. [15] X Research source If you do not cut the wire at a right angle, you may damage the wire and it may not work any longer."

    {
      "title": "Apply force gently onto the handles to snip the wire.",
      "content": "Apply force gently onto the handles to snip the wire. When you cut wire, it’s best to slowly and gradually make your cut. Squeeze both sides of the handle together gradually so you do not use too much force. As you do this, avoid rocking your tool from side to side or bending the wire. [16] X Research source If you cut the wire too forcefully, the tail of the wire may fly up into the air. If the wire does not cut entirely with 1 snip, open the handle of your tool and make another cut at a right angle."
