      "content": "Dab concealer underneath your eyes. Concealer is a base foundation that can offset the color of a dark circle under your eye. Choose a color of concealer that has opposite tones of color from the tones that are in your dark circles. Use a color wheel to determine what colors are the opposite of the ones you want to conceal. For example, if your dark circles have yellow tones, use a concealer with a purple tone. This will help neutralize the dark color under your eyes. Alternately, you can choose a concealer that is one skin tone lighter than your own skin tone. Gently dab the concealer under your eyes and tap at it with your finger, blending it across the skin under your eyes to make sure it is not noticeable. If you aren't able to buy concealer you can make your own by mixing equal parts of lotion and a powder that suits your skin colour then apply it."
