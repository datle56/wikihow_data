      "title": "Take out any Bunchems that are easy to remove with your hands.",
      "content": "Take out any Bunchems that are easy to remove with your hands. Before you apply any product, see if there are any balls that can easily be removed. To test one, look for a Bunchem that doesn't have as much hair surrounding it and tug the ball lightly. If it gives or starts to loosen, try to work it out with your fingers. Stop as soon as you begin having trouble pulling it out. You don't want to break the hair."

    {
      "title": "Apply a moisturizing product to the hair near the stuck Bunchem.",
      "content": "Apply a moisturizing product to the hair near the stuck Bunchem. Products that are moisturizing, like hair conditioner, or ones with oil, like peanut butter, soften the hair so it's easier to pull out the Bunchem. Use your hands to work the product into the strands wrapped around the ball, along with the hair immediately surrounding the area. Continue rubbing in the product until the hair is completely saturated. [1] X Research source The amount of product you'll need depends on how many Bunchems you have to remove and how large the balls are. Bigger Bunchems require more product. You can also use an old toothbrush to scrub the product into the hair on the ball."

    {
      "title": "Comb the hair underneath the Bunchem.",
      "content": "Comb the hair underneath the Bunchem. The product will loosen any knots or tangles in the hair near the stuck ball. After you apply it, run a comb through the strands below the Bunchem to work out any knotted areas. [2] X Research source If you have thick hair, use a wide-tooth comb. For thin hair, you can go with a fine-tooth comb. Don't tug or pull at knots too hard. If you have trouble combing through a tangle, start at the very end of the hair, untangling section by section as you work your way up the strand towards the root."

      "title": "Remove the Bunchem by sliding it down to the end of the hair.",
      "content": "Remove the Bunchem by sliding it down to the end of the hair. Instead of trying to pull the ball out away from the hair, pull it down along the strands you just combed. Use your fingers to gently work it away from the end of the hair. [3] X Research source If the ball gets stuck or isn't sliding out easily, apply more product to the area to soften it more. Then comb through the strands again before attempting to pull the Bunchem out."

    {
      "title": "Wash the hair with shampoo and water to remove any excess product.",
      "content": "Wash the hair with shampoo and water to remove any excess product. Once you take out all of the Bunchems, clean the hair with the shampoo of your choice, paying special attention to the area where you applied product. Scrub the shampoo into the strands thoroughly to break up any remaining product, then rinse it out with warm water. Use a scented shampoo if you used a smelly product, like WD-40 or peanut butter. If there's still product or an oily feel to your hair after you wash it, you may need to shampoo it 1 to 2 more times."

      "title": "Loosen the Bunchem as much as you can without breaking the hair.",
      "content": "Loosen the Bunchem as much as you can without breaking the hair. Before you start cutting, gently pull the Bunchem away from the scalp as much as possible without hurting your child or damaging any hair. The further you can loosen the ball, the more hair length you can save. Do not tug too hard on the Bunchem. Stop detangling once you can't safely pull the ball out any further. You can apply a product like conditioner or oil to the hair around the stuck Bunchem to help soften the tangles first."

    {
      "title": "Use hair shears to carefully cut the strands close to the Bunchem.",
      "content": "Use hair shears to carefully cut the strands close to the Bunchem. Try to snip off as little hair as you can to loosen the ball. Weave the hair shears between the Bunchem and the strands holding it in place, then squeeze the blades of the shears together to cut the hair. [4] X Research source Never use regular office scissors on hair. They can damage hair and cause uneven cuts. Always cut hair when it's dry. Wet hair shortens as it dries, so you could end up cutting off more than you'd like. You can buy hair shears from a beauty store or online retailer."

      "title": "Pull the Bunchem gently away from the scalp once the ball is loosened.",
      "content": "Pull the Bunchem gently away from the scalp once the ball is loosened. While you cut, occasionally wiggle the Bunchem and try to remove it. As soon as it gives enough that you can take it out with breaking any hair, do so carefully. Pull the ball in small, slow spurts instead of 1 long yank to protect the hair that's left. Use your fingers or a comb to loosen the hair around the Bunchem as you remove it. This could help salvage some more of the strands instead of cutting them immediately. Snip any stubborn strands that are still caught on the ball if necessary."

      "title": "Go to a stylist if the cut needs to be blended into the rest of the hair.",
      "content": "Go to a stylist if the cut needs to be blended into the rest of the hair. If there were a lot of Bunchems that you had to cut out or if the missing chunk is very obvious, make an appointment at a nearby salon to fix it. Ask the stylist to disguise the affected area while also cutting a flattering hairstyle. [5] X Research source Bring pictures of hairstyles you like to show the stylist. Look on Pinterest or Instagram for inspiration or find a photo online. Be open to suggestions from the stylist. They might have ideas for how to best remove the Bunchems and shaping the rest of the hair in a way that looks good."
