      "title": "Crack the eggs into a bowl.",
      "content": "Crack the eggs into a bowl. Always begin by cracking open the eggs into a large bowl or other container. Raw egg, just like any material that contains significant amounts of water, will expand when frozen. If the eggs are frozen in the shell, this expansion could crack open the egg. Besides mixing shell fragments into the edible part of the egg, this could introduce harmful bacteria from the outside of the shell. [1] X Research source If the eggs are near or past their expiration date, crack each one into a \"test bowl\" before transferring to the larger container. Discard eggs with obvious discoloration or a strong, unpleasant smell, then wash the test bowl before cracking the next egg."

      "content": "Add another ingredient to prevent graininess (recommended). Raw egg yolks tend to become gelatinous when frozen. When mixed with egg white, this can cause a grainy texture in the frozen egg mixture. There are two main ways to prevent this, depending on your intended use for the eggs. If you are using them alone or in savory dishes, stir in 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of salt for each cup (240 mL) of raw egg. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Center for Home Food Preservation Publicly-funded center dedicated to educating consumers about research-backed safety practices for preserving food Go to source If you are using them in sweet dishes, instead stir in 1 – 1.5 tbsp (15 – 22 mL) of sugar, honey, or corn syrup.

      "content": "Freeze in freezer-safe containers. Pour the mixture into freezer-safe containers, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space between the egg and the lid to allow for expansion. Tightly seal the containers. Alternatively, freeze the egg mixtures in a clean ice cube tray first, then pop the cubes out into a larger, freezer-safe container. This may make it easier to thaw the amount of egg you need.

      "content": "Label the container with three important facts. The eggs typically remain high quality for several months to a year, so it's a good idea to label them rather than relying on your memory. [7] X Research source Remember to include: The date you froze them. The number of eggs you froze. The additional ingredient you mixed in (if applicable). This helps you avoid the unpleasant surprise of using sugary eggs in a savory dish."

Transfer the raw egg back and forth between the two halves, letting the white drip bit by bit into a bowl until only the yolk remains in the shell.

Any temperature above 39ºF (4ºC) carries significant risk of bacterial contamination for thawing food. You may speed up the thawing process safely by placing the container under cold running water. Never attempt to cook frozen eggs directly on a frying pan or in a dish. Do not leave frozen eggs to thaw at room temperature."

If the eggs were frozen separated, use 2 tbsp (30 mL) thawed raw egg white instead of the white of one egg, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) thawed raw egg yolk instead of one egg yolk. Egg sizes can vary greatly, so don't worry too much about the exact amount. If baking, you can adjust to a dry or wet dough by adding more wet or dry ingredients, respectively, to balance it out."
