      "content": "Know at what stage you need to start fasting. In Islam, it's compulsory for you to fast when you reach puberty, which is usually around the time you reach your teens. While it's highly encouraged to start earlier to get used to fasting, you should begin by the time you hit puberty. [3] X Research source The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “The pens have been lifted from three: from one who has lost his mind until he comes back to his senses, from one who is sleeping until he wakes up, and from a child until he reaches the age of adolescence.” [Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4399; classed as Saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.] [4] X Research source If you don't know if you're ready to fast yet or think it's still too early, talk to your parents about it. They'll discuss whether you're required to fast yet. Puberty is reached when one of three things occurs - reaching the age of 15, growth of coarse hair around the private parts, or ejaculation (wet dreams). For females a fourth sign is menstruation. After puberty is reached then the person becomes accountable for their sins and should complete all compulsory acts of worship, including fasting in Ramadan."

      "content": "Talk to your parents about fasting. Before you begin fasting in Ramadan, be sure to discuss whether you're required to fast this year. This is especially important if you have health problems. Lack of food and water for several hours can be extremely dangerous for some teens, causing dehydration, severe starvation, and fainting spells. [5] X Research source If you're not physically capable of fasting yet, you should not fast for your own well-being. Your parents will let you know if they think you're healthy enough to fast for the month of Ramadan. If needed, talk to a doctor about fasting before attempting to do so, especially if you've had health problems in the past that involved lack of food and water."

      "content": "Understand why Muslims fast in Ramadan. In the Quran, Islam's holy book, it's been ordered for all Muslims to fast during the month of Ramadan. Allah says, \"O you who believe, fasting has been prescribed for you as it has been prescribed to those before you in order that you may attain Taqwa [consciousness of Allah]\" [2:183]. [6] X Research source [7] X Research source Fasting brings us closer to Allah and reminds us of those who are less fortunate than us. It also helps us practice self-restraint. [8] X Research source Fasting is also one of the five pillars of Islam. The pillars are known as the foundation for your Islamic life and are a must to follow. The pillars include believing in Allah alone, performing Salah (prayer), fasting in the month of Ramadan, paying Zakat (charity), and performing Hajj. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Learn when you don't have to fast. There are some people who are excused from fasting during Ramadan. These include people who are sick, traveling, pregnant or breastfeeding, people who haven’t reached puberty yet, and people who are senile. Typically, senior citizens are included; however, many who are healthy enough continue to fast. [10] X Research source For those who are sick or traveling: You do not need to fast until you recover or come back from your trip because Allah says, “... But if anyone is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days] should be made up from the other days.” [11] X Research source When Ramadan is over, you’ll need to make up the number of days you missed. [12] X Research source For those who are pregnant or breastfeeding: Anas ibn Maalik al-Ka’bi narrated that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Allah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of prayer, and He has relieved the pregnant and breastfeeding woman of fasting.” For the child's well-being, a person does not have to fast if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. For those who are old in age: Allah says, “And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [as substitute] of feeding a poor person [each day]” [13] X Research source Senior citizens who are not able to fast can make up their fasting by feeding a poor person everyday they don't fast. [14] X Research source For those who are on their periods: You cannot fast while you're having your period. Once your period ends, you must perform ghusl and continue fasting."

      "title": "Know how to fast.",
      "content": "Know how to fast. To begin fasting, you'd eat a light meal called Suhoor before dawn. This meal is not essential, but it's highly encouraged to do so in order to gain the blessing of fasting for the day. After eating Suhoor, have the Niyyah (intention) to fast the entire day by telling yourself, \"I intend to observe my fast for today.\" When the sun sets, you can break your fast and eat Iftar, the meal that is eaten to end the fast.

This includes brushing your teeth, swallowing things that aren't possible to avoid (e.g. your own saliva), unintentional vomiting, bathing, getting an injection or IV for medical reasons, and eating or drinking by mistake (forgetting you're fasting). [17] X Research source It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (SAW) said: “Whoever forgets [that] he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for it is Allah Who has fed him and given him to drink.\" [18] X Research source"

Your body will deal with deprivation better if you start off well-hydrated. You also don't want to be unhealthy and dehydrated when you start fasting, so be sure you're drinking eight glasses of water each day. [19] X Research source Try to become more focused on Allah - every moment spent remembering Allah will be generously rewarded, especially during Ramadan."

      "content": "Start weaning down your meals and eating less. Cut down on some foods, such as snacks and desserts, and stick to eating three meals each day. You may want to wean yourself off of foods containing sugar and white flour a week or two before you start fasting, so that your body won't be suffering from major cravings on top of hunger pangs. [20] X Research source Slowly lessen your meals and keep them light so you can train your body to eat little, making it easier when it's time to fast."

Train yourself ahead of time by taking a few cat naps throughout the day that last no more than thirty minutes. [22] X Research source A good napping time is usually during the afternoon. It's the best time to recharge your body for the evening. [23] X Research source Avoid taking naps longer than thirty minutes.

During Ramadan, having Suhoor and Iftar with the family is a common tradition, and eating as a group brings more blessing to the meal. You may want to start grocery shopping for some foods to prepare big meals for the family. Be sure to buy dates, too. In order to break your fast, you must eat a date or drink water. It's highly encouraged to break your fast with dates, though, so be sure to buy some when grocery shopping. Create a grocery shopping list to keep track of what foods you need to buy for Ramadan.

You might want to make a goal of fasting the whole month of Ramadan, or trying to at least fast for part of it (if you have not yet reached puberty). Having it as a goal will motivate you to fast and encourage you to attempt fasting. Have the intention (Niyyah) to fast before starting to do so. This is to ensure that you're serious about fasting and will try your best to do it.

Eating Suhoor is Sunnah, meaning it's highly encouraged to do so in order to follow the Prophet Muhammad's actions, but there is no sin on you if you skip it. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Prophet (SAW) said: “Eat Suhoor, for in Suhoor there is blessing.” [Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1923; Muslim, 1095.] [25] X Research source Suhoor has been known to give you strength throughout the day when fasting. It can minimize thirst, prevent headaches, and avoid making you feel sick when you fast. It's highly encouraged not to miss out this meal before fasting. [26] X Research source Try to stick to simple, nutritious meals that have plenty of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Rice, bread, pasta, salads, dates, fruits, crackers, and soup are all good options. [27] X Research source Avoid salty, greasy foods and extremely sweet desserts.

Before breaking your fast, make Dua to Allah to accept your fast and pray for other things you desire. During this period of time, all Duas are accepted. [32] X Research source When you're ready to break your fast, eat a date or drink water. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “When one of you is fasting, he should break his fast with dates; but if he cannot get any, then (he should break his fast) with water, for water is purifying.“ Once you've broken your fast, you can eat a bit and take more sips of water. You can choose to eat Iftar right away or pray Magrib first. Praying first is encouraged, however, because after eating Iftar you're usually full and feel too tired to pray. [33] X Research source There are many different Duas you can say when breaking your fast, but the most common one is \"Dhahaba al-zama' wa abtalat al-'urooq wa thabata al-ajr in sha Allah\" (ذَهَبَ الظَّمَأُ وَ ابْتَلَّتِ الْعُرُوقُ، وَ ثَبَتَ الأجْرُ إنْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ), which means in English \"The thirst is gone, the veins are moistened, and the reward is confirmed, if Allah Wills\"."

Follow the same rulings you would do when normally eating food. Don't eat too much or too fast, as that could harm your body. This is especially important since you've fasted all day. Giving your stomach too much food to digest after it hasn't been used all day is very unsafe. When eating, eat slowly and use proper table manners, as though you were a guest in someone's house.
