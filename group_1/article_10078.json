Heat the water until it comes to a boil. [1] X Research source The pot should be at least 2-quarts (1.89 liters) in size."

[3] X Research source Although many people don't like to poke the sausages, you can insert a meat thermometer to check the temperature. The weisswurst should reach 170 °F (77 °C)."

      "content": "Remove and serve the classic Bavarian weisswurst. Turn off the heat and scoop the cooked sausages to a large serving bowl. Spoon some of the salted water from the pot into the bowl with the sausages. Let guests help themselves to the weisswurst and serve it with sweet mustard, a large pretzel, and a Bavarian beer. [4] X Research source You can slit and peel off the casings from the weisswurst. Or to eat them traditionally, trim off the end of the weisswurst and suck the sausage out of the casing."

      "content": "Sauté the weisswurst for 2 to 4 minutes. Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil into a large, heavy skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. Place 1 pound (453 g) of weisswurst in a single layer in the skillet. Sauté and turn the sausages frequently until they're golden brown on the outside. This should take 2 to 4 minutes. [5] X Research source Use a skillet that's at least 12-inches (30 cm) in diameter. Avoid over cooking the weisswurst since they'll finish cooking in the oven. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan while searing, which will lead to uneven browning. Instead, do 2 or 3 sausages at a time in batches if need be; then, add them all back to the pan when they're done searing to complete the cooking process."

Cover the grill and cook the weisswurst until they're completely hot throughout. Turn the weisswurst occasionally and grill them for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve the hot weisswurst. Avoid poking the weisswurst casing with a fork, knife or tongs to prevent the flavorful liquid inside the sausage from leaking."

Place the weisswurst on the grill over indirect heat. Cover the grill and let the weisswurst cook until they reach 140 °F (60 °C). Frequently turn the sausages and spray them with a little water or beer, so they brown evenly and don't split."
