      "title": "Go from the Lobby to the Bunker.",
      "content": "Go from the Lobby to the Bunker. You can find a trapdoor leading to the Bunker next to OVERKILL’s stand. Then, go through a door on the left and under a cardboard box to be teleported to the start of a maze. Get through it and walk into a house—sometimes called “the Cabin”— once you’ve exited; you’ll find a lever there. [1] X Research source You can also obtain the Cube of Life behind the Cabin (which regenerates HP). In front of the Cabin, climb a spiral staircase to grab an extra life."

      "title": "Click the lever to start the Guide boss battle.",
      "content": "Click the lever to start the Guide boss battle. Once you pull the lever, anyone not in the Cabin will die (so be sure you’re ready before clicking on it). The floor will open, and you’ll fall right into the Guide boss battle. From there, complete the boss battle and defeat the Guide. [2] X Research source There are 3 phases of the boss battle: Phase 1: Slapstractor - This phase includes 7 different attacks used by gloves in the main game. Phase 2: Enraged Slapstractor - In this phase, attacks are the same, but they’re faster. Phase 3: Guide - Once you destroy the Slapstractor, you’ll face off against the Guide himself."

      "title": "Let Guide die to gain the Hunter glove.",
      "content": "Let Guide die to gain the Hunter glove. After the battle, once the Guide is defeated, you’ll get the option to either spare him or let him die. Choose to let him die (the “no” choice), and you’ll get the Bounty Claimed badge—as well as the Hunter glove. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "The Hunter glove has a unique ability that targets random players.",
      "content": "The Hunter glove has a unique ability that targets random players. When the ability is triggered (by pressing “E”), you’ll hear “Target acquired.” The glove will start tracking a random player with a red mark—and if the player is killed, you’ll gain a red aura that increases your power to 90 and speed to 22. The effect will last for 10 seconds. On the other hand, if a player slaps away the red target mark, you’ll hear “Target lost” (and won’t get a stat boost)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Pros",
      "content": "Pros The power and speed buffs from this glove are quite decent—the same as you’d get from a kill streak of 10. You can also chain the buff by targeting other players after each 10-second cooldown and target new players to get the buff faster. And, since the glove’s ability sticks to other players, you can track them even when they’re hiding or invisible. [4] X Research source The glove’s buffs also make it possible to kill several other targets within 10 seconds or even large groups."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cons",
      "content": "Cons Because targeting is random, you might catch anyone in your crosshairs, even people you might not want to target (like people with one-shot gloves equipped) or people in faraway, hard-to-reach locations. And if you’re not the last person to hit a target before they die, you won’t get the Hunter glove’s buff—so it can be tough to use in crowds. [5] X Research source If you’re working with a friend or team, be careful—there’s a chance your Hunter glove could randomly target them if you use its ability."

    {
      "title": "The Hitman glove’s ability has a similar theme to the Hunter glove.",
      "content": "The Hitman glove’s ability has a similar theme to the Hunter glove. The Hitman glove is also related to the Guide, but it isn’t acquired through the boss battle; rather, you can get it by collecting both the Sharp Shooter badge (by killing 10 players with Track’s ability) and the court evidence badge (by clicking on the knife that’s stuck in the Guide, beneath the lobby). [6] X Research source Hitman has a “Mystery Ability” that lets users see how many times the players around them have been slapped. Users can collect the slaps of players they kill—and this affects the user’s abilities. Players’ bounties also increase based on the number of times they’ve slapped other people. Reminder: currently, you must be in a public server to get the Hitman glove (you can’t do it in a private server)."

      "title": "The Hunt is an obtainable badge that comes with the Glovel glove.",
      "content": "The Hunt is an obtainable badge that comes with the Glovel glove. In other words, it’s a badge paired with an entirely different glove (unrelated to Hunter). You can accept a mission called “A Hunt for the Hunter” from the Hitman (an NPC), and you’ll get Slap Battles’ Hunt badge and the Glovel glove after completing it. [7] X Research source Glovel has a “shovel” ability that digs a hole into the ground for 3 seconds. Then, the user can move around in the ground, leaving a dirt trail behind them. While in the ground, users are also invincible and can stay underground as long as they want."
