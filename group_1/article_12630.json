      "content": "Don't overlook a sudden and severe headache. If an artery bursts in your brain due to an aneurysm, it will cause a severe headache that comes on suddenly. This headache is the key symptom of a ruptured brain aneurysm. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Usually this headache will feel much worse than any headache you have ever experienced. The headache is usually fairly localized, confined to whichever side of the head where the artery burst. For example, if the artery near your eye bursts, it will cause severe pain that radiates into your eye. The headache may also be associated with nausea, disorientation, and/or vomiting."

      "title": "Note any disturbances to your vision.",
      "content": "Note any disturbances to your vision. Double vision, reduced vision, blurred vision, or blindness are all indicators of a cerebral aneurysm. Vision disturbances occur because of pressure on the arterial wall near the eyes that cuts off blood flow to eyes. The optic nerve can also be pinched by the accumulating blood, causing blurry or double vision. Blindness in this situation is caused by ischemia of the retina, where the blood flow to the retinal tissues is insufficient.

      "content": "Check for dilated pupils in the mirror. Dilated pupils are a common sign of cerebral aneurysm, due to the blockage of an artery near the eyes. Usually, one of your pupils will be significantly more dilated than the other. It will also be sluggish and unresponsive to light. [3] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source The enlarged pupil is caused by the pressure of blood accumulating within the brain. Dilated pupils may indicate that an aneurysm just happened, shown by artery damage located near the eyes."

      "content": "Pay attention to eye pain. Your eyes may throb or feel intense pain during an aneurysm. [4] X Research source This happens when the affected artery is near the eyes. The eye pain will usually be one-sided pain, because it is local to the part of the brain that had an aneurysm."

[5] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The ruptured artery does not necessarily have to be nearby the exact place in the neck where the pain is felt. This is because the nerves in the neck extend a decent distance up and down the neck and head area. Pain will project itself past the site of the aneurysm."

If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, call your emergency services (like 911 in the US or 999 in the UK) immediately. [7] X Research source Experts do not recommend that you drive yourself or have a family member drive you to the hospital.Aneurysms can cause severe debilitation in a short period of time, making it dangerous to be behind the wheel.

The aorta is the primary artery that delivers blood to your heart and to all your other extremities, and an aneurysm affecting the aorta can be classified into two sub-types: [8] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An aneurysm that happens in the abdominal (stomach) area is called an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is the most common type of aneurysm and is fatal in 80% of cases. [9] X Research source Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). This type of aneurysm is located in the chest area and occurs above the diaphragm. During a TAA, a section near the heart enlarges and affects the valve between the heart and aorta. When this happens, a backflow of blood occurs in heart, causing damage to the cardiac muscles."

An MRI can be used to diagnose any type of aneurysm. In some cases, MRI and cerebral angiography may be performed together to support each other. With the use of computer-generated radio waves and magnetic fields, an MRI can produce more detailed images of the brain's blood vessels compared to a CT scan. The procedure is safe and painless.

      "content": "Understand the cause of a cerebral aneurysm. A cerebral aneurysm happens when an artery in the brain weakens and forms into a balloon before rupturing. They often form at forks or branches in arteries, the weakest sections of blood vessels. [23] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When the balloon ruptures, continuous bleeding in the brain will occur. Blood is toxic to the brain, and when bleeding happens, it is often called hemorrhagic syndrome.

Some of them cannot be controlled, such as inherited genetic conditions, but others can be reduced by smart lifestyle choices. Here are common risk factors for cerebral and aortic aneurysms: [24] X Research source Smoking elevates your risk of both types of aneurysms. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, damages blood vessels and the lining of the aorta. Aging increases your risk of cerebral aneurysms after age 50. [25] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source The aorta becomes stiffer with age, and the prevalence of aneurysms increases as you get older. [26] X Trustworthy Source National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Research and education center within the National Institutes of Health Go to source Inflammation can cause damage that leads to aneurysms. Conditions like vasculitis (an inflammation of the blood vessels) can damage and scar the aorta. Trauma, such as falls or motor vehicle accidents, can damage the aorta. Infections such as syphilis (an STI) can damage the lining of the aorta. Bacterial or fungal infections of the brain can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of aneurysm. [27] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Substance use or abuse, especially cocaine use and heavy alcohol consumption, cause hypertension that can lead to brain aneurysms. Gender plays a role in your risk for aneurysms. Men develop aortic aneurysms at a higher rate than women do, but women are at higher risk for developing brain aneurysms. Certain inherited conditions, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome (both connective tissue disorders), can cause weakening of cerebral blood vessels and the aorta.

Eating foods high in soluble fiber, especially oatmeal and oat bran, will help reduce “bad” cholesterol (LDL). Apples, pears, kidney beans, barley, and prunes also contain soluble fiber.
