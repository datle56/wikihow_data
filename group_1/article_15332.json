      "title": "Choose the freshest possible burrata.",
      "content": "Choose the freshest possible burrata. This cheese contains a lot of water, which evaporates quickly. Your burrata will be less creamy the longer you wait to eat it. Try to find cheese that was made within the past day, if possible. [1] X Research source Burrata can be found in specialty grocery stores or cheese shops. If your local store has a dairy counter, ask them when the burrata was made so you know it’s fresh."

      "content": "Store the cheese in the fridge and eat it within 48 hours for the best flavor. Burrata will stay fresh longer if it’s stored at 40 °F (4 °C). Even stored in the fridge, however, burrata is best eaten within 48 hours. You can eat it past this point, but it might not be as good. [2] X Research source If you need to store it longer, keep burrata in its own brine and store it in your fridge for up to a week."

      "title": "Take the cheese out of the fridge 30 minutes before serving it.",
      "content": "Take the cheese out of the fridge 30 minutes before serving it. A half hour to an hour before you want to enjoy the burrata, set it out at room temperature so it can warm up a little. This will ensure that the creamy center of the burrata is not too solid. You can also put your cheese in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes to warm it up. Most burrata comes in a small bag, so you can place that directly in the water. Make sure to drain it well before you serve the cheese! [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Place your burrata in a bowl, and top with olive oil and salt.",
      "content": "Place your burrata in a bowl, and top with olive oil and salt. It’s better to serve this cheese in a bowl rather than a plate, because when you cut into it the curd at the center will spill out. Drizzle a small amount of high-quality olive oil onto the burrata and sprinkle a bit of salt on top to enhance the burrata’s flavor. [4] X Research source Wait to cut into the burrata until you serve it so everyone can immediately dig in to the fresh curd. Adjust the amount of salt you add based on your own preferences. Burrata doesn’t have a strong flavor to begin with, but if you’re only getting a mild milk flavor and not much else, a small amount of salt can help the flavor stand out more. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Serve burrata with cured meats and a slice of crusty bread. For a simple snack or light meal, just spread the cheese on a piece of bread. Use toasted bread, or one with a tougher crust, to get a nice contrast in textures with the creamy burrata. [6] X Research source The cheese’s mild flavor also pairs excellently with the saltiness of cured meats like prosciutto. To toast bread, slice a baguette into 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) slices and bake for 5 minutes at 400 °F (204 °C). Flip over each slice, bake another 5 minutes, and brush with olive oil once it’s done. [7] X Research source You can also brush slices of bread with olive oil and heat them in a griddle pan or skillet until they’re lightly browned."
