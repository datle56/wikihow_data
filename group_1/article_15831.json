    {
      "title": "Use polite language to formulate your request.",
      "content": "Use polite language to formulate your request. With a personal letter, you typically provide some background information about why you're making the request, then state your request directly. A phrase such as \"would you\" or \"could you\" lets the recipient know that you aren't taking it for granted that they'll fulfill your request. [2] X Research source For example, you might write \"Would you be willing to accompany my sister to the fundraiser so she doesn't have to go alone?\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Start a new paragraph for any follow-up request.",
      "content": "Start a new paragraph for any follow-up request. If you need a response from the recipient by a certain date, or need them to do anything else related to the request, keep it separate from the main request. This lets the recipient know that the follow-up request is subordinate to the main request. [3] X Research source To continue with the previous example, a follow-up request might be \"We would also be grateful if you were willing to drive her to the event and bring her back home afterward.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank the recipient in advance for fulfilling your request.",
      "content": "Thank the recipient in advance for fulfilling your request. After you've stated your request, include a simple statement thanking the recipient. You can also include a sentence about how much their assistance would mean to you. [4] X Research source For example, you might write \"Thank you in advance for helping us out here. It would mean the world for my sister to attend the fundraiser.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Include any additional information the recipient might need.",
      "content": "Include any additional information the recipient might need. If the request needs to be fulfilled in a specific way, or at a specific time and place, go ahead and include this information after your thanks. You could also include contact information, if you anticipate the recipient will want to talk to you first. [5] X Research source For example, you might write \"My sister would want to get to the fundraiser at least an hour early so she could speak with the organizers.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a complimentary closing before your name.",
      "content": "Add a complimentary closing before your name. A simple closing such as \"Sincerely yours\" works well for personal letters. Depending on how well you know the recipient and the nature of your relationship, you may choose something warmer, such as \"Love\" or \"Love always.\" [6] X Trustworthy Source Purdue Online Writing Lab Trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines Go to source Type a comma after your closing and leave a double-space for your signature. Then type your name below."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include your specific request in the body of the letter.",
      "content": "Include your specific request in the body of the letter. When you're writing a request letter for a business, professional, or academic reason, state the purpose of your letter up front. Preferably, you would include your specific request in the first sentence of your letter, rather than at the end of your letter. [7] X Research source Because you made your request specifically in the first sentence of your letter, there's no need to repeat it at the end of the letter."
    },
    {
      "title": "Thank the recipient for their time and attention.",
      "content": "Thank the recipient for their time and attention. Start a new paragraph, then write a single sentence thanking the recipient for taking the time to read your letter and consider your request. The recipient is likely a busy person, and their time is valuable. Let them know that you appreciate them. [8] X Research source For example, you might write \"Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I really appreciate it.\""
    },
    {
      "title": "Let the recipient know of any deadlines.",
      "content": "Let the recipient know of any deadlines. If you need to know the recipient's answer by a certain date, give them the exact date and time. In some situations, it might be appropriate to provide a brief reason why that deadline is important. For example, you might write \"I apologize for the short notice, but I do need an answer before Monday, April 22. I have booked a flight out of town on that day, and I'll be away for 2 weeks.\""

    {
      "title": "Provide contact information if the recipient has any questions.",
      "content": "Provide contact information if the recipient has any questions. Give the recipient a way to get in touch with you quickly, particularly if you need an answer within a few days. Make sure the contact method you provide is one at which you're commonly available during regular business hours. [9] X Research source For example, you might write \"If you have any questions, feel free to call me at my work number, 222-123-4567.\""

      "title": "Close with a formal and respectful closing.",
      "content": "Close with a formal and respectful closing. A closing such as \"sincerely\" or \"respectfully\" is appropriate for a formal request letter written for a business reason.

If any additional information is necessary, such as a job title or identification number, include it on the line directly below your typed name."
