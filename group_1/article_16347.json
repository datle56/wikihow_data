      "content": "Faneto is speculated to mean finesse in Chief Keef's song. Chicago rapper Chief Keef released a popular song entitled \"Faneto\" where he says the line “I just hit a stain, faneto.” This means he robbed someone and took something valuable from them, which is also referred to as finessing them. [1] X Research source Chief Keef also ad-libs the words “finesse, finesse,” after the line, which points to its meaning. Keef also raps about how he’s not one to be played with, with lines like “We gone come and blow New Jersey up” and “Tryna rob? B*tch we 30’d up” alluding to the fact that he’s willing to do something illegal, like rob someone."

      "content": "Use faneto to emphasize that you’re done with something. When you want to express that you're at the end of your rope and that you're not letting anything else slide, use faneto. Since the meaning is speculative, some people have used “faneto” as a way to show that they’re not tolerating something or letting it slide. If you’re done with something or don’t want it to go on, say “That’s done. Over with. Faneto!” Example: “Man, you said you were about to do WHAT?! I can’t let you slide with that one.

      "content": "Finito is an informal way to say “finished” in Italian. It is used as a casual way to say that you’re done with something or that something is finally done. Faneto is also used this way, but since it has multiple meanings, the way it is used depends on context. [4] X Research source In Spanish, finito means “fine or delicate,” which implies finesse."
