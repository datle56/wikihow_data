      "content": "Use thin cotton clothing as a base layer. Cotton clothing is breathable, which is why it’s the perfect choice for your baby. Layers are great for babies, because you can easily take them off or put them on as needed. When dressing your baby in the winter , start with a base layer of a long-sleeve onesie and pants to keep them warm."

      "title": "Add sweaters and a coat as an outer layer.",
      "content": "Add sweaters and a coat as an outer layer. If you’re headed outside, your baby will need more protection. Add a sweater, a coat, or even a snowsuit to protect your baby from the cold. If it’s snowy or rainy outside, go for a waterproof outer layer. Otherwise, cotton or wool outer layers will keep your baby warm and cozy all day."

      "title": "Add mittens, a hat, and boots for winter temps.",
      "content": "Add mittens, a hat, and boots for winter temps. If you’re headed outdoors, make sure your baby is covered from head to toe. Have them wear mittens, a warm hat, and boots with socks to keep them warm. Pack an extra layer or two in a diaper bag in case temperatures drop or your baby seems chilly. [1] X Research source If your baby will be playing in the snow, make sure their gloves or mittens are waterproof. In very cold temperatures, like anything below 35 °F (2 °C), it’s best not to stay outside with your baby too long. They can’t regulate their temperatures like we do, and they get cold much faster."

      "title": "Use blankets outside or in a stroller.",
      "content": "Use blankets outside or in a stroller. When heading out, your baby might need more bundling up. Grab a blanket and tuck it around them when you’re sitting outside or in a stroller for an extra layer of warmth. [2] X Research source Remember to remove any blankets before putting your baby down for a nap or when they go to bed. Sleep sacks are okay, but loose blankets can be dangerous for your baby to sleep with."

      "content": "Take off bulky layers before using a car seat. It’s not safe to put a baby in their car seat wearing a bulky coat, because you can’t tighten the straps of the seat all the way. If you’re heading out in your car, take your baby’s coat off before buckling them in. Then, drape the coat or a blanket over them to keep them warm during the ride.

      "content": "Remove layers if your baby overheats. If your baby is flushed, is sweating, or feels warm to the touch, it means they are too hot. Take off a layer or two and let them cool down so they don’t overheat. [4] X Research source In general, if you feel too warm and need to take off a few layers, your baby probably does, too."
