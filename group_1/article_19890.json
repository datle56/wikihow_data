You may need to experiment with how long to hold your hair around the iron, as this varies depending on hair type. Start by holding for 10 seconds, and gradually increase that by a few seconds at a time until you get a curl that holds."

However, if you prefer hair spray, spritz your curls with a light- or medium-hold spray. [2] X Research source"

You should be holding the flat iron vertically, with the tip pointing upwards. Your flat iron needs to be thin (think 1-2 inches) with a rounded barrel. The heat from the iron heats up the barrel just enough to curl your hair."

You may need to experiment with how slowly you go here. Holding the flat iron longer at the top ensures a full curl, rather than just curls at the ends. The longer you hold, the more curl you'll get.

If it's easier for you, put each of the sections in a loose ponytail, leaving the one you'll be working on loose.
