Wrap the hair once around the wand, being careful not to burn your fingers. If you have very short pieces in the top layer, you can try curling them upwards, wrapping them once around the wand.

If you can get the piece around your hair twice, you’re good to use it for this method. You can also use objects that are different width, such as a pen that is skinny and a tube of mascara that is wide.

This is fine, as it will still give your hair some curl. You can roll the shorter pieces away from your face, backwards, for more volume. You can roll the shorter pieces towards your face, forwards, if you want the curls to shape your face more. If you have bangs, however, this could create a dated look."
