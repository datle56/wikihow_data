      "title": "Call the police dispatch office.",
      "content": "Call the police dispatch office. Police departments have a non-emergency number that you can call if you want to file a police report over the phone. Do not call 911 unless there is an active crime in progress or people's lives are in danger. Non-emergency situations include things like pickpocketing, criminal damage to property, automobile theft, and garage burglary. Search “police non-emergency number” online to find this number, look through a telephone book, or call 311 (information) if that service is available in your area."

    {
      "title": "Provide your name and location.",
      "content": "Provide your name and location. Identify yourself to the dispatcher who answers the non-emergency number and let them know that you want to file a police report. They will ask for your name and address, as well as the address of your current location if it differs from your place of residence. [1] X Research source You may be able to file a report anonymously over the phone. However, if you don't provide your name and contact information, the police will not be able to follow up with you about the report. Always provide your name and contact information if you suffered a loss as a result of the incident you're reporting, such as if your property was damaged or stolen. That way, if your property is recovered, the police will be able to easily contact you."

    {
      "title": "Describe the incident you’re reporting in detail.",
      "content": "Describe the incident you’re reporting in detail. Let the dispatcher know what happened and when and where the incident occurred. Provide as many factual details as you can remember. Remain calm and stick to the facts. [2] X Research source If you have any photos, videos, or other documents related to the incident, let the dispatcher know. They’ll let you know how you can submit them. The dispatcher may ask you follow-up questions if there is specific information they need that you failed to mention in your description."
    },
    {
      "title": "Meet with an officer if necessary.",
      "content": "Meet with an officer if necessary. Once the dispatcher takes your report, they'll determine if the situation requires sending an officer to your location to talk to you more. This may happen if, for example, you're reporting damage to your property. If an officer is dispatched, the dispatcher will give you a time frame of when to expect them. [3] X Research source The officer will confirm the information in your telephone report and ask questions to get any additional information they may need to further investigate the incident. You may not get a written copy of the report immediately. The officer typically will give you a receipt with the number assigned to your report so you can get a full copy later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Check if your police station allows telephone reports.",
      "content": "Check if your police station allows telephone reports. Many police stations do not allow telephone reports due to possible security issues. Since filing a false report is a crime, they need to have the filer sign a document and verify that they are who they say they are. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Request a copy of the report.",
      "content": "Request a copy of the report. If an officer isn't dispatched to your location to talk to you, ask the dispatcher for a report number. Find out when the full written report will be available and how you can get a copy for your records. [5] X Research source In some cases, the police department may mail a copy of the report to you. Otherwise, you may need to make a trip to the precinct to pick up the report."
    },
    {
      "title": "Locate the nearest police department.",
      "content": "Locate the nearest police department. The police department nearest you or the place where the incident occurred will likely have jurisdiction over the case. To identify the correct police department, search online or call 311 (information) if that service is available in your area. City or metropolitan police departments typically have jurisdiction within the city limits, while the county sheriff's department will have jurisdiction over incidents that take place in the county or outside the city limits. There may be dual jurisdiction in some areas, such as if you live in a metro area where city and county governments have been consolidated. In that case, just find the precinct office closest to you. If you're in the wrong place, they'll tell you where to go."

      "title": "Gather information about the incident you want to report.",
      "content": "Gather information about the incident you want to report. When you file a police report in person, you'll typically need information or evidence related to the incident itself. This information can include things like the names of other people involved, photo or video evidence, and the date and time the incident occurred. [6] X Research source If you took photos or videos on your phone, take your phone with you to the police station. The police typically won't have to take your phone from you and will download your photos or videos to their computer system. In cases of property loss or damage, gather any financial statements, insurance claims, or other documents to take with you."

      "title": "Bring your ID to confirm your identity.",
      "content": "Bring your ID to confirm your identity. When you file your report, you'll need to provide a name and address to the officer who takes your report. A government-issued photo ID, such as your driver’s license, passport, or state ID, is the easiest way for the police to verify your identity. [7] X Research source If your ID has been lost or stolen, bring whatever documents or information you have that might prove your identity. This includes things like your social security card, a tax form with your social security number, or a bank statement that includes your personal information. Bring a friend or relative along to vouch for you if you don’t have your ID."

      "content": "Visit the police department during regular business hours. Check online or call the police non-emergency line (311) to find out when the precinct office is open. While you typically can file a police report at any time, individual precincts may not be open to the public after business hours. You'll likely have a shorter wait time if you go earlier in the morning, as opposed to in the afternoon. If you have been the victim of a crime, such as a break-in or assault, you have the option to call the police and have them come out to you. They’ll likely take your statement as well as collect evidence at the scene. Call the station before you go down there to see if they would rather come to you."

When an officer comes to take your report, give them all of the information you know about the incident. Include as many specific details as possible and stick to the facts. If you have any documents or other information, let the officer know. They may want to take your originals or make copies. The officer may ask you more specific questions to get more information about the incident. If you don't know something or don't remember, say so. Avoid making assumptions or engaging in speculation."

If the written report isn't ready, they'll give you the report number and let you know when you can pick it up. [8] X Research source Keep your report number in a safe place. Depending on the type of incident you report, you may need to provide this number to others. For example, if you filed a report for property damage, you may need to provide the police report number to your insurance company when you file a claim."
