      "title": "Measure your tea on a scale if you’re using loose leaves.",
      "content": "Measure your tea on a scale if you’re using loose leaves. If you have tea bags, you can skip this step. As a good rule of thumb, use 6 g (0.21 oz) of tea leaves per 1 c (240 ml) of water. If you like stronger tea, use more tea leaves. [1] X Research source If you are using teabags and want a stronger cup of tea, use 2 tea bags instead of 1. If you are using loose leaf tea, you can pack the leaves into empty tea bags or tea filters to prevent you from having to strain the tea."

      "title": "Fill a pot or kettle with cold water.",
      "content": "Fill a pot or kettle with cold water. Always use fresh, cold water when preparing tea. Do not use warm water from your tap or water that has been previously heated and left to cool. [2] X Research source Hot water from the tap contains minerals from your pipes which could alter the flavor of the tea. Use a pot or kettle made of glass or stainless steel so that there aren’t any impurities left in your tea."

    {
      "title": "Bring the water to a boil then let it cool for 1-2 minutes.",
      "content": "Bring the water to a boil then let it cool for 1-2 minutes. Set the pot or kettle on the stovetop and set it to high. Keep the kettle or pot on the stovetop for 4-10 minutes or until it begins to boil. Then, turn off the heat and let the boiling water sit for 1-2 minutes so that it cools down slightly below the boiling point. [3] X Research source Earl Grey is best steeped in water that is 208 °F (98 °C) or slightly below the boiling point. You can use a thermometer to ensure the water is at the exact temperature."

    {
      "title": "Warm the cup or teapot before steeping the tea.",
      "content": "Warm the cup or teapot before steeping the tea. Pour the hot water into whatever container you're going to steep the tea in. Swirl the hot water around before pouring it out. [4] X Research source Warming the pot that you’re steeping the tea in will ensure that the temperature stays consistent during the steeping process, which should produce a better cup of tea."

    {
      "title": "Place the tea in your teapot or cup.",
      "content": "Place the tea in your teapot or cup. If you are using tea bags, remove the teabag from the paper packaging before placing it in your tea container. If you are using loose leaves, you can put them in an empty tea bag or tea filters or you can put the measured leaves into the bottom of your teapot or mug. [5] X Research source If you place loose tea leaves into your steeping container, you'll have to strain the tea before you drink it."

    {
      "title": "Steep the tea for 3-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Steep the tea for 3-5 minutes. Pour the hot water over the tea. As the tea sits in the water, it should start to become brown. Leave the tea in the cup and let the flavor from the tea transfer to the hot water. The longer that you steep your tea, the stronger it will be. [6] X Research source Don’t fill the cup or teapot all the way to the top to prevent it from overflowing."

      "title": "Remove the tea bag or strain the tea if you’re using loose leaves.",
      "content": "Remove the tea bag or strain the tea if you’re using loose leaves. If you are using teabags, discard the tea bag in the garbage. If you are using loose leaves, strain the tea through a sieve. Let the tea slightly cool before you drink it so that you don’t burn the inside of your mouth. Enjoy the tea while it's hot, or let it cool and add ice cubes to it later for iced tea! [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour sugar in your tea to add sweetness. Put anywhere from a 2 g (0.071 oz) to 12 g (0.42 oz) of sugar into the tea and stir the sugar so it dissolves in the tea. This will reduce some of the bitter notes in the Earl Grey and make the tea taste sweeter. [8] X Research source If you want sweeter tea, add more sugar."

      "content": "Squirt lemon into your tea for additional citrus notes. Cut a lemon into quarters and squirt one of the quarters of lemon into your tea. If you want more citrus notes, add more lemon juice to the tea. [9] X Research source Adding lemon and sugar together in Earl Grey tea is a popular preparation."

      "content": "Add milk or cream to the tea for added creaminess. Add a small amount of milk or cream to the tea after it’s had time to steep and stir it. This will add a creamy flavor and will cut through the floral and citrus flavors of the tea. [10] X Research source"
