      "content": "Use a flashlight to tag people in this twist on a classic. Choose a person to be “it” and give them a flashlight. Whoever is “it” closes their eyes while they count to 20, and all the other players quickly find a hiding spot. Once the person who’s “it” finishes counting, they look for and tag the other players by shining their flashlight at them. [1] X Research source Whenever someone is found, they have to go back to a home base, like a tree, patio, or mailbox. Whoever gets found last becomes “it” for the next round."

      "title": "Use noises to find your friends with this fun version of the classic game.",
      "content": "Use noises to find your friends with this fun version of the classic game. Just like normal hide-and-seek, choose one person to be “it” and have everyone else hide. Have the person who’s “it” count to 20 so the other players can find hiding spots. Every 60 seconds, the hidden players have to tap on something or clap so it’s easier for the seeker to find them. Whoever gets found last gets to be “it” for the next round. For a fun variation on the game, give each hidden player a flashlight. Instead of tapping, the players have to turn their flashlight on every 60 seconds to reveal their location. It’s okay to change hiding spots during the round so you’re harder to find."

      "content": "Stay hidden with your friends in this fun hide-and-seek game. Choose 1 player to be the first person to hide. All the other players close their eyes and count to 20 while the person who’s “it” finds a hiding spot. When they’re done counting, all the players split up and look for the person hiding. When you find the person who’s it, squeeze in next to them and hide in the same spot. The last person to find the hiding spot becomes “it” for the next round. [2] X Research source When you’re choosing a hiding place, make sure it’s someplace where all the other players can fit. If you’re playing inside, you might hide in a closet, in a shower, or under a bed. If you’re outside, you could hide behind a large bush, lie in a low spot in the yard, or hide in a garage."

      "content": "Try to get away from a ghost with this fun outdoor game. Choose a player to be a ghost that tries to tag the other players. Set the boundaries for where you’re playing and choose a “home base” where players start the game. The ghost runs and hides while the other players count to 12. When players shout “Midnight!” the round begins. [3] X Research source All the players have to leave home base and look for the ghost. When a player finds the ghost, they yell, “Ghost in the graveyard!” All the players run from the ghost and try to get back to home base so they’re safe. If the ghost tags someone, they become the ghost for the next round."

      "content": "Avoid the light and see how low you can go. Turn off all the lights, and have one of your friends hold a flashlight at about waist height to start. Take turns trying to go underneath the beam of light without it touching you (you aren’t allowed to crawl on the ground!). Once everyone makes it under the light, move the flashlight a little bit lower and try going underneath it again. [4] X Research source If the light touches you or if you fall down while trying to limbo under it, then you’re out for the rest of the round. Play your favorite music while you’re doing the limbo, but be careful not to wake anyone up!"

Choose a person to be a “guard” with a flashlight and the rest of the players become “statues.” Have all the statues strike a pose and hold the position. Then, the guard walks around with their flashlight while the statues try sneaking around. When the guard points their flashlight at someone, they have to stay still. If the statue moves or laughs, they’re out for the round. [5] X Research source Whoever is the last statue to get caught gets to be the guard for the next round. For a more challenging variation, have the statues try to sneak up and touch the guard without getting caught moving. If the statues tag the guard, they win the game!"

Choose a person to be the “traffic controller” and give them a red light. Have them stand at the other end of the play area to mark the finish line. When the controller says “green light,” the other players can move toward the finish line. When the controller holds up their red light, everyone has to freeze in place. If anyone is moving during the red light, they have to go back to the starting line. Whoever makes it across the finish line first wins the game! [6] X Research source If you don’t have a red light, tape some red cellophane over a flashlight instead. Otherwise, just shout “green light” or “red light.”"

All the other players try to sneak up on Grandma and take the prize. Whoever is Grandma can turn around at any moment—if they catch someone moving, that person has to go back to the starting line! [7] X Research source Give the Grandma player a flashlight to shine at the players. If you’re caught moving in the light, then you have to go back to the start. Whoever gets the prize and gets back to the starting line without getting caught wins and becomes Grandma for the next round."

Keep track of how many you knock down throughout the game, and whoever knocks down the most wins!

[9] X Research source If a player gets tagged, they go to “jail” on the side of the field. If a member of their team is able to tag them, they’re free from jail and get to re-enter the game."
