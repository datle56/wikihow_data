      "content": "Remain calm. If you become angry or defensive yourself, you will likely exacerbate the tantrum that the other person is having. If you can keep yourself calm and rational, it's likely that you will be able to diffuse the temper of the other person.

      "title": "Realize that you can't control someone else.",
      "content": "Realize that you can't control someone else. One of the most difficult parts of dealing with the emotions of another person—particularly someone who is a close friend or family member—is accepting that you cannot change the thoughts or actions of another person. You can offer help and support, but you cannot actually control another person."

    {
      "title": "Ask what is upsetting the person.",
      "content": "Ask what is upsetting the person. Adults who are prone to temper tantrums are unlikely to be effective communicators. You may have to ask the person what is causing them to be so upset. [2] X Research source Be calm and give him time to fully explain himself. Remember to be patient and persistent. You could say, “I know you said that there is nothing wrong, but I can tell by the way you're acting that you are really upset. Please talk to me about why you are upset so that I can help you if I am able to. If you aren't ready to talk about it now, please remember that I am here when you are ready.”"

    {
      "title": "Validate the person's emotions",
      "content": "Validate the person's emotions . It is important to express to the person having the tantrum that it is okay for them to feel the emotions that they are feeling. [3] X Research source Even if you do not agree with the way they are expressing their feelings (in a tantrum), you can tell them that what they are feeling is okay. Accepting feelings (such as anger) as a normal part of life can often help people deal with the emotions in a healthier way. [4] X Expert Source Christy Irvine, PhD Licensed Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 9 April 2021. For example, you might say, “It seems to me that you are feeling angry or hurt because of the situation. It's perfectly normal to feel that way; can we talk about how you feel and how we can make you feel better?”"
    },
    {
      "title": "Apologize for any wrongdoing on your part.",
      "content": "Apologize for any wrongdoing on your part. If you were a part of the reason that the other person is upset, apologize to them for what you did. [5] X Research source If you do not feel that you did something wrong per se, you can still apologize for making them feel the way that they feel. For example, if you did something “wrong,” you might say, “I am very sorry that I accidentally downloaded a virus that destroyed your computer. I can understand why that would make you upset, and I will do whatever I can to help repair or replace the computer.” For example, if you did not do anything “wrong” but still upset someone, you could say, “I am sorry that I upset you by picking out the paint color for the living room myself. I did not know that it was so important to you. I will try to be more considerate of your feelings in the future.”"

    {
      "title": "Use the words “we” and “us.”",
      "content": "Use the words “we” and “us.” Using the words “I” and “you” can create a divide between you and the other person, although some people may prefer \"I\" and \"you\" as they don't like being treated as an extension of another person. [6] X Research source This divide may cause the tantrum-throwing party to become defensive or angrier. However, using “we” or “us” implies that you are a team and might reduce some of the other person's angry feelings. For example, the following may cause someone to become more defensive: “You should not be so upset about your computer crashing. My computer crashed and I didn't get upset at all; I just went and got a new one. You should do the same thing.” A better example of “team” communication would be, “What can we do together to solve this problem? Can we take it to a repair shop, or is it time for us to invest in a newer, better computer? We can get through this together and make the best of the situation.”"

      "title": "Maintain a neutral or positive tone.",
      "content": "Maintain a neutral or positive tone. It is important to avoid sounding condescending or frustrated while speaking with someone who is having a temper tantrum. If they think that you are talking down to them, they may become angrier or stop listening to you. It is also important to avoid sounding sarcastic. Keeping your voice at a consistent volume and tone will help you sound more neutral."

    {
      "title": "Stick to the facts when possible.",
      "content": "Stick to the facts when possible. Abandon emotionally charged language or anything that might be interpreted as an accusation and stick to the facts of the events that upset the person. Emphasizing the facts may not cause the temper tantrum to subside, but it is less likely to make the situation any worse. For example, saying, “I'm sorry that the computer crashed, but you click on links of cat videos, too. You can hardly say that it was entirely my fault,” may cause the person to become angrier. Instead, the following factual statements may be less inflammatory: “I clicked on the link and the computer crashed. We cannot change those facts. Now we have to decide what to do about the situation. We could either try to have a company repair the computer or we could purchase a new computer.”"

      "title": "Encourage rational thinking.",
      "content": "Encourage rational thinking. It might be difficult to convince someone who is having a temper tantrum to use rational thought, but if you can get their rational, thinking mind to overcome their emotional response, they'll likely snap out of the tantrum. This is an approach for which you need to be particularly careful about not sounding condescending or invalidating. This may not work for everyone, but helping someone understand that being angry will not help solve the problem might kick start their reasoning mind. You might say, “I understand that you are angry right now, and you have a right to be. Let's talk through some possible solutions together and figure out how to make this better.” Make sure that you are validate their feelings , to avoid coming off as condescending or uncaring. You can acknowledge their feelings and encourage problem-solving."

      "content": "Give the person space and time. Someone who is really in a fit of rage may not be willing to have a reasonable conversation with you. Sometimes, the best option is to give the person some space until he calms down and is capable of sustaining a conversation with you.

This can be difficult if it is someone you live with, but you can go outside, run an errand or two, or go to do a chore or activity in another room."

You can either be direct and say, “You're upset. Let's go for a walk and talk about what's bothering you,” or indirect, saying, “I need to go down the street to get something. Do you want to join me for some fresh air for a few minutes?”"

      "content": "Encourage deep breaths or meditation. A good way to deal with anger or other overwhelming emotions is to sit quietly and focus on taking very deep breaths. [9] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Combining the deep breathing with some meditation exercises, such as visualizing a happy place or picturing negative emotions exiting the body, can make the breathing even more effective. [10] X Research source If the person is willing, you can guide them through a meditation exercise. Instruct them to do the following (you can do it too!): [11] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Sit comfortably with both feet on the floor and your hands resting comfortably in your lap. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath in, allowing your belly to expand with the fullness of your breath. Picture a white light entering every corner of your mind and body as you breathe in. Breathe out slowly and deliberately, allowing yourself to fully exhale. As you exhale, picture negativity leaving your body as dark, muddy colors, leaving only the light behind. Repeat for 10-20 breaths or until the person feels relaxed and comfortable."

      "content": "Suggest a solution to the problem. If the person who is having a temper tantrum is too overcome with emotions to think rationally or is unwilling to brainstorm a reasonable solution with you, try suggesting a few solutions to the problem. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Your cooler head is likely to prevail, and you might get through to them. Don't be surprised if the person initially rejects your solutions. They may need some time to calm down and process what you suggested. They could very well return to you later and say that they took one of your suggestions to solve the problem."

If you are really at a loss as to how to handle or help the person having a temper tantrum, you could try asking them what you can do to help. They may tell you that they just need some time, or a hug, or a walk outside. People who are prone to anger problems may be aware of what helps them cool down when they are angry."

[13] X Research source If you were having a conversation that caused the person to go into a temper tantrum, you should probably drop the topic for now if it is not completely time-sensitive. Give the person time to get over their initial anger and return to it later once they seem calm and rational."
