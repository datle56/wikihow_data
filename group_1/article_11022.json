[3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you get undiluted tea tree oil, dilute to a 50% concentration. Use a carrier oil like jojoba or olive. Then mix 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of carrier oil with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of the tree oil for a 50% mixture. [4] X Research source Weaker concentrations of tea tree oil, as low as 10%, might help reduce the rash, but generally won’t kill all of the fungus.

      "content": "Wash your feet with soap and water twice a day. It’s very important to wash your feet so the fungus doesn’t spread. Wash in between your toes, or anywhere else that the rash is, with soap and water. Then rinse all of the soap off. Repeat this twice per day until the rash clears.

      "content": "Dry your feet whenever they’re wet. Fungus grows in warm, wet environments like sweaty feet. Whenever your feet get wet or sweaty, use a towel and dry them off.

      "content": "Change your socks and shoes daily. The athlete’s foot fungus could live in your socks and shoes, so don’t wear the same ones every day. Change your socks twice a day, especially after your feet get sweaty. Also try not to wear the same pair of shoes more than 1 day in a row. This gives them time to dry out before you wear them again. [12] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try leaving your shoes near a window or somewhere else they’ll dry out better. You could also sprinkle talcum or antifungal powder into your shoes to dry them out and kill any leftover fungus."

      "content": "Stay away from public pools and showers until the rash clears. These are some of the most common places that athlete’s foot spreads.
