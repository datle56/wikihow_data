Much like hydrogen peroxide, baby oil or mineral oil can help soften stubborn earwax, making it easier to remove. Use a medicine dropper to put 2 to 3 drops of oil in your ear, then hold your ear facing up for 2-3 minutes so the oil has a chance to soak in. When you’re done, tilt your head to the side to let the oil and wax run out. [6] X Research source You might also use glycerin if you have it on hand and want to use a natural oil.

Cotton swabs can be used on the outer ear to remove superficial earwax, but otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat doctors) advise against digging into the ear canal with a cotton swab. Cotton swabs can also push wax deeper into your ear, potentially causing blockages, damage, or irritation.
