      "title": "Battle Pokémon types that are weak against Shelgon.",
      "content": "Battle Pokémon types that are weak against Shelgon. As a dragon type, Shelgon is very effective against similar dragon-type Pokémon, dealing twice the normal damage as it would on other Pokémon. Pure dragon types like Dratini, Dragonair, and Druddigon, especially the ones with lower levels, are good prey for Shelgon."

      "title": "Avoid Pokémon types that Shelgon would take severe damage from.",
      "content": "Avoid Pokémon types that Shelgon would take severe damage from. Fairy- and ice-type Pokémon are the ones you should avoid fighting. These types, like Granbull and Clefairy (fairy starting at Gen 6) or Abomasnow (ice), will inflict severe to twice the normal damage to Shelgon. Dragon types are also vulnerable to fellow dragon types, so when facing Pokémon like Axew or another Shelgon, make sure you use the most effective attack on its Skill list to seriously damage the other dragon type, and quickly win the match."

      "title": "Keep gaining experience points (XP).",
      "content": "Keep gaining experience points (XP). XP are needed to level up, and Shelgon will evolve into Salamence without any special conditions once it reaches level 50. Continue battling Pokémon that Shelgon is strong against to get easy matches and to earn XP quickly. The growth rate for Shelgon is low, so it will take a bit longer than normal to level it up."

    {
      "title": "Use Rare Candies to level up.",
      "content": "Use Rare Candies to level up. Rare Candy is an in-game food item that instantly increases the level of the Pokémon that eats it. Rare Candies can be found anywhere in the game, from side quests to prizes on certain in-game events, like bug catching. This is a great way to level up your Shelgon without having to do any Pokémon battles. The number of Rare Candies in every game version is limited, so you may find it hard to evolve Shelgon using Rare Candies alone."
