      "title": "Discreet packaging conceals a package’s contents and origins.",
      "content": "Discreet packaging conceals a package’s contents and origins. Sometimes, you may buy something online and you don’t want others to know what you bought for whatever reason. Opting for discreet packaging informs the seller to use unbranded shipping containers to avoid revealing what the package contains or the source of shipment. Anyone who simply looks at the package will not be able to tell what it is. [1] X Research source Discreet packaging also uses shipping labels that are not connected to the seller. This way, it’s impossible to tell who sent it, whether that’s a company, store, or individual. Discreet shipping protects customers’ privacy, prevents negative associations between brands and certain products, reduces the risk of theft or damage, and helps customers avoid potential embarrassment due to explicit labeling."

      "title": "Political materials",
      "content": "Political materials Politics can be very divisive and sometimes even feel taboo to talk about. Because of this, political parties often send their support materials in discreet packaging. This helps conceal the customer’s political beliefs, which could prevent them from feeling ostracized, and prevents others from stealing or vandalizing the package due to conflicting beliefs.

      "content": "Surprise gifts If you’re buying a gift for someone you live with, it can be difficult to hide it from them. Many customers opt for discreet packaging when they’re buying a surprise for someone and don’t want the other person to find out about it before the big reveal."

      "title": "Discreet packaging is usually plain and generic.",
      "content": "Discreet packaging is usually plain and generic. Discreet shipping is meant to be vague and not draw attention to itself. Therefore, you won’t find bright colors or fancy graphics on the box or mailer. Here are some common elements featured in discreet packaging: [6] X Research source Plain white or brown cardboard mailers or unmarked postal boxes Generic packing tape Shipping labels with no identifiable company names, logos, or other brand marketing No logos or slogans on the box itself Note that because the mail carrier needs to know where to deliver the package, the customer’s name and address will be listed."

      "content": "Look for a discreet packaging option at checkout. In most cases, brands and e-commerce sellers will communicate any discreet packaging options at checkout.

      "title": "Contact the seller to see if discreet packaging is an option.",
      "content": "Contact the seller to see if discreet packaging is an option. If you don’t see an option for discreet packaging at checkout, it may be worth contacting the seller to see what kind of packaging they offer. Their packaging may already be pretty discreet, and there’s a chance they will work with you to find a packaging option that works for your needs if you ask nicely. This option will likely work better for small businesses like Etsy stores rather than chains."

      "title": "Communicate that you offer discreet packaging.",
      "content": "Communicate that you offer discreet packaging. Advertising that you offer discreet packaging shows potential customers that you understand their needs and want them to feel comfortable buying from you. Mention that you offer discreet packaging in product descriptions, by adding a tag on the item’s page, or at checkout. It also helps if you have a page on your site that explains how your brand defines discreet packaging and what customers can expect. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Keep the packaging simple, but don’t try too hard.",
      "content": "Keep the packaging simple, but don’t try too hard. Sometimes, trying too hard to be discreet can make a package stand out even more. Eliminate all identifying information, like branding materials and shipping labels that state your brand’s name and address. Rather than leaving the package completely blank, try including a simple, non-identifying feature, like a thank you sticker or packing tape that says “fragile” to help the package blend in more. [9] X Research source Use a standard-size box, if possible, to disguise small shipments. Standard-size boxes can make small items seem bigger, therefore making it difficult for others to guess what’s inside."

      "content": "Put your branding on the inside of the package for a unique unboxing experience. With the rise of social media influencers who often promote products and brands, marketing is extremely important for ecommerce sellers. Packaging often plays a large role in marketing, especially with how popular unboxing videos have become. Give your customers a fun unboxing experience by including your branding inside the package. This can include things like custom tissue paper, confetti, stickers, and a personalized thank-you note. [10] X Research source If you typically ship your products in colorful or patterned boxes, consider putting the box together inside out so the plain brown or white is on the outside and the patterned side is on the inside. This will be a nice, colorful surprise for your customer when they open the box."

While you can still use unbranded packaging materials for international shipments, the entire shipping process won’t be as discreet as domestic shipments.

[13] X Research source Be aware that FedEx and UPS cannot ship to PO boxes. USPS offers free USPS-branded packaging materials, so it’s often easy to ship discreetly through them.

If you don’t want someone else signing for your package, try to be home when the package gets delivered or have it rerouted to a drop-off site, if available. Some sellers also allow customers to sign for their packages electronically on their website, then attach the signature to the order so the courier knows the package has already been signed for.
