Use a utility knife to cut the board into pieces that measure 18 inches (46 cm) wide by 24 inches (61 cm) tall. [10] X Research source Trim the top corners in a curve to make a tombstone shape with a rounded top. If you can’t find a 2” (5 cm)-thick board, glue 2 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick boards together. Look for extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam boards, which are easier to cut. They’re usually pink, green, or blue. Be careful when using the utility knife. The blade is very sharp."

      "content": "Prime the foam tombstone and then paint it light gray. Use a foam paintbrush to cover the entire surface of your tombstone with primer to help the paint stick to it. Once the primer dries, use a fresh foam paintbrush to paint the tombstone with the lighter gray paint. Try Drylock water proofer as a primer to give your tombstone a gritty, stone-like texture. Exterior paint with a flat finish works best for making faux tombstones."

      "content": "Draw on the name, epitaph, and other decorations with black paint. Use a small paintbrush or black paint marker to add the name and funny saying. Draw cracks, making your lines thicker closer to the edge, and then gradually narrowing as they move toward the center of the tombstone. Make it more realistic by writing the wording in marker and then carving it out with your utility knife. Then, paint the inside of the letters black. For an extra touch, use a sponge to dab on mossy green paint to age the stone."
