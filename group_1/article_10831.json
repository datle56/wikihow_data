You'll need the following blocks: Cobblestones (to make the base of the pyramid) Lava Red Stone Torches (Optional) Sticky Pistons (Optional) Fireworks (Optional)"

      "content": "Build a pyramid with the rock blocks. Start by setting up a basic pyramid, which is much easier to build. To do it, build a large square or circle. On top of this square, put another outline of blocks, moved in one space to the center. Keep making these squares, each one block shorter on each side, until you only have one block on top. The inside should be hollow."

      "content": "Add ridges, features, and mountain like valleys into the side. Once you have your pyramid, add and subtract blocks to sculpt your volcano into the correct shape. Beginner builders can also stick to the pyramid shape as well. Remove the top of the volcano. Build a platform 3-4 layers underneath the top of the volcano. Make sure there are no holes in it -- this holds your lava."

      "content": "Use TNT and gravel for an explosion. In your crater, place a layer of obsidian down for the platform, as it won't explode. Then place an ignition block (redstone switch) down in the corner and fill the platform with a layer of TNT. Top the rest off with 4-5 layers of gravel, then pour lava into the last 1-2 layers, right up to the rim of the volcano. Ignite and enjoy!"
