      "content": "Raise your toes off the ground slightly. Keep your heel firmly on the ground. If it’s easier for you to reach your toes in this position sitting down, sit on the ground or in a chair. Otherwise, bend over and reach your toes with the front of your foot raised off the ground. [1] X Research source With your heel on the ground, your toes will only be 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) above the floor."

      "title": "Place your pointer finger on the first toe.",
      "content": "Place your pointer finger on the first toe. It’s best to start with a small toe because sometimes the big toe can’t be cracked this way. Use whichever hand you feel most comfortable using. [2] X Research source While most people use their pointer finger, using a different finger is okay too."

      "title": "Press down on your toe's joint until you hear a crack.",
      "content": "Press down on your toe's joint until you hear a crack. It’s important not to press so hard that you’re hurting your foot. Apply a soft pressure until you feel or hear the crack, stopping if the pressing becomes painful. [3] X Research source If you begin pressing on your toe and it hurts, stop applying pressure."

    {
      "title": "Repeat this process with the other toes.",
      "content": "Repeat this process with the other toes. Continue applying slight pressure to each toe with your pointer finger. Keep your foot slightly raised off the ground to make it easier to crack each toe. [4] X Research source Pinky toes are very difficult to crack, so if it’s not working, just move on to another toe. Some people’s big toes can crack this way, while others can’t, so feel free to give it a try!"

      "title": "Pull your toes straight out to crack them as an alternative method.",
      "content": "Pull your toes straight out to crack them as an alternative method. Pull each toe straight out away from your body, using a strong, quick motion. If you feel or hear the crack, move to the next toe. [5] X Research source If you're having trouble doing this on your own, ask a friend or family member to help you. If pulling your toe outwards causes pain, stop pulling on it to avoid an injury."

      "title": "Crack your big toe by curling and flexing it.",
      "content": "Crack your big toe by curling and flexing it. Your big toe is the easiest to crack⁠—simply bend the toe in towards your foot, and then flex it back out reaching towards the opposite direction. You may need to do this several times to hear or feel the crack. [6] X Research source Curling and flexing your big toe quickly might make it crack easier."

    {
      "title": "Place your toes on top of your other foot to crack them more gently.",
      "content": "Place your toes on top of your other foot to crack them more gently. From a standing position, curl your toes inwards and press them against your other foot, which should be flat on the ground. Press down using your curled toes, forcing them gently into your other foot so that they crack. [7] X Research source This will crack your big toe the easiest, as this is the toe that will have the most impact with your other foot. Cross the foot whose toes you're cracking in front of the standing foot, as if you were in a flamingo pose. Avoid using too much force when trying to crack your toes this way."

      "title": "Roll your curled toes along the ground to crack them quickly.",
      "content": "Roll your curled toes along the ground to crack them quickly. Curl the toes on one foot inwards while you’re standing up. Place your toes on the ground so that only the upper bent portion is touching the floor. Roll your foot from one toe to the next, rocking left to right, applying pressure so that each one cracks. [8] X Research source Rolling your curled toes against a carpet or rug will make it more comfortable. If rolling your toes along the floor causes any pain, uncurl your toes and stop."

      "title": "Curl your toes in and press them into the ground to ensure a crack.",
      "content": "Curl your toes in and press them into the ground to ensure a crack. Curl your toes in toward your feet and place your toes on the ground as if you were about to stand on your tiptoes. Bring your foot up and back down onto the ground with a bit of force, softly kicking the floor with your bent toes. Be careful not to push down too forcefully. [9] X Research source Avoid putting all of your weight onto your toes or you may injure yourself. It’s best to do this with padding underneath your feet, such as a carpet."
