      "content": "Add a lightweight or sheer top to keep cool as you cover up. These tops are great options to have—not only can they keep you cool while allowing you to cover your arms, they can also help protect your skin from excessive sun exposure. [1] X Expert Source Veronica Tharmalingam Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. Search for a top that is mostly see-through and that complements the color of your dress. An off-white, black, or blue sheer top can look like a casual addition to your outfit without drawing much attention to itself. These tops come in 3/4-length sleeves or long sleeves. The 3/4 sleeve will probably help you feel a tad cooler than a full-length sleeve would. You can even wear sheer tights underneath.

      "content": "Choose a coverup with billowy sleeves to let air flow through. When shopping for that perfect item to cover your arms without making yourself overheat, keep in mind that wider sleeves made of a thin material will be more breathable than something with tight, heavy arms would be. For a sleeveless dress, a top that is open in the front will look most natural and will still allow you to show off the style of your dress underneath. A nice thing about most coverups is that you can generally pull them down to expose your shoulders while still keeping the majority of your arms covered."

      "title": "Pick a batwing sleeve for a loose, flowing option that will keep you cool.",
      "content": "Pick a batwing sleeve for a loose, flowing option that will keep you cool. These tops have deep armholes and “sleeves” that don’t actually cling to your arms, which makes them much more conducive to warm-weather months. Look for a top that is a similar length to the waistline of your dress. This will allow your waist to have some definition and won’t make your outfit look too bulky. These sleeves generally come to just below your elbow or to your wrist. Pick whichever option will allow you to feel the most comfortable."

      "content": "Drape a kimono overtop of your dress for a stylish, lightweight coverup. This is a simple style that takes just a moment to put together. If your dress is more subtle, pick a kimono that has a beautiful floral pattern. If your dress is patterned or brightly-colored, add a more neutrally-shaded kimono to complement it without visually overwhelming. Most kimonos are made of silk or satin. The modern kimono is what you most often see people wearing nowadays—it’s a lighter piece that doesn’t have to be secured around your waist and it generally falls at mid-thigh instead of reaching to the ground."

      "content": "Wear sheer or lace sleeves when you need to attend a fancy event. There are a lot of “body styles” available to choose from if you simply want to add a lightweight set of sleeves to your dress. These sleeves are put on first before you slip on your dress. You can find ones with high or low necklines, depending on the style of your dress; plus, you can find ones that have either 3/4- or full-length sleeves. [3] X Research source These look especially nice with fancier dresses, like what you might wear to a nice dinner or a wedding. They cover your arms without making you feel especially warm."

[4] X Expert Source Veronica Tharmalingam Professional Stylist Expert Interview. 6 April 2021. Let it hang down in the back a little bit so that it isn’t bunched up too much. If you get warm, let the shawl drop down off your shoulders to expose them while still keeping your arms covered. [5] X Research source You can put one side of the shawl over one shoulder and leave the other side down in the front.

      "content": "Pop on a jacket or blazer to transition your dress to the cooler months. A jean jacket would look great with a more casual dress, whereas a more fitted blazer could help you continue wearing sleeveless dresses to more formal or professional occasions. Try on the jackets you already have with your dresses to see if there are any good matches before heading to the store. [7] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020. You may be surprised at what looks nice together! If the weather is in the between time where it’s warm during the day but cool at night, you could roll up the sleeves of your jacket to cool off a little more during the warmer moments."

      "title": "Add a cape or capelet for an effortless addition of warmth.",
      "content": "Add a cape or capelet for an effortless addition of warmth. Capes are generally pretty loose garments made of thicker materials, like wool, fur, or velvet. This might not be the best option if you’ll need your arms for something like eating, but it’s a great outer layer to wear when you’re on-the-go in chillier weather. If you are going to be out and about, don’t forget to update the rest of your outfit for the weather, too. For example, adding a pair of tights or leggings, close-toed shoes, or even a pair of gloves could add some extra warmth to your ensemble."

      "content": "Wear a cardigan to show off the style of your dress underneath. This is a nice way to bring your dress into the cooler months without sacrificing on warmth. Wear a longer cardigan with a dress that comes to your knees or right below to create a nice layering visual. Wear a shorter cardigan with a floor-length dress to keep from looking frumpy. Depending on the kind of cardigan you choose, you could button it up partway or leave it open for a more casual look."

      "title": "Layer a long-sleeved top underneath your dress for extra warmth.",
      "content": "Layer a long-sleeved top underneath your dress for extra warmth. Pick a top that complements the neckline of the dress. For example, a turtleneck would look better with a dress that already has a high neck, whereas a scoop-neck shirt would look better with something a little lower cut. Try to pick a top that isn’t too baggy; otherwise, your dress might not lay properly on top of it. [8] X Research source There are some great long-sleeved tops that button between your legs to keep it in place throughout the day. If that’s something you’re concerned about or that annoys you, look for these options online or at local boutiques."

Let it hang over your shoulders and drape down your arms to keep them warm. Look for a style and color that complements the dress you’re wearing. [9] X Research source For example, a neutral-colored shawl would look nice with a dress that has a pattern. A patterned shawl could add a nice splash of color and style to an otherwise neutrally-toned dress."

      "title": "Choose a shrug for extra warmth that doesn’t add too much bulk.",
      "content": "Choose a shrug for extra warmth that doesn’t add too much bulk. A shrug or a sweater wrap doesn’t hang down, making it a nice choice if you still want to show off the entire body of your sleeveless dress. Pick a shrug that is the same color as your dress to make it less noticeable that it’s a separate piece. [10] X Research source Depending on just how cold it is, you may still want to wear a winter coat overtop of the shrug until you get to your final destination."
