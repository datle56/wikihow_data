If you're not already signed in, enter your username and password in the allocated text fields in the upper right-hand corner of the web page, and then click “Log in.” This method will teach you how to use your browser zoom to make text bigger in Facebook.

Alternatively, you can use Facebook on your iPhone, iPad , or Android . It's easier to enlarge text on Facebook using your phone or tablet."
