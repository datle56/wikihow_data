      "content": "Place 3-4 ice cubes in a rocks glass. Fill a rocks glass with 3-4 large square ice cubes. If you're using smaller ice cubes, fill the glass halfway with ice. [1] X Research source Ice will keep the Amarula chilled for a more refreshing tasting drink."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fill the glass halfway with Amarula.",
      "content": "Fill the glass halfway with Amarula. Pour the Amarula over the ice cubes. You don't have to fill the glass to the top with the liquor."
    },
    {
      "title": "Sip on the drink.",
      "content": "Sip on the drink. Drink the Amarula slowly to taste all the creamy and citrusy notes in the liquor. When you run out of Amarula, you can refill the glass. As the ice cubes melt, the Amarula will become less thick."

      "title": "Pour coffee into a large mug.",
      "content": "Pour coffee into a large mug. Brew a fresh cup of coffee using a drip machine, French press, or another method. Then, pour 200–250 ml (6.8–8.5 fl oz) of coffee into a mug, filling it three-quarters of the way. This will leave enough room for the rest of the ingredients. [2] X Research source You can also buy freshly brewed hot or iced coffee from a coffee shop. If you want to have an iced Amarula with coffee, let the coffee cool down before adding 3-4 ice cubes to the drink. If you are using a smaller mug, use less coffee."

    {
      "title": "Add 1-2 shots of Amarula Cream Liqueur into the coffee and stir it.",
      "content": "Add 1-2 shots of Amarula Cream Liqueur into the coffee and stir it. Carefully pour the Amarula Cream into a shot glass or jigger. Then, pour the shot into your coffee mug. Mix the drink with a spoon to incorporate both liquids. [3] X Research source If you want a stronger taste of Amarula in your drink, add 2 shots. If you want a more balanced coffee drink, only add 1. Adding too much Amarula to the coffee could overpower the taste of the drink."

    {
      "title": "Spray whipped cream on top of the drink.",
      "content": "Spray whipped cream on top of the drink. Press the button on the top of the whipped cream can to spray the whipped cream on top of the coffee. The whipped cream compliments the creaminess in the Amarula and will add sweetness. [4] X Research source Add as much or as little whipped cream as you want. Fat-free whipped cream won't taste as rich as traditional whipped cream."

      "title": "Sprinkle brown sugar and a few marshmallows on the whipped cream.",
      "content": "Sprinkle brown sugar and a few marshmallows on the whipped cream. Add 2 g (0.071 oz) of brown sugar and 4-8 marshmallows on top of the drink to add sweetness to the beverage. The sweet notes of the sugar balance out the bitterness of the coffee and the creaminess of the Amarula. [5] X Research source If you don't like overly sweet coffee drinks, leave out the marshmallows."

      "content": "Finish the drink with hot chocolate powder and serve it. The chocolate powder adds richness to the drink. Wait for the beverage to cool off before you drink it so that you don't burn your tongue if the coffee is still hot. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Place 2.5 oz (71 g) of crushed ice of crushed ice into a cocktail shaker. Get pre-purchased crushed ice or crush ice yourself by grinding up ice cubes in a blender. As the ice melts, it will cut through the creaminess of the drink which makes it taste better. [7] X Research source If you don't have a cocktail shaker, place the cubes in a tall glass instead."

      "title": "Pour 1 shot of Amarula and 1 shot of coconut water into the shaker.",
      "content": "Pour 1 shot of Amarula and 1 shot of coconut water into the shaker. Carefully measure out the Amarula and coconut water in a shot glass or jigger so that you use the proper amounts. If you'd rather have a citrus cocktail, replace the coconut water with a shot of Triple Sec instead. You can also replace the coconut water with a shot of gin if you'd rather make a martini. If you want an even stronger cocktail, put 2 shots of Amarula in the drink."

    {
      "title": "Shake the drink to incorporate all the ingredients.",
      "content": "Shake the drink to incorporate all the ingredients. Vigorously shake the shaker to mix everything together and partially melt some of the crushed ice. This infuses the Amarula with the crushed ice. [8] X Research source If you don't have a cocktail shaker, place the top of another glass into the glass with the Amarula so that it forms a seal. Then, hold both glasses together and shake the beverage to mix it."

Keep in mind that the ice cream and Amarula are already sweet, so adding more sugar will cause it to become even sweeter. Enjoy the drink while it's still cold."
