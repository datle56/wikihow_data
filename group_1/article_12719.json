Read Factor a Number for more instructions. For example, if you want to know many divisors, or factors, the number 24 has, write 24 {\\displaystyle 24} at the top of the page."

Draw a split branch coming down from the original number, and write the two factors below it. [2] X Research source For example, 12 and 2 are factors of 24, so draw a split branch coming down from 24 {\\displaystyle 24} , and write the numbers 12 {\\displaystyle 12} and 2 {\\displaystyle 2} below it."

      "title": "Look for prime factors.",
      "content": "Look for prime factors. A prime factor is a number that is only evenly divisible by 1 and itself. [3] X Research source For example, 7 is a prime number, because the only numbers that evenly divide into 7 are 1 and 7. Circle any prime factors so that you can keep track of them. For example, 2 is a prime number, so you would circle the 2 {\\displaystyle 2} on your factor tree."

      "content": "Continue to factor non-prime numbers. Keep drawing branches down from the non-prime factors until all of your factors are prime. Circle the prime numbers to keep track of them. [4] X Research source For example, 12 can be factored into 6 {\\displaystyle 6} and 2 {\\displaystyle 2} . Since 2 {\\displaystyle 2} is a prime number, you would circle it. Next, 6 {\\displaystyle 6} can be factored into 3 {\\displaystyle 3} and 2 {\\displaystyle 2} . Since 3 {\\displaystyle 3} and 2 {\\displaystyle 2} are prime numbers, you would circle them."

      "title": "Write an exponential expression for each prime factor.",
      "content": "Write an exponential expression for each prime factor. To do this, look for multiples of each prime factor in your factor tree. The number of times the factor appears equals the exponent of the factor in your exponential expression. [5] X Research source For example, the prime factor 2 {\\displaystyle 2} appears three times in your factor tree, so the exponential expression is 2 3 {\\displaystyle 2^{3}} . The prime factor 3 {\\displaystyle 3} appears 1 time in your factor tree, so the exponential expression is 3 1 {\\displaystyle 3^{1}} ."
