      "title": "Lie flat on the floor with your arms and legs extended.",
      "content": "Lie flat on the floor with your arms and legs extended. Your arms should be lifted so that they’re above your head. Make sure your spine is in a neutral position so your lower back isn't arched or rounded. [1] X Research source If you’ll be exercising on a hard floor, lay down an exercise mat before you begin."

    {
      "title": "Take a deep breath before you begin.",
      "content": "Take a deep breath before you begin. Breathing properly is an important part of exercise. By remembering to inhale as you release and exhale as you contract, you’ll ensure that your muscles are getting plenty of oxygen as you lift weights. This is important to help prevent muscle cramping and hernias. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Exhale and contract your abs, raising both arms and legs.",
      "content": "Exhale and contract your abs, raising both arms and legs. Try to keep your legs straight and bring them up so they’re at about a 35-45 degree angle to the floor. At the same time, bring your arms up and over your head so that they’re parallel to your legs. Your upper body should be raised slightly off the floor. [3] X Research source Bring your head off the floor at the same angle as your torso. Don't tuck your chin into your chest or let your head fall back, as this can cause a neck injury. Use slow, controlled motions so you don't injure your back."

      "title": "Hold yourself in this jack knife position for about 3 seconds.",
      "content": "Hold yourself in this jack knife position for about 3 seconds. By counting to 3 while you hold this pose, your abdominal muscles will get the full benefit of the workout. Static workouts like this can increase your strength and stability."

    {
      "title": "Inhale as you lower your arms and legs slowly to the starting position.",
      "content": "Inhale as you lower your arms and legs slowly to the starting position. Take a deep breath, then slowly return your arms, legs, and torso to the mat. Try to keep your arms and legs as straight as you can as you lower them, although it might be hard to not bend your knees slightly. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Repeat 10-12 reps per set and aim to complete 2-3 sets.",
      "content": "Repeat 10-12 reps per set and aim to complete 2-3 sets. After your first set of 10-12 reps, allow yourself to rest for about 30-45 seconds. This will give your muscles some recovery time, but it won’t be so long that they fully relax. [5] X Research source Try to work up to doing 2-3 sets 4 days a week for at least 6 weeks to get the maximum benefit of this exercise."

    {
      "title": "Start with your torso and legs slightly raised for an extra challenge.",
      "content": "Start with your torso and legs slightly raised for an extra challenge. Start by laying in the basic starting position, then raise your torso and your legs so they’re slightly off of the floor. Perform the jack knife sit up as usual, but try to keep your torso and legs from touching the floor when you release from the position. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Work your obliques with a side jack knife.",
      "content": "Work your obliques with a side jack knife. For a side jack knife, start by lying on your left side. Bend your right arm so that your hand is behind your head and rest your left arm on the floor for support. Contract your obliques, bringing your right shoulder and hip toward each other while you lift your right leg. [7] X Research source Take a deep breath before you begin, then exhale as you lift your leg and arm. Inhale as you return to your starting position."

      "title": "Try a jack knife crunch with an exercise ball.",
      "content": "Try a jack knife crunch with an exercise ball. To do a jack knife on an exercise ball, you’ll start in a push-up position with your hands on the ground, about shoulder-width apart. Your shins should be resting securely on the ball. Roll the ball inwards, bending your knees until your thighs touch your stomach. Roll the ball backwards to return to your starting position. Once you're balanced on the ball, take in a deep breath, then exhale as you roll your knees in towards your chest. Inhale when you extend your legs again."
