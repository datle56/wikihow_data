      "content": "Focus on distant objects or unfocus your eyes. Your pupils will get bigger as your eyes adjust to a further viewing distance. [3] X Research source Another way to approach this is to suddenly unfocus your eyes, blurring your vision as much as you can. If you're doing this correctly, your eyes will feel very relaxed; if you start to see double, you've probably crossed your eyes and need to start over. With these techniques, you won't be able to observe your own eyes, so you'll need to record yourself or have a friend watch."
