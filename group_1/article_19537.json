As soon as you finish vacuuming, empty the contents into a sealed bag. Remove it from the house immediately. [2] X Research source Make sure that you get the corners and ceiling of your closets.

      "content": "Wash walls and shelves. Pour soap or detergent into a bowl or bucket, then fill it with water. Stir the water to mix in the soap. Dip a clean cloth into the soapy water and use it to wipe down the walls and shelves. Continue to dip the rag into the water as you clean the entire closet. [4] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Wash your clothes and other fabric items.",
      "content": "Wash your clothes and other fabric items. Set your washer on the hottest cycle because the larvae can’t withstand the heat. The water should reach about 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) in order to be fully effective. Allow the clothes to cycle for 20 to 30 minutes to ensure that all the moth worms and eggs have been killed. [5] X Research source Dry cleaning will also kill the larvae."
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze items that you can’t wash.",
      "content": "Freeze items that you can’t wash. Larvae can’t survive freezing temperatures, so the freezer makes a great pesticide. Place your items in a protective covering, such as a plastic bag. Put them in the freezer, allowing at least 48 hours for the cold to kill any larvae on the item. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Avoid putting worn clothes into your closet.",
      "content": "Avoid putting worn clothes into your closet. If you plan to wear clothing more than once, find another location to store it until you are ready for your second or third wear. Moths prefer clothes that have sweat or food on them, so they act as a moth magnet. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Store clothing in airtight containers.",
      "content": "Store clothing in airtight containers. Keep the moths from laying new eggs by keeping clothes that you don’t wear frequently in airtight containers. [8] X Research source Easy to use options include sealed storage boxes, vacuum-sealed bags, and plastic storage bags. For added protection, apply packing tape over the seals."

      "content": "Look for the signs of an infestation. Look for tiny worms that look like wiggling rice, along with webbing in either food containers or the pantry. You should also notice cast off skins. Check your corners and in the dark areas of pantries for moth worms and cocoons. [9] X Research source The worms will grow to about ⅔-inch size (1.7 centimeters), and they have a black or brown head."

      "content": "Check foods to see if they’re infested. Kitchen moth worms enter your home inside food. After you bring home an item that contains moth eggs or larvae, the moth worms quickly spread to other foods. Go through your pantry, checking items for signs of infestation. You may notice the moth worms, egg casings, or webbing. [10] X Research source Foods that the meal moths prefer include cereals, flour, grains, birdseed, dried fruit, candy, pet food, dried herbs, nuts, and powdered milk. Even if you don’t see any moth worms or casings, webbing means that the food is infested."

Moth worms cannot penetrate the seal of a plastic bag, so you can prevent them from spreading by putting the infested food in bags. Throw away the items as soon as possible.

      "content": "Wash all items you plan to return to the pantry. The moths like to lay eggs in the crevices of items, so you may still have active eggs on your items. To avoid a reinfestation, wash these items well in warm, soapy water. [13] X Research source Check crevices such as jar lids or flaps on items wrapped in plastic. You can also kill moth eggs and larvae that may be on the food by putting the food in the freezer, microwaving it for 5 minutes, or baking it at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).

You can either make your own or purchase a cleaning product that contains bleach. Afterwards, spray the shelves with plain white vinegar and wipe everything down. [16] X Research source To mix your own bleach solution, add 1 part bleach to 9 parts water. [17] X Research source Don’t forget to scrub down the corners well."

Cedar contains an oil that kills small moth worms, but they don’t have much of an effect on larger worms or adult moths. Hanging a cedar ball in your closet or laying one in your dresser drawer can help, though it won’t solve all of your problems. You can also use cedar hangers. [20] X Research source"

      "content": "Use mothballs. To be effective and safe, your mothballs should only be used when you’re storing your clothes in an airtight container. Place the mothballs in with the clothing, then seal it off. Mothballs do not work immediately, but they contain chemicals whose vapors can build up and kill moths in all stages of their life cycle. [21] X Research source Wear gloves while handling mothballs because they can be toxic. They also have a strong odor that might be an annoyance to some people."
