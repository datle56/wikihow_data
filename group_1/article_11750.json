Does your crush seem to truly care about your friend? Are there any signs that he or she may have been interested in you? It may be difficult to accept that your crush may not have an interest in you romantically, but understand that it doesn’t mean you are any less valuable or attractive as a person. Maybe you two simply aren’t right for each other. If your crush seems like they are interested in you and doesn’t care too deeply about your friend, you may want to consider being honest with each of them about your feelings."

If you have strong feelings you fear you may not be able to push aside, you may want to tell them the truth. [4] X Research source If you don’t know your crush very well, it may not be worth the damage honesty could cause to your friendship.

Infatuation often occurs when you are caught up in the excitement of meeting a person you like, but the feelings often lack longevity."

After considering your feelings, the feelings of your friend and the feelings of your crush, you’ll have to determine what you think the best course of action is. You may feel the right thing to do is to tell them both the truth about your feelings, or you may think it best that you keep them to yourself.

Prepare yourself for things to go poorly if you choose to be honest. While everything may work out, you also run the risk of losing a friend and still not being able to date your crush. Remember to be sensitive to their feelings as well as your own in your decision."

Sometimes when we’re upset we make bad decisions; that’s part of being human, but don’t allow your bad feelings to lead you to make choices you know are harmful or destructive. [8] X Research source Drinking and drugs may seem like they’ll help, but they often just make you feel worse in the long run. They can also lead to addiction and serious health issues. It’s okay to spend some time lying on the couch and stress-eating, but don’t allow yourself to stay there for too long. Eating fattening foods and not getting any exercise can make you feel worse instead of better."

[14] X Research source If you don’t feel ready to be friends with either of them again, that’s okay. Take your time. Remember that friendships are valuable.
