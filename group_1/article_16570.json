      "content": "Find a motion for contempt form. A motion for contempt is a fairly standard document. Most courts have fill-in-the-blank forms you can submit without having to draft a court form by hand. Look on the court's website or pay a visit to the court clerk's office. [2] X Research source Legal aid societies also often have motion forms available for download on their websites, along with instructions. Make sure you're using a form that is approved for use in the court that will hear your motion. Generally, you want to file your motion in the same court that issued the original order. If you live far away from that court and want to file a motion in a court closer to you, talk to a local attorney about that process."

The existence of the order can be proven with a copy of the order itself. If the other person signed the order or appeared in court when the order was issued, that proves they knew about it. Proof they violated the order depends on what the order required. For example, if you're filing for contempt over violation of a child support order, you might use your child support and bank statements."
