Any corrupted data may be deleted, so use it with caution. Rebuild Database: This deletes all your old messages, playlists, custom changes, video playback/resume history, thumbnails, etc. It may take a while! [1] X Research source Restore PS3 System: This is a complete restoration of your system, back to the state it was in when you bought it. You will lose data if you use this. System Update: This allows you to update your PS3 system software, if you have an update file already saved on an external drive (like a USB drive)."
