      "content": "Give yourself a cooling off period. Did you recently move in together? If so, your feelings may not really be a crush—they might just be gratitude or happiness that you’ve found a roommate you can share living space and expenses with, as well as a good friend whom you can confide in. If you give yourself a month or two to just let those feelings be, you may find that they dissipate back to feelings of friendliness. [1] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 5 February 2021. Think about the reasons you want to date your roommate. What is it about them that you find attractive? Do you have the same values and beliefs? If you have legitimate reasons for wanting to date them, that’s one thing. On the other hand, if you just like the thought of having someone who’s always there physically and emotionally, then it’s probably not a good idea. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Fight the urge to confess all. You may have the urge to simply tell them how you feel, and it may come to this eventually. However, at first, you really need to give yourself time to see where your feelings are coming from. If you do end up needing to tell them how you feel, then having taken the time to examine your feelings will mean that you can express yourself rationally and clearly. Reader Poll: We asked 1086 wikiHow readers what they were most nervous about when building a friendship with their special someone, and only 10% of them said letting them know more about me. [Take Poll] However, this might not be the right time to open up."

      "content": "Don’t ignore your roommate. When we have a crush on someone, it can sometimes be difficult to talk to them without feeling like we are giving ourselves away. Try to keep everything as normal as possible. Keep up the same habits as you normally would, too. If you start behaving strangely, your roommate may think something is up, and they may even think that they have done something wrong. Remember that this step is not meant to be a long-term solution. Keeping things as normal as possible will give you time to think about your feelings and time to decide what to do without shaking things up, and forcing you to make rash decisions."

      "content": "Learn to accept your platonic relationship. If, for whatever reason, you feel it is best to simply hide your feelings, then you’ll need to accept that you will only ever be just friends. By doing this, you will be able to maintain your friendship and your living situation. [3] X Research source Be aware, though, that hiding your feelings for a long time may be painful and difficult for you to deal with. At some point, you may need to find another way to deal with your feelings, either by confessing them , or by moving out to get some space. Remember that feelings are fleeting. It may take time, but eventually you will find someone else to be attracted to, or someone might come out and confess their feelings to you. Be patient with yourself. Don’t blame your roommate. This will cause feelings of resentment. It isn’t your roommate's fault that you developed feelings for them, and it isn’t your fault that you developed them. Don’t be too hard on yourself, and don’t be angry at your roommate. Simply try to accept that feelings have developed. If you do develop feelings of resentment that you can’t cope with, then it may be time to consider moving out."

However, don’t try to create so much that it strains your relationship. [4] X Research source For example, if you and your roommate always hang out alone together, try to bring some other people into the mix so that it isn’t so intimate. Try to avoid doing things that feel date-like. Don’t go to the movies, dinner, or concerts alone together. This will only encourage your desire, and cause even more confusion."

Try finding a part-time job that will get you out of the house or spend more time studying in the library. Not only will engaging in activities outside the house be good for you, it will also help you put your feelings in perspective, and may even help you get over those feelings. [5] X Research source You could try online dating to meet other people. Not only will you have something to do outside the apartment, you might meet someone who you like even more than your roommate."

      "content": "Determine whether or not the feelings are mutual. Look for signs that your roommate has feelings for you. If you don’t think the feelings are mutual, you may still end up wanting to tell them how you feel, but without hope that they might reciprocate. Be honest with yourself. When we have feelings for someone, we tend to see what we want to see. If it is unclear to you whether or not your roommate has feelings for you, chances are they don’t. Read your roommate’s body language to get a sense of how they might feel about you. When you talk, do they touch you a lot? For example, do they often laugh and touch your arm? When they talk to you do they give you their full attention, or do they talk to you without looking at you? A person who is interested will make a lot of eye contact, and will want to give you their full attention. [6] X Research source Do they have a partner, or do they have someone that they talk about a lot? If they are already in a relationship, it would be unfair of you to impose on that relationship. If they have a person they are constantly talking about or if they have told you that they are interested in someone else, then it is a pretty good sign that they’re not interested."

      "content": "Confess your feelings. You can do this by sitting them down and telling them straight out, or you can wait for a moment that feels like a way to do it more subtly. [7] X Expert Source Lena Dicken, Psy.D Clinical Psychologist Expert Interview. 5 February 2021. You can do this in person or over the phone, but avoid doing it via text message or email. Sending a text or email will leave you waiting in anguish in response. If they don’t want to deal with it, they may even ignore it completely, leaving you wondering if they received your message at all. When you confess your feelings, include an offer to move out. For example, you could say, “I want you to know how I feel, and I also want you to know that I respect your space. If you don’t feel comfortable living together anymore, I will move out, and I won’t blame you at all.” If you want to tell them outright, tell them that you have something important to say, and that you hope that, regardless of the outcome, you can still be friends. Be prepared for the fact that they may not feel the same. If you’d rather wait for an opening, then wait for a time when your roommate is complaining about dating, and that everyone they meet is awful for one reason or another. Then say something like, “Why not give me a chance? I’d really like to take you out for a date.”"

      "content": "Give them time and space to think. In either scenario, your roommate may say they need some time to think. Give them this time, and while they are mulling it over, try to keep it light and casual when you do see them. This way they can be sure that they can be honest about their feelings. Do your best to stay out of their way. Let your roommate know that you want to respect their need for time to think, and let them know you’ll be spending a few days at so-and-so’s house. If that’s not possible, do your best to stay out of the apartment as much as possible, and when you are at home, try to stay in your room whenever possible."

You can hope that they will give you the response you want, but be prepared for the reality that they might reject you, and may even ask you to move out. Whatever they say, be respectful. If they feel the same, great! Congratulations! However, you now need to talk with your new lover about how you should proceed. Most importantly, whether or not you will remain roommates, or if one of you will move out. At this point, you must also talk about how you can deal with things in the (hopefully unlikely) event that it doesn’t work out. If they don’t feel the same, then be graceful. Don’t yell or cry. Say something like, “That’s too bad, but I understand.” If this happens, you need to figure out whether you can get over your feelings while still living with them, or whether you need to move out. Either way, try to talk about the next steps with your roommate. If you do get rejected, try to remind yourself that at least now you know. You can at least feel the relief of having found out for sure."

If you aren’t able to afford moving out, it is probably best to keep your feelings to yourself, at least until you figure out where you will go. If you tell your roommate about your feelings, they may decide that they want to move out themselves. They might also ask you to move out. If you’re convinced that you absolutely cannot keep your feelings to yourself, then you need to be prepared for this reality. Would you be able to afford your share of the rent for the remainder of the lease, in addition to a new apartment? If not, would you be able to find a suitable replacement roommate to take over your share of the rent? Whether or not you choose to tell your roommate about your feelings, it is a good idea to have an exit plan in the event your feelings begin to cause you (or your roommate) stress and anguish. You might ask to stay with a friend or family, or, if you’re a college student, contact the university housing department to see what your options are."

[8] X Research source If you have already confessed your feelings to them, then you can be honest about your reasons for moving out. If you haven’t told them, you can still be honest by saying, “The truth is, that I’ve developed feelings for you, and I think it’s best to move out so I can have some space to deal with them.” If you don’t want to tell the truth, then make something up. If you want to remain in contact with them, and maybe move to the next level, then try to make them understand that it isn’t anything to do with them. If you want to make up an excuse, you could say, for example, that you are having a hard time with the rent, and you found a cheaper place. You could use distance to work or school as an excuse, as well. If you can afford a place of your own, you could also say that you just want to have a space that is completely your own. Do this in person. If your roommate doesn’t know you have feelings for them, they may be very surprised by your announcement.

Tell your roommate by what date you will be out, so that they have time to find a new roommate too. Telling them the date will also keep you true to your decision."
