      "content": "Lay off the tweezers. One of the best ways to help your eyebrows grow back is by refraining from using your tweezers until you have the desired thickness. It can be tempting to tweeze those stray hairs, but you'll only continue to carry on with your current eyebrow shape if you don't let them grow back. It takes about six to eight weeks for eyebrows to grow back so try to be patient. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Make sure you are getting the right nutrients. If your diet is lacking in vitamins and nutrients that you need to retain a healthy body, this could be one of the contributions to your lack of hair growth in your eyebrows. Try to keep your diet rich in Vitamin B, omega-3s, iron, protein, and zinc and always make sure you are drinking enough water. You can also take a Vitamin B supplement like Biotin to help hair growth. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use growth treatment products.",
      "content": "Use growth treatment products. If waiting patiently for your eyebrows to grow out or using natural methods hasn't produced any results, you can use a growth treatment to stimulate your hair growth. There are a number of growth treatments you can purchase for your eyebrows, so with adequate research you should be able to find one that corresponds to your desired thickness. [6] X Research source Some growth treatments have been proven to work better than others. If you have done a lot of damage to your eyebrows by over-tweezing, you may need to invest in a higher quality product. Latisse, Rogaine, and Viviscal are all popular treatments. However, these products only work as long as you continually use them. Also, they are only effective for some people, and may not work for you. Keep in mind that while some treatments and serums are applied directly to eyebrows, some are consumed. Those consumed may help hair growth in your eyebrows, but they can also stimulate hair growth on other parts of your body so be prepared for this before you begin taking any treatments."

      "content": "Decide what your eyebrows should look like. Before you apply any makeup, you'll want to determine what will look the most natural on your eyebrows and the shape you want to achieve. To find the right length for your eyebrows, use a pencil and measure a 45-degree angle reaching from the outside of your nose to the outer corner of your eye. Traditionally, your brow should end where the pencil meets your eyebrow. The outside edge should be parallel or slightly higher than the inside edge. [7] X Research source The inside of the eyebrow should line up with the center of your nostril.The arch should be positioned above the outer third of your eye. [8] X Research source If you have an oval face, you may want to go for arched brows that are a little longer. [9] X Research source For a heart-shaped or square face, choose a rounded brow. [10] X Research source For a rectangular face, try curved brows. [11] X Research source If you have a round face, choose an arched brow. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Use an eyebrow pencil.",
      "content": "Use an eyebrow pencil. If you are looking to create the appearance of thick eyebrows, pick an eyebrow pencil similar to the shade of your eyebrows or a little darker, and lightly fill in your eyebrows in the areas that your hair is more sparse. Use short, dash-like strokes to mimic your eyebrow hairs. [15] X Research source You want the pencil to fade in with the rest of your eyebrows, so use short strokes in the center of the brows. Don't just draw on eyebrows -- blend them in so they look natural. The edges of your brows should be a little more sparse than the center to create a natural look."

      "content": "Apply a powder. After you have filled in your eyebrows with a pencil, pick your desired powder color (if you are looking for darker eyebrows use a darker shade and if you are trying to lighten up your eyebrows choose a lighter shade). Using an angled brush, dab the tip into the powder and then apply by wiggling it into your brow. Do this until you have the definition you want. [16] X Research source Be careful not to fill in too much in one area -- you're just trying to create the evenest brow. After you have the desired color and thickness, run a spooly brush or clean mascara wand through your brow to smooth it out and to give it your desired shape."
