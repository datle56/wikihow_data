      "content": "Determine what number represents a majority in your organization. A simple majority is the best way to determine a quorum if you donâ€™t have a certain number already listed in the by-laws. Find out the total membership of your organization, and then divide that number in such a way as to have one number greater than the other by one. For example, if you have a board of eight members, a majority would be five, while the minority would be three. Therefore, in this example you would need five people to have a quorum."

      "content": "Determine the number of board members or organizational members in official decision-making positions. In law, a quorum would more specifically need to be composed of those who are capable of making decisions for the organization. If your organization has members who are not in decision-making roles, you will need to find a majority of decision-making members only. [2] X Research source An organization that has only one decision-making member can still have a quorum, but in this case they are a quorum of one."

      "title": "Determine a quorum by majority if no other rule exists.",
      "content": "Determine a quorum by majority if no other rule exists. If your organization has a rule that determines a quorum as something other than a majority and that rule is taken out of the by-laws, quorum is determined by a majority. Majority determines quorum until a new by-law is accepted. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Decide on the largest number of members that can be expected to attend meetings.",
      "content": "Decide on the largest number of members that can be expected to attend meetings. At this point, you should use your experience with previous meetings to determine both the number of people you can expect and how many people you want to be involved in financial and institutional decisions. This process will help you determine the by-law for quorum. [4] X Research source For example, you may find that three people show up to any given meeting, even if you have an eight-person board. In this case, you may overrule your majority quorum in favor of a three-person quorum. If your number of board members is flexible or changes frequently, consider using a percentage of board members present, rather than a set number."

    {
      "title": "Vote on the number required for a quorum, so that you can place it in the by-laws.",
      "content": "Vote on the number required for a quorum, so that you can place it in the by-laws. Ask the Secretary to write up the number required for a quorum. Give every member of the organization and opportunity to weigh in on the change before the vote. [5] X Research source Before the vote, give the members of the organization the proposed amendment to the quorum by-law in writing, as well as the existing by-law for quorum. Additionally, prior to the vote, provide the by-law as it will read once it is adopted. A two-thirds majority is needed for the vote to pass."
    },
    {
      "title": "Adopt or reconsider the amendment to the by-laws.",
      "content": "Adopt or reconsider the amendment to the by-laws. Once the vote has been taken for the amendment to your by-laws, if it passes, it is adopted and cannot be reconsidered. However, if the vote fails, the vote can be reconsidered. [6] X Research source Send out the new, updated by-laws to members of the organization and the state and federal organizations that require copies of your by-laws. Remind people that any meeting that does not have a quorum will not be able to do legal business. Determining a quorum allows people to ensure that financial and legal decisions are always reviewed and voted on by a percentage of members according to the by-laws of the organization."
