How it works: A scammer posing as a real person interested in a relationship lures a victim with charm or promises. The scammer gets the victim to send a sexual photo or video, or, as Sgt. Nelson warns, convinces them to be sexually intimate over video chat. Once the scammer has a video or photo of the victim doing something they wouldn't want others to see, they use it as blackmail to swindle the victim out of money or more sexual photos and videos. [2] X Research source Be aware that anyone can pretend to be anyone online, and can even use deepfake video to pretend they're somebody they aren't."

But even if you feel like you've gotten to know the person quite well, Sgt. Nelson stresses the importance of meeting at a public location. \"I wouldn't meet them at their residence or invite them to your residence,\" he explains. Make sure a friend or family member knows where you are and how to reach you."

Whether someone in the dating chat room shared a link with everyone or just sent you one privately, be careful—it could be malicious, or possibly a phishing link intended to trick you into providing your passwords or other personal information. To stay on the safe side, avoid clicking any links in chat rooms."
