Sonia Batra, MD, MSc, MPH Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 19 February 2021 Studies show that it’s one of the most effective treatments for warts.

For the best results: [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Soak the area with the wart for 10-15 minutes in warm water in your shower, bath, or a basin. Gently file away dead skin over the wart with a pumice stone or emery board. Apply the salicylic acid gel, cream, or patch directly to the wart. Do this 1-2 times daily for 12 weeks. Use a patch that can stay in place for several days if you’re treating an especially stubborn wart or one that’s located in an area with very thick skin, like the bottom of your heel. Avoid getting the salicylic acid in your eyes, nose, or mouth, and immediately rinse it away if it gets into one of these areas.

Other types, such as transparent duct tape, may not be as effective. Expose the wart to the air for 3-4 hours after filing off the layers of dead skin. Reapply the duct tape after this. Continue this treatment of duct tape and filing until the wart is completely gone. Some people combine duct tape with other treatments, such as salicylic acid or cryotherapy. Using a combination of treatments may be more effective than any 1 treatment alone.

      "content": "Freeze off the warts with over-the-counter medications. Cryotherapy works by freezing the tissues of the wart. This option can be painful and may need to be repeated several times, so try other options first. To do it at home, purchase a kit at your pharmacy containing dimethyl ether and propane, such as Compound W Freeze Off or Dr. Scholl’s Freeze Away. [10] X Research source Follow the instructions carefully, or ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. Most of these kits come with a foam applicator that you will use to apply the chemical mixture to the wart. While home cryotherapy treatments are usually safe if you follow the directions, there’s a small risk of scarring, burns, or infection. Call your doctor if you notice symptoms such as increasing pain, redness, or swelling, red streaks spreading away from the area, a discharge of pus, or a fever. Freezing treatments can be flammable and shouldn’t be used near any fires, flames, heat sources such as curling irons, or lit cigarettes."

However, they can sometimes hurt or cause discomfort when you walk.

If you’re on the fence about whether to treat the warts or wait, also keep in mind that treatment can help prevent the warts from spreading (either to other people or other parts of your own body) and may reduce their chances of coming back."

[14] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Dermatology Professional organization made of over 20,000 certified dermatologists Go to source A doctor will diagnose the warts by examining them. In some cases, they might shave off a small amount of the wart with a scalpel. This can help them spot telltale dots under the surface of the skin (tiny, clotted blood vessels), or they may wish to send a sample to the lab for testing. To spot mosaic warts, look for clusters of white, pinhead-sized bumps on the bottoms of your feet or toes. These warts are similar to plantar warts, but they tend to be flatter and may spread over a large area (like the entire sole of your foot).
