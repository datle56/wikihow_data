      "content": "Dye objects with food coloring for a quick DIY project. Make sure the object you want to dye is small and made of clear acrylic plastic. This method works best if you only dye the inside of an object so that the color doesn’t rub off onto other objects. This option is great for objects that are shaped like cubes or are round. Small objects you can dye with this method include: ornaments makeup accessory containers decorative vases jars bowls flower pots votive candle holders (for decoration only)"

Add enough glue to completely coat the inside of your object. Add a few drops of food coloring and mix it with a toothpick or small paintbrush. Add a few drops of water to thin out the mixture. [1] X Research source Add more food coloring one drop at a time if you desire a stronger color. There are no exact measurements for this process. Add more glue and/or water as needed to thin the dye enough so that it swirls around easily in the mixing container."

Make sure the object is clean and dry so that your dye sticks to the object. Cleaning your object will prevent any dust from sticking to your finished product. Prepare to dye each plastic part of the object separately. Take apart any removable parts first and label or photograph them to remember how to put the object back together. Do not dye metal, wood, glass, or rubber pieces using this method because they will not absorb the synthetic dye properly."

While wearing rubber gloves, add the synthetic dye to the water according to the product instructions. Boil the mixture for several minutes until the dye is completely dissolved and mixed in. While your water is coming to a boil, fill a second container or pot with cool water for rinsing your object. Place this container next to the pot where you are dyeing your object. If your object is very large, first boil several more pots or kettles of water and pour them into a larger container. [3] X Research source Place a lid or other covering over this container to keep the water hot while boiling your dye mixture. Pour your dye mixture into this larger container and make sure there is enough water in the container to cover your object."

Make sure this area is protected from other objects, people, or animals that could bump into the object while drying. Dispose of the dyeing mixture responsibly. If you use a disperse dye, you can pour the mixture down a bathtub drain. Be careful to poor only on the porcelain surface, which will wash easier. [5] X Research source"
