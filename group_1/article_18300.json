The sticker with the model number also includes the serial number, and may also have the manufacture date printed on it. [1] X Research source Note: Frigidaire doesn't have specific instructions on where the model number is located on their air conditioners, but other sources state it is typically located on the right side of the unit. Use the following table to find the potential model number sticker locations for your appliance type.

The model number is made up of a handful of codes that detail exactly what appliance you have, down to any extra features and the color. [3] X Research source Unfortunately, Frigidaire does not have any publicly accessible resources that state what the codes in their model numbers mean."

      "content": "Appliance age is coded into the serial number, not the model number. Thankfully, your appliance's serial number is on the same sticker as the model number. Many modern Frigidaire appliances list the manufacture date on the same sticker as the serial and model numbers, but if it's not, you can determine it from the serial number. [4] X Research source For appliances with Electrolux labels, you can use the numbers in the third, fourth, and fifth positions of the serial number to determine the date. The digit in the third position is the last number of the year the appliance was manufactured. For example, if the number was 1, it could be made in 2021, 2011, 2001, or 1991. Based on the appliance's appearance, you'll have to use your best judgment to determine which year the appliance was made. The digits in the fourth and fifth positions show the week it was manufactured. For example, if the fourth digit was 1 and the fifth digit was 5, that means the appliance was made in the 15th week of the year. Use your favorite search engine to figure out what dates are in the week you got from the serial number. In the example, the 15th week of the year is in the beginning of April. If the week your appliance was manufactured spans two months, pick the month that spans over 50% of that week. If the appliance's model number sticker has a GM logo, it was manufactured before 1979. However, the serial numbers on these appliances don't have any discernible code for the exact date of manufacture."
