When a bad thought or image flits into your mind, label it as what it really is – i.e., an argument, an image, a lie, or simply a bad thought – and then immediately return to your current task or think about lighter topics. This strategy will train you to acknowledge when you're having a negative thought and avoid ruminating on it. [3] X Research source For example, if you start thinking of an imaginary argument with someone in your head, stop and label the thought as an argument. If you think of a disturbing image, label it as an image. Then force yourself to think about something more positive, like an outing you're planning with friends, pleasant memories from your past, or a favorite activity, film, or book."

I don't know what's going to happen to me tomorrow, let alone everyone I know. Instead of thinking about death, I'm going to enjoy life and make memories with the people I love.\" This technique takes practice and can feel a bit unnatural at first, but if you stick to it, eventually it will feel second nature!"
