      "title": "Choose your dye.",
      "content": "Choose your dye. Decide what color you want your sweatshirt to be and whether you are using chemical or natural dye. You can purchase chemical dye from most major retailers as well as specialty fabric stores. Gather plant materials in the color you want if you are using natural dye. A medium- to heavy-weight sweatshirt will likely need about one box of powder dye or 1/2 bottle of liquid dye, but that amount may be doubled for darker shades. If you are planning to use natural materials to dye your clothes, gather food materials in the color you want. For instance, beets can be used to dye your sweatshirt red, while carrots can be used to get an orange color. [1] X Research source When choosing a color, remember that the base shade of your sweatshirt will affect the final color. For instance, if you try to dye a yellow sweatshirt blue, it will probably end up green."

      "content": "Buy a prepared color remover if you want to dye your sweatshirt a lighter color. Lighter color dyes will not show up on a dark sweatshirt, so you'll have to lighten it first. To lighten your sweatshirt, treat it with a commercially-prepared color remover, which you can find almost anywhere you find fabric dye. One box should be sufficient for this project. [2] X Research source Do not use bleach. Bleach can damage the fibers of your sweatshirt, which may prevent them from accepting dye. [3] X Research source"

Stir the mixture to make sure the dye is mixed evenly. [7] X Research source If you are using natural plant material to dye your clothes, chop the plants up into about 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces and add them to a pot of water on the stove. Bring the water to a boil, then simmer on low for about an hour. Strain the plant material out of the water before using. [8] X Research source"
