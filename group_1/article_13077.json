      "content": "A channel that links to all the different channels in your server is a great idea if you have a large server. This way, people looking at the server aren't overwhelmed and can keep referring to the map to get around.

      "title": "Instead of the \"general\" channel, rename it!",
      "content": "Instead of the \"general\" channel, rename it! You can assign bots like WelcomeBud to welcome new people into your Discord server.

[2] X Research source You don't want to be discussing the intricacies of bagel making and have other people command \".play the safety dance\" and then the bot responding to that command. Keep all those \".play\" or other commands in a separate channel so your discussions aren't interrupted."

      "title": "Keep your server members up-to-date with an announcement channel.",
      "content": "Keep your server members up-to-date with an announcement channel. Edit the channel's permissions to make it so @everyone can't send messages to that channel. Instead, they can create threads to have out-of-the-way discussions about the updates! [3] X Research source If you're playing something like World of Warcraft, you can have multiple announcement channels, for each game, like #retail-announcements, #wotlk-announcements, and #classic-annoucements."

Instead of their text potentially getting lost in the Welcome Channel, set them up with a Charity Channel! This is great for games, like Guild Wars 2, that participate in fundraisers to raise money for charities! You can post updates and share stories to get that charity more interest!"

You can post the questions and answers in this channel, then drag it up toward the top of your channel list for easier visibility.
