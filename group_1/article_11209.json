      "title": "Visualize the cord being cut.",
      "content": "Visualize the cord being cut. Sit in a peaceful, quiet place, and close your eyes. Imagine the cord that connects you to the person whom you wish to be released from. Then, visualize yourself holding a pair of scissors and cutting the cord, letting the connection fade back into darkness. [5] X Research source It may be easier to perform this ritual with an actual thread and pair of scissors. Focusing your mental energy on the person who you want to cut cords with, cut the real thread in front of you. If these cords are strong, repeat this ritual several times. If you’re trying to cut cords with, say, an ex you’re still really hung up on, try doing it daily for 21 days in a row. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Meditate",
      "content": "Meditate on abundance to restore independence. Take a deep breath, and remember that the world around you is filled with abundance, or things to be grateful for. During your meditation, emphasize to yourself that the person with whom you’re cutting cords with does not possess your abundance and sense of gratitude for the world—only you do. This practice reinforces your individual control in any relationship."

      "content": "Take a salt bath to cleanse your chakras. Cords are tied to our chakras, which are the points of our bodies that serve as openings to the spiritual flow of energy. Take a shower to clean the dirt off your body, then add several cups of salt to a bath. Relax in the bath to cleanse your chakras and free yourself from energy cords. [7] X Research source Himalayan sea salt works especially well for cleansing chakras, but it can get a little expensive. Regular salt is more than enough to do the job. Rub some of the salt into the top of your head while you bathe. This cleanses the crown chakra, which is a major portal to the spiritual world."

[8] X Research source Try out some of these prompts: Why has this cord grown so powerful? What will you do once you’re free of this cord? What has this cord taught you about yourself? Write a letter to the person you want to cut cords with. Keep it to yourself—there’s no need to send it."
