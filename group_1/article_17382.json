      "content": "Have a plumber install a waste pipe in the wall if you don’t already have one. Contact plumbers in your area and tell them where you want to install a sink. Get price quotes from each plumber and choose the one that’s within your budget. Allow the plumber to run a new waste pipe from the wall where you want the sink to the main waste line in your home. [1] X Research source Waste pipes run through your entire home and connect to underground sewage lines to get rid of dirty water. Don’t attempt putting in a new waste line yourself since you could be exposed to sewage."

      "title": "Turn off the water supply to the faucet if it’s connected.",
      "content": "Turn off the water supply to the faucet if it’s connected. Go underneath the sink basin and look for 2 valves that control the hot and cold water. Rotate each handle clockwise as far as you’re able to shut off the water. Avoid turning on the faucet while you’re working since there may still be a little water left in the pipes. [2] X Research source If you haven’t installed a faucet yet, then you don’t need to turn off the water connections."

      "title": "Measure the inner diameter of the waste pipe and drain.",
      "content": "Measure the inner diameter of the waste pipe and drain. Hold a tape measure against the end of the waste pipe so “0” lines up with the inside wall of the pipe. Pull the tape measure horizontally across the pipe to the inside wall on the opposite side. Then locate the threading on the bottom of the drain underneath the sink basin. Use a tape measure to find the diameter between the threadings. Write down the measurements so you don’t forget them. [3] X Research source Usually, the diameters of the drain and waste pipe are either 1 1 ⁄ 4 or 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches (3.2 or 3.8 cm). If you’re replacing an old drain trap, save it so you can ensure you get pipes that are the same size."
    },
    {
      "title": "Buy a P-trap installation kit that matches the diameter of the drain.",
      "content": "Buy a P-trap installation kit that matches the diameter of the drain. Look at your local home improvement or hardware store for a premade kit for sink P-traps. Choose a kit that contains pipes with the same diameter as the bottom of the drain. Opt for PVC or ABS pipes, which are both types of hard plastic that won’t corrode, and they’re easiest to maintain. Make sure the kit contains a J-pipe, trap arm, tailpiece, tapered and flange washers, and slip nuts. [4] X Research source J-pipes are shaped like the letter J with one side taller than the other. Trap arms are pipes that have one straight end and one with a 90-degree bend. Tailpieces are straight pieces of pipes that have a 1 flared end and 1 unflared end. Slip nuts are round plastic pieces with threading that fit over rubber washers and pipe connections to prevent leaks. If you’re unable to find a kit, you can also buy all of the pieces individually."

      "title": "Screw the J-pipe onto the trap arm to make the P-trap.",
      "content": "Screw the J-pipe onto the trap arm to make the P-trap. Hold the J-pipe so the openings point up and the shorter side is on the right side. Position the angled opening of the trap arm over the short end of the J-pipe so the threadings line up. Screw the plastic nut on the trap arm loosely so the J-pipe can swivel around without falling out. [5] X Research source Avoid tightly screwing the pipes together yet since you may need to adjust the angle of the J-pipe later on. Do not apply pipe glue or cement around the threadings on any pipe connections since you won’t be able to unscrew them. If you use glue, then you will need to saw the pipes whenever you make repairs."

      "title": "Slide a slip nut and washer onto the trap arm so the threading faces out.",
      "content": "Slide a slip nut and washer onto the trap arm so the threading faces out. Take one of the plastic slip nuts from the P-trap kit and position it over the straight end of the trap arm. Make sure the threadings on the nut point toward the straight end. Then slide a tapered washer onto the pipe so the tapered side points toward the end of the pipe. Slide them about 2 inches (5.1 cm) down the pipe’s length. [6] X Research source If you put the washers on with the tapered side facing in, then the pipes may leak when water runs through them."

      "title": "Push the trap arm into the waste pipe so the J-pipe lines up with the drain.",
      "content": "Push the trap arm into the waste pipe so the J-pipe lines up with the drain. Hold the P-trap with the curved portion of the pipe pointing down. Slowly push the straight end of the trap arm into the waste pipe. Continue pushing the trap arm deeper into the pipe until the opening on top of the J-pipe is directly underneath the drain in the sink basin. Rotate the J-pipe if you need to. [7] X Research source If the waste pipe is the same diameter as the pipe, then screw the slip nut into the waste pipe right away."

      "title": "Cut the end of the trap arm with a hacksaw if it extended past the drain.",
      "content": "Cut the end of the trap arm with a hacksaw if it extended past the drain. Measure the distance from the opening in the J-pipe to where it lines up vertically with the drain. Pull the trap arm out from the waste line and measure in from the straight end to mark your cut. Hold the pipe still with your nondominant hand and slowly make a straight cut through it with a hacksaw. Throw away any pipe you removed from the trap arm. Avoid cutting the pipe at an angle, or else it will not fit properly and could cause leaks. Slide the slip nut and washer further down the trap arm so you don’t cut it off."

Slide the slip nut and washer over the pipe connection and onto the waste pipe’s threading. Turn the slip nut clockwise to tighten until you don’t feel any more resistance. [8] X Research source Don’t tighten the nut if you feel any resistance since you could crack the plastic and cause a leak."

      "title": "Put a flange washer in the flared end of the tailpiece pipe.",
      "content": "Put a flange washer in the flared end of the tailpiece pipe. Find the long section of straight pipe in your P-trap kit and look for the end that has a flared rim. Slide the narrow end of a flange washer into the end of the pipe so the wider end sits on the rim. Make sure the washer forms a tight seal around the edge so it doesn’t leak. [9] X Research source If you’re working on a bathroom sink, look for a long cylindrical PVC or metal coming straight down from the drain, which could be a pre-installed tailpiece pipe. If your sink has one, you can skip this step."

Ensure that the rim of the flange washer stays between the pipe and the drain. Slide the slip nut over the seam and turn it clockwise onto the threading. Continue screwing it in until it’s hand-tight. [11] X Research source Be careful not to overtighten the nut if you feel resistance since you could crack the plastic."

Make sure the bottom of the tailpiece extends into the flared opening of the J-pipe by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Try to push the pipes together to see if you’re able to get a tight fit. [12] X Research source Don’t try to bend or force the pipes together since you could crack or damage the connections."

Unscrew the slip nut connecting the tailpiece to the drain and remove the pipe. Set the pipe on a sturdy surface and make a straight cut along your mark with a hacksaw. Work slowly to ensure you don’t damage the pipe. Screw it back onto the drain to check your fit. Be careful when sawing through pipes since they could roll around and cause the blade to slip."
