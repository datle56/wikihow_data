Angler makes fish worth 50% more (which doesn't stack with the 25% from the Fisher profession) and Pirate doubles your chance to find treasure. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Most players prefer the Fisher profession because it's more lucrative. In the early game, the Fisher profession can earn you more money as you'll get more gold for selling the fish that you catch. If you catch fish that are above normal quality (silver, gold, or iridium) you will get even more gold for these fish with the Fisher profession, which can really help in the beginning of the game when you don't have much passive income. [5] X Research source The Fisher profession also increases the sale price of most crab pot fish, so even if you select the Fisher profession, crab pots are still a viable way to make passive income."

      "content": "Trapper is work-intensive and requires checking crab pots daily to maximize profits. Many players say they don't like having to check their crab pots daily, and would prefer to increase the profit on the fish they catch. [6] X Research source Fish caught in crab pots are always normal quality. You can get silver, gold, and iridium quality crab pot fish only by foraging them. On the flip side, fish caught with a fishing rod can be any quality, and with the Fisher profession that will only increase their value further."
