      "title": "Hold the barre in first or fifth position.",
      "content": "Hold the barre in first or fifth position. Hold the barre with your left hand while facing perpendicular to it. If you don't have a barre, you can use the wall or even a banister. Just have something you can return to for balance. In first position, your heels are together and your feet are turned out, forming a line. [1] X Research source In fifth position, your feet are turned out and parallel (one in front of the other), with the toe of one foot touching the heel of the other foot."

      "title": "Go to passé en relevé.",
      "content": "Go to passé en relevé. Bring your right foot to your left knee, with the right knee facing outward—that's the passé part. Relevé is where you are up on your toes, explains Johns. In this guide, your right leg is your working leg. In this position, hold the bar with your left hand. Keep your core tight, pulling up your ribcage and keeping your hips down. Your right arm should be in the first position. To put your free right arm into first position, hold it in front of your body with your wrist at the navel line, keeping your elbow round and your fingers pointed toward the barre.

      "title": "Plié and développé front.",
      "content": "Plié and développé front. Keep your right arm in first position and your hips down. Plié by bending your legs slightly at the knee, making sure to keep your knees over your toes. To developé to the front, point your right toe and stretch your right leg out in front of you at a 90-degree angle."

    {
      "title": "Open your right leg to the side, or à la seconde.",
      "content": "Open your right leg to the side, or à la seconde. Open your right arm to the second position as well. While you do this, remain in plié with your knees over your toes. Make sure to keep your hips down! To move your arm from first to second position, lift it upward and outward. Extend it so it's straight, with a slight bend at the shoulder and wrist.

    {
      "title": "Bring everything in at once.",
      "content": "Bring everything in at once. Lower your right arm back to the first position. Bring your right foot back to your left knee with your right knee facing outward. Go back to relevé, up on your toe. Remember to keep your core tight and hips down at all times."

      "title": "Once you have steps 3, 4, and 5 down, do a pirouette.",
      "content": "Once you have steps 3, 4, and 5 down, do a pirouette. Plié and developé to the front, go to second, and then do a pirouette, staying at the bar. This is your basic fouetté turn, but with training wheels. Once you feel comfortable here, you can do some floor work to learn and master a beautiful fouetté!"

      "title": "Practice one-legged relevés until you can do 32 in a row comfortably.",
      "content": "Practice one-legged relevés until you can do 32 in a row comfortably. A fouetté is both a turn and a relevé at once. If you can't handle the relevés just yet, Johns advises working on building leg strength and balance. Note that you don't always do 32 fouettés at once—but if you can hit that maximum, doing less will be a cinch. A solid, balanced, strong relevé is essential. To do one relevé: [4] X Research source Put one foot on the ground and the other slightly behind you, then plié (bend your knees). Lift up on the ball of your front foot, keeping your other foot lifted behind you and below the front knee. (Keep your body straight so your hips only move up and down, not sideways or back or forward.) Lower your lifted foot so your heel is back on the floor. Repeat to do additional relevés. Tip: Practice moving your free leg out and around (try a \"ronde de jambe\") and keeping your body balanced and still during your relevé."

      "title": "Practice the out, around, and inward foot movements.",
      "content": "Practice the out, around, and inward foot movements. This is a small part of a fouetté, but you need to nail this movement to pull off the full turn. Balancing evenly and not on your toes on your right foot (right-footed dancers), practice the following three steps without tipping or losing balance. Your hips, in particular, should not move. Lift your left leg straight in front of you. Arc your left leg to the right, so that it points perpendicular to your body. Bend at the left knee to bring your left toes to your right leg, touching the right knee. (Your feet are in the fourth position.)"

      "title": "Focus on your supporting leg to stay in place, not the working leg.",
      "content": "Focus on your supporting leg to stay in place, not the working leg. As you practice, work on making the extended leg’s movements second nature so your attention can go to your supporting (planted) leg. By centering yourself on the planted leg, you ensure you don't drift around the stage or lose balance as you get tired, and you keep spinning. Remember to keep your hips in the same place. They should spin like a top on your supporting leg. Make sure to spot your head as your turn. Pretend there’s something really interesting that you're trying to look at and you don't want to turn away from it. As you turn, snap your head as fast as you can back to your spot. \"Always remember to spot! When turning, you need to spot really quickly,\" says Johns. \"It can make all the difference—and keep you from getting too dizzy.\" Johns also notes that the head is the heaviest part of your body, and it needs to be correctly aligned."

      "title": "Use the swing to the side to build your momentum.",
      "content": "Use the swing to the side to build your momentum. Many young dancers will swing up, turn their leg a bit to the right, and then immediately tuck in. But that kick sideways provides the bulk of your momentum and needs to be a major part of your fouetté. Think of someone grabbing your foot and spinning it to the right to rotate you on your planted foot."

    {
      "title": "Coordinate the extension of your hands with your leg kick.",
      "content": "Coordinate the extension of your hands with your leg kick. As your left leg kicks to the right, your left arm should fly out with it. Think of your left hand and left foot as being tethered together on a string. This creates full body momentum, making it much easier to keep your balance. As your toes come in towards the end of the turn, pull your hands back in with them. Push them out afterward for the next spin."

      "title": "Keep your chest up and open to spin easier.",
      "content": "Keep your chest up and open to spin easier. Use your hands to open your body up. Your shoulders should be up and your chest out. When your hands come in, don't let your body crumple or cave inward. You want to be tall, strong, and on balance. The chest needs to be lifted to make this possible. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Fouetté is French for “whipped.”",
      "content": "Fouetté is French for “whipped.” In ballet, fouetté refers to the whipping motion of the free (working) leg as it extends out and returns to the standing leg. You may also hear the phrase fouetté en tournant used to refer not just to the whipping motion but to the whole turn. It’s French for “whipped turning.” [6] X Research source Fouetté is pronounced fwe-tay . Think of it as rhyming with “wet A.” The move may also be referred to as fouette rond de jamb en tournant .

      "content": "The ballet Swan Lake features 32 fouetté turns. The impressive turn sequence occurs during the Pas de deux between Odile (the black swan) and Prince Siegfried. The variation is famously difficult, as the dancer must maintain technical precision, balance, and control without tiring out before the end of the fouettés. [8] X Research source The ballet Don Quixote also has a 32-fouetté sequence during the wedding pas de deux ."

She later starred as the Swan Queen in Swan Lake , repeating the famous move and immortalizing the role as a way for ballerinas to prove their prowess. [9] X Research source"
