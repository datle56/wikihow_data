      "content": "Identify your dividend fraction and your divisor fraction. You should have two fractions. The first fraction is the fraction that’s being divided—this is called your dividend fraction . The second fraction is the one that’s being divided by —this is called your divisor fraction . [1] X Research source Example: For our example problem, we’ll use 2/3 ÷ 3/7 . 2/3 is our dividend fraction, while 3/7 is our divisor fraction."

      "title": "Flip the numerator and denominator on the divisor fraction.",
      "content": "Flip the numerator and denominator on the divisor fraction. Your divisor fraction (or the second fraction) has a numerator at the top and a denominator at the bottom. Flip the fraction so your denominator is now at the top and the numerator at the bottom. This is called finding the reciprocal of your fraction . [2] X Research source Example: 3/7 is our divisor fraction. If we flip the fraction, the reciprocal is 7/3."

      "content": "Multiply each fraction’s numerator and denominator by the other one. In order to divide fractions, we actually want to multiply them ! First, multiply the numerators of your two fractions together—the result of this calculation will become the numerator of your final answer. Then, multiply the denominators of your two fractions together—the result of this calculation will become the denominator of your final answer. [3] X Research source Example: 2 x 7 = 14 , so our numerator is 14. 3 x 3 = 9 , so our denominator is 9. This means that our final result is 14/9."

      "title": "Simplify the fraction (if needed) to its simplest form.",
      "content": "Simplify the fraction (if needed) to its simplest form. If your fraction is already in its simplest form (e.g., 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/7, etc.), then you’re done! If your fraction can still be simplified, however, then you must reduce it to its simplest form. To simplify a fraction , find the greatest common factor between the numerator and denominator (i.e., the largest number that both of them can be divided by), instructs Jia. Then, divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor. The resulting numbers are your new numerator and denominator in the simplest form of your fraction. [4] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. In common terms, clarifies Jia, you just have to ask yourself “what is the biggest number that both the top and bottom can be divided by? What’s the biggest number that both numbers can be divided by?” [5] X Expert Source David Jia Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 7 January 2021. Example: In our example, the final result has a numerator (14) that’s larger than the denominator (9), meaning that we have to convert the fraction to a mixed number (a whole number and fraction combined, like 1⅔) before simplifying it. We’ll first divide the numerator (14) by the denominator (9). 9 goes into 14 one time, with a remainder of 5, giving us this fraction → 1 5/9 (“one and five-ninths”). That’s our answer! The fraction can’t be reduced further because the denominator is not evenly divisible by the numerator (i.e., 9 can’t be evenly divided by 5) and the numerator is a prime number (an integer that can only be divided by one and itself)."

Multiply together the numerators of each fraction → 4 x 6 = 24. Multiply together the denominators of each fraction → 5 x 2 = 10. Assemble your new fraction → 24/10. To simplify, divide the numerator by the denominator → 24 ÷ 10 = 2 with a remainder of 4. Write the answer out as a mixed fraction → 2 4/10 (two and four-tenths). The greatest common factor in 4 and 10 is 2, so divide both numbers by 2 → 4 ÷ 2 = 2. 10 ÷ 2 = 5. Write out these numbers in your final fraction → 2 ⅖ (two and two-fifths)."

      "content": "Try to visualize the fractions and what the problem is asking you to do with them. The problem 2 ÷ 1/2 is asking you: ”How many halves are in 2?” The answer is 4, because each unit (1) is made up of two halves, and there are 2 units total: 2 halves/1 unit * 2 units = 4 halves. [6] X Research source Try thinking about this same equation in terms of cups of water: How many half cups of water are in 2 cups of water? You could pour 2 half cups of water into each cup of water, which means you are basically adding them, and you have two cups: 2 halves/1 cup * 2 cups = 4 halves. All of this means that when the fraction you are dividing by is between 0 and 1, the answer will always be larger than the original number! This is true whether you are dividing whole numbers or fractions by a fraction."

[7] X Expert Source Grace Imson, MA Math Instructor, City College of San Francisco Expert Interview. 1 November 2019. The reciprocal of a fraction (also called its “multiplicative inverse”) is just the fraction turned upside down, so that the numerator and denominator have switched places. Here are some examples of reciprocal fractions: [8] X Research source The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. The reciprocal of 7/5 is 5/7. The reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1, or 2."
