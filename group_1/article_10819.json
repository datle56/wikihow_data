      "content": "Create a vacation bucket list. Make a list of all of the things you want to do on your trip. Even if it's more than you think you can manage, create a list of everything you'd like to do. Don’t worry about budget, time, or organization at this stage. [1] X Research source If you’re not sure where you want to go yet, create a trip inspiration board with all the places you’d like to go. Create a physical vision board , pin destinations on Pinterest, or save inspiring TikToks from travel influencers."

      "title": "Create a budget.",
      "content": "Create a budget. Build your travel budget with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. Alternatively, consider using a budgeting app or website. The downside is that this may not be as portable, especially if you don't have Wi-Fi access. [2] X Research source Do you want a trip with days spent at four-star restaurants and nights spent in five-star hotels? Or are you more interested in finding local favorites and rustic B&Bs? Your vacation can be as expensive (or inexpensive) as you want. It ultimately comes down to what you can afford."

      "title": "Research your destination.",
      "content": "Research your destination. Categorize your bucket list into categories like “must-sees” and “could miss it.” Write an estimated time for each activity—certain excursions, like the Museum of Modern Art, can be an all-day endeavor. Research the best time to visit; if you're traveling in the off-season, check the weather forecasts and make sure your must-see destinations are open year-round. [3] X Research source Look into transportation for traveling to your destination and for getting around while you’re there. Find accommodation that fits your budget, like a hostel, AirBnB, or hotel, and make sure it’s near your top attractions. Research local events, holidays, and observances in the places you're traveling to. You may be able to witness or experience a cultural event that other travelers don't get to experience. If you’re traveling with a group of friends or another person, get feedback and ideas for your destinations from the group.

      "title": "Map out your trip.",
      "content": "Map out your trip. Match your stops to specific locations on a map and note their locations. Try to map them sequentially to use your travel time efficiently. You’ll most likely be traveling from adjacent cities as you travel. For each activity, estimate the length of time it will take to get there and how long you will be there. [4] X Research source Obtain local maps for the areas you will be exploring. It is also helpful to get schedules for bus and train services and numbers for local taxis. Make sure that the maps are up-to-date. Cities and other areas change often. A road that existed 10 years ago may no longer exist today. Use Google MyMaps to pin each attraction or eatery onto a map. On your trip, you can easily see routes between points of interest and what’s around you at any time."

      "content": "Create a calendar of events with your bookings. Book your transportation and accommodation first. Then, book your “must-do” ticketed tours and activities that require reservations. [5] X Research source Sketch out the days of your trip and write in these booked attractions. Then, fill in the gaps with your other sights, moving down your list of priorities. Build in an extra day for rest or spontaneous adventures. Plus, if plans go amiss for any reason, having this extra day will give you some wiggle room. [6] X Research source"
