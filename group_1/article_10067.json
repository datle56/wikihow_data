      "content": "Select a cut of top sirloin from your local butcher or grocery store. Choose a cut that's large enough for your meal. Plan to serve 1/4 to 1/2 pound per of steak per person. Choose steaks that are at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, and preferably 2 inches (5.1 cm). Thinner steaks will dry out easily when you cook them. Fresh sirloin steak is deep red in color, with a generous marbling of fat. This marbling is what makes steak succulent. [1] X Research source There should be a band of white fat around the outside of the steak."

Contrary to popular belief, you should not rinse raw beef to wash it. Rinsing raw beef and other raw meats can actually cause bacteria to spread to other foods and surfaces.

      "content": "Marinate the steak, if desired. Top sirloin steak is a great meat to marinate, since it pairs well with many flavors. Choose your favorite marinade from the store, or mix up your own with equal parts oil, vinegar and spices. Place the steak in a sealable plastic bag and add the marinade. Seal the bag and allow the steak to marinate for 2 to 4 hours. Exact marinating times vary depending on the type and size of the meat. For thick steaks, opt for the full 4 hours when possible. [3] X Research source When you're ready to cook the steak, remove it from the bag, pat it dry with paper towels, and proceed to the next step."
