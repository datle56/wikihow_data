      "title": "Use fades when transitioning from one clip to another.",
      "content": "Use fades when transitioning from one clip to another. Fading is when the volume gradually rises from or lowers to 0 over a period of time. A slow fade may take several seconds, while a quick fade may happen over a second or two. Fading is often used when transitioning from one audio clip to another. There are a couple of different fades you can use when editing audio: Fade-In: A fade-in is when the volume starts at zero and gradually rises to full. This is usually done at the beginning of an audio clip. Fade-Out: A fade-out is the opposite of a fade-in. This is when the audio lowers from full volume to 0. This usually happens at the end of an audio clip. You may have heard songs that end with a fade-out. Cross-Fade: A cross-fade is when one audio clip fades out while another fades simultaneously. This makes for a smoother transition from one audio clip to another."

      "title": "Use effects to enhance audio.",
      "content": "Use effects to enhance audio. There are a variety of effects you can use to enhance audio. The options will vary depending on which DAW you are using. DAWs generally come with their own effects, but you can add more by installing plugins, which are usually in the VST or VST3 format. The following are some effects you can use when enhancing audio: Reverb: Reverb (or reverberation) is when sound bounces off surfaces in a room. Reverb effects simulate sound reverberating through a room. Most reverb effects allow adjusting the size of the \"room.\" Reverb adds ambiance by creating a slight echo effect that lingers in the air. Delay: Delay is an echo effect. Delay repeat a sample of the sound multiple times. Typically, the delay will gradually fade with each repeat. You can adjust the speed and intensity of the delay effect. Chorus: Chorus duplicates the audio wave and intrudes slight variations in the second wave that modulate over time. This creates a lush and full sound. Phaser: Phaser alters the frequency of a sound wave and varies it over time. This creates a swooshing sound effect. The effect can be fast (simulating a rotary speaker effect) or slow, creating movement in the audio. Flanger: Flanger duplicates the audio wave and applies a varying delay to the duplicate wave. This creates a spacy, jet-engine-like effect. Equalizer (EQ): Equalizer or graphic EQ is one of the most common effects. It is used to reduce or boost certain frequencies of an audio wave or input. You can use equalizer to shape the tone of an audio clip or the overall audio. For example, a low-pass EQ allows lower bass frequencies to pass through while limiting higher frequencies. A high-pass EQ allows higher frequencies to pass through while limiting lower frequencies. Compression: Compression reduces the dynamic range of an audio clip. It reduces the range between the loud and quiet parts of an audio clip or input. It can also prevent distortion from clipping. Distortion: This is when the audio wave file is intentionally altered to create a distorted sound. This is usually done by increasing the input gain to the point where the wave starts clipping. This is most commonly used on electric guitar, however it can be used on other instruments as well. Noise Gate: A noise gate blocks audio waves below a certain volume level. This is useful for removing background noise or static hissing. Pitch correction: Pitch correction (also known as Auto-tune ) allows you to manually correct the pitch of out-of-tune vocals or instruments. This is usually used on vocal tracks. When used overtly, pitch correction can create a robotic-sounding tone, as made famous by the rapper T-Pain."

      "title": "Mix audio properly to ensure the best sound.",
      "content": "Mix audio properly to ensure the best sound. Mixing is the process of balancing the individual tracks and elements into a final mix. Once you have your audio tracks recorded and arranged, and you have added all the effects you want to add, the final step is to mix everything to produce a final mix. The mixing process involves: Balancing: Most DAWs have individual volume sliders for each track. Balancing is when you adjust the volume of each track to ensure no instrument is too loud or too quiet. You don't want one track to be overpowering the rest of the mix. You also don't want a track that's too quiet and barely audible. You also want to make sure the prominent parts of the mix (i.e., the vocals) are mixed slightly higher than the rest so they stand out. Tonal balancing: Tonal balancing is when you use EQ to adjust the frequencies of individual tracks and the overall mix. When recording a musical composition, you want each instrument to occupy its own sonic space within the audio spectrum. This means having instruments, such as bass guitar, more prominent on the lower frequencies, and electric guitar more prominent on the mid-range frequencies. Vocals and lead guitar may be more prominently featured on the high end of the spectrum. Applying EQ to the overall mix ensures that the mix doesn't have too much treble or bass. Stereo Imaging: Stereo imaging is the process of panning individual tracks to the left, right, or center sides of the stereo speakers. This creates space in the mix and makes it sound like different instruments are placed in different locations. Double-tracking is a common practice whereby an instrumental part is recorded and panned to the left or right side. Then, the exact part is re-recorded and panned to the opposite side. This creates a thicker sound with slight variations on both sides of the stereo mix. Dynamic control: Dynamic control is when you mix the audio so that no section is too loud or too quiet. This can be done using a compressor, adjusting the volume on certain channels, or boosting or reducing the volume on certain audio clips during parts of the song."

You can usually find the option to export or render the audio in the File menu of most DAWs. Select the highest-quality audio settings when you export your final audio. The final mix is not always the final mix. You may produce several rough drafts before you settle on a final mix."

      "title": "Record audio with a microphone or an instrument.",
      "content": "Record audio with a microphone or an instrument. Most computers have a built-in microphone. However, the audio quality you get from your computer's microphone may not be the greatest. You can purchase a USB microphone that you can connect to your computer. The best way to record is to purchase an audio interface that you can connect to your computer. The audio interface typically connects via a USB connection. Then, you can connect a microphone or instrument to your audio interface. When you record, you typically will need to arm the track you want to record on. Then click the record button to begin recording. Some audio interfaces have multiple inputs for multiple microphones or instruments. Make sure you purchase the right microphone for your needs. Some mics are directional and only pick up sound directly in front of them. These mics are useful for recording singing or instruments. Other mics are omnidirectional and pick up sound from all around. These mics are better for recording speech and audio from out in the field. Musical instruments can be connected to an audio interface via an analog or MIDI input. Instruments such as an electric guitar will be connected via an analog input. Synthesizers, electric drums, and 808 drum machines can be connected via a MIDI or analog input."

      "content": "Know what tools you need to edit audio. You need to understand a few terms and tools before you start editing audio: Audio Clip: An audio clip is a file that contains audio. This could be an MP3, a song, a voice recording, audio taken from a movie or video (a sample), or a sound effect. Digital Audio Workstation (DAW): A digital audio workstation is the software you use to edit audio. It has all the tools you need to edit and mix audio and export it. Timeline: In a digital audio workstation, the timeline is the horizontal spaces in a track that show how audio files and waves progress over time in an audio mix. Tracks: A track is where you can place an audio file or record an audio file. Most digital audio workstations have multiple tracks that allow you to layer multiple tracks on top of one another. Playhead: When you play audio in your digital audio workstation, you will see a vertical line that moves from left to right across the audio file(s). This is the playhead. This indicates the current time in the timeline. This is the moment you are editing. You can usually move the playhead by clicking where you want to place it. Wave: Audio is just sound waves flowing through the air. Editing analog audio is the process of editing sound waves. If you zoom in on an audio clip in your DAW, you can see the wave patterns in the audio file. Frequency: Frequency is the audible spectrum of sound vibrations humans can hear. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). The low-end frequencies produce low bass tones. High-end frequencies produce higher treble frequencies. MIDI: MIDI is another type of audio file. Rather than analog waves, MIDI files use digital data to indicate when song notes are played, the volume or dynamics they are played, and the voice (or instrument) these notes play. Mix: When editing multiple tracks, the mix refers to the overall sound of all tracks playing together at the same time. Dynamics: Dynamics refers to the volume differences between the loud and quiet parts of an audio clip or mix. Clipping: Clipping is when audio gets too loud for the audio equipment, and it causes the audio to distort. Mono: Mono is an audio clip or mix that is produced for one speaker. If played on a stereo system, the same sound will come out of both speakers. Stereo: Stereo is an audio clip or mix that is produced by two stereo speakers. There are usually slight variations in the left and right speakers. This simulates spatial sound between the two speakers. Panning: A clip can be panned 100% to the left or right speaker, somewhere between the two, or directly in the center."
