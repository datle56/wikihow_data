      "content": "Ask for 1-2 free nights and offer to post 4-5 incredible reviews. This strategy works better if you have a large social media following. However, it’s worth a shot even if you’re not an influencer. The secret is to target the right hotel chains. Go for a small- to medium-sized hotel, preferably abroad. [1] X Research source Foreign hotels will be more open to your reviews because it’s harder for them to market themselves in your country. Contact the hotel and say something like, “I’m a small travel blogger looking to stay in Bali and promote local hotels like yours. Would you be willing to provide me with a free room on the 29th? In exchange, I’d post rave reviews on all my social media accounts as well as sites like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Facebook.” Aim for an audience of 2000 followers/subscribers/unique viewers per month to boost your odds at a free stay.

      "content": "Loyalty programs reward you for staying with the same hotel chain. The benefit of hotel loyalty programs is that they’re usually free to join! As you repeatedly book stays, you’ll accumulate loyalty points, which you can redeem for free nights. You may also get perks like free wifi, complimentary food and drink, and upgraded rooms. [3] X Research source [4] X Expert Source Laura Krueger & Michelle Donson Travel Specialists Expert Interview. 30 September 2020. Two of the most popular loyalty programs are Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy. [5] X Expert Source Laura Krueger & Michelle Donson Travel Specialists Expert Interview. 30 September 2020.

[6] X Research source Likewise, with Marriott Bonvoy, you earn 10 points per dollar spent on a room, and free hotel rooms start at 5,000 rewards points or $55 plus 3,500 points."

For instance, Hotels.com offers a free night after you book 10 nights through their site. [12] X Research source Expedia offers 2 rewards points for every $1 you spend on hotels. You can redeem your points at a rate of 140 points per $1. [13] X Research source Hotels.com averages the value of your 10 bookings to determine the value of your free hotel night."

For instance, Choice Hotels will give you a $50 gift card or comp your room (depending on where you live) if you book a room through them but find another site offering an identical room at the same hotel for a lower price. Take your gift card and apply it to an extra night, or try this strategy multiple times to basically let their price guarantee pay for your room! [14] X Research source"

You can also use this strategy during peak travel times when it's tough to use your flier points to book a flight. American, United, JetBlue, and Southwest allow you to use frequent flyer miles for hotel rooms. [16] X Research source Frequent flyer miles are valued at about $0.01 per mile."

      "content": "Some airlines offer free hotel rooms for flights with long international connections. This service is called STPC (stopover paid by carrier). Not all airlines make it obvious that they offer STPC, so be sure to ask about free rooms when you book an international flight with a 6-24 hour stopover. [17] X Research source STPC is usually only available for business or first-class passengers. Airlines that offer STPC include Air Canada, China Southern, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Finnair, Iberia, Icelandair, Korean Air, Qatar Airways, Sri Lankan Airlines, Thai Airways, TAP Portugal, and Turkish Airlines."

[20] X Research source Be polite and courteous, and avoid demanding a free stay. Instead, see what the staff offers you–it might be a discount, an upgrade, or a voucher for free rooms. Don’t make up a complaint in order to get a free room. You might get a staff member in trouble."

Let the hotel know about your special event when you check-in, or put the event in the “special instructions” or “comments” section when you book your stay. You’re not guaranteed a fully free extra night, but you’ll likely get at least an upgrade. Try this strategy during a travel off-season so that the hotel won’t be totally booked."
