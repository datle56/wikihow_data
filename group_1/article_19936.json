      "content": "Find out if the fabric is colorfast. Before submerging the hat in water, you need to see if the dye will run. Dip a white cloth in warm water and rub it on a small, inconspicuous area of the hat. If the dye comes off on the rag, don’t wash or submerge the hat. If it doesn’t, the item is colorfast and can be washed. [1] X Research source Buy a new hat instead of trying to wash one that isn’t colorfast; the hat will likely be ruined if you do try to wash it."

      "content": "Let the hat soak in the soapy water for up to 4 hours. Dip the hat in the sink or bucket and swirl it around several times. Then, let it soak in the water for a few hours to allow the soap to break down the sweat and oil in the fabric. You can stir the water or swirl the hat around every hour or so, if desired.

Then, place the hat near a fan or open window so it gets as much air flow as possible. Let it dry fully before wearing it again, which could take up to 24 hours. [8] X Research source Avoid letting the hat dry in direct sunlight, which could fade the color. Don’t dry the hat in the clothes dryer either, which may shrink or damage the hat.

Alternatively, you could look up the information on the Internet or through the manufacturer’s website. If it’s made of jersey mesh, cotton twill, or a polyester blend, you can clean it in the dishwasher. If it’s made of wool, however, you shouldn’t use this method as the hat may shrink. [10] X Research source If the hat has a brim made out of plastic, you can use the dishwasher. But, if the brim is made out of cardboard, you should spot-clean the hat instead to prevent water from damaging the brim."

If you put the hat on the bottom rack, it may become too hot and the fabric could shrink or the plastic brim could get warped. For best results, place a “cap washer” or “cap cage” underneath your baseball hat to help it keep its shape. You can find these online or at hat stores.
