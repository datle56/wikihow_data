To the right of the lines that connect the head and small circle, draw two skinny curved lines to make the arms. At the end of those lines, draw a small rounded rectangle and a larger circle. Repeat these steps on the left side. If you’re having trouble with drawing the hands, artist Claire Wentzel suggests practicing until you get it right. By practicing repetition, the process will get easier over time. From the smaller circle you drew in the first step, draw two sets of skinny lines that curve into each other (one for the left leg and one for the right) and make sure to leave a gap. Then, draw two large ovals for the feet."
