On Snapchat, a Best Friend is someone you send a lot of snaps to but isn’t your #1 Best Friend (or Bestie, as Snapchat calls it). When you see the 😎 emoji next to a Snapchatter’s name, it means one of your Best Friends is also one of their Best Friends. [1] X Research source Why is it important? Essentially, the 😎 emoji is an easy, visual way to show that you and one of your contacts send a lot of snaps to the same person. This lets you see how your social circles are interconnected and could encourage you to snap this person more often, too!"

      "content": "You may see a string of emojis next to your friend's name including 😎. Depending on how often you snap someone and who else you (and your Snapchat friends) interact with the most, you might end up with multiple emojis that describe your relationship. Some common ones people see include: 😎💛: This person is your Bestie or #1 Best Friend (💛) and you have a mutual Best Friend (😎) that you both send lots of snaps to. 😎😊: This person is one of your Best Friends (😊) and you have another mutual Best Friend (😎) that you both snap a lot. 😬😎: You and this person share a Bestie (😬) and you also have another Best Friend in common (there’s a good chance you two run in the same circles IRL)."

No, you can’t see that information in the Snapchat app. However, you can do some sleuthing to find out—if you’re determined to know, you’ll have to ask who your 😎’s friend’s Best Friends are and compare that list to your own Best Friends. Anyone who overlaps could be your mutual!"

      "content": "Will the 😎 go away if you use Snapchat less? Yes, your friendship emojis can change (or even disappear) based on you and your friends’ Snapchat usage. For example, the 😎 emoji may disappear if either you or your friend stop snapping your mutual Best Friend as often. Another easy example is the Snapstreak emoji (🔥)—if you and your friend don’t snap each other every day, your fire emoji will vanish."

Over text and on other social media platforms, the 😎 emoji represents all things “cool” and conveys a confident attitude (and maybe a bit of cockiness, too).

This way, you can see how your social circles are intertwined and find new mutuals with your friends. [19] X Research source Frequency is the biggest determining factor for which emoji appears, but some other factors include how long you’ve been friends and other Snapchatters you interact with. The friendship emojis are only visible to you, allowing you to manage your friends privately. Fun fact: When Snapchat first launched, everyone had 3 Best Friends that were publicly displayed on their profile. However, the system was changed to the current friendship emojis after users expressed privacy concerns."
