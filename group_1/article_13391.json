Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is an organic marketing strategy driven by the keywords that search engines like Google and Bing use in their algorithms to populate search results. Search engines rank websites based on the keywords relevant to the search. [1] X Research source Use search engines like Google to look at search terms that are used by companies or products that are similar to your own. This can be done by looking at the suggested keyword dropdown on the search bar, the People Also Ask dropdown, also suggested queries at the bottom of page 1. Make a list of search terms that are commonly used for similar products and services. Look at what your competitors use and see search terms that they have not used and utilise them. Look at the related searches when you plug in a keyword to get ideas for search terms and to modify your own to fit popular search terms. For example: Greek restaurant in Alabama, the best chicken sandwich store in New York, etc."

      "content": "Optimize your website by putting keywords in your website URLs. A URL is the address of a web page. One of the best ways to insert keywords into your website is to put them into the URLs so your pages are the top results for those keywords whenever a potential customer searches for it on a search engine. [2] X Research source For example, if you’re selling a sports calendar, the URL for your page selling sports calendar could be: “www.yourbusiness.com/sports_calendar.” If you use a more broad keyword, your page may not appear in specific searches from people. If you sell a sports calendar but do not use the word “calendar” in your URL, your page may not appear for people searching for a sports calendar. Use URLs that are easy to remember so a customer can find you again."

      "content": "Use keywords in title tags and meta descriptions of your web pages. A title tag is the name of the web page link that appears in a search result from a search engine.

Both of these are great places to use keywords to help your page rise to the top of the results of a search engine. [3] X Research source Incorporate keywords organically so they look genuine and legitimate, rather than just jamming as many keywords as you can, which can drive people away from your page. For example, if you owned a beauty salon, you would want the meta description of your salon’s website to include words like “beauty, salon, treatments, facials, and manicures” included in your meta description to help your website appear in Google searches. Use Google and Bing webmaster tools to revise your title tag and meta descriptions. A title tag is also the hyperlink that people will click on to go to your page."
