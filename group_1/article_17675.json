      "content": "Be assertive and confront your partner directly about their sexting. Ask them what’s going on and be open about where you’re coming from.

      "content": "Tell your partner how their sexting made you feel. Talk about yourself and your experience instead of what your partner did wrong to open the conversation. It’s hard to stay calm during talks like these, but try to express your feelings and ask questions from a place of curiosity and openness.

Wait until you’re in a good headspace to have this talk. You’ll solve the problem more effectively when you’re feeling calm rather than angry or upset. Open with something like, “I feel very uncomfortable about your relationship with Robert. Let’s talk.” or “I’m feeling incredibly upset and hurt. I want to understand why this happened. Can we talk?”"

[10] X Research source An apology might go like this: “I’m sorry I ever sent those messages, and I’m sorry that I hurt you. I want to stay with you and fix our marriage.” “I can’t apologize enough for what I did. I wish I had never texted them, and I’m sorry for the pain and anger I’ve caused you.
