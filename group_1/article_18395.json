Your test results are in, you need to come in immediately.” “I have your money, please just let my brother go!” “Yes, I’d like an extra large pizza with mushrooms, sausage, peppers, and onions, please.” “Tell Marty I want his full payment by noon tomorrow or he’s done.” “The job is done, but there’s blood everywhere.

Alfred isn’t available right now.” “You’ve reached the voicemail of Harry, please leave a message after the beep.
