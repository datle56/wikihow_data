      "content": "Create an account if you haven't already. If you're new to tax preparation software, you must open an account to use the software to file your taxes. If you have a relatively low income, you may qualify to use commercial tax preparation software, such as TurboTax or H&R Block, for free. [1] X Research source To create your account, you'll have to answer a few basic questions to confirm your identity. If you've previously used a tax preparation service and move to the free file version, you may have to create a new account. That would mean your tax information from previous years would not be imported."

      "title": "Complete your federal return.",
      "content": "Complete your federal return. If you want to e-file only your state taxes using tax preparation software, you must first go through the motions of completing your federal return. This is because the tax preparation software uses information from your federal return to complete your state return. You can't do your state return first. You don't have to actually file your federal return, but you do have to provide the information. Before you start working on your returns, make sure you have all the documents you'll need with information about your employer, your income, and any other sources of income you received through the year. Most states model their tax system closely on the IRS rules, which is part of the reason that tax software is designed to process federal and state returns together and in order."

Once you complete your federal return, the tax preparation software gives you the option of selecting the state for which you want to prepare and file a tax return. It may already have a state selected as a default based on the personal information you provided for your federal return.

[5] X Research source Look for a link on the website of the state's department of revenue to \"e-file\" your taxes, or file your taxes online. You'll typically start under an \"individual\" tab, then look for \"filing\" or similar. If you own your own business and operate it as a sole proprietorship, you're still filing individual taxes rather than business taxes. Once you've created an account, you can file your taxes directly with your state's department of revenue for free.
