      "content": "Sadly, you can't clear your history without deleting your Spotify account. Although it used to be possible to remove songs from your recently played list, Spotify removed this feature in early 2022. But don't worry—while you can't delete your history, there are two easy ways to keep it private: Hide your activity from others. By default, friends using Spotify on their computers (PC, Mac, and Chromebook) will see what you're listening to in their Friend Activity tabs. They'll also see your recently played artists on your profile. To disable these social features, see Hide Your History on Mobile and Hide Your History on a Computer . Turn on Private Session to keep your history clear. When Private Session is enabled, music and podcasts won't appear in your history at all, nor will they be shared with your followers or appear on your public or private profile. See Listening Privately to learn how to use this feature."
