During the dyeing process, and the bleaching process that often takes place before dyeing, it's likely that dye will transfer to your clothing. Due to this, you should only wear clothes when bleaching or dyeing that you don't mind getting ruined. If you don't have any clothing that you're OK getting dye on, you should consider using a poncho or a hair styling cape to cover yourself and block any spattered or dripped dye. However, this solution does not guarantee that dye won't somehow still get onto your clothes. [1] X Research source"

Natural blondes may be able to apply hair dye directly to their hair with good results, but if your hair is tinted or tinged, like strawberry blonde, for example, this will influence the outcome of the dye job. It may help you to use a hair color wheel to better determine how much the base color of your hair will affect your dye job.

Because of this, you may want to consider having your hair bleached by a professional or by a friend/relative who has previous experience bleaching hair. Hair bleach should be mixed and applied according to its directions. Generally, this involves mixing a powder with water in a squirt bottle or bowl, and applying the mixture directly to your hair with either the squirt bottle or a brush applicator. Avoid washing your hair before bleaching it. That oils that build up in your hair naturally over time will help protect your hair from the harshness of the bleach. To this end, you may want to soak your hair in coconut oil over night before bleaching. [5] X Research source You may want to give you hair as much as five to seven days without washing before attempting to bleach it. Dye can also be harsh on your hair. To prevent your hair from getting damaged, you may want to wait one to three months if you've recently dyed your hair before attempting to bleach. If you have a lot of hair or especially thick hair, you'll likely want to buy a second bleach kit. This way, if you run out of bleach partway through the process, you have more bleach on hand.

For most kinds of bleach, it is recommended that you cover you head with a shower cap while the bleach sets in. This way the bleach saturates your hair, resulting in a uniform end color.

You should wait about two weeks between each application of bleach."

For the brightest green, a straight green dye will likely be your best bet. Follow the directions on the packaging for best results. Generally, you'll want to use the mixing bowl that came with your dye to prepare it. [9] X Research source If your dye did not come with a mixing bowl, a plastic bowl or small tupperware container may work. However, the dye may permanently stain your mixing container, so only use those you're comfortable staining/tinting green. [10] X Research source You may want to blend two separate dyes, one blue and one green, together to modify the hue of your green dye. The more blue you add, the more the intensity of your green will be diminished. [11] X Research source Be thorough in your dye mixing, whether mixing a single color or two separate ones. If you fail to mix the dye thoroughly throughout, your hair may end up being dyed inconsistently."

[12] X Research source Have whoever is applying the dye massage the product into your hair to ensure the dye saturates your hair and dyes it consistently throughout. Be sure whoever is applying the dye to your hair is wearing latex, rubber, or vinyl gloves when dyeing. Hair dye can sometimes take many days to fade from your skin. To prevent dye from staining the skin along your hairline or around your ears, you may want to spread petroleum jelly or lip balm along these parts. This will make the dye easier to remove."

To prevent damage to your hair from frequent exposure to chemicals, you should give your hair two weeks minimum before bleaching. For color applications, you may want to wait as long as a month. Each person's hair is different, and some hair holds up to chemical treatments better than others. If you are unsure your hair is ready for another treatment, you may want to consult a professional.
