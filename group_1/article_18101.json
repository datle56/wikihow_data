      "content": "Keep in mind that you don't have to forgive your parent if you don't want to. Forgiveness is a personal choice, to be made for personal reasons, and on your own timeline. Consider your feelings, and whether you feel ready and willing to forgive. Don't let others push you into forgiving if you aren't ready. It's okay if you aren't ready to forgive them yet. You're allowed to take your time. [1] X Research source Take care of yourself and assess the damage first. Then consider forgiving once you feel ready. It's okay if you never want to forgive them. Forgiveness should be done freely, not because you feel like you have to. Everyone heals differently, and it's okay if forgiveness isn't part of that process for you. Focus on what works best for you."

      "content": "Forgive your parent for the right reasons. Forgive your parent for your own benefit, not theirs. Do it so you can reclaim your life and let go of any poisonous anger you’ve been holding onto. Forgiveness is a personal choice to let go of the hurt they caused, and not let it damage you anymore. Here are some examples of bad reasons to forgive: Because someone else said you should. Forgiveness is deeply personal. Your abuser may manipulate others into trying to get you to forgive them. People with no experience of abuse may naively suggest that you re-establish the relationship, not realizing that this could be terrible advice. Because you think it will fix things. Your actions won't turn your parent into a better person. They would need to make that choice themselves. Don't expect an apology or a better relationship to automatically happen after you forgive them. [2] X Research source Because you hate being upset. Difficult feelings are important to process. You need to experience your anger, sadness, fear, and other tough emotions on your own timeline. Don't push yourself to forgive if you aren't ready yet. [3] X Research source It's not healthy to bottle up your feelings or sweep them under the rug. Because you think you owe them. Just because they have changed (or \"changed\"), or they now need someone to care for them, doesn't erase all the harm they caused. You don't owe someone your forgiveness. If someone abuses you, that erases any obligation you have to them."

      "content": "Know that forgiving someone does not mean condoning their behavior, or trusting them. Forgiving your parent doesn’t mean you think their abusive behavior was OK, and it doesn’t mean you would let it happen again. Let go of your anger and bitterness, but don’t downplay how the abuse affected you. [4] X Research source Similarly, you shouldn't put yourself in harm's way in the name of forgiveness. Keep yourself safe, especially if they've shown that they are willing to hurt you again. [5] X Research source Nobody deserves to be abused, and that includes you. Protect yourself first. Worry about forgiveness after you are safe (physically and emotionally)."

      "content": "Set limits on your relationship with your parent. You do not have to have a relationship with your parent if you do not want to. If you do want to keep your parent in your life, do it on your own terms. Decide how often you’ll see them and let them know how you want to be treated. Be prepared to defend your boundaries or distance yourself if your parent challenges you. [6] X Research source For instance, if you’ve told your verbally abusive mother that you won’t talk to her if she starts saying cruel things, you may have to hang up the phone on her a few times before she starts respecting your wishes. If your parent refuses to put any effort into changing the relationship, your best option may be to cut them off. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to make them part of your life. [7] X Research source Even if your abusive parent is elderly, you are not obligated to take care of them. Work with other family members to make other arrangements for them. It’s important that you protect yourself, even if your parent tries to make you feel guilty. Abuse negates responsibility. You have no responsibility to care for your abuser. Reader Poll: We asked 309 wikiHow readers how they approached setting boundaries with an alcoholic parent, and 60% of them said that they limited the parent’s involvement in their life. [Take Poll] Alcohol use can be a contributing factor of abuse, and you have a right to keep yourself physically and emotionally safe."

      "content": "Decide if you’d like to contact your parent. You can forgive your parent without seeing them in person or telling them you forgive them. Don’t feel pressured to speak to them, but know that you can have a conversation with them if you wish. Don’t attempt to have this conversation in person if you feel unsafe around your parent. If your parent has been physically abusive in the past, consider calling them or sending an email instead. If you have a therapist, speak to them about whether or not contacting your parent is a good idea. The therapist can help you practice the interaction, prepare for multiple scenarios, and give you tips for practicing self-care to get through the conversation. If you think your parent will be defensive or evasive about the topic, you might also choose to contact them indirectly through another method. [8] X Research source If your parent is deceased, consider seeing a counselor to verbally process through what happened, writing a letter to your parent, or visiting your parent’s gravesite to speak to them."

[9] X Research source Try to stick to the facts here and not make assumptions or accusations. Focus on what your parent did as well as how you felt and how the abuse has affected your life. You could open the conversation by saying something like, “Dad, I need to talk to you about something. It’s always really hurt me when you put me down and call me names. I want to have a better relationship with you in the future, but I need you to stop treating me this way.”"

Allow them an opportunity to apologize or to start making amends. [10] X Research source If they respond positively and remorsefully, reinforce this by verbalizing gratitude. You may have more hurt feelings to process, or you may want to challenge some of the things they say, but save these for follow-up conversations. Of course, nothing can make up for an abusive past, but give your parent the benefit of the doubt if they try to make amends with you. Just because your previous relationship was soured, doesn't mean the future has to be the same."

If you find your parent is making a genuine effort in the present, strive to forgive them for their past faults. [11] X Research source You might say, \"I will never completely understand why you did what you did. But, I want to move on from there. I don't want the past to hold me down forever. I forgive you, and I would like us to work on having a positive relationship in the future.\" Alternatively, you could explain that you do not want to have a relationship or state the conditions under which you would be willing to have a relationship with them. Forgiveness can take time, so it's okay if it doesn't happen immediately. Make it a goal and decide how you can work toward it."

[12] X Research source Be gentle with yourself as you heal. Remember that recovery is an ongoing process that can take years.
