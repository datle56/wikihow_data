      "content": "Give your fireplace a quick makeover with peel-and-stick tiles. Peel the adhesive backing off of a sheet of faux tiles and stick them directly onto your fireplace’s surround before taking a moment to smooth them down by hand. Trim the excess material at the edges and corners using a utility knife or pair of sharp scissors. Work carefully and use as many sheets as needed to ensure that each row of tiles is straight and precise. You can purchase boxes of peel-and-stick tiles in different finishes at any home improvement center. They typically only cost a few dollars per 1 square foot (0.093 m 2 ). [1] X Research source Peel-and-stick tiles can be easily applied over a wide range of existing surfaces, including authentic tile, brick, wood, and drywall. If you aren’t satisfied with your finished fireplace, simply pull off the tiles and try out another look."

      "content": "Demolish your fireplace’s existing surround for extensive renovations. In cases where your new surfacing material can’t be applied directly to the exterior that’s currently in place, your first step will be to remove it. Use a hammer and chisel to break up old tile, brick, or stone veneers. Score the seams of wooden facades and mantelpieces with a utility knife, then pry them out using a crowbar. [2] X Research source When dismantling particularly large fireplaces, speed up the process by equipping yourself with an automatic demolition hammer or hex breaker. [3] X Research source If your fireplace already has a brick exterior, you can jump straight to installing your new materials."

      "title": "Cover an outdated brick fireplace with contemporary tile.",
      "content": "Cover an outdated brick fireplace with contemporary tile. Once you’ve exposed the raw masonry, mix up a batch of thinset concrete and spread it over the surface of the brick using a broad, flat hand trowel. Allow the concrete to dry for at least 24 hours, then apply a second coat of latex-infused thinset. Press your tiles directly into the latex thinset while the concrete is still wet. [4] X Research source Giving the brick a preliminary cleaning with distilled white vinegar and a wire brush will help remove loose mortar and accumulated soot, ensuring that the thinset and new layer of tiles will hold. Nail a piece of scrap lumber across the opening of the top of the firebox to serve as a guide when setting your uppermost rows of tile. This will ensure that they come out straight and precise."

      "content": "Smooth on a layer of concrete or stucco for a simple, minimal look. Combine powdered concrete or stucco mix with the recommended amount of water for the product you’re using. Plaster the mud-like mixture directly onto the exposed brick surround, then grab a flat trowel and work it to a smooth, flat finish that’s roughly 3 ⁄ 8 inch (0.95 cm) - 3 ⁄ 4 inch (1.9 cm) thick. Let the concrete or stucco dry overnight before handling it. [5] X Research source Use a notched trowel or patterned concrete stamps to lend your new exterior some eye-catching texture.

      "title": "Install stone slabs for a touch of elegant splendor.",
      "content": "Install stone slabs for a touch of elegant splendor. Order materials that have been cut to fit the specific dimensions of your fireplace. To install the stone, brush a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) coat of thinset concrete onto the back of each slender side piece and stick them to the rough masonry of the surround. Do the same for the wider top piece, making sure to overlap the edges of the firebox slightly on all sides. Allow the concrete to harden overnight. [7] X Research source Search for a vendor in your area that specializes in hearth and fireplace stone. Natural types of stone, such as granite, marble, slate, and limestone, work best for fireplaces, as they won’t become damaged or discolored as a result of continual exposure to heat. [8] X Research source One downside of natural stone surrounds is that they’re softer than other materials, which means they’re prone to scratching and can be costly or difficult to clean and repair."

      "content": "Introduce some old-fashioned charm with a wood finish. Measure the height and width of your fireplace’s surround and cut your boards to the appropriate size. Attach the boards to the brick base using construction adhesive. Additional accents like molded trim and ornately-carved corner pieces can help create a more lavish presentation. [9] X Research source Throw on a couple coats of paint or rich stain to customize your newly resurfaced fireplace, or leave the wood unfinished for a pleasantly rustic aesthetic. Be sure to read up on your local fire codes before you pay to have a wooden fireplace put in. In many areas, local law prohibits homeowners from installing wood and other combustible materials within 6–12 inches (15–30 cm) of a functioning fireplace. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Slip an ornamental screen or insert over the opening of your fireplace. You can find these items at home goods stores and retailers that carry indoor fire supplies. They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, patterns, and materials, so you're sure to find one that matches the style of your home's interior. [11] X Research source Sleek yet simple materials like burnished metal are versatile enough to work in almost any space. Open screen designs are meant to serve as a barrier between a roaring fire and the rest of the room. If you want to conceal your fireplace completely, opt for a screen with a solid structure."

      "content": "Use your empty fireplace to store firewood. If your fireplace is broken or no longer in use, convert it to a convenient storage solution that doubles as a chic piece of decor. Stack bundles of pre-chopped wood vertically so that the cut ends face outwards. You can fill up the whole firebox, if you have enough wood, or make a large mound near the middle and leave some open space at the top for visual contrast. [12] X Research source Moving your firewood into the fireplace itself can also help free up room on the hearth for other decorations."

      "title": "Bring in candles to provide some soft illumination.",
      "content": "Bring in candles to provide some soft illumination. Just because there’s not a log burning in your fireplace doesn’t mean it can’t still shine. Set up a series of oversized candles along the floor of the firebox, or simply stick a miniature candelabra or similar fixture inside. When lit, they’ll give off a warm, enchanting glow that’s both safer and cleaner than a traditional fire. [13] X Research source Many home goods stores sell special candle holders that are designed specifically for displaying inside fireplaces. [14] X Research source Avoid leaving your candles lit for more than a couple hours at a time. Too much trapped heat could cause them to melt."

      "title": "Fill your fireplace with potted plants.",
      "content": "Fill your fireplace with potted plants. Every home can benefit from a little extra greenery. Situate plants with lush, sprawling leaves in the back and reserve the front for smaller offerings to ensure that everything is neat, orderly, and plainly visible. Incorporate flowering species like primrose, geraniums, or African violets to add splashes of vibrant color. [15] X Research source Your fireplace may be the perfect place to show off a selection of succulents or other plants with modest foliage. Choose plants that will fit comfortably inside your fireplace, even after they reach their full size. Overstuffing it will only make it appear cramped and dense. It's a good idea to rotate your plants out or move them to an open area for a few hours during the afternoon, since they won't receive any sunlight inside the firebox."

      "content": "Make your fireplace part of your home library. Organize a few of your favorite titles into towering stacks and arrange them throughout the inside of the opening. This is not only an imaginative use of a decommissioned hearth but also a great way to display your reading material when you run out of room on the shelves. [16] X Research source If you’re handy with tools, you could even install a couple rows of shelves to turn your fireplace into a recessed bookcase. [17] X Research source Make sure your fireplace is completely inoperable before putting books or any other objects inside—turn off the gas at the main shutoff valve, or flip the corresponding switch on your home’s circuit breaker."

      "content": "Prop up a mirror to create the illusion of more floor space. Find a mirror big enough to cover the entire opening and position it in such a way that it hides as much of the hearth and surround as possible. At a glance, the ground-level reflection will make the room feel larger than it actually is, which can be useful for opening up close quarters. [18] X Research source Browse antique stores, consignment shops, and flea markets to track down a mirror in the size you need without putting too much of a dent in your wallet. You can also combine your mirror with a candle display to double the amount of ambient lighting in the room. [19] X Research source"
