      "title": "Travel to the Agamen Volcanic Island.",
      "content": "Travel to the Agamen Volcanic Island. Because it’s the third after two other large continents, you’ll get there naturally by following the game’s main questline—but not until much later in the game. However, you can get there much sooner by taking a “secret” route through Drabnir’s Grotto , a cave in the southwestern part of Battahl near the Riftstone of the Fanged. To get there: [1] X Research source Enter Battahl and travel south using the Battahl pulley platforms as far as they go. Get off the final platform and follow the path there south until you reach the cave’s entrance. Speak to an NPC named Hillaire , who’ll warn you about the dangers of the grotto. Proceed into Drabnir’s Grotto ; upon leaving through the far end, you’ll be on the island."

      "content": "Find Gautstafr near the island’s westmost campsite. Gautstafr is an older dwarf standing in the middle of the dirt road south of Windwalker’s Home . From the far side of Drabnir’s Grotto, simply follow the path to the island, and you’ll find him there clutching his back. Approach him, and he’ll ask for help curing his back pain, leading to the Put a Spring in Thy Step quest. [2] X Research source Put a Spring in Thy Step is the side quest you’ll need to complete to unlock the Magick Archer vocation, so be sure to agree to Gautstafr’s request!"

      "content": "Deliver any three wildflowers to Gautstafr. When you first approach him, Gautstafr will ask for three wildflowers—and luckily, they don’t need to be a specific variety. If you already have three in your inventory, give them to him. Otherwise, you can find wildflowers along the road near Gautstafr or in the yard by the Windwalker’s Home. [3] X Research source You can find several varieties of wildflowers, including Greenwarish, Morningtide, Noonbloom, Pitywort, Sunbloom, and Syrupwort Leaf."

      "content": "Follow Gautstafr to his home. After delivering his wildflowers, Gautstafr will invite you to his house on the northern Windwalker’s Home island (which isn’t far). Follow him, taking the road east from the campsite and north toward the shoreline. If Gautstafr’s back gives out, you’ll need to carry him the rest of the way to his home. [4] X Research source As you approach the cottage's front door, you’ll meet Cliodhna —Gautstafr’s wife and the Maister of Magick Archery (though she won’t teach you the skill yet)."

As you talk to Cliodhna, Gautstafr’s back will start flaring up again, though he’ll start searching the house for a reward to give you. Approach him while he’s doing this and offer to help him with his pain by bringing him to the Geyser Hamlet, located inside the Volcanic Island Camp to the east. [5] X Research source If you’re ready to bring him to the hot springs already, talk to him again and begin the escort; otherwise, you can take some time to prepare first."

      "content": "Escort Gautstafr to the Volcanic Island Camp. He’ll follow you the whole way there, though it’s essential to ensure you aren’t going too fast for him to keep up. Gautstafr moves slowly, but if you start outpacing him, he’ll interrupt and tell you so. Alternatively, you can carry him the whole way. To make the journey, travel east along the main dirt road leading toward the Volcanic Island Camp . [6] X Research source You’ll encounter several enemies en route to the hot springs, including two molten saurians as you return to the island’s main road, plus hobgoblins, bandits, and a minotaur along the main road itself. The quest may be easier to complete if you camp until morning, then clear out the enemies along the path to the hot springs before leading Gautstafr. That way, there’s less chance of him getting hurt. You may also see a griffin flying around the area—in which case slaying it before escorting Gautstafr can also be very helpful. To further minimize the chances of an enemy encounter, stick to the main road and don’t deviate from it as you travel."

Then, head deeper into the camp as you get close to the ballista and go up a second dirt ramp. At the top, turn right and climb a ladder to a cave entrance. Go inside until you find a wooden bridge, cross it, and enter a black stone building. [7] X Research source You’ll find the Geyser Hamlet inside the black stone building—which means you’re nearly ready to master the secrets of Magick Archery! However, the quest will only be successful if Gautstafr is alive at the end, which is why leading him to the hamlet safely is so important."

Then, she’ll offer to teach you the Magick Archer vocation—and when you’re done talking to her, you’ll officially unlock the vocation for yourself. [8] X Research source Talk to her again, and Cliodhna will give you the Spellbow’s Paradox tome , from which you can learn the Magick Archer Maister weapon skill Martyr’s Bolt . After unlocking the vocation initially, you can now acquire it for 200 Dcp by visiting any Vocation Guild in the game as well!"

Vernworth is the capital of Vermund, the first major region you’ll explore in DD2 —and the first stepping stone on the way to the Agamen Volcanic Island. From the beginning of the game, play at least until you get the In Dragon’s Wake quest, then play through that quest as follows: [9] X Research source From the Border Watch Outpost in Vermund, travel southwest through the forest until you reach the small town of Melve . Exploring Melve will trigger a flashback where you’ll fight an enormous dragon. When you wake, talk to Lennart (the fighter Maister) in the tavern and elect to go with the soldiers to Vernworth . Along the way, you’ll have to fight numerous goblins. You’ll also have to take on a cyclops; throw an explosive barrel at the water dam during the fight to weaken it. After this battle, you can get into an ox cart with the soldiers and travel the rest of the way to Vernworth (though you’ll still have to defeat more goblins during the journey). At the quest's end, you should be in Vernworth—and ready for the next leg of the journey!"

Ferrystones enable fast travel in the game, and you can use them to teleport to the location of a portcrystal—which are located in most major towns, including Vernworth. If you’re going to the volcanic island at an early level, you’ll need a ferrystone to get back to Vernworth quickly. [10] X Research source Ferrystones can be purchased from various merchants in the game, including Philbert’s Sundries in Vernworth and the wandering merchant Domingo ."

Once there, go to the large gate that marks the border with Battahl and wait for a cart to drive by—which may take a few minutes. Hop in and wait for it to go through the gate to get into Battahl for free. [11] X Research source You can jump back out of the cart once you're fully through the gate."

As mentioned above, to get Magick Archery early, you must go through Drabnir’s Grotto —so travel southwest through Battahl to the cave. Depending on your level, the grotto can be challenging; it contains cyclops, orcs, and rattlers. So, bring camping gear, a wakestone, and healing items. [12] X Research source There aren’t any boss enemies in Drabnir’s Grotto. Players over level 25 likely won’t have much trouble with the area, but very low-level players may struggle. Remember: the regular path to the island through Battahl is story-locked, so you must take this route. Once through the grotto, you can pick up the Put a Spring in Thy Step quest and get the Magick Archer vocation!"

      "content": "Avoid combat in Battahl and Drabnir’s Grotto. Since you’ll be heading into areas meant for higher-level characters, it’s best to stay out of combat whenever possible. If you can, run away from fights and steer clear of ambush points as you work your way through Battahl, the grotto, and parts of the Agamen Volcanic Island—and bring pawns to back you up when you need it. [13] X Research source Thief skills like Formless Feint , Smoke Screen , and Shadow Veil may help you dodge and escape enemies."

Similarly, saurians will attack you on the way back to the main island—so take them out as fast as possible. You may be able to throw the saurians into some nearby brine, which can help you defeat them quickly."

Then, head back to Gautstafr, agree to escort him, and carry him to his destination (rather than letting him walk there), ordering your pawns to attack the hobgoblin camp when you pass it. [14] X Research source When your pawns attack the hobgoblins, you should be able to run past—taking the right path—without fighting. Run until you can’t hear the hobgoblins, then recall your pawns. Similarly, when you encounter a Stone Golem later on, run past it while carrying Gautstafr, and don’t stop until you’re down the slope of a nearby hill. Make sure it’s daytime before attempting the quest. Rest at the Volcanic Island Camp’s inn to reset the day if necessary!"

Consider taking Mage levels to get access to healing, bringing pawns who can heal, or stocking up on healing items before you go to Agamen Volcanic Island (or do all three for extra security). Because the quest can be dangerous (and deadly) for low-level characters, healing is an absolute must."
