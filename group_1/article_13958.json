      "content": "Crouch down on the floor. Just get down on the floor while placing your fingertips, or even your palms, all the way down on the ground in front of you. You can squat, with both feet equally positioned on the floor, on your toes. You can also use this position to get a bit more comfortable on your hands and feet, and to feel more secure in your balance. You can lean forward a bit until your palms are on the ground, and then bounce back to your feet. Repeat this movement a few times to feel more stable before you begin swinging one leg around. Doing this can also help you figure out which leg you'd like to use as your \"helicopter blade.\" See which foot you'd rather swing all the way around your body, and which one you feel more comfortable crouching on."

      "title": "Put out the leg you're going to use as your \"helicopter blade.\"",
      "content": "Put out the leg you're going to use as your \"helicopter blade.\" Stick your leg out straight to the side. Your toes can be flexed and pointed up or just pointed down at the floor. Maintain your balance on both of your hands as you do this. Typically, if you're right-handed, then your right leg will swing around counter-clockwise. If you are left-handed, then your left leg will swing around clockwise. However, it may be that you feel more comfortable crouching on your dominant leg and swinging around your other leg. You'll have a better sense of what works best after you try a few times."

      "title": "Lift up the hand on the same side of your \"helicopter blade\" leg as you swing that leg past it.",
      "content": "Lift up the hand on the same side of your \"helicopter blade\" leg as you swing that leg past it. Let's say you're using your left leg. If that's the case, then swing it clockwise, toward your right leg. As you do this, you'll lift up your left arm and hand so the leg can swing past it. One trick to maintaining your balance as you lift up one arm while swinging your leg past it is to plant as much weight as you can on your hands, leaning your chest over your hands, along with keeping your hips up high. This will help you maintain your strength and coordination as you lift up one hand, then the other."

      "title": "Plant the lifted hand back on the ground and lift your other hand as your \"helicopter blade\" leg swings past it.",
      "content": "Plant the lifted hand back on the ground and lift your other hand as your \"helicopter blade\" leg swings past it. You'll have to lift your hands up one at a time so the leg can pass through, but you have to keep one on the ground at all times to maintain your balance. At first, you should do this slowly, but as you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do it so quickly that it'll almost look like your hands are leaving the ground at the same time."

      "content": "Jump over your \"helicopter blade\" leg with your other leg as the \"blade\" leg swings past it. You'll have to lift one hand, another, and then the other leg so that your \"helicopter blade\" leg can travel all the way around your body. You'll have to time it so your crouched leg lifts up while your other leg swings around so it can come right back down as soon as the leg passes through. Keep your chest forward, about even with your wrists, so you maintain your balance."

      "title": "Swing your \"helicopter blade\" leg all the way around to where you started, and keep swinging it around until you run out of steam.",
      "content": "Swing your \"helicopter blade\" leg all the way around to where you started, and keep swinging it around until you run out of steam. As you keep swinging your leg around, repeating the motion over and over again, you should avoid having it touch the ground as much as you can. If your foot touches the ground, then you may lose your balance as well as your momentum. Also, if your foot just keeps going around and around without touching the ground, you'll be able to build more momentum and will gain speed, truly making your leg look like the blade of a helicopter."

      "title": "Keep practicing.",
      "content": "Keep practicing. As you develop your skills at the helicopter, you'll be able to go faster and faster, until you've truly mastered the move and it feels like second nature. You'll be able to fall into a rhythm and won't even think about when you should lift each of your hands and your crouched leg. Once you've got the basic helicopter down, here are some other tricks you can try: Do the helicopter with your other foot out. Do the reverse helicopter, which is the same as the regular helicopter, except you'll be moving your foot back behind you and around instead of in front of you and around. So, if you normally use your left foot, instead of swinging it forward and clockwise, you'll have to move it backward and counter-clockwise. Transition into a more advanced break-dancing move. The helicopter is a basic break dancing skill, but the beauty of it is that it will allow you to transition into other more advanced tricks, such as the windmill , or the handstand."
