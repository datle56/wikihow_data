      "content": "Smoke the cigarette properly. You generally want to start out by holding a cigarette somewhere in its filter area. The filter is the portion of the cigarette toward its end that is often a different color from the cigarette itself. Don't inhale the smoke right into your lungs. Think of your mouth as a \"staging area\" for the cigarette. Put your lips around the filter area about 5 mm into the cigarette itself. The filter end of the cigarette shouldn't extend past your teeth. Draw smoke into your mouth through the cigarette. You will want to periodically flick the ash into an ashtray. Consider flicking the cigarette away for good when it has burned almost to where the filter starts. You could stop when it burns about 8 and 12mm in. Any closer and you risk burning your mouth."

      "content": "Use your fingers to flick a cigarette away. When the cigarette is almost finished, place the butt between your middle finger and thumb. [1] X Research source Take the last few puffs of the cigarette, and put it out on a wall, the ground, or the sole of your shoe. It's much safer if you do so. Never flick a lit cigarette as it could cause a fire. Roll your middle finger over the butt, so that it meets the pad of your thumb, and the butt is wedged between the tip of the thumb and the nail of the middle finger. Hold your little finger and index finger out. Flick the butt away from you. Moving your arm in the direction you wish to flick the butt, as you flick it, can help it travel further. In contrast, people usually hold their cigarette in between their ring and middle fingers in a gentle manner."

      "content": "Master some bar tricks with cigarette ash. Want to impress? How about learning a bar trick instead of just flicking a cigarette. Light your cigarette. Smoke it to the end without any ash being lost. Here's how: Straighten out a paper clip and put it all the way through the cigarette. The paper clip will prevent any of the ash from falling off even as the cigarette burns. [2] X Research source That trick Clint Eastwood supposedly did on a talk show by flicking a cigarette from his breast pocket into his mouth? It seems to be an urban legend, as the actor reportedly doesn't even smoke. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Flick a cigarette by flicking the burnt ash into an ashtray. If you smoke, you may want to at least do it with style. Smokers use their fingers to flick ash off a cigarette instead of tapping the cigarette on an ashtray. You will need to flick the cigarette into the ashtray several times while it burns. You want to flick it when the ash looks like it might fall. Hold the cigarette between the thumb and middle finger. Lightly tap the cigarette over the ashtray with your index finger. This is how you flick cigarette ashes. The process is sometimes called \"ashing\" the cigarette. As noted, don't tape the cigarette against the ashtray or you will look like a cigarette smoking novice! Don't tap ash onto carpet or the ground or any surface other than into an ashtray. You could cause a fire."

      "content": "Consider where you’re flicking the cigarette. It’s one thing to flick a cigarette into an ashtray. It’s quite another to flick it outside. Most people consider doing so littering. It can also be illegal and dangerous. [4] X Research source Flicking burning ash outside can be a fire hazard. Some people flick their cigarettes out of car windows: that’s equally dangerous because it could cause a major fire! Cigarette ash and butts ruin the natural landscape, and are hazardous in addition to being ugly. They are considered a form of pollution that harms the planet. [5] X Research source In some states, it can be a crime to flick a cigarette out your car window. For example, Indiana state police cracked down on people flicking cigarette butts out of car windows during summer drought conditions. In Paris, they might give you a fine if you flick your cigarette ash on a sidewalk. [6] X Research source"
