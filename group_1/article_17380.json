Most roller blinds allow you to change the side that the chain hangs on. [3] X Research source For example, if you have a chair to the left of the window, you may decide to hang the chain on the left for easier access."

      "title": "Determine which way you want the blind to roll.",
      "content": "Determine which way you want the blind to roll. The blind can either roll under or over the roller. Typically, the blind is positioned so that it rolls under the roller. However, if you have objects that protrude from the window, you may decide to roll the blind over the roller. This way, the blind will not be obstructed when it is pulled down over the window.

Measure the amount of blind that you need to remove. Draw a line all the way up the blindâ€™s fabric with a pencil. Cut vertically up the fabric. Reattach the fabric to the roller. [6] X Research source Measure the space one more time to verify the measurements before making any cuts to the blind. When securing the fabric back on the roller, it is important to make sure that the fabric is secured perfectly horizontally. If not, the fabric will not roll correctly on the roller."
