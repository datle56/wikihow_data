      "content": "Add \"the Disney nose.\" It's the size of a real baby nose, and it has long bridge and points up. It can be drawn any size as long as the style won't be changed."

    {
      "title": "Draw the eyes.",
      "content": "Draw the eyes. In the most of Disney movies, the main character often has large eyes with big iris and big pupils. The eye shape is more like rounded-square, with a big side and a small side, and the big side always in front, for the eyebrows. The brows are perfect, tidy, full of hair and longer than the eye shape area. Add thick, tidy eyelashes, too."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the mouth.",
      "content": "Draw the mouth. Most of Disney animations have normal lips, meaning that the lips are not too thin or full, and are equally sized. The more the mouth is stretching, the more the lip gets longer and thinner. Lips in Disney animations don't necessarily have one style, so feel free to pick your own."

    {
      "title": "Get creative with the hair.",
      "content": "Get creative with the hair. In all Disney movies including the animations, every single character had her own hair style, color and length, so pick any hair style you like, whether from a Disney character, a celebrity, or just from your imagination."

      "content": "Try to think 3D while drawing your animation. Add all details that you need, including shadows and shiny or darker hair tufts. Add any finishing touches to make it more realistic."
