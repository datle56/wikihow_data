      "title": "Gather your materials.",
      "content": "Gather your materials. To draw the Maple Leaf Flag, you will need a white piece of paper, a ruler, a pencil, a light source, scissors, and a red marker. You can also use a red crayon or pencil crayon, but a marker will give you the best coverage. Depending on your skills, using paint could be a risky decision."

      "title": "Study the proportions of the Maple Leaf Flag.",
      "content": "Study the proportions of the Maple Leaf Flag. The flag's width to height ratio is 1:2. Also, take note of the size of the red and white bands. Unlike the Italian, France, or Irish flags, the Canadian Maple Leaf Flag is divided into fourths. The red bands on the left and right each take up one-fourth of the flag. The white band occupies the middle two-fourths of the flag."

      "title": "Study the form of the maple leaf.",
      "content": "Study the form of the maple leaf. The maple leaf is so iconic, take care not to mess it up. Note that the leaf has a total of 11 points and three sections, with two points falling outside of the three main sections. The leaf is symmetrical."

    {
      "title": "Make sure your paper fits the 1:2 ratio.",
      "content": "Make sure your paper fits the 1:2 ratio. If it doesn't, and you want a bigger flag, you will have to find a new sheet. If you are okay with a smaller flag measure and mark the correct proportions, then cut. Recommended measurements are ones with which the length units can be easily and evenly divide into 4. These include 2 units: 4 units, 4 units: 8 units, and 8 units: 16 units."
    },
    {
      "title": "Divide your paper into sections.",
      "content": "Divide your paper into sections. Turn the sheet so it is in landscape mode. Lay your ruler horizontally across the width. Make three small, evenly placed ticks at the top of your paper with your pencil. This will section the sheet into four. Lightly erase the tick marks."
    },
    {
      "title": "Make the red sections.",
      "content": "Make the red sections. Line your ruler up vertically with the first tick mark from the previous step. Use your red marker to draw a line down the paper along the ruler. Color from the line to the edge of the paper. Repeat for the third mark."
    },
    {
      "title": "Find the centerline.",
      "content": "Find the centerline. Align your ruler with the second tick in the middle of your paper. Using your pencil, lightly draw a line along your ruler. Flip your paper over and fold along this line. The colored side should face out."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw half of the maple leaf.",
      "content": "Draw half of the maple leaf . Using your pencil, sketch half of the maple leaf. This will include one half-section (1.5 points), one full section (3 points), one point, and half of the stem. Try to center the leaf as best you can."
    },
    {
      "title": "Draw the rest of the leaf.",
      "content": "Draw the rest of the leaf. Flip your folded paper over and set it against a light source. This light source can be a window, lightbox, or computer screen. You will be able to see the outline of the half leaf you drew in the previous step. Trace this with your pencil."
    },
    {
      "title": "Unfold your paper.",
      "content": "Unfold your paper. You should now have two colored sections, a centerline, and the outline of a leaf. Erase the centerline completely, and lightly erase your leaf outline."

    {
      "title": "Color your leaf.",
      "content": "Color your leaf. Based on the light outline, fill the maple leaf with red. Your flag is done! Consider displaying it. You could frame your flag or glue it to a stick. Get creative!"
