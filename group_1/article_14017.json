      "content": "He calls or texts you often. If he's blowing up your phone, it's pretty likely that he misses you and still wants to be in your life. This is especially likely if there's no practical reason for the calls and texts. You're on his mind and he wants to make sure that you're thinking of him too.

      "content": "He checks in on you out of the blue. Does he ask after you every so often or randomly text to make sure you're doing okay? He's probably missing you. He's thinking about you and wondering what you're doing, so it's natural for him to want to check in."

      "content": "He responds immediately when you text or call him. If you happen to call him first, he answers before the first ring ends. Maybe he's sitting by his phone just waiting for you to call—regardless, he definitely wants to talk to you and that's a pretty good indication that he misses you. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "He's really active on your social media. If he's suddenly hitting the heart on all of your posts and leaving several comments, he wants to interact with you and probably wants to feel as though he's still relevant to you. This can be a strong sign that he misses you and misses being a part of your life. [3] X Research source If you're in a long-distance relationship, he might scroll back down to photos and posts you made before the two of you met. It's likely that he's missing you and is trying to learn everything he can about you."

      "title": "He gives you little surprises.",
      "content": "He gives you little surprises. He'll likely try to pass these gifts off as relatively meaningless—he'll mention that he happened to be out and saw that your favorite cookies were on sale at the grocery store, or he'll pick up something small and say he saw it and thought of you. This tells you that you've been on his mind, which likely means he misses you. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "He brings up good times from the past. When he reminisces, it shows that he's thinking about you and the times you've spent together. Regardless of whether the two of you broke up or are long-distance, he's probably hoping for more great experiences with you that echo the ones you had in the past. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "He wears something you gave him a lot. All of a sudden, that hoodie you got him for his birthday last year has become his favorite article of clothing. That's likely because it reminds him of you and he wants to keep you close. It's a pretty good indication that he's missing you and wearing something you gave him is a way for him to feel like you're still around. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "He's curious about your day and your plans. If he's asking about what you're doing, it could be that he wants to \"accidentally\" happen to show up there. But it could also mean that he's just really interested in what's going on in your life. That typically means that he's missing you and wants to stay a part of your life. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "He's not looking to start a new relationship. If the two of you broke up, he'll usually try to stay single if he still misses you. He might hope that the two of you will get back together. He could also simply be sending you a message that he's still available if you do decide you're interested in trying to be with him again.

      "content": "He keeps in touch with your family and friends. If he misses you, he'll likely want to ask your friends and family about you and find out how you're doing. This is a particularly good sign he misses you if he wasn't really close to them before. It likely also means that he wants to maintain a connection with the people who are close to you so he feels as though he's a bigger part of your life. [9] X Research source"

If he calls or texts when he knows there's something going on in your life, it's pretty clear that you're on his mind—and he probably misses you too.

If you still live in the same town and you happen to run into him a lot, that's a pretty good sign that he's intentionally going to the places he knows you frequent—likely in the hopes of running into you. This could be because he misses you and is willing to take any opportunity to see you again, even if it's just for a minute. [11] X Research source"

Alcohol can make people feel more lonely and also lower their inhibitions, so if he's missing you he's more likely to reach out at these times. [14] X Research source Research suggests that alcohol use might increase for people who go from being in a relationship to being single. [15] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you've recently broken up, this could be the reason for the drunk-dialing."

If he's continuing to make himself available to do these kinds of things for you when you need it, it's likely that he misses you and wants to feel like he's important to you."

      "content": "He tells you that he misses you. If he straight-up tells you he misses you, it's a no-brainer that he does. It often takes a lot for a guy to admit something like this and be this vulnerable. Trust him that he's telling you the truth—it's not likely he'd say this if he didn't mean it. [17] X Research source Even if he doesn't tell you directly, he might tell his friends. If one of his friends lets it slip that he misses you, that's a good sign that he probably does!"

      "content": "It typically takes men about 8 weeks to miss a former partner. If the two of you just ended your relationship, it's normal for it to take some time for him to process things—especially if you initiated the breakup. Typically, men spend at least a couple of weeks in denial, so it can take that long before they even recognize the loss. [18] X Research source Once he processes the loss, it's also normal for him to start craving your presence and spending time with you. That's when he'll also start to miss having you around as a part of his life. In a long-distance relationship, on the other hand, it depends on how frequently you normally communicate and see each other. If you go a couple of days without talking when you normally talk more frequently, he's likely to miss you."

If he ended the relationship, it's totally normal for you to get a little satisfaction from the fact that he misses you. [19] X Research source Before you talk to him or say anything about him missing you, make sure your heart is in the right place. If you still truly care about him and don't want to see him hurting, you might want to reach out."

      "content": "Consider the pros and cons of seeing him more often. If he was a big part of your life and you miss him too, it's pretty natural for you to decide that you want to hang out with him more often. But depending on the reasons the two of you split in the first place, it might not be a good idea to get back together. [20] X Research source If your relationship became toxic, you don't want to add any more toxicity to your life and you're probably better off not reaching out to him."

      "title": "Talk to him about your relationship.",
      "content": "Talk to him about your relationship. Missing you can often mean that he doesn't feel like he has closure after the two of you split. Having a serious discussion about the reasons your relationship is over can help him find the closure he needs. It doesn't mean he won't still miss you, but it'll make it easier to move on. [21] X Research source The next time he reaches out to you, ask him if he wants to sit down and have this conversation. You might even tell him that you feel as though the two of you need to get some closure . If it was closure he was looking for, going no-contact is a good way for both of you to move on (if that's what you want to do)."

[24] X Research source If you're involved online or across a long distance, the more emotionally connected to you he is, the more meaningful the relationship will be to him.

He wants to build that connection, which takes a lot more effort when you can't be in each other's presence every day. Commit to texting him frequently and intentionally. Engage in regular, real-time communication so that you can both be present in the same conversation at the same time. Video chatting can also help you feel more connected. [27] X Research source"
