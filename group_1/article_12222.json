The Geo Hypostasis is immune to all Geo attacks and mostly immune to physical attacks, meaning you will need to have party members that can trigger elemental reactions. One fast way to deal massive amounts of damage is to combine Pyro with Electro to result in Overloaded. You will also want a character that can regenerate your other characters' health, such as Barbara. If you do not have a character that can restore HP, then you will need a lot of food, and you will need to pay attention very closely."

[9] X Research source If you fail to destroy all three Geo pillars, then the Hypostasis will regenerate 15% of its maximum HP for each pillar remaining. Pillars that are destroyed once do not need to be destroyed again, so if you manage to destroy one Geo pillar, you will only need to destroy the two Geo pillars absorbed by the Hypostasis."
