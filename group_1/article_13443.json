They may ask if there are any major health problems in your family and whether you’ve had any past illnesses, injuries, or surgeries. They’ll also do a physical exam to get a sense of how fit and healthy you are. They may want to check your strength, flexibility, and posture.

Gymnastics requires a lot of muscle power, so you’ll need to incorporate strength training into your learning routine. Work with a coach or trainer who has experience teaching gymnasts, since it’s important to build both overall strength and skill-specific strength. They will likely focus on strength training techniques that rely on your body weight rather than resistance (i.e., weightlifting).

Pull exercises include things like arm rows, biceps curls, and back extensions. [6] X Research source"

To learn to do a handstand, start by practicing against a wall. Stand with your back against a wall, then bend down and put your hands on the floor. Walk your feet up the wall behind you one at a time, then use your hands to walk yourself up to the wall until your stomach is flat against the wall. Hold this position for as long as you can. [13] X Research source The tops of your feet should be flat against the wall, with your toes pointed at the ceiling. As you get comfortable doing the handstand against the wall, try kicking up to a handstand from a lunge and doing it unsupported. If you are uncomfortable, have a spotter help you. A lot of people who practice handstands tend to raise their head. Instead, try to tuck your neck and head in and tighten your center core.
