This helps as you can make money. They are actually still valuable! Just be sure that you perform a factory reset on the device before selling it. If you don't do that, the buyer will be really confused with weird calls and songs they may not like. You can sell them on websites like eBay or Amazon or even to your friends."

It's Halloween, so why not offer to carve pumpkins? It's Christmas, so why not make homemade ornaments for people to hang on their trees? Offer to make scrapbooks for other people. Scrapbooking is a very profitable industry around the world, and for good reason: People want to capture their memories in one place and cherish them. Offer to help people do that."

They will probably only give you change, but you could make lots, if you keep at it. Ensure beforehand that the location allows this type of activity so that you don't end up in trouble."

Tell them you'll give them a good deal for letting you mow their lawn four weekends in a row. Spice up the mowing by going diagonally instead of using straight lines. This looks really fancy and it's just as easy to do as straight lines. Of course, ask your neighbors first whether you can cut diagonal lines.
