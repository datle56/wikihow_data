[1] X Research source To protect your lungs, do not use smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco or snuff. These increase your risk of mouth cancer, as well as gum disease, tooth decay, and pancreatic cancer. E-cigarettes may also be dangerous to your lung health [2] X Trustworthy Source American Lung Association Nonprofit health organization dedicated to improving lung health through education, advocacy, and research Go to source New studies have found that some companies use a flavouring in e-cigarettes which comes from a toxic chemical called diacetyl . This chemical has been linked to constrictive bronchiolitis, a rare and life-threatening form of non-reversible obstructive lung disease in which the bronchioles are compressed and narrowed by scar tissue and/or inflammation.

      "title": "Take hot showers to clear your lungs.",
      "content": "Take hot showers to clear your lungs. A sauna or hot water shower increases the secretion of sweat, and helps the lungs rid themselves of toxic substances. Be sure to drink water after you take a long shower or spend time in a sauna because you do not want to risk becoming dehydrated. Ensure any hot tubs are properly cleaned to avoid any infections. High heat encourages bacterial growth, and although the water or surroundings may smell strongly of chlorine, it is hard to maintain bactericidal levels of dissolved chlorine gas in hot water. On testing, the bath may be found to contain high levels of chlorine, but most of it may be in a form that has little effect on contaminating organisms."
