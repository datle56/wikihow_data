      "content": "Change your sedentary lifestyle. Although weight training can build muscle mass — which consumes more calories and therefore increases your metabolism and improves your physique — this cannot be viewed as getting rid of excess tissue in a specific spot. You’ll need to be more active throughout the day and do some type of cardiovascular exercise. [3] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. Simple changes like walking instead of driving or taking the stairs instead of the elevator can help you burn calories and fat. Consider wearing a pedometer to count how far you walk in a day."

      "content": "Do cardio most days. Combining weight training with cardiovascular exercise and a healthy diet can help you get rid of excess body fat, including in the chest area. Sensible weight loss is one to two pounds per week. Doing some type of exercise or activity five to six days a week can help you meet overall weight loss goals and get rid of excess breast tissue more quickly. [4] X Research source Do least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity every week. Aim for at least 30 minutes of daily cardio to reduce breast tissue. Break up your workouts up into manageable sections if you’re just starting. For example, try two 15-minute workouts. Choose activities that challenge your body and that you enjoy. It may take a little trial and error to find what works and what you like. Consider activities such as walking, jogging or running, rowing, swimming, or biking. You can also use machines such as an elliptical, stair trainer, or rowing machine. Keep in mind that team sports, running outside with your kids, or even activities like jumping rope or on a trampoline count towards your weekly exercise."

Boot camps, spin, aerobics, and cardio burn classes that use free weights and other equipment are a great way to start building muscle and reducing fat in all areas of the body. They can also motivate you if you have a hard time doing workouts alone. Sign up for a class that you do three to four times per week, with a day of rest in between. These classes often have the added benefit of teaching you proper form, which you can apply when you work out at home or on the go. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Build your chest muscles. Do some strength training exercises that can help boost your chest muscles. Adding muscle also speeds up your metabolism and helps you burn more fat, which may reduce the amount of tissue in your chest area. [6] X Research source You can choose to do weightlifting exercises such as pec flyes or use your own body weight with moves such as pushups to sculpt your chest muscles and burn excess calories and fat. Perform one set of eight to 12 reps of each exercise to start. Gradually build up to three sets as you get stronger. Keep in mind it is impossible to \"spot treat\" weight loss — that is, you can't lose fat in just one specific area. Doing a ton of chest exercises may give you really great pecs, but may not affect the fat that covers the muscle. That's why it is important to combine strength training with cardio, too."

Push-ups target your chest muscles and the smaller muscles around your chest area. In addition, they can help build back and abdominal muscles, which can help you slim down overall. [7] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 30 July 2020. Get into a plank pose. Keep your arms straight and your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Bend at your elbows and lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor. Remember to keep your abs and leg muscles engaged. Try half-plank, or knee, push-ups if you are unable to do push-ups in a plank position. To do this, start on your hands and knees instead of the plank position, then adjust so that your head, torso, and knees are all in a straight line. [8] X Research source Aim to get your groin, chest, and chin to touch the ground at approximately the same time. Your hips should not bend. Consider adding push-up variations such as military push-ups, chest squeeze push-ups, and archer push-ups after three to four weeks to give your chest a new challenge."

      "content": "Perform presses. Pressing any amount of weight up from your chest can also help to strengthen your chest muscles. From chest presses to bench presses, doing a variety of these exercises can help you define chest muscles. [9] X Research source Lie on your back on a bench with a weighted bar or dumbbells to do chest presses. Hold the weight at your lower ribs, bend your elbows, and press up until your arms are straight. Stay at the top for one second and then slowly lower your arms back to your original position. Start with 5 lbs. (2.3 5kg) and work up to more weight once your form is good and you can safely finish three sets of 10 repetitions at the current weight. This allows not just the muscles but also the connective tissues in your shoulders, elbows, and wrists to strengthen and support more weight. Try different presses every three to four weeks to challenge your muscles. You can choose from a variety of options such as incline or decline presses, neck bench presses, dumbbell around the world, close grip bench presses, and squeeze presses."

[10] X Research source Lie on your back or stand at a slight incline. Use two 5 lb. (2.3 kg) weights and hold one in each hand, arms extended straight above your chest with your palms facing each other. Slowly open your arms wide, as though spreading your wings. Then slowly bring your arms back up. You can perform flyes using a resistance band, too. Stand and anchor the band at about hip-height (try wrapping it around a column or door handle), holding one end in each hand. Start with your arms open, then bring your hands together in front of your chest, then slowly open again. Vary your flye routine every three to four weeks to challenge your chest muscles. Try incline or decline flyes, cable flyes, and even single-arm variations."

This is especially important if you’re doing so to get rid of man breasts.

[11] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview. 12 August 2020. Gynecomastia can also indicate a more serious disease such as male breast cancer. Let your doctor know why you scheduled the appointment. Give her information about when you first noticed the excess breast tissues, if you’ve had any pain, and if you’ve put on weight. Depending on the examination and any tests you may have, your doctor could diagnose you with gynecomastia or pseudogynecomastia, which happens as a result of fat deposits without an underlying hormonal imbalance. [12] X Research source Listen to your doctor’s advice on treatment for either condition. In most cases, men with mild gynecomastia and pseudogynecomastia can use diet and exercise to reduce fat deposits in their chests.

For example, eat brown rice instead of white rice. Add more vegetables to your plate than meat or carbs. Try air-popped popcorn instead of eating potato chips. If you’re looking for crunch, try carrots or cut veggies. Allow yourself one cheat day every week to keep cravings at bay and minimize the risk of overindulgence. But remember that a cheat day doesn't mean making up the extra calories you cut out during the week. A cheat day means allowing yourself a moderate to small sized portion of a food you have cut out of your diet. For example, on your cheat day, you might allow yourself one piece of fried chicken and a tablespoonful of potato salad with your green leaf salad and veggies."
