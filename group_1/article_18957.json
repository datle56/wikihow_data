If you want to get honeycomb without damaging the bees, here's what you'll need to do: In Java Edition, place a carpet over the campfire; the smoke will flow through the carpet, but the bees will be safe. In Bedrock Edition (Windows 10, consoles, etc.), don't use a carpet—instead, put the campfire in a hole below the hive and surround the hole with a fence . You'll also need to extinguish the campfire after harvesting the honeycomb (which is not necessary in other versions)—you can do so by placing a water block on the campfire."
