Repeat this movement 8 to 10 times."

Release the breath completely out through your nose, allowing the body to shrink inward with your navel gently drawing toward your spine. This is a loud breath that may clear your nostrils, so you might need a tissue. Repeat for several minutes at a steady pace that is comfortable for you."

      "content": "Create a peaceful environment. Breathing exercises can help you gain control in stressful situations, but the best place to practice the techniques is in a safe, calm environment.

      "title": "Avoid injury.",
      "content": "Avoid injury. Always try to adopt a relaxed posture when doing breathing exercises, and be careful not to strain yourself. Practice at a comfortable pace – if you are struggling to hold a breath for a certain count, hold it for a lower count at first and gradually work up to it. If you begin to hyperventilate or feel lightheaded, slow down your breathing and stand up slowly. If you have arthritis of the neck or any other spinal condition, check with your doctor before trying any exercises that involve moving or bending the neck or back. Never experiment with holding your breath as long as you can - this can be extremely dangerous, even fatal."
