On the other hand, wearing a bra that’s too big can make your breasts hang loosely and look smaller as a result. Here's how to find a better bra and wear it correctly: [2] X Trustworthy Source University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment Program in the University of Kentucky devoted to scientific research and public education Go to source Ditch whatever idea you have of your “size.” Bra sizes aren’t standardized, so what fits you really well in one brand might be off in another. Check out modern lingerie companies that offer different styles of bra based on your breast shape (not just one style of bra cup/shape). Focus on the width of your band, not your cup size. Cup size is important, but only if you know whether you're a 32 or a 36. Don't wear your bra on the tightest hooks unless that's how it fits best. Otherwise, hook your bra in the place where it feels the most comfortable. Don't ever let your band ride up your back. Make sure your bra fits the type of outfit you're wearing. Don't wear the same style bra with different tops. Some may make your breasts look smaller than they really are.

A padded bra can make your breasts look a bit bigger, and a push-up bra can take that to the next level. If you're in the market for a padded or a push-up bra, you should get fitted before you try one on, just as you should do with a real bra. Just make sure you don't get a bra that is so obviously padded that you've increased the size of your breasts by 3–that will be a little obvious. Avoid stuffing your bra with tissues or anything else, since it won’t look very realistic."

This creates the illusion of a bigger size, and it only requires a few brush strokes. Just be careful not to get makeup on the top of your shirt. You can even buy a makeup kit for this purpose if you're really committed; first, though, it's best to start off just using the makeup you have to see if you like the effect. If you want to give it a try, follow these steps: [3] X Research source Get dressed, bra and all. Put on the outfit you're actually going to wear. Tuck tissue or toilet paper into the front of your shirt to protect it from makeup. Apply darker bronzer or powder in your cleavage area, moving down in between your breasts. Blend this color up and outward, making a v-shape along the natural curve of your breasts. Brush a lighter shade of eye shadow or face powder, such as gold or peach, over the top half of your breasts. Use a sponge to blend the shade to create a natural and fuller look for your breasts."

Wear tops with frilly lace or patterns in the chest area, wear horizontal stripes that stretch out your breasts, and try shirts with low necklines that show your cleavage without revealing so much that your breasts actually look smaller. Wearing tops that have one color above your breasts and a different color below can also make them look bigger. Shirts or dresses that fan out just below the breast bone can also enhance the size of your breasts. Wear a dress or a shirt with an underwire and your breasts will naturally perk up. Wearing shirts that are too tight around the breasts, such as tube tops that are too tight or halters that don't quite fit, will actually make your breasts look smaller. You can also call attention to your breasts by wearing a pendant necklace that hangs in between your breasts."

Start by doing just 2 or 3 sets of 10 push-ups in one day if you're already physically strong. If push-ups are new to you, start with 2 sets of 5 and work your way up. As you become a push-up pro, you can \"push\" yourself to do even more each day. Here's how to do a push-up: [5] X Research source Start with your stomach on the floor and your hands directly below your shoulders. Slowly push your body upwards into the plank position by pushing against the ground until your arms straighten as you rise onto your toes. Lower down to the ground without letting your stomach touch the floor and lift yourself up again. If this proves too challenging, start off by doing push-ups while keeping your knees and lower legs on the floor. This is still a great workout for your pecs."

If you’re a beginner, you can start somewhere around 7-12 pounds. You can do this exercise in the gym or even at home without a workout bench. Here's how to do it: Lie on a bench with your feet flat on the floor. Hold the dumbbells just outside your shoulders, with your palms pointing towards your feet. Raise the dumbells in the air so that your arms are straight, but not locked out. Gently lower the dumbells to your sides and repeat.
