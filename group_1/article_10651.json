      "title": "Think about the application of your font.",
      "content": "Think about the application of your font. Will your font be for a specific project (i.e., a logo , poster , album cover , storefront sign), or do you want to create a font that has a broad range of applications? This will help you decide how much time (and money) you want to spend creating a font. For example, if you are designing a logo for a death metal band, you may only need to create a handful of stylized characters. However, if you want to make a font for Adobe Fonts or Google Fonts, you may need to design hundreds of characters with unique styles and weights."

      "title": "Decide which type of font you want to create.",
      "content": "Decide which type of font you want to create. The two most common font types are serif and sans-serif. However, you can find more decorative fonts like brush, calligraphy, and black letter fonts. [1] X Research source Serif fonts: Serif letters have decorative tapers or feet (called serifs) at their bases and tops of their letter stems. They are widely used in formal design and print publications, such as books and newspapers. Common serif fonts: Times New Roman, Garamond, Caslon, Baskerville, Courier New, and Georgia. Sans serif fonts: As the name implies, sans serif fonts lack serifs, and the letter thickness is usually consistent throughout the entire character form. These fonts look more modern and are used in many brand logos and digital publications, as they're easier to read on screens. Common sans serif fonts: Helvetica, Arial, Futura, and Calibri. Brush/calligraphy fonts: These fonts mimic human handwriting and look like they were written with a paintbrush or pen. They often use cursive (but not always) with connected letters and can be very formal, decorative, and fancy, or light and fun. Common brush fonts: Brush Script, Comic Sans, Lucida Handwriting, and Bradley Hand. Black letter fonts: These fonts tend to be ornate, with a medieval/gothic look, using thick letters with additional flairs and decorations. Common black letter fonts: Black Letter, Cloister Black, Old English, and Canterbury."

      "title": "Understand the anatomy of a letter form.",
      "content": "Understand the anatomy of a letter form. Letter forms have a variety of shapes and features that repeat throughout the entire font. You want to make sure these features stay consistent across your entire font. The following are some common characteristics you see in letter forms: [2] X Research source Stem: The main vertical or diagonal stroke of a letter (i.e., the straight line in a capital \"B\" or the diagonal strokes in a capital \"A.\"). Arm/Leg: A straight horizontal line attached to the stem at the top or bottom of the letter. The other end of the arm or leg is not attached to anything (i.e., the top and bottom lines in a capital \"E.\") Bar: The horizontal line in the center of letters like \"A,\" \"H,\" \"e,\" or \"f.\" Bowl: A curve that creates an enclosed space within a letter (i.e., the curved line in a lowercase \"b\" or an \"o.\") Counter: The enclosed space inside of the bowl of a letter. Ascender: The part of a lowercase letter that extends beyond the x-height of the lowercase letters (i.e., the long lines at the top of the letters \"b,\" \"d,\" \"f,\" \"h,\" \"k,\" \"l,\" and \"t.\") Descender: The line that extends below the baseline in lowercase letters (i.e., the line that extends below the letters \"g,\" \"j,\" \"p,\" \"q,\" and \"y.\") Shoulder: The curved line attached to the stem, such as the curved lines in the letters \"h,\" \"m,\" and \"n.\") Spine: The curved line in the center of an \"S.\" Stroke: Any straight or curved line in a letter. Ear: A small stroke at the top of a lowercase \"g.\" Loop: The lowercase portion of a lowercase \"g.\" This can be a curve or a loop. Link: The stroke that connects the loop of a lowercase \"g\" to the top bowl. Stress: The direction of the line thickness in a serif font (i.e., draw a diagonal line through the thin part at the top of an \"O\" to the thin part at the bottom of the \"O.\") The slope of the line corresponds to the stress. Tail: The small stroke at the bottom of a capital \"Q\" or \"R.\""

      "content": "Download font design software. Adobe Illustrator is the best software for designing letter forms . Illustrator is used to create vector graphics, which is what most fonts are made of. Vector graphics maintain the same clean and crisp look at any size. Fonts need to be able to look good at any size. You need a subscription to download Adobe Illustrator. You can download it from here If you don't want to pay for software, you can use Inkscape instead. Inkscape is an open-source and free vector graphics editor that will also work. You can download Inkscape from here Neither Adobe Illustrator nor Inkscape can save the font in a font file format, but they are both ideal for designing the shapes of your letters. If you don't want to use Illustrator or Inkscape, most font creation programs allow you to draw and edit characters within the app. The interface and tools may not be as strong or intuitive as Illustrator or Inkscape."

Create a guideline for the following letter heights: Baseline: This is the line that the majority of your lowercase and capital letters will sit on. Cap Height: This is the maximum height of your capital letters. X-Height: This is the height of most lowercase letters that do not have an ascender. Ascender Height: This is the maximum height the ascenders on your lowercase letters reach. Descender Line: This line marks how far the descenders on your lowercase letters drop below the baseline. Letter widths: In addition to letter heights, you can also drag out guidelines from the ruler on the left side to mark the width of your letters. Keep in mind that lowercase letters may be thinner than capital letters, and some letters (such as an \"O\") may be wider than other letters (such as a \"T\")."
