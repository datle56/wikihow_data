      "title": "Make sure that you have the new hard drive.",
      "content": "Make sure that you have the new hard drive. Your new hard drive must be larger than the space that's currently occupied on the hard drive that you want to copy. If you're creating a clone of your hard drive, the new hard drive must be at least the same size. There are two types of hard drives to which you can copy your old hard drive's contents: Internal - A hard drive that sits inside of your computer's housing. External - A hard drive that connects to your computer via a USB cable. Most external hard drives will work on any computer, though in some cases you must format the hard drive before using it."

      "title": "Buy an adapter for your hard drive if necessary.",
      "content": "Buy an adapter for your hard drive if necessary. If you're copying your hard drive's contents onto another internal drive, you'll need a USB adapter so that you can attach the new hard drive to your computer. There are two types of hard drive connections: SATA, which has a narrow cable attaching the connector to the drive, and IDE, which has a several-inch-wide cable attaching the connector to the drive. You can buy SATA-to-USB and IDE-to-USB adapters online or in tech department stores such as Best Buy. If you're using a Mac, make sure that you get a USB-C to SATA/IDE adapter rather than a USB 3.0 version, as Macs no longer have USB 3.0 ports."

If you're using an internal hard drive with an adapter, make sure that the hard drive is firmly connected to the adapter as well. If you're using an external hard drive on a Mac, you may need to format the drive before you can store your hard drive's contents on it."
