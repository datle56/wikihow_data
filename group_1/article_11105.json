Test children’s gargling ability with plain water before using the solution. Take the gargling mixture into your mouth and tilt your head back. Make an “ah” sound to create vibrations in your throat.

You should be able to feel the liquid moving around from the vibration — almost like it’s boiling in the back of your throat. Do not swallow any of the fluid.
