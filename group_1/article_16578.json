However, there are other situations in which you can request a default judgment. You should read your court’s Rules of Civil Procedure in order to identify all of the reasons you can bring a motion for default judgment. For example, you can get a default for the following: [1] X Research source The defendant never entered an appearance in your lawsuit. The defendant never filed an answer or other response. The defendant failed to appear for trial. The defendant failed to disclose a defense. Either the plaintiff or defendant failed to comply with requests for information in “discovery.”"

[2] X Research source You need to check whether or not the defendant is in the military before filing your motion for default judgment. You must search the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act (SCRA) website to check whether the defendant is on active duty. [3] X Research source To perform a search, you will need the defendant’s last name and either their Social Security Number or birth date."

      "content": "Look for a motion form. You need to request entry of default first. Your court might have a printed “fill in the blank” form you could use to make this request. The court might also publish a sample or informational packet you can use. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Since these forms have been pre-approved, you should use it if one is available. Ask the court clerk if there is a form. You can also check on the court’s website. Always follow the information in your court packet. Each court handles default judgments a little differently, so you should always follow the court’s directions whenever they depart from the directions in this article."

In most courts, the clerk (not the judge) must enter default according to your rule of civil procedure. [11] X Research source You can put this on a separate sheet of paper with the title “Entry of Default” at the top. Sample language could read: “Plaintiff Alice T. Greene requests that the clerk of court enter default against Defendant Acme Construction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a).

[15] X Research source If you can’t determine whether the defendant is in the military, then you should explain in your affidavit why you can’t find that information.

In some courts, you might have to go onto the judge’s calendar and schedule a hearing date yourself. In other courts, you might file the motion and then the court clerk will notify everyone of the hearing date. Technically, you don’t need to give the defendant a chance to respond to your lawsuit. However, many judges want you to give the defendant a chance to respond. Read your Rules of Civil Procedure to see when you can schedule the hearing.

Try to get a complete understanding of your case so that you feel comfortable discussing any aspect of it with the judge.

For example, the judge may ask if the defendant is a minor or if the defendant is incompetent. [31] X Research source Always answer truthfully. If the defendant is a minor, then he or she could come into court and get any default judgment overturned. When addressing the court, always say, “Your Honor.” Don’t talk over the judge.

Accordingly, many defendants first show up at court on the day of the hearing on your motion for default judgment. [32] X Research source The judge may also give the defendant a chance to address the court. You might be upset—after all, the defendant never bothered to respond to your complaint.
