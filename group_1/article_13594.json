      "content": "Pick up either side of the far thumb string using your pinky fingers. You may need to bring your palms closer together slightly. Dip your hands slightly forward with your wrist if necessary. If your string is properly positioned, it should be held diagonally across your palm, looped over the back base of each pinky finger and thumb."

Lower your right hand so that your right index finger lines up with the center of your left palm. Move your right index finger under the string so that it loops over your fingernail.

The string should loop over the backs of each of your thumbs, index fingers, and pinky fingers. If there is a loop over a different finger or one missing from these digits, start over.

The string should cross twice between your palms, forming two Xs in the center. One way to think about the proper shape is a large diamond in the center connected to two triangles by its top and bottom angles. The other two angles are at your index fingers. The bases of the triangles are the parallel string segments between your thumbs and your pinky fingers."

The near pinky finger strings begin at the further X and end at your pinky fingers. Finally, the far pinky finger string is the section that runs between your right and your left pinky fingers.
