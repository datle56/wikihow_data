      "title": "Use orthodontic wax.",
      "content": "Use orthodontic wax. The longer you wear braces, the more your teeth are pulled into alignment. When this happens, your teeth shift, which causes the wires used in your braces to shift as well. The closer your teeth get to one another, the more extra wire you will end up with along the back of your braces. The excess wire can cause irritation and discomfort. If it is just a small amount of wire sticking through, you can use orthodontic wax to help ease the discomfort until you can get it repaired. Dry off the area with a cotton ball or cotton swab. Then, roll a pea sized amount of wax between your finger and apply it to the irritating wire in the back your mouth. [1] X Research source You may also want to consider using cotton balls in this area of our mouth. It may be slightly more cumbersome, but it will work until you can get some wax or see your orthodontist. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Bend it back.",
      "content": "Bend it back. If the wire is longer than is comfortable and cannot be covered with wax, you need to move the wire. Try bending the wires back with your fingers. If the wire is too small, try using a pencil eraser to move the point away from the area that it is irritating. Make sure you don't move it to a place where it will irritate another area of your mouth. Also make sure you don't bend it to the point that you pop off one of your brackets. This will cause you to need additional repairs when you get to the orthodontist office."

      "title": "Cut it off.",
      "content": "Cut it off. When you have a particularly annoying wire in the back of your mouth, putting wax on it and bending it back might not be the best method to fix it. If the wire is too long to apply wax to and too strong to bend, take a pair of sharp fingernail clippers or wire clippers and cut off the wire as close to the end as you can without damaging the bracket. [3] X Research source Make sure you catch whatever wire you cut off. You don't want to swallow it or poke yourself with the leftover wire. To catch the wire, place a tissue or cloth under your mouth to catch it as you cut it off. If you don't cut it all the way off, you may need to use orthodontic wax on the back."

      "title": "Slip it back into place.",
      "content": "Slip it back into place. Sometimes a brace wire can come loose from inside the bracket, which is the small metal or ceramic object attached to your tooth. If this occurs, or if the wire comes completely out, see if you can push it back in with your finger. If you can't push it back in, grab a mirror and a pair of tweezers. Grab the middle of the wire and bend it so you can stick the end back into its place in the bracket. If you find that it still wants to slip out, use orthodontic wax to secure it in place. To apply the wax, dry off the bracket and wire with a cotton ball or cotton swab. Take a pea sized amount of the wax, roll it into a ball, and place it on the edge of the bracket and the beginning of the loose wire, securing it in place. Although this is not an emergency orthodontic situation, still call your orthodontist and let him know what happened to your braces. He will let you know if repairs can wait until your next appointment. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Bend it back.",
      "content": "Bend it back. A ligature wire, which is the wire that is wrapped around the brackets of your braces, can come loose when you're eating or brushing your teeth. If this happens, the best option is to try to bend it back in place. Use a pencil eraser or cotton swab to push the edge of the wire back into place. If it still continues to bother you, use orthodontic wax. Dry off the offending wire with a cotton ball or cotton swab. Take a pea sized amount of the wax and place it over the dry wire, pushing it down until it covers the whole wire. If the wire has caused a sore in your mouth, rinse your mouth with salt water or a solution of peroxide and water. Do this 2-3 times a day and keep wearing the wax over the wire. Your mouth should heal over time. [7] X Research source [8] X Research source [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Clip it off.",
      "content": "Clip it off. There are times when a broken wire will not stay in place inside a bracket. The wire can also break off and no longer fit within the area it is supposed to fit. In this case, you may need to cut off the excess wire until you can get to the orthodontist to have the wire break repaired. Open your mouth, placing tissue or some other material under the broken wire to catch the part you cut off. Using a mirror to guide your movements, clip off the end of the wire with sharp fingernail clippers. If you don't have sharp fingernail clippers, you can also use wire cutters or any clippers that will cut through the wire. Just be sure not to accidentally cut your lip. Make sure you catch whatever wire you cut off. You don't want to swallow it or poke yourself with the leftover wire. You might not be able to get all of the excess wire cut off, so be aware of the sharp edge it may leave. If the edge is still irritating your mouth, you can try use orthodontic wax on it.
