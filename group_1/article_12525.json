Seawater is full of salt and great for use in the desalination process."

[5] X Research source Mix enough salt into the water so it tastes salty. Start with a small amount of salt and taste just a drop to ensure it is salty. Put the salt water into the large glass bowl. You will then need to rinse and dry the mug to ensure there is not salt residue in the mug. Once you have rinsed and dried the mug, you can put it in the center of the glass bowl in the 1 inch of salt water."

Look for a window sill or a spot on your deck outside that gets lots of direct sunlight and make sure the bowl is on a nice, even surface in the sun. [7] X Research source Place the small weight or rock on the top of the cover, right above the cup. The plastic wrap should sag in the center of the cup due to the weight of the rock. This will ensure the condensed water falls into the cup so you can drink it."

Remove the plastic wrap and drink the water in the cup. You should taste nothing. [9] X Research source This is pure, distilled water. This desalination device works by using the sun to warm up the salt water. The plastic wrap helps to trap the water vapors in the bowl as the salt water evaporates. Because the top of the plastic wrap is much cooler than the rest of the bowl, the humid air in the bowl condenses on the top of the plastic wrap and forms water droplets. Over time, the water droplets on the plastic wrap grow larger and start to flow to the center of the bowl due to the weight of the rock. As the water droplets build up, they grow heavier and eventually fall into the cup. The result of this simple desalination device is a cup of fresh drinking water that does not contain any salt."
