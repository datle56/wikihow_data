      "content": "Evening is the part of the day between afternoon and nighttime. There’s no exact scientific definition of “evening,” but in most cases it’s defined as the few hours after sunset but before the sky turns fully dark. Unlike late at night, people are generally still awake in the evening. [2] X Research source Evening hours occur roughly from 6:00pm - 9:00pm . Or, from sunset until the sky gets fully dark. The actual timeframe will vary depending on your exact location and the time of year. The sky during the early evening may still be partially lit by the sun. This is called “twilight,” and it usually lasts for 1-3 hours after sunset, depending on your exact location and the time of year."

      "content": "Night begins when the sun dips 18° or more below the horizon. This is a scientific definition based on astronomical observations of sunrise and sunset times. At night, people may be asleep or getting ready for bed. Dinners, shows, and other social events have ended—apart from “nightlife,” which explicitly takes place when most people are asleep. [3] X Research source Night hours usually last from 9:00pm - 4:00am . Or, from 1-2 hours after sunset to 1-2 hours before sunrise. The actual start and end times depend on your exact location and the time of year. The exact length of nighttime—that is, how many hours the sun spends 18° or more below the horizon—depends on your exact location and the time of year. In the winter, the sun spends more time far below the horizon, so nights last longer, while the opposite is true in the summer."

      "content": "Evening hours are usually reserved for things not done in the daytime. Most people come home from work, eat dinner, attend social events, and complete tasks that they don’t have time to do while the sun is still up. In the evening, businesses and neighborhoods might still be active as people walk their pets, run errands, and so on. During the workweek, school-aged children might spend evenings doing homework, while toddlers and infants get put to bed. Adults might do housework, cooking, or take time to relax if they’re lucky. On weekend evenings, children and adults might find time to socialize, see family, and engage in leisure activities, depending on their interests and circumstances."

      "title": "Night hours are usually reserved for rest.",
      "content": "Night hours are usually reserved for rest. Neighborhoods go quiet and dark, except for streetlights in urban areas. Most adults and children go to sleep or prepare for sleep. Businesses and institutions close, with the exception of hospitals, firehouses, police stations, and other emergency services. On weekends, some towns and cities may have an active nightlife. People may stay out in bars, clubs, concerts, and other events until the morning hours. On weekdays, most cities will have very little nightlife. The only exception is in major cities where nightlife is active every day of the year."

      "content": "“Good night” is used to say “Goodbye” or \"Sleep well.\" English speakers use it at night in both formal and informal situations. For example, children might say “Good night” to their parents, just as a dinner guest might say “Good night” to a host. Or, you might offer a quick \"Good night\" when someone is going to sleep.
