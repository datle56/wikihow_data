      "content": "Pick out your cobs. Sweet corn is the typical kind of edible corn you'll find at most grocery stores. While its peak season is May to September, you can often find it year-round if it's imported. [1] X Research source There's effectively no difference between white and yellow sweet corn aside from color, so pick whichever you prefer. Feel the cob through the husk before putting it in your basket. If you feel gaps where kernels are missing, put the cob back – no matter your end goal, you want as many kernels as possible. Avoid corn that feels soft, as this could be a sign of mold or rot."

      "content": "Blanch the corn cobs by bringing a large pot of water to a boil. Make sure your chosen pot is large enough to accommodate all the ears of corn you want to dry. Place the ears of corn in a wire basket. Lower it into the boiling water, and let it boil uncovered for two to five minutes. [2] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source You can cut the cobs in half crosswise before blanching. This will make it easier to dry them fully."

      "content": "Fill a large bowl with ice water. Place it on a countertop near the stove. Lift the wire basket of corn from the pot. Dunk it into the ice water straightaway to stop the cooling process, ensuring each cob is submerged. Leave it there for three to five minutes and move on to the next step while it cools."

      "content": "Place the corn cobs on one or two baking sheets. Once your cobs have cooled down, lift the basket from the bowl of ice water and drain it. Dry the cobs gently with a cloth or paper towel. Lay them on the baking sheet or sheets, keeping them 2 to 3 inches apart ensure they'll dry evenly."

      "title": "Leave the corn cobs there for 8 hours, rotating each ear halfway through.",
      "content": "Leave the corn cobs there for 8 hours, rotating each ear halfway through. Repeat this step until the corn cobs are thoroughly dry and feel brittle. It may take three or four 8-hour drying sessions over the course of multiple days to complete this process. To speed things up and minimize oven usage, you can turn the heat to 175 °F (79 °C) and leave the oven door closed for a single 8-hour period. Then you can complete the process by air drying them on a rack for one or two days. However, you'll need to check the corn cobs and rotate every hour or two while they're in the oven to prevent browning or scorching."

You'll know it's time when the tassels – the pieces of silk that emerge from the top of the ear of corn – turn brown and the husks are no longer green. [4] X Research source If you planted in May, the corn will likely be ready by September, depending on regional conditions. If you live in a wet climate, you may want to harvest the corn before the rain arrives for drying indoors."
