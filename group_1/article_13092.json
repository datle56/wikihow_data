      "content": "Server directories The best way to find new Discord servers is by using a public server directory like Disboard or Discadia . Search for servers with the tag \"friends\" or \"make-friends\" to find servers that prioritize meeting new people and forming friendships. On Disboard, users can leave reviews for servers. On Discadia, users can upvote their favorite servers. Use these rating systems to find servers that other people also love."

      "title": "Discord Discover",
      "content": "Discord Discover In the Discord app, click the compass at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar. This will bring you to the Discover page, where you can find servers to join. You can also check these servers out on the web by going to Discord's servers page . Try searching for \"friends\" to find servers that fit your needs."

      "title": "Social media",
      "content": "Social media Many servers have a presence on social media—mostly X/Twitter, but you might find some on Bluesky or Reddit as well. If you don't want to join a server specifically aimed at making friends, you can use social media to find the official Discord server for your favorite game or a fan community for something else that you like. These servers often have a general chat where you can chat with others and potentially make new friends."

      "title": "Word of mouth",
      "content": "Word of mouth If you have friends or acquaintances that are in active community servers, ask them if any of them are open to inviting new users. You might be able to find some really great servers that might not show up in other places, either because they're smaller servers or they're private."

      "title": "Google",
      "content": "Google You can also find Discord servers for making friends on Google. However, it's not always as refined as using the above methods for finding servers, so it may take you a little longer to find a community that you like."

      "title": "Join communities that focus on things you love.",
      "content": "Join communities that focus on things you love. One of the strengths of finding friends online is that it's actually pretty easy to find other people who you share interests with. Many Discord servers (especially gaming servers) are focused around one particular topic, so you know that you already have something in common with other people on that server. And even if the server is more general, there are almost always channels to talk about art, music, anime, TV, movies, games, and more."

      "title": "Start meaningful conversations.",
      "content": "Start meaningful conversations. Avoid sending messages that just say \"hi.\" This can come off as impersonal and could even make the other user think that you're a bot (as scam bots are a common and rampant problem on Discord). Instead, make a meaningful comment that can start a conversation. More often than not, this will involve asking the other person a question about something they said or posted that indicates you want to learn or hear more.

      "title": "Don't jump straight into DMs.",
      "content": "Don't jump straight into DMs. While it might be tempting in a busy server to contact someone via DM to have a conversation, this might actually put them off. Not everyone is comfortable having a one-on-one conversation right away, so keep your conversations to public channels at first. If the person you're chatting with seems interested in talking with you, you can always shoot them a quick message asking if they'd be okay talking over DMs. Some servers may have roles that indicate whether a person is okay with talking in DMs or not. If the server you're in has those roles, check to see if the person you're chatting with has selected one. If they have indicated that they're okay getting DMs, you can likely send them a private message without putting them off."

    {
      "title": "Don't be afraid to be selective.",
      "content": "Don't be afraid to be selective. If you are seriously looking to make friends, it might seem counterintuitive to be selective in who you befriend. However, it's important to only maintain friendships with people who make you feel safe, appreciate you, bring out your best qualities, and support you. It's very easy for not-so-great people to hide their not-so-great qualities online, which can lead to toxic and manipulative friendships."

      "title": "Accept that things might not always work out.",
      "content": "Accept that things might not always work out. While it's hard to not take it personally, sometimes friendships just don't work out, or you might try to befriend someone who isn't interested in befriending you back. While it's okay to mourn the loss of a budding friendship, it's important to respect the other person's decision as well. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Treat online friendships the same as offline friendships.",
      "content": "Treat online friendships the same as offline friendships. Online friendships are just as valid as offline friendships, and the relationships and emotions that come along with them are just as real. Avoid saying \"real\" friends when referring to your offline friends, and make sure to take the time to hang out with your online friends just as much as your offline ones to cultivate lasting, authentic relationships."

      "title": "Stay safe.",
      "content": "Stay safe. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people online who don't always have the best intentions—and this can be exacerbated by how easy it is to hide things and stay anonymous online. When talking to someone new online, don't give them a bunch of personal information (such as your real name, your address, your picture, or any other personally identifying information). While you can (and should!) get to a point where you can meet online friends \"in real life,\" you should spend a while getting to know the other person first. If someone you're chatting with makes you feel weird, creeped out, or bothered in some way, trust your gut. Learn how to identify narcissism , manipulation , love bombing , and abuse . While it's likely that you won't encounter anything this serious, it's always good to know what to look out for."
