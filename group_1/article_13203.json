      "title": "Avoid putting your empty propane tank in the trash.",
      "content": "Avoid putting your empty propane tank in the trash. Because propane tanks are pressurized, they can potentially explode when they’re compressed in a garbage truck. This means that not only is it dangerous to try to throw away your tank in the garbage, but most city sanitation departments won’t even pick up the tanks along with the rest of your trash. [1] X Research source Some municipalities have exceptions to this rule for propane tanks under a certain weight. For example, empty propane tanks under 2 pounds (910 g) can safely and legally be thrown away in the garbage. Check with your local city government to see if your propane tank can be safely disposed of in the garbage."

      "content": "Refrain from storing your old tank in a heated room or in the sun. There will still be a little bit of propane left in your tank even when it’s “empty.” This leftover gas can expand when it gets heated up, causing the tank’s safety valve to open and leak propane everywhere. Store your empty tank in a cool, shaded space until you’re able to have a licensed professional remove the leftover propane. For safety, avoid storing your propane tank inside your home, in case a leak does occur. Your propane tank needs to be stored somewhere where it will not reach 120 °F (49 °C)."

      "content": "Have a professional remove any leftover propane from the tank. There will be a small amount of propane still in the tank that can be transferred over to a new tank for future use. However, it’s very dangerous to remove flammable gas from a pressurized canister, so hire a licensed professional to remove the gas, depressurize the tank, and remove the valve instead of doing it yourself. [2] X Research source You can find a licensed professional to remove your leftover gas by contacting local propane suppliers in your area."

      "content": "Call the company you bought the tank from to see if they’ll replace it. Many propane retailers offer tank exchange programs in which you can bring your empty tank to one of their locations and have it replaced for a small fee. The cost for this type of exchange is usually around $20, which is a terrific price for not having to worry about throwing out the old tank yourself. [3] X Research source The company you bought your tank from may even offer to come to your house to pick it up from you. Some propane companies that offer a tank exchange program include AmeriGas and Blue Rhino."

      "content": "Take your empty tank to a hazardous waste collection site. Many municipalities will have designated locations where citizens can bring hazardous waste that can’t be taken to a normal garbage dump. Contact your local government’s sanitation department to find out if there are any hazardous waste collections near you. Most municipalities will accept propane tanks that are up to 5 pounds (2,300 g) at hazardous waste drop-off sites. For tanks that are bigger than this, you’ll probably need to contact your local government about having someone come to your property to remove it."

      "content": "Bring your propane tank to a refill station to refill it, if possible. If your propane tank is refillable, you can refill it at any propane tank refill station at a cost of around $3-$4 a gallon. Your propane tank should have a label on it indicating whether or not it’s refillable. If you’re not sure, bring it to the refill station and ask an attendant if it can be refilled; chances are it can be! Locations that include propane tank refill stations include AmeriGas and U-Haul. Most single-use propane tanks are 1 pound (450 g) or lighter."

If you can’t take your empty tank to a waste collection center and you can’t refill it, taking it to a scrap metal yard is going to be your best bet. Most scrap yards will take an empty propane tank, but call ahead to make sure your local scrap yard will take yours before you bring it to them. [4] X Research source"
