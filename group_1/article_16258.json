Hold the $10 bill to light and make sure there's a faint image of Secretary Hamilton in the unprinted space to the right of his portrait. It will be visible on both sides of the bill. [1] X Research source Fake: Counterfeit bills do not have a watermark when held to a light that is visible on both sides. The watermark portrait usually does not match the portrait on the bill either. [2] X Research source"

On authentic $10 bills, the numeral 10 in the lower right-hand corner changes color from copper to green when tilted back and forth. This color shift is even more dramatic on new-series bills.

A second, smaller metallic red torch is printed on the lower right-hand side of his portrait. [7] X Research source Fake: Counterfeit bills usually cannot reproduce the details and crispness of genuine bills, so the images may look blurred, dull, or flat. [8] X Research source"

The image of the United States Treasury building on the back of the bill will also be taken from the front of the building, with the blank space surrounding the building. [13] X Research source Fake: Counterfeit bills include portraits that look lifeless and flat. The details merge into the background, which is usually too dark or mottled. [14] X Research source On bills issued from 1990 to 2000, Secretary Hamilton’s portrait features an oval border.

Additionally, real money has a distinct texture that is slightly rough to the touch, and it’s designed to feel crisp with age. [23] X Research source Fake: Counterfeit bills are typically made from regular paper, which becomes torn and soft with age. They may include red and blue fibers printed on the paper, but they are not embedded in the paper itself. [24] X Research source"
