      "content": "Begin with dry hair that hasn’t been washed in 1 to 2 days. For best results, wait to braid your hair until it has been a day or so since you last washed it. If your hair gets really greasy between washes, try using dry shampoo . Before you begin to braid, brush your hair to remove any tangles. [1] X Research source Dry shampoo will also give your short hair a bit more texture, which makes it easier to grip as you braid it. If your hair is too clean, the strands of the braid may easily slip out and come undone."

Use the side of the part with the most hair to make your braid, and use the hair in the front to create your initial 3 strands. [3] X Expert Source Ndeye Anta Niang Professional Hair Stylist & Master Braider Expert Interview. 10 January 2020. Make each strand about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. Hold each strand of hair between separate fingers so they don’t get mixed up. [4] X Research source For example, the first strand could go between your thumb and forefinger, the middle strand could go between the forefinger and middle finger, and the last strand could go between the middle finger and ring finger. The beginning of any French braid resembles a normal 3-strand braid."

Cross it over the middle strand of hair, so that it becomes the new middle strand. [5] X Research source It can be helpful to remember that the outside strands of hair will always be braided in to become the middle strand. You’ll never cross an outside strand over the entire braid to mix with the other outside strand."

Keep the 3 strands of hair separate, and take a moment to make sure they are all secured between your fingers so you don’t accidentally drop a strand. Pass the back strand over the middle strand, so it, in turn, becomes the new middle strand. [6] X Research source You can make your braid as loose or as tight as you like. If you have really short hair, though, a tighter braid will help keep your strands in place and make them less likely to fall out. Keep in mind that you can always use bobby pins to tuck in any wayward strands after you’ve finished the braid."

End the braid right around where you would secure a half-ponytail. [10] X Research source While you could continue the braid to the base of your scalp, it may look odd since the other side of your hair is going to be left down. If your hair is longer than 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm), braiding to your scalp might create a cute look, but very short hair may look weird."

To keep the braid from sticking out from your head, gather about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of hair from underneath and around the end of the braid. Secure the elastic tie around that hair and the braid so they’re combined together. [11] X Research source Choose a hair tie that matches your hair so it will blend in. You could also place several bobby pins across the end of the braid to secure it in place rather than using an elastic tie."

Doing this adds volume to your braid. Try to keep each section even so that it looks uniform all the way down. [12] X Research source If your hair is really short and you’re worried about the sections coming undone if you tug them, you can simply place your fingertips over the braided section and gently shake them back and forth. This should create a little bit more volume without compromising the braids. However, it may also create some frizz. [13] X Research source"
