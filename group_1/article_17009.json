If your provider gave you two separate devices, the modem is the one connected to the wall jack—the Wi-Fi router will be the other device. If you (or someone else with access to the router) changed the router's default password (and this is pretty common), the password on the router sticker won't work.

If you've been unable to obtain your router's password under any of the conditions outlined by the previous methods in this article, your Wi-Fi password is unrecoverable and you'll need to reset your router to its factory settings. Restoring the router to factory settings won't tell you the current password, but it will change the router's password back to the factory password, which is printed on the bottom or back of the router. Resetting your router will also disconnect every item you have connected to the router—this means all devices connected to it will need to reconnect.
