      "title": "Wear a white peasant-style blouse.",
      "content": "Wear a white peasant-style blouse. Traditional blouses are relatively high-cut, but low-cut peasant blouses are also popular at Oktoberfest. Don't choose anything with buttons, and try to avoid blouses with decorative designs. You may be able to buy something like this in a department store, but it can be tough to find something plain enough (without buttons and designs) [1] X Research source If you don't have any luck, try searching online or at a costume shop. If you're shopping online, do so in advance and confirm the return policy before making a purchase."

      "title": "Wear a long dress with a sleeveless top over the blouse.",
      "content": "Wear a long dress with a sleeveless top over the blouse. A traditional dirndl is a specific type of dress with a full skirt and a low, sleeveless top, similar to what you would find on overalls. It is worn over the white blouse. Traditional dirndls extend to the ankles, but shorter lengths are available. Many have a bodice-like design on the top, which is traditional, but some do not. [2] X Research source Traditional dirndl dresses can be quite expensive. You can find far less expensive options at costume shops or online. Always purchase in advance and confirm the return policy when shopping online!"

      "title": "Mimic the dirndl look with a separate skirt and bodice.",
      "content": "Mimic the dirndl look with a separate skirt and bodice. If traditional and costume options are out of your budget, you can put together something very similar using your current wardrobe. Pick out a knee-length to floor-length cotton A-line or circle skirt. Go with black, red, dark green, brown, or sky blue. Wear a laced-up bodice over your blouse. Authentic bodices are made of velvet or felt, but work with what you can find. The most traditional skirt option is mid-calf or floor-length. [3] X Research source If you can find a bodice with thick straps that go over your shoulders, that would mimic the look of a traditional dirndl best."

      "title": "Tie a white apron over your skirt.",
      "content": "Tie a white apron over your skirt. The apron, also known as a pinafore, is a key element for this costume! The apron should be white and match the length of the skirt. Tie it around your waist with a bow in the front, over the dirndl. [4] X Research source Traditionally, where you knot the apron indicates whether you are single or taken. Tying it on the right side means: \"I'm taken.\" Tying on the left means: \"I'm single and/or available.\" [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Skip the long dress and try a pair of female lederhosen.",
      "content": "Skip the long dress and try a pair of female lederhosen. While not traditional, female lederhosen are becoming popular among those who dislike wearing dresses. The lederhosen are high-cut suede shorts with suspenders attached to them. Typically, they are extremely short -- you may want to try them on before you buy them! [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a pair of white knee-high stockings or socks.",
      "content": "Add a pair of white knee-high stockings or socks. Traditionally, these white socks have a bow on them. The bow should match the dirndl. If you usually wear nylon stockings, go with a nude color that matches your skin tone, and wear the white socks over your nylons. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear dark-colored loafers, clogs, or Mary-Jane style shoes.",
      "content": "Wear dark-colored loafers, clogs, or Mary-Jane style shoes. These kinds of low-heeled shoes are the traditional look. You can wear high-heels if you want to, but it's better to plan for comfort, since you'll be moving around a lot. [8] X Research source Other options are regular or ballet flats. Go for a black or white pair."

      "content": "Wear a blonde wig braided into pigtails (optional). If you want to go the extra mile, opt for a \"Gretchen\" style blonde wig with long blonde pigtails. You can also simply braid your own hair into pigtails, or wear your usual hairstyle. [9] X Research source"

      "content": "Wear a plain white or checkered button-down shirt. The shirt may have long or short sleeves, but it should be a button-down shirt either way. Checkered is the most traditional, but white is also popular. [10] X Research source"

      "title": "Buy a pair of lederhosen.",
      "content": "Buy a pair of lederhosen. Lederhosen are a type of traditional leather or suede breeches with suspenders attached. They usually extend to or just past the knees. Authentic lederhosen can be quite expensive, so check out costume shops or go online for cheaper options. [11] X Research source You can also mimic the look by selecting a pair of brown, black, or dark green knee-length pants. The pants should be fairly plain and not have many pockets."

      "title": "Put on some suspenders.",
      "content": "Put on some suspenders. Authentic lederhosen may come with suspenders, but if you buy them separately, try to find some that match the color of your lederhosen or pants. Going without suspenders is also acceptable. [12] X Research source"

      "title": "Add a pair of off-white slouch socks.",
      "content": "Add a pair of off-white slouch socks. Slouch socks are knee-length cotton or wool socks. Off-white is traditional, but gray, light brown, and hunter green will also work. Often, they have a tassel. [13] X Research source Many men wear the socks pulled up to the knee, but slouching them down a few inches above the ankle is more traditional. [14] X Research source Typically, men whose lederhosen stop just above their knee wear their socks pulled up, while men whose lederhosen extend just below their knee wear their socks pushed down."

The look is very similar, and will cost far less! Anything that looks similar to a rugged dress shoe will work. [15] X Research source"
