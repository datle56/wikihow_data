      "title": "Choose between rolled and steel cut oats.",
      "content": "Choose between rolled and steel cut oats. Steel cut oats are created by shredding oat grains with a machine, giving them a thicker consistency. Rolled oats are flattened, and tend to be easier to chew. They’re both healthy options, but your meal's texture will be affected by which variety you use– steel cut oats will be a little crunchier, while rolled oats tend to be quite soft. [1] X Research source Try to avoid buying oats that are pre-mixed with sugar. While they may sound healthy, sugared oats aren’t as good for you. They also tend to be excessively sweet. [2] X Research source If you’re cooking or baking, you probably want rolled oats. If you’re adding oats as a garnish or topping, steel-cut is preferable."

      "content": "Mix some oats into a cup of yogurt. You can turn that boring old bowl of yogurt into something entirely new with a few tablespoons of oats. Mixing oats into your yogurt will add a crunchy texture and a nutty flavor profile, which works well alongside the simple flavor of a fruit yogurt. Even if you aren’t a fan of the texture, you can mix a tablespoon of oats into yogurt and let it rest for a minute or two and they’ll soften into the yogurt. You can add oats to traditional or Greek yogurt."

      "title": "Add some oats to a smoothie.",
      "content": "Add some oats to a smoothie. A smoothie can provide an excellent medium for oats, since the thick texture and fruity flavors will pair well with the mildly nutty crunchiness of oats. To add oats to a smoothie, pour 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of uncooked oats into your blender before adding your other ingredients. If you like your smoothies on the thicker side, add an additional 1 ⁄ 4 cup (59 ml) of oats. Oats will naturally thicken your smoothie, so start with a smaller amount before you blend it. You can always add more later."

      "content": "Try some muesli for a different take on cereal. Muesli is a Swiss version of cereal that combines raw oats, nuts, seeds, and fruit. [3] X Research source To make muesli, all you have to do is add 4 parts rolled oats, 1 part dried fruit (of your choice), and 1 part nuts/seeds in a small bowl with some milk. The mix can also be used to top toast. [4] X Research source Use an almond or soy milk instead of standard milk if you’re not a fan of dairy. You can add more fruit if you’d like to make it sweeter."

Bring it to a boil and then immediately reduce your heat to low. Do not cover your pan. [5] X Research source This recipe will not work with steel cut oats. Make sure that you’re using rolled oats to make your oatmeal. You can substitute the milk with almond or soy milk if you want a dairy-free option."

      "content": "Simmer for 3-5 minutes based on your desired thickness. Stir occasionally while your oatmeal simmers. If you like your oatmeal to be a little thinner, check the thickness around the 3-minute mark. If you prefer thicker oatmeal, you probably want to wait a full 5 minutes. [6] X Research source"

      "content": "Pour your oatmeal into a large bowl and add your honey. Top your oatmeal with a teaspoon of honey. Mix the oatmeal and the honey together with your spoon. This will have the added benefit of helping your oatmeal cool while you’re mixing it. [7] X Research source If honey is not your thing, you can use brown sugar, maple syrup, or even calorie-free sweeteners like stevia to sweeten your oatmeal."

      "content": "Add additional toppings based on your preferences. To play up the nutty flavor of oatmeal, add some almonds or walnuts to it. You can also mix in some fresh fruit to create a sweeter dish. Sliced bananas, blueberries, and cut strawberries make excellent additions to a standard bowl of oatmeal. Try mixing in some peanut butter for a thicker dish if you’re fond of peanuts. [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Try an instant oatmeal packet if you’re short on time. Instant oatmeal packets are a simple and easy alternative to homemade oatmeal. Most instant oatmeal simply requires you to heat a prepared packet of oat mix with water or milk in the microwave. While it doesn’t tend to be as healthy or delicious as the real thing, it can be spiced up all the same with fresh fruit, peanut butter, or nuts. [9] X Research source When choosing between brands of instant oatmeal, it’s generally a good idea to buy varieties with lower sugar contents. Instant oatmeals are sometimes heavily sugared, so try to look for plain, ideally organic options that you can sweeten yourself. [10] X Research source"

Stir in your honey and set it aside for a few minutes. It should take 5-10 minutes for the yeast to bloom. [11] X Research source You can tell if yeast has bloomed by checking to see if it has thickened and expanded a little bit. Look at the edges of your bowl—if the yeast is pushing out a little bit, then it’s ready for your flour. [12] X Research source"

Stir aggressively to get the combination fully mixed, and run your spoon against the edges and bottom of the bowl to ensure that you’re not missing any chunks of flour or oats. [13] X Research source Keep an eye on your yeast while you’re doing this. It should be rising steadily, but you don’t want to take too long or your yeast could start to deflate."

After it has done baking, you can broil it for 30 seconds to give the top of your bread a crusty-brown crunch. Remove it from the oven and let it cool.

Anything that can hold at least a cup of liquid and can be closed with an airtight lid will be fine for making overnight oats. [17] X Research source Do not use steel cut oats for this recipe. They can only be cooked in hot water based on the thickness of their grain. [18] X Research source"
