      "content": "Write a friendly/polite line before the actual closing phrase. You might want to thank your reader for his or her time, or say that you look forward to her or his feedback (in a formal letter), or simply say that you miss them very much (in an informal letter). Keep in mind, the first three suggestions are formal while the last three are informal. Here are some ways to wrap up your letter before the ending phrase: Ich bedanke mich bei Ihnen im Voraus (I thank you in advance). Ich würde mich freuen, bald von Ihnen zu hören (I look forward to hearing from you soon). Für weitere Auskünfte stehe ich Ihnen gerne zur Verfügung (I am readily available should you require additional information). Ich freue mich auf Deine Antwort (I look forward to your reply). Bitte antworte mir bald (Please write back soon). Melde Dich bald (Get in touch with me soon)."

      "content": "Be aware of your audience's age. Language is constantly changing, and this is reflected in verbal as well as written communication.

In other words, writing a letter to your boss might have a different ending than a letter to the President. And writing a letter to your significant other might take a different ending than a letter to your mother or father."
