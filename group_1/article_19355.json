      "title": "Keep the area clean.",
      "content": "Keep the area clean. It’s important that you keep the waxed area clean, especially during the first few days following a wax. Sweat and dirt can get trapped on freshly waxed skin, contributing to the development of those pesky bumps. Try showering at least once a day and making sure you clean the waxed area thoroughly during your shower. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Exfoliate a few times a week to treat ingrown hairs.",
      "content": "Exfoliate a few times a week to treat ingrown hairs. Dead skin cells can build up after you get a wax, clogging the hair follicle and causing ingrown hairs. Daily exfoliation will prevent razor bumps because the hair will never get a chance to regrow towards the skin and become trapped. You can use: chemical exfoliation (coffee scrub, liquids, etc) or physical exfoliation (gloves, loofah, cloth, or an ingrown hair prevention brush). If you have sensitive skin, then go with the soft and firm bristles. Try swapping out your regular washcloth for an exfoliating cloth. Then gently rub the wet exfoliating cloth over the waxed area with your favorite soap or body wash. You can buy an exfoliating cloth at your local drug store or online. You can also try a topical exfoliating product, like a post-wax cream that contains salicylic acid. Be sure to apply the products to clean skin and carefully follow the directions on the package. Exfoliating can help prevent and treat bumps."

      "title": "Use a warm compress and hydrogen peroxide for painful ingrown hairs.",
      "content": "Use a warm compress and hydrogen peroxide for painful ingrown hairs. If you have post-wax bumps that are painful to the touch and/or feel pressurized under the skin’s surface, you might have infected ingrown hairs. If this is the case, take a warm compress and apply it to the affected area. Leave the compress on for 1-2 minutes, and then swipe the area with a cotton ball soaked in hydrogen peroxide. [2] X Research source You can use a warm compress several times to help alleviate the bumps."

      "title": "Use a hydrocortisone cream.",
      "content": "Use a hydrocortisone cream. Calming inflammation after a wax can help eliminate post-wax bumps. Dab a small amount of one-percent hydrocortisone cream on the waxed area after your procedure. For example, a pea-sized amount works well after a brow wax. Use more for a larger area. Apply a thin, even layer across the skin."

      "title": "Talk to your dermatologist.",
      "content": "Talk to your dermatologist. If you frequently get bumps after waxing, you might want to make an appointment with your dermatologist. They can determine what is causing the bumps, such as a proclivity to ingrown hairs, and whether waxing is the best way to remove unwanted hair. For example, they may suggest a depilatory or laser treatments instead of waxing. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a gentle cleanser after waxing.",
      "content": "Use a gentle cleanser after waxing. After you are finished waxing an area, gently wash it with a mild cleanser. Don’t use soap or scrubs, as both can irritate the freshly waxed skin. For example, after you wax your eyebrows, wash your face with an everyday, gentle facial cleanser. [4] X Research source If you waxed your body, use a gentle cleanser like castile soap."

      "title": "Apply witch hazel after waxing.",
      "content": "Apply witch hazel after waxing. You can soothe freshly waxed skin with a gentle application of witch hazel. Dip a cotton ball in with hazel. Then, smooth it across the area that was waxed. You can purchase witch hazel at your local drug store or online. [5] X Research source"

      "title": "Don’t apply lotions or oils after a wax.",
      "content": "Don’t apply lotions or oils after a wax. Lotions, oils, and other types of moisturizers can clog the pores of freshly waxed skin. Avoid applying these products right after a wax. If you find your skin needs extra moisture, try aloe vera gel instead. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Try a cold compress after waxing.",
      "content": "Try a cold compress after waxing. One way to cut down on the bumps some people get after waxing is by icing. Apply ice to the waxed area to help reduce inflammation. Make sure the ice pack or bag containing ice is clean so that you do not inadvertently introduce bacteria and dirt to your waxed skin. [7] X Research source You can use a cold compress as often as you like."

    {
      "title": "Wear loose clothing.",
      "content": "Wear loose clothing. Tight clothes can trap dirt and sweat, contributing to the appearance of post-wax bumps. Try wearing loose, breathable clothing after a wax. This will allow your skin to breathe and may help prevent the appearance or exacerbation of unsightly bumps. [8] X Research source For example, you should avoid wearing tights after a bikini wax. Instead, opt for loose fitting pants or a skirt."
