      "content": "Do wake-up exercises. Get your body moving by doing at least two to three wake-up exercises. Go for a short run, walk, jog, or do basic stretching moves. Exercising will raise your core body temperature and release hormones and endorphins in your body, which will boost your energy. [2] X Research source Do an upper-body fan stretch. Lie on your back with your arms outstretched at your sides and your palms facing up. Bring your knees up to your chest and roll to your right side. Your knees should be stacked on top of each other and your hips should be stacked. Turn your head to the left. Try to keep both shoulders touching the floor. Sweep your left palm in a 180-degree arc over your chest to touch your right palm. Let your head follow your arm. Then slowly reverse the movement. Repeat this stretch 10 times, then switch sides and repeat it on the other side. Do gentle crunches. Lie face up and bend your knees. Keep your feet planted on the floor. Press your palms on the floor, near your hips. Squeeze your abs and lift both of your shoulder blades off the floor. Hold the crunch for a full breath and then lower. Repeat this movement 10 to 15 times. Be sure to take a full breath as you hold each crunch. Do basic squats. Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your toes facing forward. Extend your arms in front of you, with your palms facing each other. Keep your weight in your heels as you sit back and down, as if sitting in a chair. Make sure your knees do not extend beyond your toes. Hold the squat for a full breath and then return to standing. Repeat this movement for 5 to 10 breaths."

Switch the tap to very cold water for 30 seconds, then very hot water for 30 seconds, and then very cold water for 30 seconds. This 90-second change to your shower can help you feel refreshed and energized for the day."

      "title": "Have energy-boosting foods.",
      "content": "Have energy-boosting foods. Stay away from heavy carbohydrates like pasta or bread, as these take time for your body to digest and can trigger sleepiness. You should also avoid foods high in artificial sugar, like candy, cakes, or soft drinks, as these can lead to a spike in your blood sugar, followed by a sugar crash and a dip in your energy. Instead, go for foods that will raise your blood sugar and give you energy to get through your day. [3] X Research source A handful of raw almonds are a good pick-me-up snack, full of Vitamin E and Magnesium. They also contain lots of protein to give you energy throughout the day. A bowl of Greek yogurt is packed with protein, but has less lactose and carbohydrates than regular yogurt. It will keep you full, without slowing you down or making you more tired. Popcorn is a good snack in the office that is a good source of carbohydrates and is low in calories, especially when it is not smothered in butter. Go for a salad full of leafy greens, like spinach or kale, to boost your iron levels. This will make you more alert and improve your concentration levels."

      "content": "Consume coffee throughout the day. Drinking a cup of coffee can help to combat fatigue and make you feel more alert. Try drinking a cup of coffee once every four hours to help you stay awake. You can also have other sources of caffeine, like dark chocolate. The darker the chocolate, the less sugar it contains and the most energy-boosting potential it has. Have small pieces of dark chocolate, with no added sugar, throughout the day to stay awake and alert.

      "content": "Take a 10 to 30-minute nap. Find a quiet space and take a power nap, no longer than 30 minutes. This will prevent you from developing sleep inertia, which is when you feel groggy and disoriented after a nap that goes on for longer than 30 minutes. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Naps under 30 minutes will also not interfere with your sleep schedule, allowing you to get a good sleep at night. Set an alarm for 30 minutes so your nap doesnâ€™t turn into a 1-hour snooze."

Go for the latest pop tune or an electro-dance mix to keep your toes tapping and your mind alert. Look for upbeat mixes online, some of which last for hours, and turn them up in your headphones."

      "content": "Have a protein snack. Protein stimulates a neurotransmitter in your brain called orexin. Orexin regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite in your body. Having protein snacks throughout the day will stimulate your brain and keep your body up and alert. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Go for healthy protein snacks like a handful of almonds, peanuts, or cashews. Rice crackers, cheese, and sliced turkey and ham are also a more filling protein snack. Fruit high in fiber, like apples, and natural sugars, like oranges, are also good snacks to keep you awake and alert."

      "content": "Go for a quick walk or stretch every 30 minutes. Doing light exercise every 30 minutes will keep your body and mind active, especially if you have been sitting at a desk in front of a computer. Walk to a park nearby or do a few laps around the block. More vigorous exercise like a quick run or sprint can also keep your hormone levels up and ensures you don't fall asleep during the day.

      "content": "Reorganize your schedule, if possible. Rather than try to tackle all of your tasks for the day at once, adjust your schedule so your more important appointments are at the start of your day. If you are sleep deprived, you will likely try to maintain a higher level of energy in the morning and feel burned out by the end of the day. Create a schedule where you prioritize the important tasks first, while you still have energy. [9] X Trustworthy Source University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Division of the University of Georgia focused on research and community education Go to source If you cannot reorganize your schedule, plan on a nap break or a caffeine break between meetings or tasks so you can stay awake and alert."

      "content": "Delegate your tasks for the day. If you have other co-workers or peers who can sympathize with your lack of sleep, try to delegate some of your responsibilities for the day. Explain your situation and promise an IOU in exchange for help on a project or task. This will allow you to manage any stress or anxiety due to lack of sleep, and focus on only one or two tasks for the day. [10] X Research source"

Going through the motions of your day will likely make you more tired and drowsy. Instead, go for a quick walk outside or have a coffee break with a coworker. Jolting your brain out of your normal routine will keep you alert and ready to tackle the rest of your day.

Ask questions of your peers or your clients, raise your hand during class, and try to stay engaged in the conversation.
