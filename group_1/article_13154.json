While some non-LG, third-party, or universal remotes can be used to open your TV's service menu, you'll have the greatest chance of success if you use the remote that came with your TV. This method will not work with the LG Magic Remote (the one that's voice-activated and comes with modern OLED TVs). You will need a service remote instead. If you don't have the original LG remote, you can try a universal remote . But if that doesn't work, you'll need a replacement remote from LG or a service remote."

If you don't see the channel info and a place to enter a passcode after holding down this button for 10 seconds, try one of these options: If there's no MENU button on your remote, press and hold the one called SETTINGS , or the one with a gear. If that doesn't work, try pressing-and-holding the HOME button. Try pressing and holding your remote's MENU button and the TV's MENU button at the same time.

You can typically use the service menu to change settings such as your TV's network settings ( IP Control Set Up ), USB options, HDMI options , region, volume levels, and firmware . Changing these settings could make your TV unusable. Before making any changes, take a photo of (or write down) the current settings so you can restore the defaults if something goes wrong. Consider taking a picture of the screen or writing down the current settings so that you can reset your TV to its defaults if you accidentally change an important setting."

Service remotes don't come with consumer TVs, but they do come with commercial models (such as those designed for hotels or hospitals). But even if you don't have a commercial TV, you can buy an LG service remote on sites like eBay or Amazon . Look for \"Factory SVC Remocon,\" or the model number MKJ39170828. These remotes are pretty cheap, running anywhere from $7-$20 USD. If you have an Android with an IR blaster (this is sort of rare these days), you can use an app called AnyMote Universal Remote in place of the service remote. This app has the button you'll need to enter the setup menu. If you don't have an IR blaster, you may be able to attach one through your charging port."
