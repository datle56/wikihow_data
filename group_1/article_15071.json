    {
      "title": "Turn on a dehumidifier if the baked goods are in a humid environment.",
      "content": "Turn on a dehumidifier if the baked goods are in a humid environment. Humidity can cause your icing to dry 3 times slower than if they are placed in an area with dry air. Place the dehumidifier in the same room as your baked goods, turn it on, and place it on the highest setting. Leave it turned on until the icing is completely dry. [1] X Research source If you don’t have a dehumidifier, turn on the cool air-conditioning instead. This also helps to prevent the icing from losing its shape."

      "title": "Put the baked goods in the oven with only the light on to speed up the process.",
      "content": "Put the baked goods in the oven with only the light on to speed up the process. It is important to ensure that the heat is turned off so that the baking doesn’t get burnt. Simply turn the oven on and then wait for the light to turn on. If a light doesn’t come on automatically, select the light icon on your oven or turn the dial to the correct setting. [2] X Research source If you don't want to use an oven, use a heat lamp instead. Place the tray into the middle of the oven to allow for maximum airflow. Since sugar can absorb smells and tastes, your oven must be really clean, or you run the risk of making your royal icing taste like your dinner."

      "title": "Place a fan near the baked goods to increase the airflow that it receives.",
      "content": "Place a fan near the baked goods to increase the airflow that it receives. Position the fan on the middle setting and place it at least 1 metre (3.3 ft) away from the baked goods so that the airflow doesn’t cause the icing to bleed or change shape. If you notice the icing losing its shape, simply move the fan further away or turn down the wind speed. [3] X Research source This works best on cakes or cookies with a single layer of icing, as multiple levels of icing are more fragile and tend to be affected by the strong wind from a fan."

      "title": "Hold a heat gun over the icing to flash-dry it.",
      "content": "Hold a heat gun over the icing to flash-dry it. A heat gun is a rather specialist piece of equipment, but it is incredibly effective and may be a useful purchase if you do a lot of baking. Hold the heat gun about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the icing and wait for it to dry. This normally only takes a few minutes. [4] X Research source Purchase a heat gun online or from a specialty baking store."

      "title": "Leave the icing on the bench to dry, rather than in a container.",
      "content": "Leave the icing on the bench to dry, rather than in a container. Airtight containers tend to become humid, which means that the icing will take longer to dry. Instead, simply allow your cookies to dry at room temperature. [5] X Research source If your kitchen is particularly humid, place your baking in another room where the air is cooler and drier. However, make sure to choose a spot where the baking won’t be knocked over or eaten by pets or children."

      "title": "Avoid putting your baked goods in the fridge.",
      "content": "Avoid putting your baked goods in the fridge. This is a common hack for drying royal icing; however, it is not an effective method. The cold and damp air in the fridge doesn’t allow the icing to dry and can make your baking go soft. [6] X Research source Similarly, avoid putting your baked goods in the freezer to dry, as the condensation can ruin the icing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Place your baked goods in a single layer, rather than stacking it.",
      "content": "Place your baked goods in a single layer, rather than stacking it. If you are lacking space, it can be easy to stack your drying trays on top of each other. Unfortunately, this often causes condensation and humidity, which slows the drying process. [7] X Research source If you don’t have much room in your kitchen, consider placing your baked goods on a desk or table instead."
