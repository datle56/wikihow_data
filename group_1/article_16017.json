      "title": "Catch an Eevee if you don't already have one.",
      "content": "Catch an Eevee if you don't already have one. Because Sylveon is an evolved form of Eevee that can't be captured anywhere else in the game, you'll need an Eevee to start with. If you already have one caught, you can proceed to the next step, but if you don't, you'll need to catch one yourself. In Pokémon X and Y, Eevee can be caught on Route 10, which is located between Geosenge Town and Cyllage City. In Pokémon Sun and Moon (and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon) you can catch an Eevee on Akala Island (the second island) on your way to the Pokémon Ranch. Eevee can also be caught in the Friend Safari, an area that uses another player's 3DS Friend Code to generate an area containing Pokémon of a single type. Because Eevee is a Normal-type, you'll need to use a Friend Code that generates a Normal-type safari. Finally, Eevee can also be obtained from a trade with another player."

      "title": "Teach your Eevee a Fairy-type move.",
      "content": "Teach your Eevee a Fairy-type move. The first requirement for Eevee to evolve into Sylveon is that it must know at least one Fairy-type move. Unlike other Fairy-type Pokémon like Clefable, no moonstone is needed to evolve Sylveon. [1] X Research source Eevee learns two Fairy-type moves from leveling up: Baby-doll Eyes at Level 9 and Charm at Level 29. [2] X Research source Note that Eevee can't learn any Fairy-type moves from TMs."

      "title": "Gain two affection hearts from Eevee in Pokémon-Amie.",
      "content": "Gain two affection hearts from Eevee in Pokémon-Amie. The second condition for evolution into Sylveon is that your Eevee must have at least two affection hearts for you in Pokémon-Amie. Pokémon-Amie is a feature new to Pokémon X and Y that allows players to develop a bond with their Pokémon by petting it, feeding it, playing minigames with it, and allowing it to play with other Pokémon on your team. Don't worry, this feature is also available in Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire; you can find it in the PlayNav. [3] X Research source Pamper your Eevee in Pokémon-Amie until it has at least two Affection hearts before proceeding. You can do this either before or after you've taught it a Fairy-type move. Make sure you only get 2-3 hearts, because maxing out Eevee's affection may cause it to evolve into Espeon or Umbreon."

    {
      "title": "Level it up.",
      "content": "Level it up. Once your Eevee has at least two Affection hearts and knows a Fairy-type move, level it up. You can do this through random battles, fights with other trainers, and so on. Once your Eevee levels up, assuming the conditions above have been met, it should immediately evolve into Sylveon. Congratulations!"

      "title": "Avoid areas with a moss or ice rock when leveling up.",
      "content": "Avoid areas with a moss or ice rock when leveling up. While leveling your Eevee up in the vast majority of the areas of the game will cause it to evolve into a Sylveon once the conditions above are met, there are several important exceptions that you'll want to be aware of. Failing to observe these exceptions can cause your Eevee to evolve into an undesired form! Two of Eevee's evolved forms, Leafeon and Glaceon, require you to level up the Eevee near a moss rock or an ice rock respectively to achieve the evolution. [4] X Research source If you level up your Eevee near either of these, it will evolve into one of the other forms no matter whether or not you met the conditions for Sylveon above . In Pokémon X and Y, the spots to avoid are: Route 20, which contains a moss rock. [5] X Research source Frost Cavern, which contains an ice rock. [6] X Research source In Pokémon Sun and Moon (and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon), you'll want to avoid the northern part of Lush Jungle, where the Moss Rock is located, as well as the cave on Mount Lanakila.
