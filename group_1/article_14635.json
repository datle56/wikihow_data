      "title": "Opt for front-opening garments.",
      "content": "Opt for front-opening garments. Shirts, jackets, dresses, and other garments are much easier to get on using just 1 arm if they open completely at the front. Opt for clothing that buttons, zips, or hook-and-loop fasteners all the way up the front in order to make dressing as quick and easy as possible. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Wear pull-on elastic waist pants.",
      "content": "Wear pull-on elastic waist pants. It’s typically much easier to put on and take off loose-fitting sweatpants or stretchy leggings than it is to put on and take off fitted jeans or dress pants. While in recovery, opt for pants that are made of stretchy materials to simplify the dressing process. Wearing this type of pant may also keep you from having to deal with fastening buttons or zippers on your lower body."

      "title": "Go for loose-fitting clothing.",
      "content": "Go for loose-fitting clothing. Baggy clothes are also much easier to put on when you can’t use one of your arms. Pick out clothes that are a few sizes too big so that they’re easier to slip on. [2] X Research source For example, if you usually wear a medium size T-shirt, wear extra large T-shirts instead immediately following your surgery."

      "title": "Wear camisoles that have a built-in bra.",
      "content": "Wear camisoles that have a built-in bra. Bras are difficult to put on and take off each day while your shoulder is healing. If possible, skip your regular bra and wear a camisole with a built-in bra underneath your shirt. As an alternative, you can wear a plain fitted tank top underneath your shirt. [3] X Research source If you need more support than camisoles and fitted tank tops can provide, opt for front-closing underwire bras, or wear regular back-closing underwire bras and ask a loved one who lives with you to hook it on for you."

      "title": "Wear slip-on shoes.",
      "content": "Wear slip-on shoes. Tying your shoes is very difficult, if not impossible, to do with only 1 hand. To save yourself a headache, only wear shoes that slip onto your feet easily while you’re in recovery. Some examples of these kinds of shoes include: [4] X Research source Flip flops Hook-and-loop fastener sneakers Clogs"
