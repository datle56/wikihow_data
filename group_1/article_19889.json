      "title": "Open the door or window that the spider is near.",
      "content": "Open the door or window that the spider is near. If the spider is non-venomous, there are a number of ways to get it out of your home. If the spider in your house is already close to a window or door, you can find ways to encourage the spider out. You will first want to open the door or window to show the spider the way out of the house. [1] X Research source Try to step around the spider and open the door or window slowly. If you scare the spider, it may run and hide somewhere, and you won’t be able to get it outside as easily."

      "content": "Find an object to block the spider’s path. Find an object like a notebook, folder, or book that you can move around the spider if it tries to go in a direction that’s not the open door or window. Anything that is tall and flat will work. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Guide the spider out.",
      "content": "Guide the spider out. Take the notebook or folder and gently give the spider a nudge toward the door. The spider will be scared and start moving. If the spider veers away from the door, take the notebook and put it next to the spider to create a wall so that the spider won’t be able to run in that direction anymore. Keep doing this until the spider starts running in the right direction. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Guide the spider over the threshold.",
      "content": "Guide the spider over the threshold. The spider may hesitate on the threshold as it is running toward the door. If the spider lingers on the threshold, brush it out using your hand or the notebook or folder. You also could flick it with your finger."

      "title": "Throw the folder out the door if the spider crawls on it.",
      "content": "Throw the folder out the door if the spider crawls on it. When you are using the folder to guide the spider out of the door, the spider may start crawling on the folder instead of running. If the spider crawls onto the folder, toss the folder out the door, so that both the spider and the folder are outside. The spider will eventually crawl off the folder, and you can go and retrieve the folder later. You may not feel comfortable throwing the folder out of the door or window, especially if you live in a communal space like an apartment complex. If the spider crawls on the folder, instead of throwing it you can go outside with the folder and either brush the spider off with your hand, or wipe the folder on a bush or the windowsill until the spider falls off."

      "title": "Close the door or window.",
      "content": "Close the door or window. Now that the spider’s gone, you don’t want it to come back! Make sure that you close the door or window so the spider or other bugs can’t come in."

      "title": "Place a cup over the spider.",
      "content": "Place a cup over the spider. This works best for spiders on the floor or on the wall. Approach the spider slowly, so that it doesn’t get scared and start running. Quickly, take a small cup and place it directly over the spider, so that the spider is trapped inside. [4] X Research source Preferably the cup should be clear so that when you trap the spider, you can see it inside the cup. However, you can use any cup that you have in your house. Make sure to aim correctly so that the spider is unharmed. You don’t want to crush the spider or any of its legs with the rim of the cup."

      "title": "Slip a piece of paper under the cup.",
      "content": "Slip a piece of paper under the cup. Take a sheet of paper and slide it underneath the cup. Make sure that the piece of paper is under the entire cup. This will make sure that the spider won’t be able to escape when you lift up the cup. [5] X Research source The paper should be just one sheet, as opposed to a book or notebook. A stiff piece of paper like a notecard or index card works best. If the spider is dangling from a web, you will want to place the cup under the spider, and then either cut the web using scissors or use the piece of paper to break the web. The web and spider will stick to the piece of paper, and you will be able to bring the cup up to the paper and trap the spider."

Make sure that as you are lifting, the rim of the cup and the paper are always against each other so that the spider does not escape. [6] X Research source One way to lift the cup and paper is to hold the edge of the piece of paper with your left hand, with your right over the bottom of the cup. Lift the edge of the piece of paper, still holding the cup over the paper. Slip the fingers of your left hand under the piece of paper so that your hand is on the part of the piece of paper underneath the cup. Now with your hand underneath the paper and cup, you can lift up the trap and carry it to your door."

The spider should run away. If the spider is not moving, try gently blowing on the spider. You can also brush the spider off with your hand if you’re feeling brave! [7] X Research source"

Then empty out the filter outside of your home. You can use a regular vacuum cleaner, but be warned that this may possibly kill the spider. A dust buster is a slightly better option. [10] X Research source You can also buy vacuums made especially for bugs and insects. You can purchase these on Amazon."
