      "content": "Try not to pick or peel your skin yourself, since that can cause infections. As tempting as it might be to peel off the skin and speed up the process, peeling your skin can rip or tear your healthy skin, leaving room for infection and scarring. Let your skin peel by itself to avoid any adverse effects. If your skin gets more swollen or starts leaking pus, that’s a sign of infection. Talk to your doctor right away if you have any concerns."
