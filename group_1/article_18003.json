      "content": "Fold a piece of square paper in half diagonally. Lay the paper on a flat surface and turn it to look like a diamond. Take the top point and fold it down towards the bottom point. Press down on the fold to make a crease, and then unfold the paper. [1] X Research source The larger your piece of paper is, the larger your paper heart will be. The smaller your piece of paper, the smaller the heart. If you don’t have a square piece of paper, cut a piece of printer paper (or any other paper you have on hand) into a square using scissors."

Bring the bottom point up towards the top point, crease the center fold, and then unfold the paper. [2] X Research source Now, there should be 4 triangles in the square or 2 perpendicular crease marks running through the center of the square."

      "content": "Fold both halves up and over to the top edge of the paper. Keep the paper flat on your work surface and bring the right point up and over the top edge by folding it up at a 90-degree angle. Repeat this fold with the left point, bringing the inner edges of the folds together in the middle of the paper. [5] X Research source It may take 2 hands to do this—1 holding the middle of the paper while the other folds. Think of the right and left points as each half of the heart. Folding up the right point makes the right half, while folding the left points creates the left half."

      "content": "Tuck the points into the back of the paper. Flip your folded paper over. Fold the 2 points on each top side of the heart down about a 1 ⁄ 2 in (1.3 cm). This will give your paper heart a more rounded look. [6] X Research source If you’d like your heart to be more triangular, keep the points out. That’s it—you’ve made your very own paper heart! Turn it over and see how it looks."

Press on the fold to crease it, and then unfold it. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a piece of square paper, no worries! Simply use scissors to cut a different-sized piece of paper into a square."

Bring the bottom 2 points up to the center on either side along the existing diagonal creases. Use 2 hands to do this. Bring all the left creases together with your left hand and the right creases with your right. Flatten the fold once you’ve made a heart shape. [13] X Research source To flatten the paper, fold it in half horizontally, so the top and bottom edges are going away from you. The folded crease should be facing you."

Repeat this process with the right edge and point of the heart. [16] X Research source If you’ve done your folds correctly, the square will fold in on itself when you press it together. If it doesn’t, no worries! Press down on the center of the square with your finger to push everything in place."
