Jokes about office supplies are fine, but rulers are where I draw the line. A train station is where a train stops. A bus station is where a bus stops. I have a work station on my desk, so… Working from home is just the technical term for keeping track of emails and acting like your cat isn’t the real boss. I need a 6-month vacation, twice a year.
