      "content": "Apply a basecoat . Basecoats are usually clear or bluish in color, and can be purchased wherever nail polish is sold. Basecoats protect your nails from getting stained or damaged by nail polish and other nail art materials. Apply one layer of basecoat and allow it to completely dry before proceeding.Some basecoats remain tacky after drying. This texture is meant to help the next layer, the polish, stay in place longer without chipping. Choose whichever basecoat you like best."

Allow the polish to dry. Place a French manicure sticker across your nail, leaving the tip exposed. If you don't have a French manicure sticker, use a similarly-shaped sticker, such as the circular stickers that reinforce punched holes in paper. Paint the tip color above the sticker. It's okay if you overlap the paint with the sticker a bit. Remove the sticker while the paint is still wet, so you don't pull off chips of paint with it when you take it off. Allow the design to dry completely and finish it off with clear top coat."

If you'd like, you can use multiple colors for the dots. Apply the basecoat color. Allow it to dry completely. Dip a small brush, toothpick or pin into the polish you chose for the dots and lightly tap the implement on your nail. Continue doing this until your nail has as many dots as you want. For other effects, you can create dots of varying sizes by using thinner or thicker-tipped implements. To make fading or trailing dots, dip the implement in the paint once and apply several dots without reapplying paint. You can also use your fine-tipped implement to drag the paint out from the wet dot to create rays, swirls and other designs. When the dots are dry, finish with a clear top coat."

When the petal dots dry, use the same color to paint a simple circle in the center of the petal dots. [5] X Expert Source Marta Nagorska Nail Artist Expert Interview. 29 July 2019. You can add extra detail by placing a tiny white stripe in the center of the petals, or creating leaves with green nail polish. Take care not to crowd too many flowers on each nail. Make sure the flowers are distinct from one another. When the flower designs are dry, finish with a clear topcoat."

Use a clean toothpick to apply a dot of the second swirl color on top of the first dot while the first dot is still wet. Drag the colors outward together and create swirls using a clean toothpick, a striper brush or other implement. You can also create a marble effect by randomly placing several dots of the first swirl color on the nail, then placing several dots of the second swirl color around and on top of the first set of dots. Swirl the dots around and together by moving your implement in a criss-cross, S-shaped or figure-8 pattern."

      "content": "Try gradient (ombre) nails. Ombre looks best with colors in the same color family, like purples and blues. For this look, you'll need three colors: a dark color, a medium color, and a light one. Apply a coat of the darkest color to your nails and allow it to dry. Dip a makeup sponge into a dark colored polish (only a dab of polish is needed on the sponge) and apply the medium color to the tips of your nails, starting at the tip and moving down to create a fading effect. With a clean makeup sponge, dab the lightest color onto your nails in the same fashion, starting from the tip and fading downward toward the base of your nails. The resulting look should be bright-tipped nails that fade downward toward the darkest base coat color. Apply a clear top coat while the polishes are still wet to more completely smear the colors together."

Use the acetone and the brush to thin and smear the dots over the white base coat. If you're successful, you'll have an impressionistic Monet-inspired design.
