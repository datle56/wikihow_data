      "content": "Check that Goodwill will accept your items. Goodwill accepts most new, like new, and gently used household items, clothing, shoes, accessories, furniture, electronics, books, and more. That said, local donation policies are always changing depending on need, so be sure to check out your local Goodwill donation center website to double-check what they're currently accepting. [2] X Research source [3] X Research source Some common items that Goodwill does not accept include: Carpet/carpet padding Chemical products Cribs CRT, DLP, or rear-projection TVs Large appliances (refrigerators, washers/dryers, etc.) Mattresses/box springs Weapons [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Sort your donations into categories. [5] X Research source Whether you've come across clothing you rarely wear anymore while spring cleaning or simply emptied out a storage closet cluttered with infrequently used items, gather all of your potential donations into one spot. To make things easier on yourself, try dividing your potential donations according to type, making piles for things like: Books Clothing Electronics Houseware Shoes"

      "title": "Avoid donating damaged or separated items.",
      "content": "Avoid donating damaged or separated items. Donating broken items or items that have been split from a pair won't help anyone out, so it's important you give all items you're considering for donation a brief inspection to ensure each has all of its parts and pieces and is undamaged. For example, if an article of clothing is ripped or your china set is cracked, those items won't be good contenders for donation. [6] X Research source Test out electronics and appliances to see if these are in working order. This way, you can be sure your donation makes a difference. Try to keep items that belong together from being separated, as a single shoe or dish will be far less useful than a complete set. To do this, consider using a rubber band to prevent shoes or other sets from losing a mate."

      "title": "Make a list of what you're donating and evaluate the worth of your items.",
      "content": "Make a list of what you're donating and evaluate the worth of your items. Making a list of all the items you've collected is particularly useful if you plan to use these donations as a write-off for tax purposes. Write down all the items you are planning to donate, and then use the Goodwill Valuation Guide to estimate the worth of your donation."

      "title": "Load your donations into a reusable container.",
      "content": "Load your donations into a reusable container. Plastic totes or containers are often more durable than plastic bags or cardboard boxes, which can be especially helpful when moving heavy or cumbersome donations. Not to mention, by transporting your things to a donation center in a reusable container, you’re helping protect the environment by reducing waste! [7] X Research source No need to include hangers for your clothing items—Goodwill will handle that for you. Keep things organized by bagging or boxing up similar items together, like dishware sets and stationery."

    {
      "title": "Label fragile items.",
      "content": "Label fragile items. If you're donating something that has delicate parts or could break, hand these items to a Goodwill attendant as soon as you arrive at your donation center to avoid an unfortunate accident. Alternatively, if you're donating several fragile items or handing off your fragile item isn't an option, carefully package each item and clearly label each box with the word \"Fragile.\" [8] X Research source Not only will a broken item lose much, if not all, of its value, but these can also be a safety hazard for Goodwill employees."

      "title": "Consider making a monetary donation.",
      "content": "Consider making a monetary donation. Goodwill aims to make a positive difference in the lives of the community members they serve. For example, Goodwill has earned over 80 million dollars put towards job training programs and employment placement services. [9] X Research source By making a monetary donation to Goodwill, you can be a part of these positive changes at a local or national level. Talk about a positive impact!
