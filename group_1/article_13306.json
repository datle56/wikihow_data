Do this until both numbers have the same number of places to the right of the decimal point. This does not change the value of the whole number. [2] X Research source Example: In the problem 3 ÷ 1.2, our whole number is 3. Since 1.2 has one place to the right of the decimal point, rewrite 3 as 3.0, so it also has one place after the decimal. Now our problem is 3.0 ÷ 1.2 . Warning: do not add zeros to the left of the decimal point! 3 is the same as 3.0 or 3.00, but it is not the same as 30 or 300."

In division problems, you're allowed to move the decimal points, but only if you move them by the same amount for each number. This lets you turn the problem into whole numbers. [3] X Research source Example: To turn 3.0 ÷ 1.2 into whole numbers, move the decimal points one space to the right. 3.0 becomes 30, and 1.2 becomes 12. Now our problem is 30 ÷ 12 ."

Calculate the number of times the divisor goes into this digit, then write this number above that digit. [5] X Research source Example : We're trying to fit 12 into 30. Compare 12 to the first digit of the divisor, 3. Since 12 is larger than 3, it goes into it 0 times. Write 0 above the 3, on the answer line."

This time, compare the divisor to the number you just wrote down on the lowest line. Example:' How many times does 12 fit into 30? The closest we can get is 2, since 12 x 2 = 24. Write 2 in the second spot of the answer line. If you're not sure what the answer is, try some multiplication problems until you find the largest answer that fits. For example, if it seems like 3 is about write, multiply out 12 x 3 and you'll get 36. This is too big, since we're trying to fit within 30. Try the next one down, 12 x 2 = 24. This does fit, so 2 is the correct answer."

That means you're done, and you have a whole number as the answer to your problem. But if you've reached the end of the answer line and there's still something left to divide, you'll need to extend the dividend by adding a decimal point followed by a 0. Remember, this does not change the value of the number. [10] X Research source Example: We're at the end of the answer line but the answer to our last subtraction problem is \"6.\" Extend the \"30\" under the long division symbol by adding \".0\" to the end. Write a decimal point at the same spot on the answer line as well, but don't write anything after it yet."

Once you've done that, finding the remaining digits of the answer is exactly the same. [11] X Research source Example: Bring down the new 0 down to the last line to make \"60.\" Since 12 goes into 60 exactly 5 times, write 5 as the last digit on our answer line. Don't forget that we put a decimal on our answer line, so 2.5 is the final answer to our problem."
