      "title": "Avoid jumping to conclusions.",
      "content": "Avoid jumping to conclusions. Feeling ignored is frustrating, and it’s easy to assume the worst. Don’t assume that the other person is being malicious or intentionally giving you the cold shoulder, however. Consider alternative reasons why they might be ignoring you. For instance: They're distracted by something else, like problems at home or work. You upset them without realizing it, and they feel hurt. They just don't \"click\" with you, so they prefer to spend time with other people. They're keeping a secret (like a surprise party) from you, and they're worried they'll spill it if they talk to you. They feel nervous around you for some reason (like having a crush on you or being intimidated by you). They just aren't very social, and they treat everyone this way. Reader Poll: We asked 1074 wikiHow readers, and 57% of them agreed that the most likely reason someone might distance themself after a fight is because they need time to cool off . [Take Poll]"

      "title": "Reflect",
      "content": "Reflect on your recent actions. This can be a challenge. People often don't want to admit they did something wrong, or even notice that they've done something to offend someone. Take some deep breaths and evaluate your recent interactions with them. Was there any tension? Could their feelings have been hurt? Plan for an apology if you realize you've done something wrong. Even if this person didn't behave perfectly either, it is always better to take the high road. Practice different meditating techniques if it is hard for you to reflect. If you’re having trouble viewing the situation objectively, try asking someone else who knows what’s going on and can give you an outside perspective."

      "title": "Invite them to talk privately.",
      "content": "Invite them to talk privately. Sometimes the best way to get to the root of the issue is to sit down with the other person and clear the air. Send them an email or a letter asking if you can get together to chat in private at a particular time and place. Pick a quiet time to talk, when both of you are free and not distracted. Meeting in private will allow you to work out any problems between you (if there are any) without the embarrassment of a public confrontation. If you're especially nervous or think it might not go well, you can ask a 3rd party (like a mutual friend, counselor, or authority figure) to hep mediate."

      "title": "Explain your feelings.",
      "content": "Explain your feelings. Make \"I\" statements to say how you feel. Non-judgmentally explain the pattern, and say how it makes you feel. Here are some examples: \"Lately, when the three of us hang out, you're mostly talking with Serena while I listen. I feel left out.\" \"Mom, I've seen you play video games with my brothers a lot. I'm glad you have good relationships with them, but sometimes I feel left out. I wish we spent more time together.\" \"Honey, lately I've noticed that after work, you go out with friends, and don't come back until late. I miss you, and I want to spend more time with you.\" \"Are you upset with me? I noticed that you haven't been answering my calls and texts for the last 2 weeks.\""

      "title": "Be willing to collaborate on a solution if it's realistic.",
      "content": "Be willing to collaborate on a solution if it's realistic. Talk about ways that both of you can adjust so that the relationship improves. Getting things out in the open, and making an agreement, can help both of you figure out how to move forward. \"If I read the same book series as you, would that give the three of us something in common to talk about? Because I would be willing to do that. It does sound like a cool series.\" \"So, what I'm hearing is that you play more with my brothers because they invite you to play games, and if I want to spend time with you, I should ask, and you will. Is that right?\" \"I didn't realize that I was overwhelming you. Maybe we could set aside two date nights a week for just us, and I'll go out with friends more often too, so that I don't feel lonely as often?\" \"I can't change my sexuality. If you aren't okay with me being gay, that's your problem, and you don't have to spend time with me anymore.\""

You can revisit the topic during a better time, or re-evaluate whether the relationship is worth maintaining. \"You seem pretty distracted right now. Would it be better to talk about this later today?\" \"I would like to have a closer relationship with you. But if that's not a priority for you, then we don't have to have this conversation.\" \"I don't want to fight with you. Maybe we should take a break for now.\" \"If you're going to call me names, then I'm going to leave.\" \"Let's talk about this later, when we're both calmer.\""

By ignoring them, you might cause them to take notice of your actions. This is also a good way of keeping your cool. Even if it is tearing you up inside, this can be an effective solution over time. This doesn't mean snubbing them or being rude to them if they approach you. It's important to keep good manners, even if they aren't treating you the same way. Stay cordial."

Be genuine with the people around you and let them know what you need from them and what your limits are, and you will find that it is much easier to get your needs met. [6] X Research source Explain your boundaries clearly, and let others know what the consequences will be if those boundaries are violated. For example, if your significant other ignores you and plays on their phone whenever you go to lunch together, say something like, “I feel really ignored and unappreciated when you’re on your phone so much. If you don’t feel like spending quality time together, let me know, and I’ll make other plans for lunch.” If others in your life aren’t used to you setting boundaries with them, they might react with disappointment, surprise, or even anger at first. However, if they care about you, they should ultimately respect your boundaries."
