      "title": "Loosen up the muscles of your neck before you begin.",
      "content": "Loosen up the muscles of your neck before you begin. Take a few minutes to gently massage your neck and gently stretch . While standing or sitting, lean your chin down towards your sternum and hold it for 5 seconds, then pull your head back and look up at the ceiling for another 5 seconds. [2] X Research source Do this 3–4 times to loosen up your neck muscles. If you try to crack your neck without loosening up first, you could pull a muscle . Personal trainer John Diaz shares his favorite neck stretch as a warmup: “I push my chin down towards my chest, I look up to the sky, I bring one ear to my right shoulder. Then I switch and go to the left. Then I'll turn and look over my shoulder. Then I'll switch and look to the other side, holding each one for about 20 seconds, and that'll help your range of motion.” [3] X Expert Source John Diaz Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 22 October 2024."

      "content": "Hold the stretch for 10 to 15 seconds to relieve tension or crack your neck. Gently relax into a deep stretch to relieve tension in your trapezius and other neck muscles. Avoid sudden or jerky motions that can cause injury to your spine. Repeat this 3 to 5 times per side to get the most relief. [6] X Research source Warning: Do not force or push the stretch beyond what’s comfortable just to make your neck crack or pop. Continue gently stretching and if your neck needs to pop, it will."

      "content": "Lie down and place a foam roller beneath the curve in your neck. This exercise necessarily won't crack your neck, but it will release tension and provide a feeling of relief. Place a small, firm foam roller on the floor in a large room. Lie on your back so that your neck is resting comfortably on the foam roller and your feet are flat on the ground. Keep your arms flat on the ground, and lie with your back and head at rest. [7] X Research source If you don’t have a foam roller in your home already, you can purchase one at any store that sells yoga supplies or exercise equipment or simply use a rolled-up towel."

      "title": "Lift your back and rear off the ground to put weight on your neck.",
      "content": "Lift your back and rear off the ground to put weight on your neck. Gently push your hips upward until they’re about 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) high. Lift your rear without changing the position of your neck or head. As you lift your lower body, start rolling your neck left and right on top of the foam roller. As you keep your hips in the air and turn your head back and forth, you’ll feel the muscles in your neck begin to relax. [8] X Research source If you need to stabilize your neck, clasp your arms together behind your head as you move over the roller. Just do what feels good to you. If you ever feel any pain, go ahead and stop."

      "title": "Roll your neck over the roller until you feel your neck relax.",
      "content": "Roll your neck over the roller until you feel your neck relax. Arch your back and push your hips in the air. Push your body forward with your legs so that your neck slides up and down over the roller. [9] X Research source Continue to slowly turn your head left and right on the roller so that all of your neck muscles and vertebrae have a chance to loosen up. [10] X Research source Keep rolling until you feel the muscles relax. This should also stop any neck pain you’re experiencing, even if you don’t hear a cracking sound. Try to keep your head and shoulders as relaxed as possible while you’re rolling your neck. This will keep the muscles loose and allow you to fully crack your neck. Stop rolling your neck if you feel any pain. Turn your head left and right 10 to 15 times to ensure a good stretch."

If this happens to you, move the foam roller down until it’s under your shoulder blades. Lower your hips and chest until you’re lying flat on the roller. Use your legs to move your body back and forth until your lower back relaxes.

      "content": "Try stretching instead of cracking your neck. You might feel the urge to crack your neck frequently, as it can relieve stiffness, soreness, and feelings of tension. However, this pain relief is only temporary and doesn’t treat any deeper, underlying problems that your neck may have. Instead, try gently leaning your head from side to side to stretch out your neck.

      "content": "See your doctor if you experience frequent neck pain. While cracking your neck often relieves minor pain, repeated wear and tear on your vertebrae can lead to health problems and bone damage. If you are dealing with chronic neck pain, make an appointment with your general practitioner. [13] X Research source Describe your symptoms and pain level to the doctor. Mention how long you’ve experienced neck pain and show them how you typically crack your neck. This will be really helpful in the long run. It's better to correct the problem that’s causing your neck to hurt rather than simply trying to alleviate the symptoms."

[15] X Research source It's usually best to try gentle stretching and self-massaging before getting into the habit of neck-cracking. Visit a trained professional if your symptoms persist or worsen."
