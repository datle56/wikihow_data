The first signs that a person may have CIDP include \"motor deficiencies,\" like physical weakness and pain. These symptoms usually progress slowly over a period of two months. It is important to note that these symptoms could indicate a wide-variety of treatable conditions, and do not alone indicate CIDP. Some of these physical symptoms may include: Weakness Numbness Difficulty walking (especially on stairs) Tingling Pain Fainting spells (while standing up) Burning in the extremities Sudden onset of back and/or neck pain that radiates through the limbs"

They involve using gentle electrical currents to test nerve function and response.
