      "content": "Apply liquid to the lenses. You can run the lenses under water for a minute, or you can use specialized cleaning solution designed for use with glasses. [1] X Research source Window cleaning sprays also work well. Do not yet apply any chemical that contains abrasive materials or has a high acid content (as will be mentioned in later examples). Glasses typically have layers or coatings over the lens itself. As you are polishing or cleaning, you are really just wiping this exterior coating. When you remove scratches, you are buffing or removing a small amount of the exterior layers. It is best to keep this to a minimum in the initial phases of scratch removal. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Find a soft, microfiber cloth specifically designed for cleaning. You will use it to clean the lenses. [3] X Research source Do not use rough fabric. Though these may seem better designed to peel off layers of material, you really want to keep it to a minimum. It is essential to use microfiber cloth because the incredibly small size of the fibers makes any new scratches or buffing marks so small that they are invisible to the naked eye."

      "title": "Use side-to-side wiping motions to go over the lenses with the cloth.",
      "content": "Use side-to-side wiping motions to go over the lenses with the cloth. Do not use swirling or circular motions, as these can create circular smudges on the exterior of the glasses."

      "title": "Apply toothpaste to the scratched lens.",
      "content": "Apply toothpaste to the scratched lens. [4] X Research source Toothpaste contains microscopic abrasive particles that can polish and grind down the exterior layers."

      "title": "Use a piece of soft fabric to rub the toothpaste over the lens.",
      "content": "Use a piece of soft fabric to rub the toothpaste over the lens. Again, do not use any fabrics that are coarse or abrasive on their own; they will leave additional scratches in the lens."

      "title": "Rub the toothpaste over the lens using a side-to-side motion.",
      "content": "Rub the toothpaste over the lens using a side-to-side motion. Do not use circular motions as they can create circular scuff marks. The abrasives in toothpaste are harsher than microfiber cloth alone. Concentrating on a single area for too long could penetrate the exterior layers and damage the interior lens.

      "title": "Wash off the toothpaste.",
      "content": "Wash off the toothpaste. You can use warm water or glass cleaners, or a combination of the two."

      "content": "Purchase the necessary materials. Normally, glass etching involves the use a fairly powerful acid to cut or burn an image into glass. [6] X Research source In this particular context, it will be used to burn off the exterior layer of the glasses. You will need: A glass etching substance. A brand known as Armor Etch produces one popular variety of the material, but there are others as well. [7] X Research source High quality rubber gloves to protect your hands. Cotton swabs or some other material to use for applying the substance to the glasses."

      "content": "Apply the glass etching substance using the cotton swabs. Do not rub the substance in, but merely apply it to the surface. Because of the strength of the acid in glass etching substances, you must work quickly. Only apply enough of the substance to cover the lens."

      "title": "Let the substance remain on the lenses for no more than 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Let the substance remain on the lenses for no more than 5 minutes. Again, etching solution contains powerful acids. Over-exposure to these acids will likely damage the lenses."
