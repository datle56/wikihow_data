      "title": "Understand what will happen.",
      "content": "Understand what will happen. Generally, a skier will tip head first into the hole created by the tree well. This means that your head and arms will be heading straight down into the hole and your skis will be the last thing above you. Loose snow will start to fall in around you as you tumble, packing you in against the tree or other snow in the hole. [1] X Research source The biggest threat is suffocation from the snow packing in around you. Another threat can be from hitting the tree and getting concussion or other injuries."

      "content": "Don't panic . Rapid movement and struggling will worsen your situation. It is important to stop panicking and to start thinking as calmly as you can about how to get out. Bear in mind that every bit of wriggling, squirming, struggling, and angry gestures will compact more snow around you. Save your energy and let your thinking take over."

      "content": "Grab whatever part of the tree you can or hug it. As you fall, do your very best to arrest yourself as quickly as possible. Do this by grabbing and holding onto the tree branches, or any other parts of the tree to try to stabilize yourself and stop yourself from falling any deeper. Hold on tight. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Make a decision. At this point, consider whether you have the energy or even the opportunity to try to wedge yourself out of the situation. If you don't, continue focusing on creating air holes and waiting for rescue. Use a rocking method to carve out space in the snow and to gain more air; your body heat may also help to compact snow around you that can help you to lift yourself up from. [4] X Research source If you think you might be able to get yourself out, consider the following method, based on how Craig McNeil got himself out of a tree well: Turn your body as slowly as you can to try to turn yourself upright. Pull yourself up the tree, slowly. This will be a long and difficult process. While there is no guarantee of success, continue believing that you can do this and be aware that people have escaped from this situation."
