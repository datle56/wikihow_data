      "content": "Fold a T-shirt in half lengthwise and tuck in the sleeves. You can use a shirt that fits you well as a template for creating a new shirt. Fold the shirt in half lengthwise and tuck in the sleeves so that they are out of the way. Push them into the shirt so that the seams along the armholes are visible. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Place the folded shirt over folded fabric. Fold your fabric in half and smooth it out so there are no lumps or bumps in it. Then, place the shirt on top of the folded fabric. Line up the folded edges of the shirt with the folded edges of the fabric. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut around the edges of the shirt except for along the fold.",
      "content": "Cut around the edges of the shirt except for along the fold. Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut around the outside of the shirt, except for along the folded edge. Cut carefully and slowly to avoid creating any jagged edges in the fabric. When you’re done, lift the shirt off of the fabric, fold the fabric again, and cut a second piece in the same manner. These 2 pieces will be the front and back of your shirt. [3] X Research source You can also use a pattern to create the shirt part of the peplum top. There are many free ones available online.

      "content": "Pin the shirt pieces together with the right sides facing in. Layer the 2 shirt pieces so that the raw edges are even and the right (front or outer) sides are facing each other. Insert 2 to 3 evenly spaced pins along each of the shoulders and 6 to 8 evenly spaced pins along each of the sides. [5] X Research source Make sure to remove the pins one at a time before you sew across a pinned area. Sewing across the pins may damage your sewing machine."

      "content": "Sew a straight stitch along the shoulders and sides of the shirt. Sew a straight line along the top edge of each of the shoulders about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) from the raw edges. Then, sew down each of the shirt’s sides in the same manner. This will create a simple top that you can sew the peplum skirt onto. [6] X Research source Cut the excess threads when you are finished sewing. Be careful not to sew across the neckline or armholes of the shirt."

Hold 1 end of the measuring tape against the bottom edge of the shirt and then wrap it all the way around the bottom edge. Record this measurement on a piece of paper. [7] X Research source"

      "content": "Divide the measurement by 3.14 and subtract 0.5 in (1.3 cm). This will give you the ideal radius of the peplum, which you will need to cut the skirt piece. The extra 0.5 in (1.3 cm) will serve as seam allowance. [8] X Research source For example, if the shirt measurement was 36 in (91 cm), then dividing by 3.14 gives you a result of 11.5 in (29 cm). Subtracting 0.5 in (1.3 cm) gives you a result of 11 in (28 cm). Use a calculator to make this easier and make sure to write down your result."

Then, measure from the corner to the radius. Mark the fabric in several places extending from the corner to form a curved, dotted line. Then, connect the dots to fill out the curve. [9] X Research source This technique is similar to using a protractor. The end of the measuring tape stays in the same spot while you move the other end to find your desired radius."

Measure from the bottom of the shirt to the point on your body where you’d like the skirt to end to determine how long to make the skirt. Go with a longer length for something that will cover your hips and waist completely, or go with a shorter length for a cropped peplum shirt. [10] X Research source For example, if you want a short peplum top, you might measure only 5 in (13 cm) from the radius line. If you want a long top that falls down around your hips, measure 10 in (25 cm) from the radius line."

This will ensure that you have enough fabric to hem the bottom edge of the skirt and to attach it to the top. For example, if your desired skirt length was 10 in (25 cm), adding 1 in (2.5 cm) for the seam allowance gives you a total of 11 in (28 cm)."

Measure from the edge of the radius to the desired length of the skirt plus seam allowance. Mark the fabric with a piece of chalk or fabric marker in 7-10 places to form a curved, dotted line just as you did before. Then, connect the dots to form a solid, curved line. For example, if you determined that your skirt will be 11 in (28 cm), then measure down to this length starting from the radius."

Go slowly to avoid creating any jagged edges in the fabric. Cutting along these lines will give you a long, curved strip of fabric that looks like a donut when you connect the ends. The piece that you cut out is what you will sew onto the bottom of the shirt piece."

Fold the donut strip of fabric that you created so that the ends are lining up and the right sides are facing each other. It will look like a half-circle. Then, insert 2 to 3 pins through the fabric to keep the short edges lined up. Insert the pins going perpendicular to the edge of the fabric. This will make it easier to remove them when you sew."
