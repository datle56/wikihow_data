      "content": "Make sure the control arm isn't obstructed. The control arm is a long arm that hangs over the ice tray. When the tray is full, the arm raises and shuts off the ice maker. If ice is obstructing the control arm, it will prevent it from lowering, which leads to your ice maker not making ice. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "If the ice tray isn't latched properly, the ice maker won't run. The ice tray is inserted differently depending on which Frigidaire refrigerator you have. Use one of the following steps to make sure your ice bucket is inserted properly: If your ice maker dispenses ice through the door, make sure there is no ice obstructing the ice tray. Slide the ice tray all the way into the ice maker compartment until it latches shut. If your ice maker dispenses ice into a bucket inside the freezer, make sure there is no ice obstructing the bucket and that it's placed under the ice maker against the back of the freezer."

      "content": "Ice clumps can prevent mechanical parts from moving. Check the inside of your ice maker for ice buildup. Also, check to make sure there aren't any clumps in the ice chute preventing ice from dropping. You can clear out any ice clumps with a plastic utensil or by allowing the freezer to thaw out. clear out the ice tray at least twice a week to prevent ice from clumping. Toss out any unused ice."

      "content": "A frozen fill tube prevents water from reaching the ice mold. The fill tube is usually at the back of the ice maker or behind. It's the tube that fills the ice molding with water. If the fill tube is frozen, allow your freezer to thaw out, or defrost it with warm water or a hair dryer. On some ice maker models, you may need to remove the ice maker to access the fill tube."

      "content": "Check the water line for leaks, kinks, or clogs. If there is a problem with the water line, it will prevent your ice maker from receiving the water it needs. Check the water line, which is a small plastic or copper tube that connects the water faucet to the water valve on the back of the refrigerator. Water leaking inside the freezer could be a sign of a water line leak. Also, make sure the faucet the water line is connected to is turned on and that there is no leak where the hose connects to the faucet."

      "title": "Check the water valve for damage or leaks.",
      "content": "Check the water valve for damage or leaks. The water valve is usually located on the back of the refrigerator where the water line connects. The water pressure from the valve needs to be at least 20 psi for it to function properly. If the valve is leaky, the ice mold may overfill. If damaged, it may not open to allow water to flow. Replace the water valve if need be. [2] X Research source To replace a water valve , you will need to turn off the water and disconnect the water line . Then, remove the back panel from your Frigidaire refrigerator and remove the valve mounting bracket. Remove the wire harness and the valve assembly. Attach a new assembly to the wire harness and mount the new valve assembly. Reattach the back panel, along with the water line, and turn the water back on."

      "content": "If your Frigidaire has a water filter, change it every six months. If you do not, the water filter may become clogged with sediment, restricting water flow to the ice maker. If your ice is tasting funny or there is low water pressure in the ice maker or water dispenser, it could be time to replace the filter. [3] X Research source Also check to make sure the water filter is installed correctly. To do so, remove the water filter and re-insert it. Check the Frigidaire manual that came with your refrigerator to learn how to change your filter. Some after-market filters may not work as well as the ones that came with your refrigerator. Make sure you get a water filter that is right for your refrigerator model."

If the main control board is damaged, you can order a new one from https://www.frigidaireapplianceparts.com/ . [5] X Research source The main control board rests in a tray underneath the refrigerator. You will need to open the doors and remove the grill from the bottom of the refrigerator. Use a wrench or a screwdriver to unscrew the screws holding the tray in place. Pull the tray out and inspect the board for damaged or rusty parts. If you order a new main control board, it will come in a new tray. Pull the old tray out from underneath the refrigerator. Take a picture of it so that you remember where the wires connect to. Disconnect the wires and connect them to the new board. Slide the new board back under the refrigerator and secure it with the screws. [6] X Research source"
