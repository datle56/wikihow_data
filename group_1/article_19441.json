      "content": "Figure out what caused the food poisoning. Before treating the symptoms of food poisoning, it is important to figure out what caused it. Think back to the food you ate in the last 4 to 36 hours. Did you try something new? Did anything taste slightly off? Did you share food with a friend or family member who is also experiencing the same symptoms? Here are the most likely causes of food poisoning: [1] X Research source Food that has been contaminated by E. coli, Salmonella, and other types of bacteria. Bacteria are usually killed when food is cooked and handled properly, so this type of food poisoning usually results from undercooked meat or food that was left sitting out without refrigeration. Poisonous fish, such as pufferfish, are also a common source of food poisoning. Pufferfish should not be consumed unless it has been prepared by staff at a restaurant that is certified to do so. Poisonous wild mushrooms, looking identical to edible mushrooms, can also cause food poisoning."

It should go without saying that you should avoid eating the food that caused the poisoning. If you aren't sure what caused it, forgo eating anything that hasn't been freshly prepared right before you consume it. Throw away any suspect food. If you get tired of subsisting on broth and soup, eat plain foods that won't upset your stomach, like bananas, plain boiled white rice, or dry toast. Only start eating after the active vomiting stage of your food poisoning.
