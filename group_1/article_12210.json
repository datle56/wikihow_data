Whether you’re heading out to work, in the middle of a busy day, or want to express your love simply and concisely (without gushing too much), a short love message is the way to go. After all, a message doesn’t have to be long to be meaningful! I don’t need paradise because I found something better: you. Life is more beautiful with you in it. Every time you smile at me, the rest of the world disappears. Our love is so precious to me because it has no boundaries. Just wanted to remind you that I’m yours, and always will be. Never forget: I love you exactly the way you are. You’re amazing! With you, I feel more excited by the possibilities in front of us than ever before. When I picture my future, you’re right there with me. I love you! I will always choose you—every single day. My favorite place in the world is wherever you are. You’ve given me a kind of love I didn’t know truly existed. Thank you. Your love grounds me and makes me feel like I can do anything. I love everything about you, from your wonderful mind to your kind heart. My love for you has no limits, and it’s always growing. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you, my love."

Tell him everything that’s on your mind, whether you’re missing him, feeling grateful for him, or you’re just feeling overwhelmed with love. You can be more specific and detailed with a long love message! I love everything about you. I love how kind you are, how patient you can be, and how you always go out of your way to make me feel adored and cared for. Thank you for everything you do, my love. I feel so lucky to be with you. You’re the man of my dreams, my true love, and I can’t wait to start building a future with you because I know it will be a wonderful one. Never forget that I love you, and I always will. I’m so overjoyed and proud to be your partner. You help me be the best version of myself while supporting and encouraging me. With you, I feel truly seen—and truly loved. Thank you for being yourself, and the best partner I could ask for. Every piece of you is perfect to me. I want you, in mind and (of course) body. Being close to you will never cease to thrill me, and I love knowing that you’re all mine, just as I’m all yours. You make me happy in so many different ways, and you’re never far from my thoughts. When I’m with you, all I want to do is be close to you—and when we’re apart, I’m always thinking about how you make me feel and how lucky I am to know you. Our love is like a wild and dazzling adventure, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. We’ve had more than our share of incredible journeys and unbelievable experiences, and I love that together, we’ve learned to live each day to the fullest. Here’s to many, many more days together."

      "content": "Show him the true depths of your feelings with a heartfelt message. All of the messages in this article are deep love messages, but these ones truly come right from the heart. Don’t be afraid to be a little vulnerable when writing a heartfelt message. “Vulnerability is the birthplace of intimacy, so if you’re feeling something just say it,” says clinical psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz. Finding you helped me understand what I’d been searching for my whole life. I love you so very much! I love you. I love your body, your soul, your mind, and how I feel when I’m around you. I’m honored to be yours! The way you look at me completely melts my heart. You make me feel loved and desired, like I’m the most important person in the world. My love for you is beyond words, measure, and time. It’s infinite and endless! Sometimes it feels like I’m having a dream, but then I remember that it’s all real—and so are you. How lucky am I? Thank you for being mine! You are the only amazing person I want to come home to. Being with you just makes sense, even when nothing else does. The more time passes, the more I learn new things to love about you. As long as you love me, my world is perfect. Each moment with you feels like a fairytale come true. I never want to let go of the love we share! Everything in my life has led me to you. Through all the choices I’ve made and regrets I have, meeting you has been worth all of it. I wouldn’t change a single thing! I didn’t always believe in soulmates, but you’ve changed my mind. You made me believe, and now I know that you’re the love of my life."

With you, I finally understand what all those sappy love songs are about. Everyone has their own motivation to get up in the morning, and seeing you is mine.

What do you love about him? Why are you so grateful for him? Having specifics can make your message feel more authentic and touching—and expressing gratitude is a great way to strengthen your bond. Thank you for being my rock and biggest supporter, my love. It means the world to me! Words can’t express how thankful I am for you. Having you at my side gives me the courage to do anything. I’m forever grateful for you, and the way you make me feel desired and wanted. Your love always brings light to my life, even on cloudy days. You’re my strength. When I reach down inside myself and do things I’m not capable of, it’s because of you. Thank you for loving me unconditionally. You listen to me, value me, and make me feel cherished every single day. Looking back, I’m grateful for every change, decision, and fork in the road that led me to you. Thank you for always believing in me, and encouraging me to chase my dreams and goals even when it means taking a risk. Your belief is the best gift I’ve ever been given. Thank you for always going above and beyond to make me happy. Your romantic gestures are absolutely magical, and never cease to amaze me. I love the way you’re always leaving me sweet little notes, so here’s my attempt to do the same. Thank you for making me feel so special, and remember that I love you with everything in my heart. Thank you for everything, my love: the adventures, the late-night conversations, the way you hold me, and so much more."

Whether you want to build up his anticipation for the next time you see each other or just want to tease him with something seductive, try giving him an intimate love message. Thinking about your handsome face and wishing I could kiss it. It’s crazy how distracting you are when you’re not even here! Do you have any idea how much my heart races when I see you? When you touch me, everything else fades away, and every kiss is intoxicating. I can’t stop thinking about the way you hold me close and whisper sweet words in my ear.

A truly great love message feels personalized in some way; try avoiding generic statements and add details that apply specifically to him and your relationship. Reminiscing can be a great way to do that, because it allows you to reflect on the good times you’ve shared together. [2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Every moment with you is time well spent, and each memory we make is more special than the last. Come what may, I cherish you and every laugh, tear, and moment we share. Do you remember the day we first said, “I love you”? I didn’t think it was possible to love you more than I did then, but I was wrong. I treasure the memories we share more than anything else. You’re my favorite adventuring partner in life, and I treasure every memory of our adventures thus far. I’m grateful for all the moments that make us who we are, and form the foundation of this beautiful relationship. Nobody has been able to make me laugh until my stomach hurts quite as much as you, and I love you to pieces for it. Imagining our first kiss still makes me lose my train of thought, even now. Every joke we’ve made, kiss we’ve shared, and “I love you” we’ve exchanged adds to our story—the best story of all. No matter where I am or what I’m doing, thinking of the day we met makes me so very happy."

I’m so grateful that our love keeps getting stronger, even though we live in two different places. That’s what makes us special! Anytime someone asks me why I’d be in a long-distance relationship, I tell them the same thing: it’s not about the distance but the person, and you’re worth fighting for. I haven’t seen your face in a while, handsome. Could you send me a new picture to gaze at lovingly? You’ve been on my mind today, and I’m dying to see you.
