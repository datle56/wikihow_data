      "content": "Talk to a trustworthy friend or family member. Sometimes just talking to someone about what you are dealing with can make you feel better. [1] X Research source Try talking to a trustworthy friend or family member about what has been happening in your home life. For example, you could try talking with a close friend about the way that your parents make you feel. Choose someone you feel comfortable talking to and who you know will not turn around and repeat what you said to your parents. Try to avoid becoming too dependent on this person for your emotional needs. Just talk when you need someone to listen to you. If you find yourself calling several times a day for reassurance, then you may be developing a codependent relationship with this person. Talk to your school counselor or therapist if you find yourself depending more and more on other people for validation."

      "content": "Find a mentor. Mentors can guide you through important life decisions and teach you things that your parents are not willing or able to teach you. You can find a mentor to help you learn new skills for navigating difficult situations, succeeding in school, or advancing your professional career. Try asking a trustworthy, responsible adult in your life to mentor you, such as a coach, a teacher, or a boss. [2] X Research source If your coach or boss offers to mentor you, make sure that you take him or her up on that offer; however, you can also try asking someone to mentor you, such as by saying, “I admire your success in life and I hope to achieve many of the same things you have someday. I am not sure how to get there. Would you be willing to mentor me?” Try to avoid becoming too dependent on your mentor(s). Keep in mind that a mentor cannot replace your parents. You should not look to this person for parental guidance. A mentor is just someone who can help you reach your goals in school, work, or in another specific area of your life."

A therapist or your school counselor can help you to develop coping mechanisms and begin to feel better about yourself. [3] X Research source If your school has a counselor, stop by and see if you can make an appointment to talk. If you feel uncomfortable doing this or you're not sure how to go about it, talk to a teacher you trust. You may also try asking your counselor if you can see a therapist by saying something like, “I have been struggling with some things lately, and I would like to see a therapist to talk about them. Can you help me find one?” Keep in mind that if your parents are abusing you , then your therapist or school counselor will be required to report it."

There could be a situational reason why they treat your sibling with more thoughtfulness or effort. Most of the time it is also unintentional, and your parents may not even realize they are treating you differently. Most aren’t trying to make you feel unloved but aren’t aware of how their actions affect kids mentally and emotionally.

It can be hard to dismiss criticism and hurtful language from people who are supposed to love you, even if you know that what they are saying isn’t true. Remember that your parents’ behavior and words is about them and not about you.

Some children who are mistreated by their parents treat themselves badly as well, such as by cutting, using alcohol or drugs, or intentionally failing at school. Performing these unhealthy, harmful activities will not make you feel better in the long run. Instead of doing these things, make sure that you nurture yourself, such as by: Maintaining a healthy diet . Exercising moderately most days of the week . Starting a daily meditation practice .

To train your mind to think positive things about yourself, replace the negative thoughts with positive ones. For example, if you hear yourself repeating something your parents said like “You’re stupid if you can’t figure out division problems,” you might replace it with: “Learning long division is challenging, but I can succeed by working hard at it.

      "content": "Write yourself a positivity cheat sheet. [6] X Research source It may help you to examine any negative thoughts that are interfering with your ability to love yourself and write some positive thoughts to replace them. To get started, make a chart with four columns. In the first column, make a list of your negative beliefs. These might include things like, “I am not good at making decisions,” or, “I am not very smart.” In the second, explain why you believe these things. Did your parents tell you these things or do things to cause you to feel this way? In the third column, think about what believing this is costing you emotionally and in your personal life: are you depressed, withdrawn, afraid to try new things and fail, afraid to trust others or let people in, etc.? List briefly but specifically what you are missing out on by letting yourself continue believing this negative self-image. Then for the final column, rewrite the thought to make it positive. For example, you might change a thought about your intelligence to something like, “I am an intelligent, capable person and I have accomplished many things using my brain.”"

It is hard to give up on anyone you care about, especially family, but your primary responsibility is to take care of yourself. Don’t feel guilty for severing contact with your parent(s) if you feel it’s the best thing for you. If you are not sure cutting off all contact is necessary, consider the amount of pain they cause you vs. the amount of happiness. Dysfunctional parents may show love sometimes, typically when it serves their own interests, but a little love now and then isn’t enough to justify staying in a bad relationship with anyone.

One sign of a toxic parent-child relationship is if your parents do not acknowledge your accomplishments in appropriate ways. This could mean that your parents either refuse to acknowledge when you accomplish something, or that your parents dismiss your accomplishments. Some parents may even ridicule your accomplishments. [12] X Research source For example, if you get a good grade on a test, your parents should congratulate you for this accomplishment. If your parents are toxic, then they might ignore what you said, change the subject, make fun of you for being a nerd, or say something like, “So what? It’s just a test.”"

This may range from small decisions like what to wear to school to larger decisions like where to go to college or what to major in. If you think that your parents exert a high amount of control over your decisions, then they may be toxic. [13] X Research source For example, a parent who encourages you to make your own decisions might ask you questions about where you want to go to college and why; however, a parent who is exerting control over your decisions might tell you where you are going to attend college."

If your parents ignore you completely or only acknowledge you when you are doing something that they can brag about to friends, then this is an example of narcissistic parenting and it is toxic. [17] X Research source For example, your parents should encourage you in your interests. A narcissistic parent, however, might only pay attention to you if your interests give him something to brag about, such as by telling all of his friends that you won a scholarship, even though he never asks about your studies or encourages you. Some narcissistic parents may have a personality disorder (PD). A person with PD displays self-centeredness, refusal to accept personal responsibility, constant self-justification, a strong sense of entitlement, and shallow emotions. A parent with PD might treat children like a burden or roadblock to her own personal goals. She will typically rely on emotional manipulation to control her kids. People with PD are often hypercritical of their children and can be physically abusive or prone to endangering their child’s welfare."

Some parents are too immature or have other problems (such as addiction) that make it hard for them to be effective parents, so a child ends up taking on some parenting duties. Consider whether you had to take on any parenting roles because your parent was not able or willing to care for you and/or your siblings. These may include things like cooking, cleaning, and caring for other children. [18] X Research source Sometimes parents assign cooking and cleaning chores to teach children responsibility, but toxic parents may heap many responsibilities on one child to avoid having to do these things themselves. For example, a toxic parent who does not want to cook or clean may shirk these responsibilities and force one of his children to do all of the cooking and cleaning instead."

Some children feel unloved even though their parents say that they love them regularly, because they don’t see this love reflected in how they are treated. Make sure you aren’t assuming you know how your parents feel about you without good reason. For example, a parent who regularly says “I love you,” but who often ignores her children is not behaving in a way that shows love. Likewise, a parent who says that she wants her children to be independent, but never allows them to make any decisions is not behaving in a way that demonstrates what she says she wants."
