      "content": "Make the room safe. Before you let your guinea pig out of their cage, you need to make the room safe. Make sure you have nothing around the room that your guinea pig can get into, such as chemicals or cleaning supplies. Remove or pick up cords out of your guinea pig's reach. They may chew on them if they find them on the floor. If you're worried about your guinea pig going to the bathroom on your carpet or flooring, lay down a layer of plastic or newspaper to catch any accidents. Put house plants out of reach. Many of them are toxic to guinea pigs. [8] X Research source Remove plastic bags, as guinea pigs may like them, but they are not safe to play with.
