      "content": "Wear dark shirts and tops with minimal decoration. [1] X Expert Source Jordan Stolch Image Consultant & Style Advisor Expert Interview. 25 September 2020. When it comes to the main articles of clothing, stick to black. Look for shirts and tops that have few details and graphic designs. Get shirts that fit a little tighter if you think that you can pull it off. When wearing a collared shirt, button it as high as you comfortably can. If you're going to wear a shirt with icons or designs on them, stick to Gothic or Post-Punk bands and occult or morbid imagery, like goat heads, bats, skulls, and upside-down crosses. [2] X Research source Goth folks that tend to wear a lot of T-shirts are sometimes referred to as casual goths. It's not an insult though, it simply means that you prefer comfortable clothing. Romantic, steampunk, and vampire goths can opt for more ornamental clothing. Look for shirts with ruffles, loose tops, or lace detail. Cybergoths tend to wear a lot of leather or fabric vests. Look at male fashion inspirations from the early Batcave/post-punk days. Fishnet tops or clothing inspired by Romantic Poets or vampires are possible options. If you're into The Mission or The Sisters of Mercy, wear Western/cowboy clothing complete with shades. [3] X Expert Source Regina Dunn Goth Subculture Enthusiast Expert Interview. 12 July 2021."

      "title": "Stick to darker, tighter leather pants and jeans.",
      "content": "Stick to darker, tighter leather pants and jeans. When it comes to pants, try to stick to leather or black denim. Wear pants that fit around the hamstrings and thighs, and never let them hang below your beltline. If you want some stylized options, look for pants with zippers or lace details where the pockets and seams belong. You can always dark wash jeans to get them closer to a shade of black. [4] X Research source [5] X Expert Source Regina Dunn Goth Subculture Enthusiast Expert Interview. 12 July 2021. If you're going to wear shorts, opt for torn jeans that stop around the knee. If you're interested in mall goth or cybergoth versions of the subculture, baggy Tripp pants with lots of chains and belts can work as well. Never wear athletic shorts. They just don't fit any part of the goth aesthetic. Romantic and vampire goths rarely wear shorts outside. Try to find pieces that have leather accents, chain studding, contrasting fabric, or anything else that's a little bit unique.

      "title": "Wear darker sneakers and heavy boots.",
      "content": "Wear darker sneakers and heavy boots. Stick to black Vans or Converse sneakers if you want lighter footwear. Generally speaking though, the goth look requires boots. Dr. Martens and New Rock make boots that match the goth aesthetic because they tend to use black leather and a lot straps with thick soles. [7] X Research source Never wear sandals or open-toed shoes. Cybergoths and vampire goths typically only wear thick-soled boots with lots of straps. Boots, creepers, and winklepickers are great additions to a goth outfit. [8] X Expert Source Regina Dunn Goth Subculture Enthusiast Expert Interview. 12 July 2021."

      "title": "Stick to leather jackets or trench coats in the colder seasons.",
      "content": "Stick to leather jackets or trench coats in the colder seasons. Leather jackets with lots of zippers, spikes, or straps tend to compliment the gothic look nicely. Trench coats are another option if you lean more towards goth's Victorian sensibilities. Again, stick to black whenever you can. [9] X Research source If you're into the Romantic goth style, a tailcoat with a ruffle shirt can work quite nicely. Pinstripe blazers and wool overcoats can work if you're attending a formal function or fancy dinner."

      "title": "Get some black hoodies if you're a mall or emo goth.",
      "content": "Get some black hoodies if you're a mall or emo goth. Mall and emo goths wear black hoodies in the fall and early spring. Get a comfortable hoodie, preferably in all black. This is the one item in an emo or mall goth's wardrobe that can be oversized. If you want to get one with a design, band names, logos, or occult imagery are safe choices. [10] X Research source If you're into the punk goth or skater styles, a Thrasher hoodie is a classic choice. Cyber, Romantic, and vampire goths typically never wear baggy hoodies."

      "title": "Dye your hair",
      "content": "Dye your hair if you're allowed to. Black hair is essential for a classic goth look, but there are other options available depending on your specific tastes. If you're into steampunk, a light brown or blonde can work well. For cybergoths, fluorescent greens and neon pinks will stand out nicely. You can choose to not dye your hair at all if you'd likeâ€”especially if it's already a shade of dark brown or black. If you can't dye your hair because of your job, school, or parents, consider getting a temporary dye for the important nights out with your friends. Hair chalk, spray color, and Kool Aid are some easy ways to dye your hair temporarily."

      "title": "Flatten your hair",
      "content": "Flatten your hair in the front, sides, and back for a classic emo-goth look. For the standard look, use a flat iron to straighten your hair in the front. Comb it at a 45-55 degree angle to the side so that it hangs over a portion of one of your eyebrows. Flatten the sides and comb them out or down depending on your preference. In the back, you can use hair gel to spike it out or comb it down to match the rest of your hair. Go to a salon and ask for a classic emo-goth look if you don't want to do it yourself. Once you describe it, they'll know exactly what you're looking for. The standard goth cut is most commonly found in the emo goth scene. It's rare that you see a Romantic goth with this style of haircut."

      "title": "Grow your hair out and flatten it for a Romantic goth style.",
      "content": "Grow your hair out and flatten it for a Romantic goth style. For a longer style, grow your hair out past your shoulders. Then, you can either tie it back into a ponytail, or use a flat iron to flatten it. To flatten it, hold out a length of hair from the roots with your nondominant hand. Heat your flat iron and clamp it around a section of hair before slowly sliding it down towards the end of your hair. Repeat this for each section of your hair to make it hang flat. It may take a year or more to grow your hair out long enough. As you're waiting for it to grow to an appropriate length, experiment with other hair styles. This is a common hair style for Romantic and vampire goths."

      "title": "Spike your hair or shave a Mohawk for a more extreme look.",
      "content": "Spike your hair or shave a Mohawk for a more extreme look. If you want a more radical option, you can spike your hair out with hair gel. To do this, scoop out some gel with both hands and run them outwards through your hair. You can then choose to join segments of hair by twisting them with your palm. You can also shave the sides of your head and spike the section of the middle to create an awesome Mohawk. If you're worried about sticking out too often with a Mohawk, you can always smooth it back with a comb and some hair gel for a more mainstream, trendy cut. Deathhawks are a popular hairstyle you can try. [11] X Expert Source Regina Dunn Goth Subculture Enthusiast Expert Interview. 12 July 2021."

      "content": "Ruffle your hair and spray it with spray gel for a messy look. If you're trying to go with a casual look that sends the message that you don't really care about your hair, ruffle it with your hands by rubbing your head in multiple directions. Once you find a configuration of messy hair that you think looks good, use a sculpting spray to set it in place. Edward Scissorhands is a classic goth character that had this kind of haircut!"

      "content": "Choose a beanie, bolero, or top hat if you want headgear. If you don't feel like doing your hair before going out, throw on a unique bolero or top hat if you have Romantic or Victorian sensibilities. If you're into emo or cybergoth, go for a beanie if you want to rock some headgear. There are plenty of beanies with gothic designs and phrases at local boutiques and online retailers. [12] X Research source Stay away from baseball caps. Trucker hats can work if they feature a band name or goth iconography. If you're a cybergoth, you have a lot of freedom when it comes to headgear. If you're heading out for a night of dancing with your friends, the weirder you can get, the better. As long as it's dark, it can fit the cybergoth style. Wigs also tend to be popular in the cybergoth dance scene."

      "content": "Get a black, studded leather belt. The standard goth outfit isn't complete with a black leather belt with plenty of studs or spikes. It's a classic element of the goth uniform and goes with everything in a goth's closet. Get 2-3 different styles with different patterns or spikes to add a little variety. [13] X Research source Fabric belts with bright colors can work if you're going for a steampunk or cybergoth look."

      "title": "Get some wallet chains, studded bracelets, and chokers.",
      "content": "Get some wallet chains, studded bracelets, and chokers. Wallet chains add a little vintage flair to a goth outfit, especially in a rockabilly-inspired context. Studded or leather bracelets are an easy way to accessorize if you feel like you could benefit from some extra accessories. If you're going to wear a necklace, look for tighter necklaces and chokers. [14] X Research source Romantic goths tend to wear a lot of big, decorative rings. No cybergoth outfit is complete without a respirator! There are custom respirators that you can find online that are made specifically with the cybergoth aesthetic in mind. If you're accessorizing on a budget, get some safety pins! They can easily be clipped through ragged clothing items to give them a new life, and you can even wear them as earrings. Goths don't normally wear watches, but if you want to wear one, there are plenty of watches that have studs, spikes, or goth-inspired designed."

      "content": "Use a permanent marker or nail polish to make your nails black. Wear some black nail polish if you want to really subvert expectations. [15] X Expert Source Regina Dunn Goth Subculture Enthusiast Expert Interview. 12 July 2021. You can also use a black permanent marker if you don't have any nail polish available. You can try the look out on 1-2 nails on your nondominant hand if you want to see how people react before you apply it to each of your fingers. [16] X Research source To apply nail polish, dip the brush on the cap in the polish. Stick one of your hands out so that your fingers are spread apart, and keep them still as you apply the polish. Start at the bed of the fingernail and move slowly towards the top of the nail in vertical strips to cover each section. If you're into the steampunk or cybergoth aesthetic, use different colors on each finger to create a rainbow effect."

      "title": "Apply eyeliner",
      "content": "Apply eyeliner around your eyes to really commit to the look. Use a liquid liner and brush or a marker to apply eyeliner to the top and bottom of your eyelids. Sit down in front of a mirror and brush carefully to get even, thin lines around your eyes. If you mess up, use a cotton swab and some liquid oil to dab the spot clean. [17] X Research source Ask a friend to help you out the first time that you try to put it on. This may make the process easier. If you're a vampire goth and really want to push the look to the edge, get some fangs and fake blood to add some drips under your lips! Goth men were not afraid to experiment with fashion and would also wear makeup and nail polish. For instance, Daniel Ash was well-known for his flared eyebrows and Robert Smith was well-known for his red lipstick and smokey eyeshadow combination.

      "title": "Get some tattoos or piercings if you're into body modification.",
      "content": "Get some tattoos or piercings if you're into body modification. Tattoos and piercings are common in goth subcultures. For piercings, ears are a good place to start. Nose rings, lip rings, and septum hoops are an excellent way to take it to the next level. If you're getting tattoos, start with an area of your body that isn't immediately visible to make sure that you like how they look on your body before moving to full sleeves and neck pieces. Stick to occult imagery and black ink. If you're not old enough, get parental consent before you get a piercing or tattoo."
