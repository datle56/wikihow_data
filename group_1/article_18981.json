      "content": "Visit your local track. Short tracks and road courses are spread throughout the world and you may have one in your area. Travel to the tracks and sit in the grandstands. Find out which type of racing appeals to you and watch how the race functions. [1] X Research source Go-karting is an ideal starting point. Go-karts are the cheapest racing vehicle to buy are safest to race. Motorcycle racing has various forms, including road racing, endurance, track racing, and drag racing. Motocross adds jumps. Standard races are simplest for beginners and don’t require more expensive cars with safety modifications. NASCAR is the highest version of stock car racing. Racing is more of a marathon than Formula One and takes place on oval tracks using closed-wheel cars. Many track races in America are similar to this and can be used by beginners with civilian cars. Formula One is the most prestigious racing form and uses open-wheel, aerodynamic cars making circuits on tracks across the world. Formula Two and Indy car are lower-level versions. Open-wheel cars may be less common or more expensive than beginner stock races. Vintage racing is also highly prestigious, but lack the exposure and sponsorship opportunities of Formula One. It also does not have career building potential as a professional driver since most racers are amateurs racing their personal vehicles. However if you intend to hold a regular day job and race as a hobby, vintage racing can be a great way to expand your network with fellow professionals and business owners who are also passionate about cars. Endurance racing, such as 24 Hours of Le Mans, blends physical endurance with strategy and technology over a long period of time. Drag racing involves accelerating quickly to race a short distance in a straight line. Rally racing involves completing driving through any off-track terrain. Street racing is illegal and highly dangerous unless done through sanctioned events."

      "content": "Buy a pit pass. Some racetracks, including those of NASCAR, offer pit passes, which allow you behind the scenes access. Before the race, you’ll get to witness the pit crew making the final tune-ups for the cars. This provides you at least some perspective on car mechanics. Some tracks also offer garage passes, but these are harder to come by and are mostly reserved for staff."

      "content": "Connect with racers and mechanics. Racing is no different than other jobs and activities in that other people can help get your foot in the door. Spend time at the tracks and around the mechanics and drivers, if possible. Also visit auto shops. Make friends and learn from their vehicular and racing knowledge. At first, you may have to volunteer for small jobs in a shop or at a track. Keep working until you gain sufficient knowledge and trust.

Even top-level racers have mechanical knowledge that makes problem-solving and track navigation second nature. Buy an old vehicle or learn how to maintain your own. While race cars are different, the fundamentals you’ll learn, such as changing parts, optimizing speed, and performing maintenance, still apply. Get repair books from the library and consider signing up for shop classes."

This is a safer and cheaper option to get used to how a vehicle handles during a race. Practice at nearby kart tracks. From there, look into buying a kart and entering races. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Attend racing school. There are many different schools. Some of them are a day or two of driving lessons with professional instructors. Others can last a few months and cost thousands of dollars. While the former is good for getting a taste of racing without buying a car, the latter is often required to get an official racing license. [3] X Research source Check the requirements of the racing circuit you want to join. For example, you’ll need a license from a school accredited by the Sports Car Club of America before you can join their sanctioned road races."

      "content": "Get an appropriate make of vehicle. The easiest way to get a vehicle to enter into a race is to have someone who will let you rent or borrow one. If you don’t, you will have to buy one. The kind of vehicle you need depends on the category you wish to enter, but classes are available for even slow civilian cars. You’ll have to search dealerships, junkyards, and sales listings for a seller. Some classes, such as small production sports cars in vintage racing and Improved Touring class in SCCA races, are cheaper and easier to handle for beginners."

      "title": "Fix up your vehicle.",
      "content": "Fix up your vehicle. As long as your racer works and is safe to use, you can enter it in a race and even place well. However, you may want to upgrade to better parts and with a used vehicle you will probably need to make repairs. Give the vehicle a test run then repair systems such as braking and acceleration that feel lacking. Keep a budget. Racing gets very expensive. Remember that you’ll need to spend money on towing, replacing tires, and repairing damage after a race."

You will need to build an audience, so be kind to everyone and display good character. The more visible you are, the more likely you are to attract a sponsor’s attention. Be gracious for opportunities rather than critical. [9] X Research source Once you start gaining some success, you can reach out to companies you like. Reaching out via direct messages on social media or connecting with executives on LinkedIn can be effective. Keep in mind though that they get many such inquiries and have likely already sought out the drivers they want. Once you get a sponsorship, you must represent the brand well. Display their products or advertisements and stay away from controversy."

While you can start a team with your friends or other racers, to join the big teams that offer you benefits, you will need to win and establish yourself as a racer. Do what you did to attract sponsors, since teams often function the same way. Once you develop your reputation, a team may seek you out to represent them. Otherwise, you can try sending them a message and speaking to their representatives. In seeking sponsorships and a team, think of yourself as a brand. Maintain personal responsibility and be friendly, but also market yourself. Establish a media presence, including online. Remember to be graceful even during rejection. Represent yourself well if you want a team to let you represent them."
