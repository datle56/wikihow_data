Just make sure that you learn them correctly and don't mix them up! [5] X Expert Source Ted Dorsey, MA Academic Tutor Expert Interview. 11 December 2019. [6] X Research source Mnemonics are phrases which can help you remember the order of certain things. For example, \"Katy Perry Came Over For Great Songs\" is a great way to remember the biological classifications (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species). Another memory trick is if you have to remember a string of numbers. Instead of trying to remember 2537610925, for example, break it up like a phone number: 253-761-0925. You can break up dates this way too. 14 Oct 1066 (the Battle of Hastings) can become a locker combination: 14-10-66. \"PEMDAS\" is a popular math mnemonic for orders of operations, while \"FANBOYS\" is a well-known English grammar mnemonic for conjunctions.

If you really want to ace those exams, study old and new material every day, or at least several times a week. This will make test-taking a breeze. Take study breaks . When you study, make sure you take a 5â€“10-minute break after every 30 minutes of study. This will help keep your brain from getting overloaded and give it more time to absorb the information. [13] X Trustworthy Source Edutopia Educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation Go to source [14] X Research source On study breaks, try not to fill your brain with more information, even if that information is more about your favourite celebrity's latest concert rather than Winston Churchill's foreign policy. Make study guides for different topics to help you learn and retain information. Summary sheets, flash cards , and mind maps are all great approaches to studying.

      "content": "Study according to a learning style that fits the subject. Certain subjects are easier to understand when studied using a style that connects to the nature of the subject. For instance, if you're studying literature , you'll need visual reading and writing activities. If you're studying music , you'll need auditory resources. For art courses, kinesthetic activities often help. [15] X Research source Learning styles, as conventionally understood, are somewhat controversial. Many academic studies suggest that learners develop subjective preferences for studying material, but these styles don't necessarily mean they learn better through these styles. [16] X Research source Nevertheless, the idea of learning styles still persists even in academic circles. [17] X Research source If a subjective preference for a certain learning style helps motivate you to study, you can still try it."
