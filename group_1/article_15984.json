Since it's a part of your body, it's a very convenient measuring tool even if you're out at fancy restaurant. However, everyone's hands are different, so practice measuring out portions first and compare them to your hands to get an idea of what they should look like. Use these guidelines when trying to estimate a portion size: [1] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source 2 cups will fit into your hands if they were cupped together. This should generally be the size of your total meal. 1 cup or 8 oz is equivalent to your fist. If you have large hands, your fist might equal 10 oz or slightly more than a cup. 1/2 cup or about 4 oz is the size of one cupped palm. 3 oz is about the size of your palm. 1 tablespoon is the size of the tip of your thumb. 1 teaspoon is the size of the tip of your pointer finger."

[3] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source Divide a 10-inch plate so that: A quarter of the plate is reserved for protein-based foods. Another quarter of the plate should be left for starch-based foods. The remaining half of the plate should be divided between fruits and vegetables. Note that fruit shouldn't make up a full half of the plate. At most it should be about a quarter of the plate. Vegetables, however, can be the entire half of the plate."

      "content": "Practice measuring out portions. To improve your ability to estimate a portion when you see it, practice portioning it out at home. Use measuring cups and a food scale to measure out various types of food portions for your meals for one week and pay attention to what the portions look like. Then, measure out portions for one day each week to help calibrate your ability to recognize portion sizes. [4] X Trustworthy Source MedlinePlus Collection of medical information sourced from the US National Library of Medicine Go to source While you can get better at estimating specific portion sizes, in order to get as accurate portion sizes as you can, read the labels on the food you eat to see exactly how big a serving is.

Protein-based foods, even nutritious ones, still need to be measured and portion controlled. [5] X Trustworthy Source American Heart Association Leading nonprofit that funds medical research and public education Go to source In general, if you're measuring or eyeballing protein-based foods, aim for about a 3-4 oz or about a 1/2 cup portion per serving. [6] X Research source If you're estimating this portion size, this will be one small palm full, the size of your checkbook or about the size of a deck of cards. For example, 3-4 oz of chicken, pork or fish is a serving and one and a half to two eggs is a serving. Nuts, although a protein-based food, are higher in fat and come with a smaller serving suggestion. If you're eating nuts, measure out 1 oz of nuts per serving. In general, adults should aim for about two 3-4 oz servings of protein-based foods each day."

      "content": "Eat a 1 or 2 cup serving of dairy. Dairy is a food group that contains a high amount of protein. However, dairy products are still separated into a different food group and have different serving size recommendations. [7] X Research source When you're having a diary based food, serving sizes can vary. Measure 8 oz of liquid dairy and between 1-2 cups of other forms of dairy products. For milk and yogurt, the serving size is 1 cup. If you're eating cottage cheese, the serving size is 2 cups. If you're going to have cheese (like cheddar cheese), the serving size is 2 oz. If you're estimating these portion sizes, 1 cup of yogurt will be about the size of your fist and if you're measuring cheese it'll be the size of a golf ball for a piece, or the size of a CD for a slice. In general, adults should aim for about 3 cups of dairy each day. This does not include high fat dairy options, such as ice cream and butter."

In general, estimate 1 cup for the denser vegetables and 2 cups for those leafy green vegetables. Denser vegetables like broccoli, peppers or beans should be measured at 1 cup. However, if you're going for salad greens like kale or romaine, you should measure out 2 cups per serving. In general, adults should aim for about 3 cups total of vegetables each day."

If you have a whole piece of fruit or cut fruit your portion will be a 1/2 cup. It should be about the size of a tennis ball or computer mouse. [10] X Research source If you're having dried fruit, the portion is smaller. This is because the water has been evaporated out of the fruit leaving behind a higher sugar dried fruit. The portion size for dried fruit is about a 1/4 cup. This is equivalent to two golf balls or about the size of an egg. In general, adults should aim for about 2 cups of fruit each day."

When you're shopping or eating packaged goods, serving information is provided which can give you additional guidance on how much to eat. [14] X Trustworthy Source US Food and Drug Administration U.S. government agency responsible for promoting public health Go to source Packaged foods, like cereal, crackers, soup or salad dressing, will have the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list on the side of the product. This is where you will find the serving size information. Look at your food product and find the nutrition label. The serving size is listed at the top left of the label. The label will provide the serving size in two measurements. It might list a cup measurement, ounces or pieces. It'll also list the serving in a gram amount as well. The label will also tell you how many servings the entire package or container contains. This is helpful if you need to eyeball a serving. For example, if a tub of yogurt says it contains 3 servings, it might be easier to just guess what a third of the tub is, rather than trying to remember what 1 cup looks like."

If you're using a large plate, this can make portion sizes seem smaller than they are and lead to more inaccuracies in your estimation. [15] X Trustworthy Source EatRight.org Organization associated with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics providing advice about food, health, and fitness Go to source Studies have shown that if you eat off of a typical size dinner plate, which can be 12 inches (30.5 cm) or even bigger, you're more likely to overeat. It looks like there is less food on a bigger plate which makes it tempting to overeat. Even if you're using your fist to estimate portion sizes, the extra space on the plate can trick your eyes. Instead of those typical dinner plates, use a salad plate or appetizer plate instead. They're smaller and can make an appropriate serving of food look larger than it is."

[16] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Health information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source If you have difficulty estimating correct portion sizes, try purchasing more pre-packaged or individual items. They're already pre-portioned for your convenience. For example, instead of buying a larger container of yogurt and estimating what 1 cup looks like, purchase the individual yogurt cups. No estimating required. You could also buy pre-sliced cheese instead buying cheese in a block. They're already sliced into the correct portion size. Note, not all pre-portioned items provide one serving. Always check the nutrition panel to see how many servings are per container. If it's more than one, you should account for eating more than 1 serving."

[17] X Research source For example, if you love soups, measure out your ladle. Your ladle may hold a 1/2 cup. You know that if you give yourself two ladles of soup, your total serving will be about 1 cup.

Most people aren't going to bring their food scale or measuring cups, so estimating will be a must. [19] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source Most restaurants are serving portions of food that are much larger than recommended. In addition, many people are ordering an appetizer, larger entree and even dessert. This makes the overall portion size of the meal overly large as well. To help cut down on these sneaky big portions, start splitting items. If you split an entree, you're automatically cutting down the portion size and getting closer to an appropriate serving. You can also try ordering an appetizer for your main meal as well. Appetizers are generally smaller and most likely closer to a normal portion size. You may even want to choose to order items à la carte. For example, get a side salad and order a grilled chicken breast to go on top."
