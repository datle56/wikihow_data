There's no way to manually delete expired subscriptions from your subscription list, but fortunately, they won't stick around forever. Any subscriptions you've canceled or let lapse will automatically disappear one year after their expiration dates. While these old subscriptions may still clog up your list after expiration, you won't be billed for those services. While you wait for it to be removed, you can hide the app from your Apple ID. It's also a good idea to check your Apple subscriptions to make sure you're not still subscribed to services you no longer use. You can also view and cancel subscriptions on your Mac ."
