      "content": "Brush out any tangles. Having smooth, tangle-free hair before you begin will make it easier to part your hair. It will also help make the actual cuts more even. You don’t need to wash your hair before cutting your bob. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Find your natural part.",
      "content": "Find your natural part. Comb your hair all the way back, then push it forward lightly with your fingers toward the front of your head. You should be able to see where your hair naturally tends to split into two sides, exposing a hair line. Then, comb your hair straight down on both sides of the line to make the part clean and distinct. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Split your hair into sections.",
      "content": "Split your hair into sections. First, find the “apex” or highest point on top of your head. Then, draw a line with your comb straight down from the apex to behind your ear. Grab the section of hair in front of the ear and tie it with a hair tie. Repeat this on the other side. [3] X Research source This will leave you with 3 main sections: right, left, and back. If you’re having trouble finding the apex, try placing a comb flat on top of your head. Where the comb rocks is the apex."

      "title": "Pull the back section into a ponytail with a hair tie.",
      "content": "Pull the back section into a ponytail with a hair tie. Make sure the ponytail is centered, and as low and close to your neck as possible. Slide the hair tie down to adjust for the length of the bob, if needed. [4] X Research source The farther down you slide the hair tie, the longer your bob will be. How much you adjust the length depends on your personal preference and vision! Use a hand mirror to see the back of your head. Angle the mirror and check to see that the ponytail is centered and tied at the desired length."

      "content": "Cut straight across the back section ponytail with your hair scissors or shears. Cut right underneath the hair tie to make sure you get the desired length! [5] X Research source Though it may be more convenient to use regular scissors that you already own, try to use a pair of hair scissors or shears if possible. This will make the cutting process easier and cleaner, as the blade will be sharper and more precise. It’s fine if the first cut isn’t perfect. Just trim off the jagged parts with your cutting tool until your hair is straight. It can be tough to cut the back of your own hair—you might want to ask someone to help you with this part.

      "content": "Let down the two side sections. Now that you’ve completed the basic cut on the back section, you’ll want to work on the sides to achieve the bob shape. Remove the two side sections from their hair ties and brush out any tangles to make sure your hair is still smooth. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut the two side sections to form diagonal lines.",
      "content": "Cut the two side sections to form diagonal lines. To get the A-line look, you want the ends of your hair to be shorter in the back and longer in the front: using a hair razor comb, begin shaving the ends of the side sections so that they blend into the back to form smooth diagonal lines. Hold the hair razor parallel to the ground and make downward motions, beginning from the back of the side section and working towards the front of your face. [8] X Research source If you want your bob to be blunter, shave the side section ends so that they’re an even length that matches the back, instead of creating a tapered diagonal."

      "title": "Taper the rest of the look to match the sides and back.",
      "content": "Taper the rest of the look to match the sides and back. At this point, you’ve accomplished cutting the basic bob! Now, you can repeat the same cutting technique on the rest of your head to make your bob as smooth as possible: grab sections of hair from around your head that look abrupt or jagged, and taper the ends down with your razor by making downwards motions. [9] X Research source There isn’t a certain amount you have to taper⁠, or certain sections to taper down—it just depends on what you want to see in the final product. For instance, you might cut the bob to be more boxy or more round. [10] X Expert Source Martin Nepton Professional Hair Stylist Expert Interview. 17 November 2020."

      "title": "Create more layers, if desired.",
      "content": "Create more layers, if desired. Once the rest of your bob is smoothed out, you can consider adding layers. This is totally optional⁠—it just adds texture and makes the bob less harsh and bulky. If you decide that you want to add layers, try a point cutting technique: comb a section of hair out from your head and pinch it with your fingers so that the ends are exposed and stick straight out. With your other hand, angle the scissors so that they are parallel to your hair, then cut by lightly opening and closing the scissors on the ends of the hair. Repeat on different hair sections as needed. [11] X Research source When point cutting, be aware that angling the scissors instead of keeping them parallel to your hair will cause more hair to be cut off. You can use scissors, shears, razors, or clippers to point cut."

      "title": "Put on the final touches.",
      "content": "Put on the final touches. If you see any other abrupt edges or layers that you don’t want, now is the time to smooth things out. Using your razor, grab the outstanding sections and blend with the same downwards motion. Also check that your bob is even on both sides: if it’s more A-line, make sure the diagonal line is smooth, and if it's more blunt, make sure the ends all line up evenly. Once you’re happy with the look, you're done! [12] X Research source"
