[1] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. This doesn’t mean go crazy with sugars and bad fats – your diet should be balanced and healthy. The best way to keep track of your calories is by recording what you eat and how much you burn. To gain weight, increase your calorie intake gradually, starting with 200-300 more calories per day. Over the course of a few weeks or a month, try to work up to 500 more calories every day. [2] X Research source Use a notebook, app or website like MyFitnessPal to total up your day’s calories. This requires reading food labels, being meticulous about recording ingredients, and being aware of portion size. Also record what exercise you did that day and how many calories you burned (as close as possible). A surplus of 500 calories per day will help you gain 1 pound per week. A great way to add calories is by eating “good fats,” like olive oil, nuts, and flaxseed. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Try to eat five meals per day. [4] X Research source The best way to time your eating is to eat consistently throughout the day. Of course, if you work or go to school, you may not find time for full sit-down meals. Keep protein-rich snacks with you between meals like almonds, raw sunflower seeds, and peanuts. You can also try to sub in a protein shake during the day between whole meals. You’ll do better spacing meals out multiple times throughout the day than trying to eat 1-2 extremely calorie-heavy meals in a sitting. Definitely do not skip breakfast. Try to include fresh fruits or vegetables, carbohydrates, and proteins in your breakfast."

      "content": "Keep track of your protein intake. To put on muscle mass, try to eat at least 1.44 calories of protein per pound of your body weight. Also remember to shoot for 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily (about 0.36 grams per pound). [5] X Research source For example, if you weigh 180 pounds (81.6 kg), you want to get 259 calories from protein every day. At this weight you should try to have about 64.8 grams (2.3 oz) of protein that day. Eat high-protein foods like lean meats (beef, chicken, turkey), beans, peas, lentils, hemp seeds, chia, eggs, oats, cottage cheese, milk, quinoa, tuna, and peanut butter. Your best choices for high-quality protein are beef, yogurt, milk, eggs, cheese, poultry, and fish. [6] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview. 18 October 2019. Try protein shakes with whey powder base. Whey is a commonly used protein supplement."

      "content": "Include carbohydrates in your diet. Carbs are your body’s main source of energy, and eating them with protein can help your body turn the protein into muscle. Try to have a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of carbs to proteins in your meals. Plan meals in advance by reading labels and using your notebook or app to track protein and carbs, as well as calories. [7] X Research source Have fruit and veggies at every meal with a 3:1 ratio with carbs. Add carbs to your protein shake to get a great boost of both. This is great for after a workout."

Getting the carbs and protein your body needs sets you up to build muscle, but in order to put those building blocks to work you have to train. There are generally two kinds of exercise: aerobic exercise like running and swimming, which gets your heart rate up, and anaerobic exercise like weight lifting – the second is what builds muscle. [8] X Research source Aim for 3 weekly sessions of weight training; there’s no need to hit the gym every day. [9] X Research source Start slowly so you don’t strain your muscles. Talk to your doctor before starting a new workout regimen, especially if you have any medical issues or are over 40 years old. Consider hiring a personal trainer to help you stay safe and motivated! [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you go at it alone, always be safe with workout equipment. Know how any equipment works before you use it, don’t use it under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Only use as much weight as is safe for you.

      "content": "Limit your cardio. Aerobic exercise like running, biking, and swimming is great for losing weight and burning calories, which is not your goal. You don’t have to completely avoid cardio exercise, but keep it to a minimum. If you do go for a run, for instance, use a website or app to estimate how many calories you burned and try to make up for it. 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio per week is a good limit. If you are already active in your daily life, count that towards these values."

NEAT stands for \"Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis,\" and it refers to everything you do throughout the day that isn't formal exercise, including walking across a parking lot, playing an instrument, cleaning or making dinner, and fidgeting in your chair. The calories burned by these activities can add up throughout the day. For example, an hour of household chores burns about 180 calories, [18] X Research source and fidgeting while sitting or standing burns 40-60 calories more per hour than remaining still. [19] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source NEAT can amount to up to 2,000 calories per day, depending on one's occupation and leisure activities. [20] X Research source If you find that you naturally fidget a lot, learning to control the nervous habit may be able to save you some calories. If you pace or fidget because you’re nervous, try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or a few minutes of meditation. If your extra movements are just a habit, pay closer attention and remain mindful. Sit with your feet planted firmly on the ground so you don’t tap your foot or shake your leg. Otherwise, focus on keeping your body still and calm.
