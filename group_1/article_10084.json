      "content": "Season the chuck roast with salt, pepper, and paprika. Place the chuck roast on a flat surface and season the top liberally with an even mixture of salt, pepper, and paprika. Flip the chuck roast over and season the bottom side as well, leaving the sides bare. If the chuck roast is frozen, defrost it in your fridge or microwave before cooking it. Leave the seasoned chuck roast in your fridge overnight for a stronger flavor."

      "title": "Chop and season the vegetables.",
      "content": "Chop and season the vegetables. Chop the onions, carrots, and potatoes and place them in an airtight zip-top plastic bag. Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil and the dry onion soup mix to the bag and shake to coat the vegetables in the seasoning. [1] X Research source For a milder seasoning, you can toss the vegetables with a mix of salt and pepper instead."

      "title": "Heat 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil in a skillet.",
      "content": "Heat 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil in a skillet. Place a skillet over your stove and turn it to medium heat. Coat the skillet in the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil and let the pan heat up until the surface begins to crackle. [2] X Research source Choose an oven-safe skillet if you plan to bake your chuck roast so you can put it directly in the oven."

      "title": "Brown the roast on each side for 4-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Brown the roast on each side for 4-5 minutes. Place the roast in the pan and sear the bottom side for 4-5 minutes or until it turns brown, Then, flip the roast over and sear the other side for 4-5 minutes or until it browns as well. [3] X Research source This will create a crust over the roast that helps keep in moisture and flavor while you cook it. At this stage, the center of the chuck roast will still be raw. You will cook the entire roast by baking or slow cooking it later on."

      "content": "Remove the chuck roast and place it on a plate. Remove the seared chuck roast from the skillet and set it on a plate. If you won't be finishing the roast in the oven or slow cooker within 2 hours, wrap it in tin foil and put it in the fridge Do not leave the chuck roast out at room temperature for any longer than 2 hours to prevent food poisoning."

      "content": "Saute the chopped vegetables for 5-10 minutes. Place the chopped vegetables in the skillet for about 5-10 minutes or until the onions become translucent, and the carrots and potatoes have a softer texture. [4] X Research source Like the roast, the vegetables will have more time to cook thoroughly while you bake or slow cook them."

      "content": "Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). While searing your chuck roast, turn on your oven so it has time to heat up before you cook the meat. Try to preheat the oven at least 30 minutes before you cook the roast so it reaches 350 °F (177 °C) when your roast is ready to bake. [5] X Research source You can use a slow cooker instead of an oven for a juicier, more tender roast. Keep in mind, however, that slow cooking meats may take several hours longer."

      "title": "Cover the chuck roast and vegetables in tin foil.",
      "content": "Cover the chuck roast and vegetables in tin foil. Place your chuck roast and vegetables in a baking pan or oven-safe skillet. Cover the top of the chuck roast and vegetables in tin foil, pressing the ends of the foil with your fingers to secure it tightly on top. [6] X Research source Make sure your skillet is oven-safe before you cover it in tin foil. Not every skillet is oven-safe, and you may ruin your chuck roast if you use the wrong skillet. You can also put your chuck roast in a dutch oven as an alternative to covering a pan in tin foil."

Take the roast out of the oven when the meat browns and develops a tender, pull-apart texture. [7] X Research source Use a meat thermometer to make sure the roast is done cooking before you take it out. To prevent foodborne illnesses, the center of the roast should reach at least 145 °F (63 °C)."

Let the chuck roast rest, covered, for 30 minutes and then serve alongside the potatoes and vegetables. This lets the juices redistribute throughout the roast so the end result is a softer, more flavorful piece of meat. When removing the tin foil, turn your face away to shield it from the hot steam emitting from the roast. [8] X Research source"
