      "content": "Since Virgos tend to overthink their texts, start the exchange yourself. Send him a sweet “good morning” text to kick things off and let him know that you’re thinking about him. Virgo men struggle with texting sometimes because they’re trying to think of the perfect message to send and second-guessing every word choice. Once you set the tone of your exchange, he’ll have an easier time answering. [1] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. For example: “Good morning, handsome!” “Thinking of you. Hope you’re having a lovely day!” “I had a great time hanging out the other day. What have you been up to? 😊”"

      "content": "Appeal to his dry sense of humor with funny, entertaining texts. It’s easy to miss Virgo’s subtle humor but make no mistake: these guys are quick to come up with jokes, especially sarcastic quips, and clever witticisms. Show him that you get his sense of humor by texting him flirtatious jokes and memes and responding to his jokes with an appreciative “Lol!” [2] X Research source “Do you ever get exhausted from running through my mind? It’s gotta be such a workout.” “I just saw this meme, and thought it’d make you chuckle. 😆” “That story you told was hilarious! My cheeks are seriously in pain. 🤣” Virgos don't enjoy crude or simple humor, so save your R-rated jokes for someone else!"

      "title": "Virgos look for a partner as smart and thoughtful as they are.",
      "content": "Virgos look for a partner as smart and thoughtful as they are. Send texts that engage your Virgo’s mind and simultaneously show him the kind of intelligent conversations he can keep having with you as the relationship develops. Bring up your favorite books, or text him about a recent news story. Text him about subjects you think he’ll like, but save political talk and depressing articles for in-person discussions. [3] X Research source “Have you listened to this podcast yet? I’m dying to talk about it with someone!” “Want to check out the local art museum sometime? I hear they have a great collection.” “I just saw this article in the news, and I wanted to hear your thoughts!”"

      "content": "Do your best to build up his self-esteem, as Virgo men can be self-critical. By complimenting him, you can strengthen your bond with your Virgo and make him more invested in the relationship. Compliment his looks, work ethic, loyalty, intellect, or any other traits that you appreciate. Be sincere and specific so that your Virgo knows you truly mean every word. “You always look so handsome and polished every time I see you!” “You have such strong attention to detail in everything you do. I’m inspired by how hard you work to meet your goals.” “I love talking to you. You show me new perspectives when we talk, and you’re always so thoughtful with everything you say.”"

      "title": "Keep him guessing to appeal to his love of puzzles.",
      "content": "Keep him guessing to appeal to his love of puzzles. When you text him, drop hints that you have more to say or new stories that he hasn’t heard yet. Virgos tend to use texting as a lead-in to meeting in person rather than as a replacement for it, so tell him about your life while leaving out some major details. He’ll be eager to see you face-to-face and learn more. For example: “Oh, I’m from a small town in New York. What about you?” “I have a crazy story about that! I’ll tell you the whole thing the next time I see you. 😉” “I can’t wait to see you later! There’s so much I want to talk about with you. 😊”"

      "content": "Due to their sensible nature, Virgo men respond to practical questions. He’s more down-to-earth than emotional, so leaving too much to the imagination when you flirt may confuse him. Instead, flirt with him by asking for his help or a recommendation. Ask for information and add a personal touch, so he knows that you’re flirting rather than being friendly. “Know any good sushi places? I figure you must since you have such great taste.” “What’s a favorite movie of yours that I would be surprised to know you like? (And when can we watch it?)” “What are your favorite weekend activities? I wanna know…for science. 😘”"

      "content": "Virgos are unapologetically honest and want the same from their partners. Show him that you’re the same person over text that you are in person. Be consistent, yet flexible with your Virgo crush. [4] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. When he sees that you’re honest and open around him, your Virgo man will feel more comfortable relaxing around you too. Try not to overthink your texts and don’t be afraid to disagree. Just be honest and respectful, and you’ll win his affection. “I didn’t care for that movie, but I think your perspective on it is really interesting! I might have to give it a rewatch now. 😉 Thank you for sharing!” “I’m really into classical music, but I can’t get any of my friends to give it a chance. Want to check out a concert with me? I promise we’ll have a good time! 🥺”"

      "content": "A Virgo man has more conservative taste in photos. Nudes or overly suggestive photos aren’t Virgo’s style, but a flattering photo in the right context will drive him crazy. Find a good excuse to snap a photo of yourself, like asking for his opinion on your new blouse. Let him admire your good looks without revealing too much, and make him crave even more! “I just found the BEST coffee shop. Check out this cappuccino art!” “I’m trying on dresses for a work event. What do you think of this one? I think it’s my favorite. 😉” “I don’t know what kind of flowers these are, but they make for a gorgeous selfie background! Ever seen them before?”"

      "title": "Send him lighthearted messages since Virgos appreciate optimism.",
      "content": "Send him lighthearted messages since Virgos appreciate optimism. Long and emotional conversations are best saved for when you see your Virgo in person, as he won’t like having them over text. When you flirt with your Virgo man over text, limit the flirting to one or two lines (as opposed to whole paragraphs of romantic thoughts) and be sweet without getting too sappy. For example: “I’ve been thinking about you all day. Want to grab dinner with me tomorrow?” “Good luck with your presentation at work today! You’re going to knock it out of the park. 😘” “You looked really cute last night. When can we do it again?”"

      "content": "Virgos are true gentlemen and prefer classy flirtatious exchanges. While he might be interested in stepping it up and exchanging steamy texts with you, you are better off waiting for him to ask for them. In the meantime, mirror his polite demeanor with wholesome flirts, and steer clear of raunchy or explicit texts—especially when you’re still getting to know him. “I wish you were here next to me right now.” “You’re all I can think about today!” “You look handsome today—and I know that because you look handsome every day. 😉”"

      "content": "A cautious Virgo will want to take their time with romance. Make sure that he doesn’t feel pressured to text back, and give your Virgo the space he needs to decide that you’re the right person for him. Be patient and resist the urge to double-text if it takes him time to respond to you sometimes. [5] X Expert Source Jessica Lanyadoo Astrologer & Psychic Medium Expert Interview. 12 November 2019. Send him your flirty text, and occupy yourself with other activities while you wait for his response. Sometimes he won’t be in the mood to text! If he’s slow to respond, it likely has nothing to do with your relationship—Virgos just aren’t the most active texters of the zodiac. Double-texting (or following up with several texts at once) might make your Virgo feel smothered. It’s better to give him space and let him respond on his own time. When you’re still getting to know one another, leave a little space between your responses too. Don’t leave him on read for days; go about your life and text him back when you have a moment."
