However, as long as your photos, videos, contacts, and personal data are synced to your Google account, it'll resync back to your device once you sign back in. After resetting your phone, change your Google account password if the hacker has access to your account. You can do so in the Settings app—just go to Google > Manage your Google Account > Security > \"'Signing in to Google\"' > Password to do so from your device. [5] X Research source"
