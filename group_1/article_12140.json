      "title": "Use a chainsaw to level the top of the stump.",
      "content": "Use a chainsaw to level the top of the stump. The top of your stump may not be flat and smooth, but it will need to be in order for you to make your planter. Turn a chainsaw on and then cut off the top 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) as evenly as possible. The chainsaw should cut through the wood quickly and easily. [1] X Research source If you don’t already have a chainsaw and just want to use one for small projects like this one, choose an electric chainsaw over a gas chainsaw. The chainsaw that you use should have a guide bar that’s 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer than the diameter of the stump. Make sure that you wear safety glasses, gloves, safety pants, cut-resistant safety boots, head protection, and hearing protection when you use your chainsaw. [2] X Research source You can expect your chainsaw to cost about $50-$200 USD."

      "title": "Cut the perimeter of the planter with a jigsaw.",
      "content": "Cut the perimeter of the planter with a jigsaw. After you’ve created a relatively smooth, flat surface, use a pencil to draw a circle onto it as big as you’d like the planter to be. Use a drill and a 1 ⁄ 2 inch (1.3 cm) drill bit to drill a hole along the drawn circle. Then, insert a jigsaw into the hole and follow the line as you saw. [3] X Research source If you don’t already have a jigsaw, get one with an average motor power of around 5 amps or 18V and a maximum speed of about 3,000 SPM. Go with a jigsaw that has advanced orbital capabilities so that you can make smooth curved cuts. To avoid injury, wear eye protection and be mindful of where you place your fingers while you’re working. Make sure to take out the battery pack or unplug the cord before you change out blades or reposition the jigsaw. [4] X Research source Jigsaws usually cost $50-$300 USD."

      "title": "Hollow out the center with an axe.",
      "content": "Hollow out the center with an axe. Use an axe to break up the wood located inside of the outline you made. Try to chip away at the center of the stump as much you can with the axe, while being careful to keep your aim inside the outline. [5] X Research source Ideally, the planter should be about 6 inches (15 cm) deep. Keep this in mind while you use the axe on the stump. If you don’t already have an axe, consider getting either a small axe or a limbing axe for this project. These typically weigh 1.5-3 pounds (0.7-1.4 kg) and are 20–28 inches (51–71 cm) long. An axe should cost you about $20-$50 USD. To use your axe safely, get a good grip on it and only use it away from others when you have plenty of light to see what you’re doing. Also, stone-sharpen the blade regularly and keep the blade in a sheath when it isn’t being used. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Weaken the wood with a drill.",
      "content": "Weaken the wood with a drill . Once you’ve broken up and removed a lot of the wood, start using a drill to drill holes in different spots within the circle outline you created. Direct the drill up and down repeatedly until most of the wood within the circle is broken up into small pieces. [7] X Research source Once you’re done, put down the drill and scoop out any loose wood inside of the stump. If you don’t already own a drill, go for a ⅜-inch (0.9 cm) cordless power drill for maximum mobility and versatility. Power drills typically cost about $50-$200 USD. Wear safety glasses, ear protection, and gloves while using your drill. Unplug the cord or remove the battery when you change out the bit and be careful with where you place your fingers while you work."

      "title": "Use a hammer and chisel to chip away at the weakened wood.",
      "content": "Use a hammer and chisel to chip away at the weakened wood. Look around the inside of the stump for wood that still needs to be removed. Hold your chisel in your non-dominant hand, and rest the end of the chisel on one of those areas. Then, chip it away from the rest of the stump by tapping a hammer, held in your dominant hand, onto the other end of the chisel. Continue doing this until you’ve chipped off all of the wood you want removed. [8] X Research source For this project, you’ll need a nail hammer and a wood chisel. Hammers typically cost between $15-$50 USD and chisels are usually $10-$20 USD each. Wear safety glasses and focus on your aim while using a hammer and chisel to prevent injuries.

      "content": "Drill drainage holes into the sides of the stump. To prevent root rot in your plants and flowers, you’ll need to drill some holes into the bottom of the planter. Hold your drill against the outside of the stump on the other side of the planter and drill all the way through to the bottom of the planter on the inside of the stump. Do this 2-3 more times, spaced evenly around the circumference of the stump. [10] X Research source"

      "content": "Attach a door and windows to the outside of the stump. To make a basic fairy house, you’ll need a very small door and a few tiny windows. Purchase these online or paint them onto the stump as an easy option. As an artsy alternative option, make the doors and windows yourself out of popsicle sticks or other crafting supplies. Use a hot glue gun or a hammer and nails to attach the door and windows to the stump. If you want to make stained glass windows, hot glue pieces of sea glass to the stump on the inside of the window frame. [12] X Research source"

      "content": "Set a roof on top of the stump. Measure how wide the top of the stump is to determine how wide the angle of the roof should be. Use hot glue or wood glue to attach the edges of 2 small, thin pieces of plywood together to make a simple roof. Place the roof over the surface of the stump. Consider painting the plywood a color of your choice after you glue it together. Let the paint dry completely before you set the roof over the stump’s surface. If you’re familiar with woodworking, you can also cut small rectangles of wood and attach them to the surface of the plywood to make shingles. [13] X Research source"

Use these things to make cute additions to the outside of the home, such as a little walkway leading to the front door. Go online and purchase 1 or 2 fairies and several accessories, such as tiny wagons or benches, to set in front of the home.

      "content": "Sand and seal the surface of the stump. In order to make your mosaic, you must have a flat, smooth, waterproof surface to work on. Run a piece of sandpaper back and forth all over the surface of the stump to flatten any sharp edges. Then, coat the surface of the stump with a waterproof sealer to keep the stump from absorbing moisture and expanding and contracting as a result. You want to prevent this because it can cause your mosaic to crack. [15] X Research source"
