What songs would be on the soundtrack of your life? What are you the most grateful for? If you could have dinner with anyone, living or dead, who would you choose? What would you eat, and what would you talk about? What have you accomplished that you're most proud of? What would be your weapon of choice in the zombie apocalypse?

Laughter triggers the release of feel-good chemicals that make you feel happy to be around each other, which means you'll feel safer being vulnerable and opening up. Here are some questions that might potentially get the giggles flowing: If you could understand what animals are saying, which one do you think would be the rudest? Can you give an impression of what it would sound like? What's the best joke you've ever heard? Can you make me laugh solely by making weird facial expressions? What's the most ridiculous thing you've ever looked up online? Would you rather fight a human-sized duck or the number of regular-sized ducks equal to the weight of an average human? How big is an average human? Which meme best represents your life as a whole? What fashion trend did you follow in the past that's cringe to look back on now? What's a word that you pronounced incorrectly for years before anyone told you?"

The secret is to ask questions that scratch below the surface and require a little introspection to answer. These types of questions also help you unlock more commonalities or learn about something you're not familiar with. Get started with these questions that focus on the best things in life: What is the healthiest thing you do to take care of yourself? What is your favorite guilty pleasure? What food or dish most reminds you of home? What's your favorite thing to do when you have 15 minutes to burn? How would you describe your perfect day? If you had 2 extra hours in a day, how would you spend them? What do you think about the most when you let your mind wander and aren't actively thinking about anything? Do you prefer going out and being active or staying in and relaxing? What's your favorite way to be active or get exercise? Where is your favorite place to be active? What's the most recent thing you've learned? What would most people think is your most unexpected interest? Is there anything that you're secretly good at? If not, tell me about something you wish you were secretly good at. When was the last time you sang to someone? What's something you're really good at making or building? Is there something you used to really enjoy that you stopped doing? What made you stop? What's keeping you from doing it again?"

If you could do anything you wanted and money was no object, what would you do? If someone gave you money to start a business, what kind of business would you start? What was the first thing you ever bought with your own money? If you get a windfall of money, is your instinct to spend it, save it, or invest it?
