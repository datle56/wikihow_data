      "content": "Zip the zipper if the hoodie has one on it. Locate the zipper if the hoodie has one and connect the 2 sides so you can move the slider to close the teeth. Zip it all of the way up so the hoodie dries evenly and doesn’t form wrinkles or folds. [1] X Research source Connecting both sides of the hoodie will help prevent the fabric from stretching or warping while it air-dries. If the zipper is damaged or broken, try fixing it so you can zip up the hoodie."

      "title": "Lay the hoodie flat on top of a dry towel.",
      "content": "Lay the hoodie flat on top of a dry towel. Place a clean dry towel on a flat surface such as a table or countertop so it’s spread open. Then, lay the hoodie on top of the towel so it’s flat. Place the arms of the hoodie at its sides so they’re straight. [2] X Research source Even if you ran the hood through a spin cycle in your washing machine, there’s still some excess moisture you can remove before you air-dry it."

      "title": "Press down on the hoodie to squeeze out the excess water.",
      "content": "Press down on the hoodie to squeeze out the excess water. Place your hands on top of it and press straight down to squeeze out as much water as you can. Don’t twist or wring out the hoodie or you’ll stretch the fibers and cause it to dry with wrinkles. [3] X Research source Be sure to press on every part of the hoodie to help it dry evenly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Roll the hoodie up in another dry towel and squeeze it.",
      "content": "Roll the hoodie up in another dry towel and squeeze it. Take another clean, dry towel and lay it flat. Place the hoodie on top of the towel so it’s flat and the sleeves are straight on the side of it. Roll up the towel from the bottom so the hoodie is rolled inside of it. Squeeze the towel with your hands to press out even more water from the hoodie. [4] X Research source Don’t twist or fold the rolled towel to squeeze it or you’ll stretch the hoodie out and create wrinkles in it."

    {
      "title": "Place the hoodie on a flat surface in a dry location.",
      "content": "Place the hoodie on a flat surface in a dry location. Unroll the hoodie from the towel and lay it flat on a drying rack or on top of another dry towel on a surface such as a table, desk, or counter. Make sure the arms are straight and there aren’t any wrinkles or folds in the hoodie. [5] X Research source Avoid damp rooms like a bathroom or the hoodie could develop mold or smell. Don’t put the damp hoodie on a hanger or the weight of it will stretch the fibers."

      "title": "Allow the hoodie to air dry for 8-10 hours.",
      "content": "Allow the hoodie to air dry for 8-10 hours. Leave the hoodie undisturbed so it dries evenly. Let it air-dry overnight or for at least 8 hours so all of the fabric is dry. Check the material by touching it with your hands to make sure it’s fully dry before you wear it. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Check the tag for specific drying instructions.",
      "content": "Check the tag for specific drying instructions. Locate the tag on the inside of the hoodie. Read it to see if there are specific instructions you need to follow in order to machine-dry the hoodie without damaging or shrinking it. If there are, be sure to follow the instructions for the best results. [7] X Research source For instance, if the tag says to machine-dry on medium heat, then follow the instructions."

      "title": "Zip the zipper up all of the way if there is one.",
      "content": "Zip the zipper up all of the way if there is one. If the hoodie has a zipper, zip it up all of the way so it dries evenly and doesn’t develop folds or creases in the fabric. If it’s possible, tuck the zipper inside of the neck of the hoodie so it doesn’t catch on the walls of the dryer. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "Set your dryer to a low heat and tumble setting.",
      "content": "Set your dryer to a low heat and tumble setting. Find the dials that control the tumble speed and the heat setting for the dryer. Turn the dials to the lowest possible setting to prevent the hoodie from shrinking or being damaged. If the dryer has a no-heat option, set it to that so your hoodie is tumble-dried only. [9] X Research source A low tumble setting will help keep your hoodie from getting wrinkled."

      "title": "Put the hoodie in the dryer by itself.",
      "content": "Put the hoodie in the dryer by itself. Open the dryer door, place the hoodie inside of it, and close the door securely. Avoid adding any other items to the dryer so your hoodie dries evenly and doesn’t attract lint or dirt from other fabrics. [10] X Research source If you’re drying multiple hoodies, or you have additional clothing items you need to dry, keep the load small so your hoodie is able to tumble easily and freely. Mixing heavier items, like a wet hoodie, with lighter items, such as shirts or undergarments, can cause some of the items to be overdried and other items to still be damp."

      "content": "Start the dryer and check the hoodie every 15 minutes until it’s dry. Once you’ve adjusted the settings and placed your hoodie in the dryer, locate the button or knob that starts the dryer. Activate the dryer and leave the hoodie to tumble for at least 15-20 minutes. Check on the hoodie periodically and remove it from the dryer as soon as it’s dry to avoid any possible shrinkage. [11] X Research source If you set your dryer to a no-heat setting, it may take up to an hour to dry your hoodie."
