      "title": "Show off your sense of humor—it’s an attractive quality!",
      "content": "Show off your sense of humor—it’s an attractive quality! A sense of humor is one of the most attractive qualities a man can have. When we laugh at a good joke, the “reward center” of our brain fires, just like when we eat good food, accomplish something, or have sex. [1] X Research source If you want to keep someone laughing after a match, plan a fun activity for your first date! “Some say I have a dad bod, I consider it more of a father figure.” “Looking for love in all the wrong places (online).” “If I were a fruit, I’d be a fine-apple, but if I were a vegetable, would you visit me in the hospital?” “Swipe right if you go to therapy. Swipe left if it’s all you talk about.” “It’s cool if you just want to play with my dog. I’ll sit in the crate while you guys hang out.” “Not looking for anything serious, just a job that pays 100k and the love of my life.” “Looking for my keys! I think I left them at your place if you want to have me over for a look-see.” “I’ve got a closet full of sweaters and I’m incredibly forgetful.” “I’m terrified of speed bumps, but I’m slowly getting over it.” [2] X Research source “Dogs love me, I’ve got a great butt, and I’ve never been in jail (except when playing monopoly).”"

      "content": "Flaunt your creativity and wit with a snappy, clever bio. Whether you’re making a pun , referencing a famous pop culture phenomenon, or just making a witty observation about the online dating process, a clever bio is a great way to show off your humor and smarts. Intelligence is a highly attractive quality—studies show that if you appear intelligent, people will assume you have other positive qualities, too! [3] X Research source “So I’m actually from the future where we have been married for 20 years. I came back in time to settle an argument over when and where our first date was.” “I’ve got ✨Styles✨ , but I ain’t Harry.” “Cooler than the other side of your pillow.” “Free psychological evaluation based on your profile.” “Willing to lie about where we met.” “Match me if you can.” “Cute enough to steal your heart, smart enough to revive it.” “I’m currently training for a Netflix marathon, so I could use a partner for the cardio workouts.” [4] X Research source “I love a good story, but I’ve read and watched all of the best. Now, I’d like to hear about you.” “Well, the last time I was someone’s type, I was donating blood.”"

      "content": "Try a cute and flirty bio to catch a match’s attention. Test out your rizz lines to make your potential next date chuckle (and maybe blush a little). A playful and flirty bio shows that you’re confident, outgoing, and perhaps a bit charming—all attractive qualities to anyone looking for a match! “Feel free to add me to your to-do list.” “I’ll let you steal my hoodies.” “Why pick flowers when you can just pick me?” “You look like my new favorite notification.” “I love your lipstick, I wonder what it would look like on me.” “What movie do you want to pretend to watch when you come over?” “Looking for fwb (friend with boat).” [5] X Research source “I lost the directions, but I’m pretty sure you have to swipe right here.” “How about I come over and fix that broken thing in your apartment?” “Tall, smart, hot, valedictorian, prom king,…that’s my brother. He’s getting married soon. I’m similar but I can cook.”"

      "content": "Showcase your interests to find common ground and encourage messaging. If you have a hobby or interest you love and want to share with your future special someone, mention it! Talking about your interests shows who you are and gives potential matches something to message you about. They may share your interest or have questions about it if they’ve never dabbled. “It’s 2025. Yes, I’m into bouldering.” “Looking for my undercover partner to infiltrate the city’s writing groups.” “Working on setting up my own stall at the farmer’s market, but for now I’m just looking to buy a vegetable on a date.” “Grad student looking for love. Hit me up for all your 17th-century history needs.” “I’m trying to hit every coffee shop in town. Want to join?” “Just started training my new dog. Swipe right if you want to hear me give some commands.” “Wedding photographer by day, short filmmaker by night. Want to be my new muse?” “Catch me at every mid-size indie music venue in the city.” “When I’m not cycling, I’m probably thinking about cycling (and candy).” “Looking for someone to taste test my latest bakery confection. And yes, you can lick the spoon.”"

      "content": "Use a snappy bio to stand out and avoid looking like a try-hard. Sometimes, a lengthy bio can make it seem like you’re really trying for a match. On the other hand, something succinct and memorable screams confidence and can make a good impression without cluttering your profile. [6] X Research source One easy way to write a simple bio is to just state a unique or (playfully) controversial opinion you have, like: “Nothing tastes better with truffle oil.” “The only thing capers are good for is to ruin a dish.” “Cold pizza is better than warm pizza.” “‘May the fourth be with you’ is a mega cringey and weak pun.” “Watching a movie at home is better than watching a movie in theaters.” “Strawberries are the most disappointing fruit.” “Bidets are better than toilet paper.” “The best way to sleep is naked.” “Coffee smells 100x better than it tastes.”"

      "content": "Drop a hint for something physical, if that’s what brings you online. Of course, not everyone on a dating app is looking for sweet romance—some just want some fun for the night. If that sounds like you, be open and playful about it in your bio so potential matches know what they’re getting into. One note of warning—most women don’t respond well to blunt sexual messages, so avoid the X-rated talk until you’re sure that’s what she wants. [7] X Research source “I’m here to give you a night you’ll never forget. Ready to break some rules?” “I’m all about fun and games… and maybe a little bit more.” “Looking for someone to heat things up and keep them sizzling all night long.” “Can you handle a night of passion and pleasure? Swipe right to find out.” “I’m like a rollercoaster—fast, thrilling, and guaranteed to leave you breathless.” “Why waste time? Let’s get straight to the fun part.” “Here for a good time and some unforgettable nights. Ready to join me?” “Looking for someone to keep me company tonight and maybe all night long.” “Here for a good time, not a long time. Swipe right if you’re on the same page.” “Not here to play games—unless they’re in the bedroom.”"

      "content": "Keep your bio relatable, charming, and simple on Tinder. Tinder’s got a reputation for being a lighthearted app where users are looking for everything from long-term relationships to a one-night stand. You can adjust your bio to be as personal or playful as you like, depending on the type of match you’re looking for. To start, try something that shows off your sense of humor to get attention. Include a playful call to action or a fact about yourself or what you want from the app to round it out. [8] X Research source “Current relationship status: Tonight I made dinner for two, and I ate both.” [9] X Research source “If you can guess my favourite flavour of ice cream, you win bonus points. If you can guess what toppings I’d choose, I’ll propose.” “The key to my heart is letting me win at board games. Or at least helping me improve my skills.” “The most erotic moment of my life was when the melted cheese of my first pizza slice clung to the rest of the pie as I put it in my mouth.” “Ask me about the time I got strip-searched at the airport.” “Tell me what’s your favorite late-night snack.” “Calling all nap enthusiasts.

      "content": "Blend genuine affection and playful flirting for a stellar Bumble bio. While women no longer have to make the first move on Bumble (there’s an “Opening Move” feature they can set up to allow men to reply to a prompt), you still want to craft an inviting profile that encourages them to reach out. [10] X Research source So, write a charming or funny bio that grabs attention, but also hints that you’re looking for something real with potential long-term goals. “Time to figure out what all the buzz is about.” [11] X Research source “I can be your parents’ tech support.” “Swipe right for a plus-one for family events so they’ll stop asking why you’re still single.” “I’m Mr. Right… I heard you were looking for me?” “Looking for someone to lie in bed and doomscroll with.” “Professional couch potato with a PhD in Netflix binging.

Instead of writing a bio from scratch, you can select 3 pre-existing prompts and then answer them to flesh out your profile. Here are a few of the best Hinge prompts for men with some sample answers that are lighthearted and playful, but aimed at getting that elusive first date: “Dating me is like…” “...winning the lottery. You’ll always feel like a million dollars when you’re with me.” “...your favorite sweatpants—comforts you after a hard day at work and doesn’t mind even your messiest look.” “...a long walk in spring. I’ll be a huge stress relief and I’ll always smell good.” “A fact about me that surprises people” “I can speak 5 languages (but only 3 fluently).” “I won a state sculpture award in high school, but haven’t made anything since.” “I had to relearn how to walk after a car accident. My PT taught me to add some swagger.” “The secret to getting to know me is…” “...running your finger along the spines of my disorganized book collection.” “...2 to 3 martinis during happy hour this week.” “...just ask! I’m an open book who’d love to hear more about you, too.”"

Then, try to limit your text conversations to less than 20 minutes and ask to go on a date as soon as you feel comfortable. To keep your expectations reasonable, try to meet within 1-2 weeks of matching. [12] X Research source “Trying to be on my phone less—let’s just skip to grabbing dinner?” “Can we skip to the part where I take you out on a date?” “Halfway out the door to my next spontaneous adventure, wanna come?” “Only here so I have someone to go to clubs with.” “I’m organizing a first date! Swipe right to be invited.” “I need no excuse to dance, but I’m taking applications for a partner.” “Heaven and Hell club, 11pm, every Thursday. See you there.” “First date wish list: walking through an art gallery and making up stories about the art.” [13] X Research source “Let’s go to a cozy bookstore where we pretend to be intellectuals but just read comics.” “I plan on eating my weight in tacos later and need someone to weigh me to make sure I did it right (will return the favor).”"

      "content": "Mention you’re interested in meeting cool people to keep things casual. If you’re just looking for casual dating or a temporary fling, use a line that’s relaxed, charming, or funny to keep things lighthearted. Don’t be afraid to just say, “I’m looking for something casual,” either. As relationship coach Maya Diamond, MA puts it, “Be very clear about why you're on [the app]...That helps filter the people who are not right for you and attracts those people who are really the right fit for you in terms of your goals and your vision for what you want.” “I’m like a library book: if you don’t check me out, you don’t know what you’re missing.” [14] X Research source “I’m like a thrift store—full of weird stuff but worth the rummage.” “Not the best at bios, but great at dates.” “Just a guy with a love for good food and great company.” “I’m not a photographer, but I can picture us together.” “I’m the guy your mom warned you about. But hey, we both know you never listened to her.” “Here to find someone as awesome as my dog thinks I am.” “Just here to find my Tinderella.” “I’ve got 99 problems, but a bad first date won’t be one.” “Swipe right and I promise to make our story seem cooler than ‘we met on Tinder’.”"

If you’re looking for the one , include things about what you want from a relationship, how you like to be treated, and what you’d be like as a boyfriend. According to Diamond, “People are afraid to put out why they're online. They want to cast a really wide net of people. But what happens is that you attract the wrong people” when you aren’t clear about what you’re looking for.” Just keep it light-hearted for now and show off what makes you a good long-term partner (you can have a deeper talk about what you’re looking for once you land a date!). “Swipe right if you want to delete this app.” “Describe your ideal first date and I’ll make it happen.” “Looking for someone to add to my Netflix household.” “Swipe right if you want to make your friends jealous.” “I’m employed, emotionally available, and regularly call my mom.” “My kink is when someone takes a genuine interest in me.” “Looking for someone to send my Wordle score to every morning.” “Your parents are going to love me.” “Willing to lie about how we met.” “Let’s plan our Instagram soft-launches.”"

      "content": "Showcase the qualities that make you shine if you’re a bit introverted. If you’re a shy guy, it might feel a little uncomfortable to put yourself out there on the apps. But on the positive side, writing a bio gives you the chance to express your interests and share what you’re looking for from the comfort of home. Don’t be afraid to mention you’re a bit reserved—there are plenty of introverted dating app users out there who would love to match with you! “Took a giant leap from my comfort zone to here. Looking for someone who appreciates quiet nights in and deep conversations over loud parties.” “A man of few words but many thoughts. Here to find a special someone who doesn’t mind unraveling them one by one.” “Introvert, book-lover, and a bit of a nerd. If you enjoy long talks about everything and nothing, I might be your guy.” “Quiet at first, but witty and fun once you get to know me. Looking for a fellow explorer of life’s simple pleasures.” “Quiet guy with a loud mind. If you’re looking for someone to share silence and meaningful chats with, I’m your person.” “I might not be the life of the party, but I could be the heart of a meaningful conversation. Looking for a connection that goes beyond small talk.” “A man of mystery? Maybe. A man of sincerity? Definitely. Let’s uncover the mysteries together.” “Not great at first impressions, but excellent at genuine connections.” “Introvert, thinker, dreamer. Seeking someone who finds beauty in the quieter things in life.” “Introverted adventurer seeking a partner for quiet escapades and shared moments of serenity.”"

      "content": "Be authentic and specify what you’re looking for if you’re in your 40s. By this age, most guys will have at least some dating experience to draw on when they craft their bios—you know what you like, dislike, and need in a partner. There’s also less of an appetite for games in the dating world, so be yourself and mention whether you’re looking for a long-term relationship, something casual, or a simple hook-up. “Simple guy ready to settle down with the one. Looking for someone who values depth over drama. Send a message if that sounds like you.” “Emotionally available, financially stable, and ready to give this whole marriage thing a try one day.” “Amateur chef and full-time foodie looking to get back in the dating scene. I’ll cook, you bring the wine!” “Whiskey, jazz, and real conversation. Self-made and looking for someone who values a quiet life full of the finer things.” “I’ve done the whole ‘build your career’ thing, now I’m looking to build a life with that special someone.” “Not here to waste time (unless it’s at a poolside bar). Let’s catch an old movie or explore a new neighborhood and see where the evening takes us.” “Divorced, no baggage, and feeling the best I’ve ever felt. I believe in second chances and great art. Interested?” “Looking for loyalty, laughter, and low-key weekends. Who knows? We could finally get off this app together!” “Not afraid to ask for directions (I’ve learned the hard way). I’d love to tell you all about it over dinner and drinks soon.” “I’ve seen the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramids, and the Grand Canyon. Next, I can’t wait to see the love of my life. Is it you?”"

After too long, people become tired of reading. You want it to be just enough information to show the different facets of your personality and that you’re an interesting person that someone would want to meet.” She continues, “Pepper it with a few interesting facts, keep it positive, reflect your personality, and don’t make it too long.” Some apps may have a character limit for your bio.

As celebrity dating coach Damona Hoffman explains, “The goal of the profile is to get them to stop and pay attention. Get them to like you and then get them to engage with the message.” What’s an easy way to get them to stop on your profile? Write something they haven’t read before! One easy way to encourage a match or message is to include a casual “call to action” in your bio. For example, you could end with something like “Swipe right if you feel the same” or “Drop your favorite SpongeBob reference and drinks are on me.” You could also ask people to challenge your opinions, swipe right if they agree with you on some matter, or include a prompt question like “Would you rather go on a date with Bruce Willis or Bruce Wayne?”"

For example, “If you ski, you may want to talk about that in your profile. [Mention] that you really enjoy skiing and that you hope to find someone who shares that common interest.” Talking about your interests also gives potential matches the chance to ask you questions about them, even if they don’t know much about them to start."

      "content": "Begin with a prompt if you’re not sure where to start. Some dating apps, like Hinge, make you select prompts to answer to fill out your bio. But others, like Tinder, are a blank canvas. If you’re feeling stuck, start your answer by completing a prompt like: [16] X Research source “The first item on my bucket list is…” “The key to my heart is…” “My worst midnight snack habit…” “First date wishlist: Let’s…” “My hidden talent is…” Tip: Hinge has tons of good prompts to choose from; if you happen to like one, feel free to steal it for another dating app bio!"

If you’re looking for a relationship, mention your interests, values, and relationship goals. If you’re looking for hookups, write a short, flirty bio. However, don’t write about values, interests, or beliefs that you don’t really have just to attract a certain kind of person. As dating coach Candice Mostisser puts it, “You really don't want to start off playing games or saying something about [yourself] that may not be the most honest or accurate. Why start off with deception?”"

A dating bio isn’t a professional bio—while people want to learn a little more about you, it doesn’t have to be all information and stats. If you’re confident in your humor, tell a witty joke to show it off. If you want to fish for a hookup or a first date, say something flirty. Potential matches want to know what your personality is like and what you want out of using the app, so don’t be afraid to let your true self shine through."

      "content": "Be confident and positive. Talk about what you’re good at, what you enjoy, and what you want to accomplish. While you don’t want to come off as overconfident, it’s better to be positive than to be self-deprecating or talk about the things you don’t like. [17] X Research source When people meet you, they don’t necessarily know if you have the qualities they want—competence, drive, kindness, etc.—but being confident signals that you’re sure of yourself and feel good about the kind of person you are. An under-confident bio would be something like: “Just moved to the area and don’t have any friends yet. Lonely and down for anything.” A more confident version is: “New in town and looking for friends, but I’m down for anything if there’s a spark 😉” An overconfident version of this bio would be something like: “Haven’t met anyone in DC on my level yet. I’m down for anything...if you can impress me.”"

Whether you mention it in your written bio or in another spot in your profile, “I always encourage men to be honest about…their online dating profiles,” explains dating and relationship coach Suzanna Mathews. “It's just better to lead with honesty and really show all the other awesome and amazing characteristics that you bring to the table,” even if you’re insecure about something. “It’s sort of like if you were looking for a job,” she continues. “If the job I'm looking for requires these five certifications and I have four of them, I'm going to really highlight those four and downplay the one I'm missing.” Mathews offers more advice for guys who are nervous about height specifically: “If you're a guy who's height challenged, make sure that you're in good shape, you're going to the gym and looking after your health, that you dress well, and that you're really cultivating awareness of yourself, a good personality, and good conversation and social skills...There are women out there who will not privilege height as much as you think they will.”"

Find a friend who can think of you from the perspective of a person who would be viewing your profile as a potential partner…It's good for a second set of eyes if you can also get them to look at it from a more neutral perspective.” Be selective about who critiques your profile, though. As Hoffman warns, “Sometimes [friends] can lead you astray. They want what's best for you and generally think the world of you, but they know you on a different level than a potential partner. They're going to be thinking about you as a friend and sort of selling your accolades in that way.”"

We think it adds context, but it potentially gives someone a reason to say no to you or a reason to confuse you with other people in your photos. Whether it's a group shot with your buddies or a picture with your grandma, to me, it doesn't really have a place on your dating profile. You want to keep the attention and the focus on you.”"

Where does the eye go when someone looks at your photo initially?” asks Hoffman. “A lot of the apps now will crop your picture to a square. Consider it from the point of view of the person looking at it and how they will see it. Sometimes, a full body or three-quarter shot that is cropped square will not look the same.”"

      "content": "Wear a bright or eye-catching color in your first photo to stand out. “Color is strategic,” according to Hoffman. “It helps to stand out from the crowd. No white button-downs! Anything that doesn't have a story to it or isn't memorable will get swiped past. If you consider it from the perspective of someone swiping, they're going through picture after picture after picture, and they might not even be getting to your second photo. You have to give them a reason to stop and pay attention.” “Color is really strategic in that way,” she continues. “A lot of times, I'll recommend the color red, because it's unique, it's different. There aren't going to be a lot of other people wearing bright colors in their profile photos. That gets the attention on you.” Once they’re hooked on the first pic, the following ones can tell the rest of your story. “If that person likes the primary photo, that's where we need context. That's telling your story through your photos. What do you like to do? What part of town do you live in? It's telling the same things that you probably would say in the written part of your profile, but it allows them to be conveyed at a glance,” Hoffman explains."

A sexist remark or comment about sex and women’s bodies will probably be a turnoff (and a waste of your bio). However, a fun fact that shows your interests or passions is a lot more illuminating and inviting. A strong bio is also a chance to show you’re confident and not too self-deprecating or too cocky. It’s a fine line to walk, but it displays your maturity and self-awareness."
