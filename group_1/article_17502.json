      "title": "Separate the PopSocket components.",
      "content": "Separate the PopSocket components. Newer, Swappable PopSockets will have a base and a top. The top consists of the cap and funnel attached together, and they cannot be separated. [1] X Research source Make sure to remove the PopSocket from any phone or case. Collapse the PopSocket fully and turn the top 90 degrees in any direction. You'll feel a click before it releases from the base. Use this method for a Swappable PopSocket top that has a loose connecting piece. This is the component that is located at the bottom of the funnel and inserts into the base. If the connecting piece is stuck to the base, use a pair of pliers to pinch the piece, and then turn it 90 degrees until it pops off."

      "title": "Insert pliers into the funnel opening and widen it.",
      "content": "Insert pliers into the funnel opening and widen it. It's best to use needle nose pliers, as this can easily fit in the small opening. You may also be able to use two pieces of hooked wire to pry the hole open. The material should be fairly stretchy, so it shouldn't take too much force. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Reinsert the connecting piece into the hole.",
      "content": "Reinsert the connecting piece into the hole. Make sure the side that connects to the base faces outward. It may take some maneuvering to get the piece situated properly. If it gets stuck, use another small tool—such as an Allen wrench or hex key—to pull the rubber over the exposed edges of the connecting piece."
    },
    {
      "title": "Connect the cap to the base again.",
      "content": "Connect the cap to the base again. With the funnel collapsed, align the connecting piece with the grooves in the base. Turn it 90 degrees in any direction to lock it in place. The PopSocket can now be reattached to your case and used normally."

      "title": "Locate the slots along the top edge of the PopSocket funnel.",
      "content": "Locate the slots along the top edge of the PopSocket funnel. The main part of a PopSocket is a funnel-shaped piece that sits atop the sticky base on your phone. It has 4 small slots spaced out around its rim. [3] X Research source The cap has 4 matching tabs that fit into these slots, keeping it hooked to the funnel. This method will work for the classic version of PopSockets. The PopSocket cap is the part that fits over the funnel’s wider opening. Unless you have a plain PopSocket, it’s the part with a picture on it. If the funnel has come off, reinstall it first before putting the cap back on. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Snap the cap’s tabs into the open slots on the funnel.",
      "content": "Snap the cap’s tabs into the open slots on the funnel. Hold the cap over the funnel, then start inserting the tabs one by one. Tilt the cap slightly to push its tab through the hole. After the first one is in, move on to an adjacent tab and slot it in as well. Then, do the same for the remaining tabs to secure the opposite end of the cap. [5] X Research source Install a cap with caution. Although you aren’t likely to damage one of the tabs or the funnel, take your time to ensure you don’t end up having to replace the entire thing."

    {
      "title": "Push down on the cap until you hear a pop to snap it in place.",
      "content": "Push down on the cap until you hear a pop to snap it in place. Keep a firm grip on your phone. Hold onto the edges of the case so you aren’t putting pressure on the screen. Then, press firmly against the cap with your thumb or palm. Listen for a loud pop. Just like the name suggests, it’s a sign that your PopSocket is in one piece and ready for use. Popsocket caps are replaceable, so any cap you have will fit over the funnel you’re using. If you feel like trying a new style, you can easily pop off the existing cap at any time."

    {
      "title": "Press on the tabs to pull the cap off the PopSocket if it is still on.",
      "content": "Press on the tabs to pull the cap off the PopSocket if it is still on. While holding the funnel in one hand, push on one of the tabs. Make sure it comes out of the hole on the funnel. Then, pull it away from the funnel so it can’t get stuck again. Do the same with the remaining tabs to take the cap off. This method will work for the classic version of PopSockets. A PopSocket cap has 4 tabs, so you will have to do this 4 times to remove it. PopSockets are meant to come apart, so removing the cap won’t do any damage to it. The cap has to be completely off to reattach the funnel. If yours is already off, fit the funnel piece back on the base before reinstalling the cap. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Place the funnel on top of the sticky pad on your phone.",
      "content": "Place the funnel on top of the sticky pad on your phone. The pad is a base for the rest of the PopSocket and has a hole in the center. Rotate the funnel so its smaller end is face down. Then, push it into the hole. It won’t lock in place right away, so hold it there for now. The pad keeps the PopSocket attached to your phone, so it has to be installed first. If it has come off, clean it to stick it back on."

      "title": "Rotate the PopSocket funnel clockwise until it locks in place.",
      "content": "Rotate the PopSocket funnel clockwise until it locks in place. Hold the funnel vertically so it stays centered over the base. Press your thumb down on its center to keep it pinned in place. Then, begin turning it with your free hand. After about a quarter-turn, it will snap in place. With some PopSockets, you'll need to push the funnel in place rather than twist it. Align the funnel point to the grooves on the pad. Place your thumb on the inside of the funnel and push firmly until you hear a click. This may take some force, so it's advised to remove your phone case to avoid damaging your device. Test the PopSocket by lightly pulling the funnel away from the base. If it has snapped onto the base, you won’t be able to move it without yanking it off your phone."

      "title": "Install the cap by fitting its tabs into the holes on the funnel.",
      "content": "Install the cap by fitting its tabs into the holes on the funnel. The funnel has a series of 4 small holes around its top edge. You can see them when you look straight down into the funnel. To replace the cap, slide the tabs into the holes one at a time. Once you get the first tab in, the others become much easier to secure. After connecting the cap, try lifting it off of the funnel. If all of the tabs are in the holes, you won’t be able to move it. If you’re able to raise any part of the cap, then find the loose tab and secure it so the cap doesn’t fall off. All Classic PopSocket caps have the same setup, so you can easily customize yours by replacing the cap with a new one. It’s as easy as detaching the cap and snapping a new one on in its place."

      "content": "Run warm water from a sink faucet to clean the PopSocket . Let the water run for a moment, then test the temperature. Make sure it’s slightly warm but not hot. PopSockets are easy to clean, but cold water isn’t as effective and hot water could potentially ruin the material. If you haven't already removed the PopSocket , gently peel it from the back of your case."

      "title": "Dip the PopSocket base into the water to wet it.",
      "content": "Dip the PopSocket base into the water to wet it. Place it sticky-side down in the water. If your PopSocket is in one piece, you can drop the entire thing in the water and let it soak for a few seconds. It won’t harm the material. Otherwise, make sure that the sticky base is damp so you’re able to scrub it clean. Popsockets can safely soak in water, but you don’t really need to do that. Clean it lightly so it doesn’t take as long to dry off."

      "title": "Rub the PopSocket with your fingers to remove debris on the sticky base.",
      "content": "Rub the PopSocket with your fingers to remove debris on the sticky base. Dip your thumb in the water, then move it in a circle around the base. Do this for 30 to 60 seconds to knock off most of the debris. Then, feel the bottom half of the base for anything still stuck on it. Keep rubbing at it, dampening the PopSocket and your finger until the base is clean. If you take a PopSocket off of your phone, it is bound to get dirty. Fortunately, it will usually stick back on once you remove the debris getting in its way. While you’re washing the base, clean off the rest of the PopSocket as well. Remove the cap and rinse out the inner part of the funnel."

      "title": "Set the PopSocket on a towel to air dry for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Set the PopSocket on a towel to air dry for 10 minutes. Find a spot in your room that is out in the open but away from direct sunlight. Spread out a clean towel, then shake the PopSocket to remove as much of the water as you can. Place it on the towel and wait. The manufacturer recommends reattaching the base within 15 minutes so it doesn’t dry out. Some people let the base dry out for longer without any problems, but it could potentially prevent the PopSocket from attaching to your phone. Be careful to avoid laying the sticky side on your towel, or else you may have a hard time getting the PopSocket off of it!"

      "title": "Apply the PopSocket",
      "content": "Apply the PopSocket again. Flip your phone over so the back is face up. Then, press the sticky side of the base firmly against it. Fit the funnel into the small hole on the base, giving it a quarter-turn clockwise to lock it in place. With some PopSockets, you'll need to press on the middle of the funnel to click it in place. Finally, place the cap on top by sliding its tabs into the small holes on the funnel. PopSockets work best with smooth, flat surfaces. They may have trouble sticking to silicone or textured cases. If you find that your PopSocket keeps falling off, you may need to purchase a new phone case. If needed, you can also clean your phone case . While you can glue a PopSocket to your phone, it isn’t recommended since it prevents you from taking the PopSocket back off. Some types of glue, such as hot glue, can damage your phone case as well. After drying for an hour, give the PopSocket a thorough testing by picking it up. It should stay attached to your phone. Sometimes cleaning it doesn’t work, so you might have to purchase a new one."
