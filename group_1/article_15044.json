      "title": "Harvest your herbs when they are tender just before flowers form.",
      "content": "Harvest your herbs when they are tender just before flowers form. How the herbs taste will depend on when you cut them from the plant. You will get the best flavor while the herbs are still tender, which you can feel with your fingers. If the herb is flowering, this will be just before the buds open. You can still dry herbs that have flowered, but the taste will be bitter. [1] X Research source This process works for all herbs. If your herbs have already flowered, you can deadhead the flowers. This will allow more leaves to grow, which you can harvest and dry."

      "content": "Choose a warm, dry morning after dew has evaporated. A sunny day is the best time to cut your crop because the herbs will be dryer. The more moisture that remains on the herbs, the harder it is to dry them. [2] X Research source It’s best to wait until mid-morning, as the dew should be gone by then.

      "content": "Use scissors to cut the stems just above a leaf or leaves. You can use regular sharp scissors or small pruning shears. Place the cut herbs into a jar of fresh water until you’ve completed the harvest. Leave at least 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of stem for the plant’s regrowth.

      "content": "Pull large-leaf herbs from their stalks before drying. This includes herbs like sage, basil or mint. If it’s easy to hold just the leaf, then it’s best to remove them from the stalk before drying. [6] X Research source You can also cut the leaves from the stalk with your sharp scissors, but this will be more time consuming."

      "title": "Leave small-leaf and feathery herbs on their stalks until after they dry.",
      "content": "Leave small-leaf and feathery herbs on their stalks until after they dry. This includes herbs like fennel, dill, and rosemary. While these herbs will eventually be removed from their stalks in most cases, its best to wait until after they are dry as the stalks make them easier to handle. [7] X Research source Additionally, some dishes may look better with these herbs still on the stalk."

      "content": "Check the herbs for insects. Insects are common in an herb garden, but you don’t want them to get into your batch of dried herbs. Inspect each leaf for visible signs of insects, such as crawling bugs, webbing, or white spots that could be eggs. If you see these signs, throw that leaf or stalk away.

Allow the water to run over them for a few seconds, then gently shake them to expel the excess water. Place the damp herbs on a dry towel.

Depending on the size of the herbs, you could also try a rack with close-set bars. If you use a rack, place it over the cookie sheet to prevent bits of herbs from falling down into the bottom of the oven.

      "content": "Lay your herbs on the tray in a single layer row. Make sure that none of the leaves are overlapping or touching, as this could cause the herbs to dry unevenly. If this happens, then the whole batch could get ruined, as the centers of the leaves will burn if you try to finish drying the edges that are still moist.

Oven drying can destroy the flavor, color, and oils in your herbs, so it’s important that you keep the temperature low. The drying process should be slow in order to keep the herbs edible. The highest temperature you should use is 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).

      "content": "Leave the oven door open if you have an electric oven. The air needs to circulate around the herbs while they dry, and leaving the door open allows for that to happen. Additionally, it lowers the risk that your oven will get too hot and burn the herbs. [17] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source If you have a gas oven, do not leave the door open, as this is very hazardous. Instead, open the door every five minutes to let the air circulate. Wait about 30 seconds, then close the oven again."
