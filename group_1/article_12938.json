      "content": "Obtain a pair of post hole diggers. This tool is designed specifically for the task, and will enable you to do the job in the least time with minimum effort. There are a few things you need to consider, however, before starting. [1] X Research source Check the soil consistency. Rocky soils are difficult to use post hole diggers in, since a relatively small stone will prevent the cutting edge of the diggers from penetrating the soil. You can use a steel rock bar to loosen the rocks before using the post hole digger. Very loose, sandy, and dry soils, or otherwise stubborn ground, are hard to remove from the hole, as the clamping action of the jaws is not as effective on these non-cohesive materials. If you have time, start the holes one day, fill them with water and come back to remove the much softened soil the next day. Measure and mark the location of each fence post. Post hole diggers have a maximum effective depth of about 3/4 of their handle length, so a five foot pair will dig about 3 1/2 half deep. Very hard earth like clay is extremely difficult to dig with a manual pair of post hole diggers. A rock bar may work on dry clay."

      "content": "Select the location for the hole you will dig. If it is a single hole for a project like installing a flagpole, you can eyeball the location, but for fences and other projects requiring multiple holes, you may want to lay out the locations of you holes more accurately. Using stakes and a string line to guide you, and a long measuring tape to establish your spacing will help for this purpose. Plant the stakes on either end of the line that you want to dig along. Tie the string to one stake, pull taut, and tie to the other stake. [2] X Research source The average spacing for posts is eight feet (2.4 m), though depending upon the structure you could space them further apart."

      "content": "Determine if there is any possibility of underground utilities being in the area you are digging. For fencing around a field on private property, this may not be an issue, since the property owner should be aware of any utility right of ways on his land, but if there is any doubt, call your local utility locating service to be sure. [3] X Research source Be sure to call your local utilities at least three days prior to digging to have your utility lines located. Depending upon your location, it may be illegal to begin digging without requesting a utility survey."

      "title": "Begin digging",
      "content": "Begin digging by holding the post hole diggers by the handles, one in each hand, with the handles close together. Thrust the blades into the earth so they cut a plug out of the soil (and turf, if there is any present). If the soil or turf resists the digger's blade, you may repeat the downward thrust several times to cut into the soil and break it up. Rotate the diggers when in the ground for better results. You should penetrate the soil several inches before extracting the soil (dirt) you are removing."

      "content": "Repeat the steps above, going deeper with each successive thrust. If roots or other difficult material interfere with your progress, rotate the blades so you attack the obstacle from a different angle until they are cut through. Start narrow and make the hole wider as you go deeper. This will help stabilize the post. Moist soil will hold better than dry soil."

[6] X Research source Some contractors prefer to dump dry pre-bagged concrete into the hole and sprinkle with water. This would decrease the finished strength of the concrete by as much as 80% as you can not control even mixing or water proportions."

Use 3 parts sharp masonry sand to 1 part type 1 (or type N) concrete for a strong mortar mix or add 2 parts gravel to bulk up each mix.

Instead put a rock/slate into the hole for the post to rest on and fill around it with rocks/gravel and finally sand which you can pound down to keep the post straight."
