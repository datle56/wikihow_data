      "title": "Soak the sorghum.",
      "content": "Soak the sorghum. If you'd like the sorghum to be soft instead of chewy, you can soak 1 cup (192 g) of whole-grain sorghum in a large bowl of water. Soak the sorghum overnight so the sorghum absorbs some of the water. Drain the sorghum through a colander. Chewy sorghum is a great replacement for bulgar wheat or couscous in tabbouleh or falafel recipes. If you don't have time to soak the sorghum, you can skip soaking it, although the texture of the sorghum might just be a little nubbier."

For a little extra flavor, you can also stir in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of kosher salt. Stir the sorghum and the seasoned water. [1] X Research source"

      "content": "Simmer the sorghum for 1 hour. Once the water is cooking gently, put a lid on the pot and cook the sorghum for about 1 hour. Check the sorghum to see if it's finished cooking. You can serve the sorghum once most of the water has been absorbed and the sorghum is softened. [3] X Research source If the sorghum isn't soft enough for your liking, pour in 1 more cup (240 ml) of water and keep simmering the sorghum. Check the sorghum after 30 minutes."

[4] X Research source Sorghum comes in whole-grain or pearled form. If you want to use pearled sorghum, just reduce the liquid to 3 cups (709 ml)."

If you're using an Instant Pot, use the MULTIGRAIN setting and adjust it for less time so the sorghum cooks for around 20 minutes."

      "content": "Open and check the sorghum. Once the pressure cooker has finished its cooking cycle, use the natural release to open the lid. Let the cooker cool down for 10 to 15 minutes. Turn the handle counterclockwise to unlock the lid and slowly lift the lid up and away. The sorghum should be soft. Fluff the sorghum and serve it. Ensure that the pressure is released from inside the pot before you remove the lid."

      "content": "Replace whole grains in salad. If you frequently make cold grain salads that use farro, couscous, wheat berries, or bulgar, swap the grain for cooked sorghum. Cooked sorghum will keep its texture for several days, so it's great in Greek salads, tabbouleh, or grain bowls. [8] X Research source"

Stir dried spices into the water that the sorghum cooks in, so the grains absorb the flavors.

You can also make a breakfast porridge that uses sorghum instead of oats. Combine the sorghum with a combination of water, milk, or coconut milk and stir in your choice of sweeteners, spices, fruit, and nuts.
