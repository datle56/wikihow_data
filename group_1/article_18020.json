A smooth surface will make it easier for you to fold your shirt without wrinkles. [1] X Research source Keep the shirt face down when you fold it so any logo or image on the front will be visible when it’s folded."

Run your hands over the surface of the shirt to remove wrinkles and have it lay as flat as possible for a better fold. [2] X Research source Use an iron for T-shirts with a lot of wrinkles."
