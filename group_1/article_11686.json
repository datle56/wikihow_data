Ask the other person to have a conversation with you, and pick a time and place that works for both of you. Try meeting in a neutral area like a conference room or a common area.

      "content": "Be open-minded. Set aside any preconceived notions you have about the employees that are involved in the conflict. This is really tough to do sometimes, but it's an important part of being a manager. Focus on the conflict at hand rather than your personal opinions about the people involved. [3] X Research source For example, if some of your employees are arguing about prime office space don't worry about whether or not you simply like one better than the other."

      "title": "Respect their differences.",
      "content": "Respect their differences. Understand that some people simply aren't going to get along. Don't go out of your way to try to make them be best friends. Instead, encourage them to be professional with one another and leave it at that. [4] X Research source If problems persist, ask HR to help you moderate the conflict. They are trained in conflict resolution. If you are an HR manager who is having trouble managing a conflict, the best thing to do is to rely on your company's guidelines. Following protocol can help you know what to do. If that method isn't working for you, reach out to a trusted colleague or supervisor for help. Talk to them about the problem you are having and ask for guidance."

      "content": "Accept that it's normal to have strong emotions. Being prepared for intense feelings will allow you to sidestep some of them: Instead of being taken by surprise, you anticipate that you might have them. Emotions are sometimes easier to handle if they don't take you completely by surprise. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If you're feeling overwhelmed by emotions—especially if you're angry or anxious—wait until you're feeling calm again before you try to talk about it. [6] X Expert Source Liana Georgoulis, PsyD Licensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 6 September 2018. While it's tough to cool down in the heat of the moment, it can be helpful to tell yourself something like, '\"Okay, I know that arguing with Roberto usually gets my blood boiling, so I'm going to try to stay calm. I won't let my emotions dictate the tenor of the conversion. Count to three before responding to any of his statements, especially if I perceive them as accusations.\"'"

      "content": "Try to deal with the conflict as soon as possible to avoid anxiety. Some (small) conflicts fizzle out and die if ignored for long enough; but most bigger conflicts, ironically, get worse if categorically ignored. Even though dealing with conflict is stressful, it will get worse if you put it off. Commit to handling it as soon as you're able.

      "content": "Try to manage your stress during the conflict itself. It's normal to feel some anxiety or even anger when dealing with a conflict. This is definitely stressful. But while stress sometimes serves a very good purpose, it's not very productive in an argument. It can produce argumentative, aggressive behavior, momentarily subdue rational thought, and cause defensive reactions. By managing your stress you can hopefully mitigate those other reactions. Take deep breaths to keep yourself calm. Breathe slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth. You could also have a tough conversation in a space where you feel comfortable. If you need to talk to a friend, try a coffee shop that you like. Maybe you could have a tricky work discussion in the breakroom so that you'll be on neutral ground. Choose a location that feels good to you."

      "content": "Keep your posture open. Most conflicts are mediated through language, but that doesn't mean that the only thing you need to pay attention to is the phrasing of your words — which are, by the way, important. Maintain a friendly posture when you're having a discussion. Don't slouch, sit with your arms crossed, or face the other way. Don't fidget with something like you're bored. Sit or stand with your shoulders back, your arms at your sides, and facing the subject at all times."

      "content": "Maintain eye contact with the other person. Show them that you're interested in what they're saying by being alert and showing concern in your face. Don't stare at them aggressively, though. It's okay to blink normally and even glance away occasionally. The point is just to let them know that you are paying attention to what they are saying.

      "content": "Resist the urge to overgeneralize. Over-generalizations can be harmful because they can put the other person on the defensive. Try to be really specific when you talk about what's bothering you. That will make it easier to find a solution.

      "content": "Use \"I\" statements instead of \"You\" statements. This accomplishes two things. First, it makes the problem less about them and more about you, which is less likely to put them on the defensive. Second, it helps explain the situation better, letting the other person understand where you're coming from.

      "content": "Make resolution the priority. When you're trying to solve an issue, you might be really invested in being right. That's normal, especially if you are in the right.

      "content": "Be open-minded instead of jumping to conclusions. Even if you feel like you understand what the person is saying and where they're coming from, let them say it themselves. It's important, both for catharsis and communication, that they feel that they are equally important in this conversation.

      "content": "Accept accountability for your role in the conflict. When you're having a tough time dealing with someone, it's easy to blame them for all of the trouble. Even if it is their fault, try to look at things from their point of view. They probably see it differently, so take accountability for your part in the conflict. [14] X Research source Maybe you and your partner are arguing about who does the most work around the house. Even if you feel like you do the majority of it, suggest setting up a chore calendar or finding another way to divvy up duties."

      "content": "Show that you're open to compromise. Throw away the idea that you're going to get completely what you want without having to sacrifice anything. That's probably not going to happen. You're going to have to compromise, and you want to show compromise because you care about the other person, not because you know it's something you're being forced to do. The one gesture comes from a good place, the other from a not-so-good place. A couple things to keep in mind when you compromise: [15] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Under-promise, over-deliver. This is the manager's mantra, but it may as well be yours. Don't promise the other person the world just because you're sick of the conflict and want it resolved quickly. Promise the other person slightly less than what you think you can deliver — be realistic about it — and then wow them by exceeding their expectations. Don't punish them after you compromise. Don't purposefully do a bad job at whatever you said you'd do because you don't really believe in the compromise. This will only prolong the conflict.

After emotions run high and all the logical arguments have blunted your ability to think clearly, a little bit of humor can really ease tensions between two people.

      "content": "Take a step back from it all if you're too caught up in the moment. A lot of couples, for example, give themselves a 20-minute cooling-off period in which they let their emotions and stress calm down before tackling an issue. This makes communication easier for a lot of people. Sometimes, all it takes is a little self-imposed perspective on the situation to see the forest from the trees. Ask yourself — how important is this thing we're arguing about? In the grand scheme, is this going to make or break my relationship with this person, or is it something I can let slide? Ask yourself — is there anything you can do about the situation? Sometimes, we get mad about problems over which other people have no control."
