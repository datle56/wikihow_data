      "content": "Make a slip knot with worsted weight yarn. Get out a fun color of worsted weight yarn and pull about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the yarn ball. Twist the end of the yarn into a loop and slip your thumb and pointer finger through the loop. Pinch the yarn tail while you pull down on the working yarn with your other hand. This makes a slip knot . [1] X Research source If you're not sure if you made the slip knot correctly, keep pulling the yarn in opposite directions. A slip knot will come undone instead of tightening into a sturdy knot."

      "content": "Make a chain stitch to start your bracelet. Wrap the yarn around the hook once and pull it through the loop. This forms a new chain stitch . Don't pull the working yarn tightly after you make the chain stitch or you'll have a hard time working more stitches. [3] X Research source"

      "title": "Chain enough stitches to wrap the bracelet around your wrist.",
      "content": "Chain enough stitches to wrap the bracelet around your wrist. Keep making chains until you have a long crocheted cord. Check the bracelet length every once in a while by wrapping it around your wrist. Stop crocheting chain stitches once you can bring the ends of the bracelet together at your wrist. [4] X Research source For example, make around 30 chains for a large bracelet or 20 chains for a small one. If you're making the friendship bracelet for a friend, measure their wrist so you know how long to make the chain. You can crochet the bracelet so it's a lot longer than your wrist. This way, you can wrap the bracelet around your wrist several times before you tie it."

      "content": "Cut the yarn and pull it through your last chain. Leave a 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) yarn tail when you make the cut. Then, pull your hook away so the yarn draws through the last chain stitch you made. [5] X Research source You'll use this yarn tail to tie the bracelet around your wrist."

      "content": "Wrap the bracelet around your wrist and tie a square knot with the ends. To make it easier to tie, grab the yarn tail with the fingers so you can hold it in your palm. Wrap the other end of the bracelet around your wrist and hold it close to your body so you can tie a basic square knot with the ends. It is tricky to tie a bracelet around your own wrist, so ask a friend to tie your friendship bracelet if you're struggling. To make a thick friendship bracelet, make 3 of these simple friendship bracelets. Then, braid them together and tie them around your wrist."
