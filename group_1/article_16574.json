Small claims courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, so you cannot ask for more than the maximum amount the court has the power to order. The court also must have personal jurisdiction, which means it must have the power to order the person you're suing to pay you money if you win. Typically this means you need to sue in the county where the person you're suing lives. [2] X Research source Check as well to make sure that the type of case you have is one decided in small claims. Even if the monetary amount is small, it may not fit within the court's limits. The limit typically is between $3,000 and $10,000, but that's a broad range. For example, the limit for small claims is $5,000 in New York, but $10,000 in California. [3] X Research source [4] X Research source Also keep in mind that small claims courts generally don't decide divorce, guardianship, custody, or estate matters, nor do they provide equitable remedies.

If this is the case in your state, the clerk will let you know. When you appear, dress in clean, conservative clothing and treat all court staff including the judge with respect and courtesy.
