      "content": "Look in places where your remote should be. There's a good chance that you lost the remote in the room where you watch television. Many people tend to leave their remote near the television set, or near where they sit when they're watching T.V. It is very common to lose a remote in the couch. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Try looking in hidden places.",
      "content": "Try looking in hidden places. Check underneath books, magazines, blankets, and coats (under anything that might be resting on top of the remote and hiding it from you). Check between the cushions of couches and chairs. Look underneath and behind furniture. Check beside the kettle, the shelf in the hall, the bathroom cabinet, and anywhere else you might have brought it with you."

      "title": "Think about where you've been.",
      "content": "Think about where you've been. Perhaps you carried the remote out of the room, set it down while your mind was on something else, and accidentally left the remote in a strange place. Consider whether you might have left the remote somewhere en route to the bathroom, your bedroom, the kitchen, or the front door. Check the fridge. If you had something to eat or drink during the past few hours, you might have left the remote in the fridge while grabbing your food. Maybe you took a phone call recently, while you were watching television, and you set the remote down while you were on the phone. Perhaps you answered the door during your favorite show, carried the remote out of the room, and set it down in your entryway."

      "content": "Bang on the bed covers. This is useful if you watch TV in bed. The remote will often get buried under the sheets or covers and the best way to find it is to just run your hands along the bedspread until you feel something boxlike in shape. If this does not work, look under the bed, and then check the area at the foot of the bed."

      "title": "Ask other members of your household.",
      "content": "Ask other members of your household. If anyone else has used the remote recently, he or she might be able to give you a lead as to its location. Perhaps this person placed the remote in a spot where you don't normally leave it. Perhaps he or she absentmindedly left the device in a part of the house that you do not often visit. Even if you don't find the remote right away, asking someone else can help you decide where not to look. They can help find the controller."

      "title": "Find out if anyone has taken it.",
      "content": "Find out if anyone has taken it. Your teenager might have brought the remote to his or her room and forgotten to bring it back. Your toddler might have hidden the remote as a prank. Your dog might have carried the device off to chew on it! Check the kid's toy box. You never know when your son or daughter might have taken off with the remote!"

      "title": "Get help.",
      "content": "Get help. You don't need to find the remote alone! Ask your friends or family members to help you look for the missing device. It might help if you can give them an engaging reason to find the remote. If you find the remote, then you can all watch a movie together, or you can catch the program that's coming on in twenty minutes."

      "title": "Be more mindful of your remote.",
      "content": "Be more mindful of your remote. If you keep a closer eye on your remote in the future, you may be less likely to lose it. Try to be engaged and aware each time that you set your remote down. Take a mental snapshot of the device so that you remember where it is."

    {
      "title": "Try designating a specific place to put the remote.",
      "content": "Try designating a specific place to put the remote. Don't ever put the remote anywhere other than this place. It might be on the coffee table, next to the television, or in a dedicated \"remote control holder\" that is attached to your couch or table. If you regularly lose the remote, consider buying a remote control holder so that you have a set place to put it. Apply a Velcro strip to the back of the remote, then attach the matching \"opposite\" Velcro strip to the TV. Keep the remote firmly attached to the Velcro strip on the TV when not in use."

      "title": "Make the remote more visible.",
      "content": "Make the remote more visible. Attach a strip of brightly-colored tape, a reflector, or a long, fuzzy tail. Tie a ribbon to the device, give it wings, or glue plastic legs onto it. Add anything that you think will make it easier for you to notice and remember your remote! Try not to add anything that will impair the function of the device."

      "content": "Consider buying a universal remote. [2] X Research source These devices work with most brands of television, and they will free you from the need to keep a small fleet of easy-to-confuse remotes. It's easy to find yourself using separate remotes for your television, your DVD player, your sound system, and other devices. You may find that it is easier to keep track of one remote than it is to keep track of, say, four."

      "title": "Attach a tracker to your remote.",
      "content": "Attach a tracker to your remote. Several companies now sell small, relatively inexpensive tracking devices that link up to a smartphone app, like Tile or AirTag. Clip the tracker to your television remote in case you ever lose it again. You can set your smartphone to beep when the remote is nearby or the tag itself will beep until you find it. Some apps will even try to find your remote when it is far from you."
