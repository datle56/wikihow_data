      "title": "Check the envelope to see who was officially invited.",
      "content": "Check the envelope to see who was officially invited. Before you respond to the RSVP, check the inside or outside of the envelope to see who was invited to the event. [2] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. If the host is okay with you bringing a guest, it will have a +1 on the card to indicate that you can bring another person. Decide whether you can attend before filling out the card. If the card says something like “The Thompson Family,” then your immediate family is invited to the event. If the card doesn’t have a +1 or +2 on the card, you should assume that only the people listed on the envelope are invited. If you are married with children and only you and your spouse are listed on the card, you shouldn’t assume that your kids are also invited to the event."

    {
      "title": "Write the full name of each attending guest after the \"M\" on the card.",
      "content": "Write the full name of each attending guest after the \"M\" on the card. The M is the first letter in the title of your name. Writing your full names will let whoever is hosting the party that you're coming. [3] X Research source For example, write something like “Mr. Joe Smith and Mrs. Jenny Smith.” Only write the name(s) of those attending the event."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write the number of guests attending in the accept or decline box.",
      "content": "Write the number of guests attending in the accept or decline box. Writing the number of people attending will let the host know how many people will be coming to the event. If only 1 person was invited, you can fill in this field with a checkmark or an X. Letting them know who is coming in advance will allow them to properly prepare the right amount of food and allocate enough seating for everyone."
    },
    {
      "title": "Indicate your food choices if there are options.",
      "content": "Indicate your food choices if there are options. Some RSVP cards will also have choices for food options at the event. If there is more than 1 person invited, put your initials next to your food choices. This will let the host know what each guest wants in terms of food."
    },
    {
      "title": "Write a letter of congratulations if the card is empty.",
      "content": "Write a letter of congratulations if the card is empty. Some traditional RSVP cards will have a blank space instead of blank fields on the card. Write a short note on the RSVP card congratulating them on their wedding as well as who plans on attending. [4] X Research source If you can attend, you can write something like, “Joe and Charlotte Shivers kindly accept the invitation to attend Marsha and Greg’s wedding on May 24th.” If you can’t attend you can write something like, “Unfortunately, because of a prior engagement, Joe and Charlotte Shivers are unable to attend Marsha and Greg’s wedding on May 24th. We wish you both the best and regret that we can’t make it.”"

    {
      "title": "Send the response card even if you don’t plan on attending.",
      "content": "Send the response card even if you don’t plan on attending. Even if everyone invited is declining, it’s important that you still fill out the RSVP card and send it out to the host. [5] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. This will help them determine the number of seats they need and the amount of food necessary for the event. Many hosts will be busy with event preparations and won’t have the time to reach out to you personally if you don’t send back the RSVP. Some hosts will have a secondary list of guests they will invite if their first list of guests decline."

    {
      "title": "Mail the RSVP before the deadline.",
      "content": "Mail the RSVP before the deadline. Most RSVP cards will include a response deadline. Try to respond a week or 2 before this deadline to give the host enough time to plan the event. [6] X Research source [v161267_b02]. 11 February 2020. If you can, send the card back as soon as you’re done filling it out. If the host has to wait to receive RSVP responses, it could push back their plans which makes hosting the party more difficult."

    {
      "title": "Write legibly.",
      "content": "Write legibly. The host should be able to easily understand the writing on the RSVP card. If it’s a larger event, they could be going through hundreds of cards, so it’s helpful if yours is easy to understand and read. Using print rather than cursive may make it easier to read your handwriting."
    },
    {
      "title": "Don’t respond by phone or email if a card was sent.",
      "content": "Don’t respond by phone or email if a card was sent. It’s rude in most circumstances to respond via phone or email if an official RSVP was sent to you in the mail. The host likely spent money on having the cards designed, printed, and sent, so it’s polite to fill it out and send it back rather than responding using other means. The host is likely busy planning the event, so they may not have time to respond or talk to you over the phone or email."
