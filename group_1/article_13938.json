Release any tension you’re feeling in your shoulders or neck and place your feet flat on the ground. Move forward so your weight is over your feet, using your hip joints. Push down into your feet while standing up straight. Practice standing up from a sitting position 5-10 times before taking a break.

      "content": "Sit down in a chair to help you reduce tension in your legs. Start by standing up, making sure your knees are slightly bent and not locked straight. When you go to sit down, move your knees forward while your hips go backwards. Be careful not to sit down too quickly into the chair, taking the time to slowly lower yourself into a seated position. Do this exercise 5-10 times to help reduce tension. [2] X Research source This technique keeps you from plopping down in chairs, preventing extra pressure from being put on your neck, spine, and bottom."

      "content": "Practice constructively resting by lying on a hard surface. Instead of using a bed or soft couch, lay down on a floor covered by a rug or a yoga mat. When you’re laying on the floor, place your feet flat on the ground with your hands either by your side or on your stomach. Rest like this for 10-15 minutes. [3] X Research source Consider resting your head on a thin pillow or small stack of books to make it easier on your neck or head. Do this exercise 2-3 times a day to help elongate your back and release tension."

      "title": "Lift your fingertips into the air to release tension from them.",
      "content": "Lift your fingertips into the air to release tension from them. Start by placing your hands down by your sides. Instead of lifting your hand as you normally might, focus on only lifting up your fingertips. Bring your fingertips up into the air, trying to only use those muscles. This keeps you from using the bigger muscles in your hands and teaches you to release the tension in your fingers. [4] X Research source This exercise is great if you work at a keyboard all day or your fingers tend to feel cramped. Try doing this exercise several times a day in your free time."

Try to make your exhale last at least 2 seconds longer than your inhale to help reduce stress and relax your muscles. When you’re exhaling, open your mouth comfortably to let the air escape naturally. [5] X Research source Do this as many times as you’d like, using the technique to help you calm down or even fall asleep."
