      "content": "Acknowledge that he’s the problem, not you. Are you blaming yourself for your dad’s angry outbursts, excessive drinking, neglect, or emotional instability? Many kids think their parents behave badly because of something they did wrong. If this sounds like you, stop blaming yourself. No matter what your dad or anyone else says, you’re not responsible for his behavior. Your father is an adult, so he's responsible for himself. If you’re having trouble realizing that you’re not to blame, talk to another adult about what you’re feeling. It may also help to remind yourself by reciting an affirmation like, “Dad is responsible for himself. I am not to blame for his behavior.” Remember that your dad’s behavior does not have anything to do with you. His behavior may be the result of how he was raised, his own trauma, a mental illness, or other factors. Clinical psychologist Asa Don Brown, PhD, DNCCM, FAAETS, adds to this, stating, “There are many parents who were unprepared or ill-equipped to be parents. Parents seldom have the experience or preparation that is needed to make all of the right decisions. For many, parenting is a trial-and-error experience. They are learning as they go and hopefully, they are improving as they grow.”"

It's true that there's a chance that kids can develop habits— how to handle relationships, conflict, and substance abuse from their parents— but it's not a certainty. To ensure that you don’t inherit his bad habits, Brown offers a few suggestions, including: Making a list of his behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions that you consider to be unbecoming. Being aware of and protecting your own needs. Refusing to use aggressive behavior in your life. Refusing to allow the negative behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of others to define you."

Brown suggests replacing “all negative behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions with constructive and positively directed ones.” One way to do this is to try to identify the unhealthy behaviors you don't want to pick up from your father. Then, look for another role model who demonstrates the types of behaviors you do want. If your dad suffers from substance abuse, participate in extracurricular activities at school. Involvement in such activities lowers your risk of engaging in those same high-risk behaviors.

      "content": "Find other father figures and role models. You can soften the influence your terrible father has on you by seeking out positive relationships with men who are role models. Form relationships with men who are leaders in your school, work, or community. These influences may counter some of the negative effects of having a bad father. Participate in mentoring programs like the Boys & Girls Club of America . You might also connect with positive role models by reaching out to teachers, coaches, community leaders, or spiritual advisors. You might reach out by saying something like, \"Coach Greg, I really look up to you. My own dad is hardly ever around. Do you think you could mentor me?\" Consider your friends’ dads as well. If you have a friend who has a good dad, then you might ask your friend if it would be okay if you tag along for some of their activities. Life coach Jennifer Butler recommends determining what your core values are and finding role models based on shared core values: “A strong foundation for any kind of relationship to flourish begins with having aligned core values.”"

While relationships with others can’t necessarily replace your father, they can offer protection against stress. Lean on good friends and family members for social support. Brown notes the power of surrounding yourself with people who are positive influences: “We must become consciously aware of our own person and those that we interact with. If we are in the company of negative people, then over time, we will inherit many of those individuals’ beliefs and perspectives of the world. It is a skill that is never mastered, but rather is carefully and cautiously cultivated.”"

      "content": "Keep your distance. If your terrible father is a part of your life, but you find his presence tends to make things worse, get some distance from him. Protect yourself from further psychological harm by reducing the amount of time you spend around him. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source If you visit your father only occasionally, ask your second parent if you can stop the visits. If your father lives in the same household as you, limit the time you spend around him by excusing yourself to your room whenever possible. Brown is a big advocate of setting clear boundaries with a toxic father and sticking to them, adding, “Compromising your boundaries will indicate to [him] that you do not stand behind what you believe.”"

      "content": "Identify the things that have hurt you. Start by making a list of the beliefs that you have about yourself, and consider how each one of these beliefs was formed. Then, work on identifying behaviors that come from those beliefs and work on refuting them. For example, if your dad has told you repeatedly that you’re not smart, then you may have accepted this. This belief may have affected your grades. You can refute this belief by asking for additional help with subjects that have been challenging for you and by improving in these areas. Brown advises that you “refuse to allow the negative behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions of others to have a dire effect upon your own person.”"

After you’ve finished writing, read the letter aloud to yourself as if you were sharing it with him. Then, destroy the letter by burning it or tearing it to shreds.

There are many negative effects of having a father who is physically or psychologically absent, such as poor future relationships and mental health problems. Counter these effects by nurturing yourself with regular self-care. [5] X Research source Self-care can be anything that helps you feel nurtured. Try watching your favorite movies or TV shows, going for a quiet walk in nature, or massaging away the tension in your shoulders. Life coach Kamal Ravikant offers an alternate explanation to self-care and achieving self-love, stating, “Loving yourself is not just taking a bubble bath. Loving yourself is a fundamentally inner thing where you walk around feeling love for the amazing human being you are, and you live life from that place.” He adds, “You don’t live life as a victim— you live life as the hero of your story from a deep sense of confidence and love.”"

      "content": "Learn to identify your strengths . Feeling unloved or alienated by your father can result in self-hatred and low self-esteem . To counter these emotional problems, make an effort to highlight your personal strengths. Doing so can help you feel more self-confident despite lacking needed support from your dad. [6] X Research source Sit down and make a list of all the things you’re good at. If you have trouble coming up with strengths, ask a close friend to help you. Post your list on your mirror so that it’s always visible. Add to it when you discover more strengths. Write down compliments you get from other people, such as teachers or other adults whom you respect. Then, when you’re feeling low, look at the list of compliments to remind yourself of what other people really think of you. Butler shares that allowing negative thoughts about yourself to come to the forefront is the beginning of a good exercise for this purpose: “You can write them down and start noticing a pattern. What is the narrative? What's the theme? When did the story become that I don't deserve to succeed?” She encourages that you ask yourself these questions, answer them, and then begin to dismantle them. “Flip the script and start writing down every success you've had, start listing everything you've ever accomplished, and start looking for evidence of the truth.”"

Getting out of his sight may protect you from verbal or physical attacks. If you have younger siblings, bring them along, too. A safe haven might be a friend’s or neighbor’s house or a park near your home. Psychologist Natalie Feinblatt offers some insight on what it might feel like to leave an abusive home: “Try to embrace that life is gonna be very different for a little while. And if that difference feels weird or strange, that's not because it's wrong. It's actually because it's right.” She further explains that dysfunctional families are “opposite land,” where unhealthy behaviors begin to feel healthy. “So, when you're leaving an environment like that, it can feel very strange, but that's because what you're used to is very unhealthy.” Feinblatt adds that you need to prepare yourself for the fact that “people are not going to be happy with you” and that you're going to have to “learn how to set and maintain boundaries with members of your family. If we're talking about people who have abused you, you get to choose if you want them in your life at all, or not,” she finishes."

Recent studies show that about 26% of young adults are estranged from their fathers, which is significantly higher than the 6% of young adults estranged from their mothers. [15] X Research source One reason why your dad might be treating you poorly is due to parental narcissism. This can present as entitlement, overbearingness, and lack of empathy, especially as a child grows and the father feels as if they’re unable to control them any longer. Mental health issues, such as undiagnosed anger disorders or substance abuse, may cause your dad to lash out in cruel ways. Other factors, like a painful divorce or dealing with abuse they experienced earlier in life, can result in them abusing you. Remember: this is not your fault, and you should try to remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible."

Extreme criticism, gaslighting, and an inability to respect boundaries are widespread among toxic parents.

Having negative feelings toward your dad is relatively common, depending on your age, degree of closeness, and history of negligence or abuse. Puberty marks a particularly tension-filled time between children and parents, as adolescents seek more independence, grow tired of being told what to do, and generally want to break free of the influence their parents have over them.
