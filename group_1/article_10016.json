      "title": "Pick out a whole fish.",
      "content": "Pick out a whole fish. There are many varieties of snapper, but red snapper has distinctive bright red metallic skin that fades into pink near the belly. When you're picking out a whole snapper, look for eyes that are clear and red. The flesh should be firm to the touch. Snapper has become so ubiquitous that it's often used as a catchall term for any kind of white fish. For this reason it's commonly mislabeled as a similar but less desirable fish, like rock cod. When you buy snapper, be sure to do so from a trusted fishmonger so you'll know you're buying the real thing. Ask for the fish to be gutted and cleaned, unless you want to do so yourself. You’ll need about ¾ of a whole snapper per serving."

Add pieces of butter inside the fish to keep it moist while it bakes. Season the outside with more salt and pepper. [1] X Research source If you want the dish to have an herbal taste, add sprigs of thyme, rosemary or basil inside the fish's cavity. For a complete meal, place sliced carrots, onions or potatoes around the fish in the baking dish. The vegetables will cook along with the fish."

You can gently pull back some flesh with a fork. If it looks white and easily flakes off, it's ready. If it's still a little rubbery, it needs more time. Return it to the oven if it needs more time, then check again in five or ten minutes."

Add black and red pepper to taste. Panko is a popular choice as well. This breading is sold in canisters available in the breading aisle in the grocery store.
