      "content": "More open apps drain the battery on your computer. Use only what you need at any given time. If you are using two apps frequently (like Microsoft Word and Chrome), then keep those two open to avoid opening them often. Keep in mind that many apps, like Steam and Discord, minimize to the tray or your menu instead of completely closing when you click the x . Use Activity Monitor or Task Manager to make sure unnecessary apps are not running. Aim to keep at least 20% of your hard drive free at all times, so your laptop can function at its highest level and retain battery power. According to tech specialist Luigi Oppido, unnecessary open tabs or multiple extensions can be the cause of a battery that's quickly losing battery life, especially if you're using a Chromebook."

      "title": "Heat will cause a battery to drain quickly.",
      "content": "Heat will cause a battery to drain quickly. In that case, you want the heat created by your battery to be able to vent away instead of heating the area. Make sure there aren't any objects obstructing airflow, and check for any dust build-up. Use something like a microfiber cloth to wipe away any dust build-up from the outside of your computer's vents. Make sure you keep your laptop on a breathable surface, like a desk or table. Putting the laptop directly on a pillow or blanket is a good way to obstruct the fans and lose battery life to heat."
