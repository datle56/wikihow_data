Talk to your father and mother about their expectations for how you dress and ask them to provide you with some suggestions and guidance. Ask your parents what they think it means to dress modestly. Are they comfortable with you wearing long dresses or skirts or would they prefer you to wear an abaya? How do they feel about the niqab? Go shopping with your mom and/or dad. Talk with the women of your family about how they reached their own personal interpretation of the requirements of hijab."

      "content": "Determine what it means for you to dress modestly. It is a personal choice that will be informed primarily by your religious beliefs, but also political opinions and cultural understanding. You can wear the hijab even if you can't fully commit to wearing it every day. What matters is that you are trying. It's better to wear the Hijab sometimes than not to wear it at all. Of course, one's goal should always be to wear the hijab every day. Frequently alternating between wearing and not wearing the hijab should be avoided as Allah prefers consistency in acts of worship. Hijab is not just a piece of clothing; it represents modesty. Just because you choose to wear the hijab, doesn't make you a modest person. Hijab is a way of life."

      "title": "Wear a hijab, or head covering.",
      "content": "Wear a hijab, or head covering. In the Qur’an, Allah commands that women should only expose that which must ordinarily appear. [3] X Research source Many interpret this to mean that only a woman’s hands, face, (and sometimes feet) may be displayed. Women honor this rule of modesty by wearing a hijab, a veil that wraps around their head, leaving the face uncovered while completely concealing their hair, neck, and chest. You may choose from several types of hijabs , or head coverings. Pick the one that is right for you: Shayla: Wrap this rectangular scarf around your head and use a pin to secure it at your shoulders. Khimar: Wear this cape-like scarf wrapped tightly around your head. It will hang loosely at your mid-back. Chador: If you prefer more coverage, choose this floor-length scarf. It is a longer version of the Khimar. Niqab: The niqab is a cloth face covering chosen by many Muslim women to provide additional protection. Burqa: The burqa will cover you from head-to-toe—a small mesh panel over your eyes is the only opening. Traditionally, hijabs come in plain, non-attention-grabbing colors, like black, white, blue, and brown. If you feel comfortable wearing colors and patterns, a fashionable scarf from your local department store may be substituted for a solid colored hijab."

      "content": "Wear loose-fitting clothes. With your hijab, wear loose, non-revealing tops and bottoms. Sheer and or figure-hugging clothing should be avoided. Remember, the type of clothing you wear with your hijab is completely dependent upon your comfort level and understanding of modesty. Ask your parents for a second opinion if you are unsure about a certain piece of clothing. If you prefer full coverage, shop for maxi skirts, wide leg pants, long dresses and abayas. Want to wear skinny jeans or leggings? Pair them under a long flowing top or dress. If you want to wear a tighter outfit, cover it up with an abaya, jilbab or mumu."

If you choose to wear make-up on a daily-basis, go for a natural look. Apply minimal amounts of foundation, blush, mascara, and lip-gloss to enhance your natural beauty and features. For a \"no makeup\" look, you can use tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or CC cream for your complexion. Add some concealer for correcting any blemishes or dark circles, a little bit of bronzer for your cheekbones, upper forehead and eyelids, and some lip balm for your lips."

Instead of wearing tight, revealing tops and bottoms, put on wide-leg pants and a matching long-sleeve shirt. Consider traditional clothes such as kurtas and salwar that do not reveal the body. Base your outfits on your personal comfort level. Maxi-skirts, long dresses, and flowy tops are essential staples of a modest wardrobe . Seek a second opinion if you are unsure whether a certain top or bottom is too tight. Full coverage does not have to look dowdy and matronly! Mix and match trendy items or vintage pieces with the staples of your modest wardrobe for a chic look. Pair black jeans with boots, a long wool trench coat, and a turtleneck sweater. You should keep in mind that the reason that you wear full clothes is so that you do not attract men so try to wear clothes that will not show your body shape. Don't wear short shirts; instead, wear long ones that hide your lower back."

Cover up tight skinny jeans with a long sweater, coat, or flannel blouse tied around your waist. [6] X Research source Get creative!

Determine if a neckline is too low by measuring the distance from your collarbone to the top of your shirt using your fingers as a measuring tool—one to four finger-widths is ideal, while five finger widths may verge on too revealing. Cover your cleavage with turtlenecks, boatneck shirts, and blouses. Tie a scarf around your neck to cover a lower neckline. Wear a tank-top with a high neckline under a shirt that is too low in the front."
