      "content": "Make a rhubarb root tea for lighter tones. Cut up a half cup of fresh rhubarb root or use 3 or 4 tablespoons (44.4 or 59.1 ml) of dried rhubarb root and add to a pot with a quart of water. Simmer for 20 minutes and let steep overnight. Strain out the pieces and use the remaining liquid in a spray or rinse on your hair.
