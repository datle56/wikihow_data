  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Wash your hair",
      "content": "Wash your hair with a fragrant, clarifying shampoo for the best fix. If you’ve got time and some fresh-smelling shampoo on hand, hop in the shower to wash and then condition your hair. Pick a shampoo with a strong but clean scent to cover any lingering smoke smell (scentless shampoos will still work, but may leave the faintest trace of bonfire in your locks). [1] X Research source Clarifying shampoos deep-clean your hair of any smoke residue causing the smell. They’re pretty strong and can strip your hair of its natural oils, so you’ll only want to use one once a week at most. Regular shampoos work too, but you might have to rinse and repeat a few times to get the full effect. Alternatively, try rinsing your hair without shampoo and then adding conditioner if you don’t want to wash it. This works best if the smoke smell is pretty faint. While you’re in the shower, take a moment to scrub your skin and eliminate any smoke odor clinging to your body, too."

      "title": "Try dry shampoo",
      "content": "Try dry shampoo if you’re on the go or don’t have time for a shower. If you’re camping or exposed to smoke all day long, a full shower isn’t always practical. In these cases, grab a scented dry shampoo and spray the roots of your hair (keeping the nozzle about 6 in (15 cm) away from your scalp). Then, use your fingers or a comb to spread the dry shampoo all over. Dry shampoo will noticeably reduce the smell, but won’t be quite as effective as regular shampoo."

      "title": "Rub your hair and scalp with a scented dryer sheet to skip shampooing.",
      "content": "Rub your hair and scalp with a scented dryer sheet to skip shampooing. Grab any dryer sheet you have on hand—preferably one with a fresh scent to mask any faint, lingering smoke smell, but a scentless sheet will absorb odor, too. Gently rub and wipe all of your hair from your roots to the tips, making sure to hit the scalp, too. [2] X Research source Dryer sheets will also make your hair less frizzy and leave you smelling like a basket of fresh laundry. It’s a win-win! Sometimes, wiping a clean, damp towel through your hair will take the scent away too, although it won’t be quite as effective as a dryer sheet."

      "title": "Brush odor-absorbing baking soda into your hair for a natural solution.",
      "content": "Brush odor-absorbing baking soda into your hair for a natural solution. Household powders like baking soda, cornstarch, or even baby powder are natural deodorizers that also trap oil and grease. Massage the powder of your choice into your scalp and hair, then grab a comb or brush to evenly distribute it through your locks. The smell should be gone in minutes! [3] X Research source Start with a conservative amount of powder and add more if needed. Too much can leave a white, powdery residue on your hair (you’ll smell great, but might look bizarre). Brush or shake your hair out if you added too much powder and it’s showing. Once the smell’s gone, rinse the powder out (or go on with your day if you don’t have time). If you have dark hair and don’t want the powder to show, try using cocoa powder instead (it absorbs bad smells too)."

      "content": "Spritz your hair with a baking soda-water mix, then shampoo as normal. Mix ¼ cup (68 g) of baking soda with 1 quart (0.9 L) of water (making sure all the baking soda is dissolved) and pour the solution into a spray bottle . Spray your hair thoroughly and let the mixture sit for a few minutes, then hop in the shower and wash your hair with your usual products. [4] X Research source If you’re short on time or don’t have access to a shower, let the spray air dry and shower later. If you don’t have a spray bottle, mix the baking soda and water in a bowl or pitcher and pour it over your hair instead."

      "title": "Rinse your hair with diluted vinegar for a natural deodorizer.",
      "content": "Rinse your hair with diluted vinegar for a natural deodorizer. Mix 1 part distilled, white vinegar with 4 parts water in a bowl or spray bottle, then apply the mixture all over your hair. Let it sit for a few minutes, then hop in the shower and follow up with your regular shampoo and conditioner. [5] X Research source Don’t worry if you don’t have time to rinse out the vinegar in the shower—the smell will go away once your hair dries and the vinegar evaporates. Apply the vinegar slowly and carefully so it doesn’t get in your eyes. Avoid this method if you’ve got scratches, cuts, or other irritation on your scalp (vinegar can burn). In a pinch, use apple cider vinegar as an alternative if you don’t have white vinegar on hand."

      "title": "Set your hair dryer to the cool setting and blast your locks for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Set your hair dryer to the cool setting and blast your locks for 5 minutes. Cold air opens up your hair cuticles, releasing any bad odors trapped in your locks. Gently toss or brush your hair while you blow dry it so the air circulates around each and every strand. [6] X Research source If you don’t have a blow dryer on hand, just go for a walk outside and let the wind do its thing. [7] X Research source If you’re airing out your hair outdoors, try to get a few minutes of sun. The UV rays help kill odor-causing bacteria and make any fresh breezes more effective."

      "title": "Spray your hair with diluted lemon juice and blow dry it on the cool setting.",
      "content": "Spray your hair with diluted lemon juice and blow dry it on the cool setting. A DIY citrus spray is an easy, natural way to cleanse your hair of last night’s bonfire. Juice a lemon (or another citrus fruit like a lime, orange, or grapefruit), then add the juice to a spray bottle and fill the remainder with water. Spray your hair all over, then let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Blow dry with cool air to expel the smoke scent, and reapply the lemon spritz throughout the day if needed to stay on top of the smell. A 12 ounce (355 mL) spray bottle or bigger works best. If your bottle is smaller than that, juice half a lemon instead of the whole fruit (too much acid can damage your hair). Also try soaking your hands in the lemon juice and then running them through your hair for a similar effect. Do not expose your hair to sunlight during or shortly after a lemon juice treatment, or you may end up accidentally lightening your hair."

      "content": "Make a DIY conditioner with peppermint , lavender, or tea tree oil. Grab about ¼ cup (59 mL) of a carrier oil from your kitchen, like olive oil or coconut oil, and add a few drops of your preferred essential oil. Mix the oils together, then massage the mixture into your hair and scalp like conditioner. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly with warm water. Alternatively, dilute a few drops of essential oil in a spray bottle full of water and apply it to your hair. For extra stubborn smoke smells, try adding essential oil to your regular shampoo and conditioner. The oils are very concentrated, so only add a couple drops (even for a full bottle of shampoo)."

      "content": "Spritz your hair with a 50/50 mix of vodka and water and let it air dry. Mix equal parts vodka and water in a spray bottle, then douse your hair all over. Go on with your day and let the mixture air dry—once the alcohol evaporates away, the smoke and vodka smell will be gone from your hair. [8] X Research source Vodka may dry out your hair, so plan to use conditioner or apply a hydrating hair mask once you’ve got time to shower (if you’re out camping, though, your hair has plenty of time to replenish its natural oils before your wash!)."

      "content": "Try a hair spray specially designed to oust the smoke smell. Invest in a bottle if you’re frequently around cigarettes, BBQs, or campfires—it’s a lifesaver! Just spray your hair according to the product’s instructions, usually from about 6 in (15 cm) away. Let it sit for a few minutes, then style your hair like normal. Odor neutralizing sprays work quickly and are perfect for camping trips or when you’re on the go and don’t have time to shower."

      "content": "Wear a rustic scent that complements the bonfire smell as a last resort. There’s not much that complements cigarette smells, but a stubborn campfire scent is pleasing when it’s toned down with other fragrances. If you’re stuck with a lingering smoke smell, put on a few pumps of an earthy scent like cedar , palo santo, bourbon, or birch . [9] X Research source If you’re desperate, try putting your regular perfume in your hair to mask the smoke smell. Hold the bottle about 12 in (30 cm) so the scent doesn’t become overwhelming in one spot. Alternatively, try spraying your brush or comb with a clean scent and running it through your hair to mask the smell. Also try wearing a hat (preferably a washed, clean-smelling hat) to literally cover the smell until it fades or you have time to properly wash your hair."
