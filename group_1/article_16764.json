      "content": "Set a time limit or give yourself a prompt. There are many different writing exercises one can use to get inspired. If you're feeling really stumped and don't know where to start, try a writing exercise. Having a specific set of instructions can take the pressure off and get those creative juices flowing. Write a song for your friend or someone you're grateful for. Pick a popular break up song and try writing the other person's perspective. Try to write a song about your hometown or where you grew up. If you feel intimidated, tell yourself that you'll only write for 5 minutes. If nothing comes out, you'll know that you've at least tried. If you find yourself settling into the writing process after 5 minutes, you're likely to come out with at least a few ideas you're happy with."

Lots of songwriters write about nature, other people, or interesting experiences. Get out there and let the world inspire you. Try eavesdropping. Sometimes, listening in on someone else's conversation can open you up to a new perspective. You may even find something intriguing or lyrical in their words.

      "content": "Explore other art forms. You don't have to limit yourself to music for inspiration. Try to consume as much art as possible in all its different forms as doing so can inspire you in unexpected ways.

Many street artists make public art for a variety of reasons, such as raising political awareness. Note any descriptions, phrases, or emotions that come to mind. Discomfort isn't always a bad thing. New experiences can make you uncomfortable, but they can also inspire you to produce new, exciting work, especially if you feel like you're creating the same thing over and over.

      "content": "Collaborate with others. Think about who in your life is also engaged in artistic pursuits and ask them if they would be willing to collaborate with you. Collaborating can be as easy as giving each other feedback on each other's work or even starting a new project together. Not only will you motivate each other to produce work, but you'll also get great feedback and a fresh outlook that will make you a better songwriter. [14] X Research source Your collaborators don't necessarily have to be musicians. In fact, working with an actor or writer may be even better as you'll get a totally different perspective.
