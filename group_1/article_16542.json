      "content": "Think about the people you might be attracted to. It's all right if you're not sure exactly what you're feeling. Take some time to reflect about the people who are causing these feelings by thinking about these questions: What thoughts have you had that make you think you might be a lesbian? Have you had sexual thoughts about women? What about men or people of other genders? If you have been in relationships with men, how was your level of attraction in that relationship? Did you feel motivated to initiate and engage in physical affection/intimacy? Do you find women beautiful? Do you think that's an aesthetic appreciation (which anyone can have)? Or does that tie into stronger emotions?"

This doesn't mean you have to call yourself a lesbian, but it's a sign that you might not be fully heterosexual or heteroromantic. [1] X Expert Source Marissa Floro, PhD Counseling Psychologist Expert Interview. 1 April 2021. These questions might help you explore the idea: Have you wanted to kiss, touch, or do something romantic for other women and nonbinary people? Have you ever had thoughts about any other genders in this way? Which feelings bring you more pleasure?"

If you are drawn to these experiences and memories, maybe more so than you are to similar experiences with other genders, you might be a lesbian."

      "content": "Talk to lesbians and queer folks. One other way to help assess your feelings is to talk to lesbian women and women/nonbinary who date women You might want to find out how they realized that they were lesbian or if they always knew, what their same gender attractions were like to them, and if they ever had feelings for certain genders (or men). Try to find someone who you know well enough to be comfortable asking personal questions. Think about writing down your questions ahead of time so that you don't forget if you get nervous. Make sure that you trust this person so that they don’t out you before you are ready and in a safe situation.

Allow these reflections to sit with you and don’t feel that you have to make a choice or tell anyone until you are ready.

Sometimes what seems like a big mystery to us is a lot easier to figure out from the perspective of someone who knows us well. [4] X Research source You might say something like “Hey Monica, you're one of my best friends, can I trust you with something private? I’ve been wondering if maybe I’m lesbian or not. Have you ever thought that maybe I am?” If you're nervous about telling your friends, try finding out what they think about queer topics in general first. Asking them about a recent news article is an easy way to bring this up. Don’t talk to your family or friends if you have good cause to feel afraid of their reactions. If you are likely to be abused or cut off financially, protect yourself. However, do find someone to talk to. If you aren't ready to tell anyone you know, try a hotline, online forum, support group, counselor, or therapist."

No matter what your situation is, you don't have to decide anything until you are ready. [5] X Expert Source Marissa Floro, PhD Counseling Psychologist Expert Interview. 1 April 2021. If you aren't sure but would like to explore romantic or sexual encounters with women, you can tell people you are \"questioning.\" If you are attracted to women but are unsure about the labels (lesbian? bisexual? queer? pansexual? trans and straight?), you could identify as queer, a label that doesn't specify whether you feel a difference in your orientation, gender, or both. If you feel like you need a label, consider if the desire is coming from within or because you feel pressured by someone or something. Don't let anyone make you feel forced to decide."

      "content": "Consider the sexualities beyond “straight” or “gay.” Attraction is a spectrum, and there are many queer identities besides lesbian. Bisexual individuals are attracted to people of their gender and other genders. Pansexual folks don't consider gender a factor in who they're attracted to. Sometimes, confusion over our identity comes from treating sexual attraction and romantic attraction like they have to be the same thing. It's okay to be sexually attracted to someone (or even a whole gender), but not want to become romantic partners—or the other way around. If you want to learn more about this, look up information about being asexual, demisexual, or aromantic."

That means they both identify as a woman (or a feminine nonbinary person) and are also attracted to women (their sexual or romantic orientation).

Does it feel right to call yourself a woman? Does it feel right to say you're attracted to only women? You define your own gender identity, not your birth certificate or your genitals (this relates to your assigned sex at birth, not your gender). If people have assumed you are a woman your whole life, but if calling yourself a woman feels wrong or irrelevant, you might be trans. You could look into the trans experience (including nonbinary gender identities)."

      "content": "Accept that sexual orientation can evolve. Your previous attractions don’t necessarily determine your future ones. Orientation isn't necessarily something that changes from Tuesday to Wednesday, or that we can choose to change whenever we want, but it's not set in stone forever either. If you used to feel certain of your identity and orientation, but are less sure now, that doesn't mean you were lying or in a fake relationship. Give yourself time to figure it out and accept yourself in your current form. Denying your feelings so that you can comply with the expectations of a label that you've previously applied to yourself can cause mental and emotional harm. It's okay to follow a new path if that's what's right for you."

      "title": "Accept that sexual and emotional attraction are different.",
      "content": "Accept that sexual and emotional attraction are different. Though some people might confuse the two, recognize that sexual and emotional attraction are inherently different. For instance, perhaps you have a friend who is a woman/nonbinary person who you always want to kiss or touch, but you do not necessarily want to go out to dinner with them. Or you may know guys who you would really like to go on a date with. Know that the two attractions are different and assess what is more important to you. Also be mindful of the way that straight women and men are primed and conditioned to think about those of the 'opposite' gender. People of all genders are conditioned from a young age to think only about those of the 'opposite' gender in a romantic context. If your feelings for women seem purely sexual, it could be that you don't have a clear idea about what dating a woman would look like. It might be worth trying out romantic dates (or just imagining them) to help you work out if this is the case."
