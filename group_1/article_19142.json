If you exceed this limit, you will be in Twitter Jail until the new 24 hour period begins. This limit is broken down semi-hourly, so users should avoid tweeting more than 100 times within an hour. Repeated violation of this limit could lead to a larger suspension."

      "content": "Following 400 people in a day will put you in Twitter Jail. The site refers to this as “aggressive following\" and may flag even lesser behavior as jail-worthy. Once your account is following a total of 5000 other users, you can only follow additional accounts in accordance with account-specific ratios laid out by X. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Confirm whether or not your account has been suspended. X generally communicates to its users whether or not they have been suspended. You will see an Account suspended message on your profile page, with a short description explaining the specific term(s) you have violated. You may also receive an email with similar information. If your suspension is specific to a tweet, the email will include that tweet. If you are told that you have violated an X rule, but do not agree with this assessment, you can file an appeal . Before doing so, click here to read the full description of each rule. If your account has been identified as spam, X may ask you to confirm your email address and phone number upon signing in."

      "content": "Avoid tweeting on multiple devices. X also has API limits. In other words, they limit the interactions between applications and software more than direct interaction with the X platform website. Many people find it easier to end up in Twitter Jail if they are using a third-party X client, a blog, a phone app and a computer."

You can appeal any violation, although if your account has been accused of abusive behavior, it may be difficult to overturn X’s decision. If X believes they have associated you with spam incorrectly they will likely reinstate your account and apologize. It may take several hours for the account to return to normal.

      "content": "Beware that third-party clients may result in duplicate content. Many X users may connect their account to their blog, website, or third-party social media management app to automatically post links to their writing. If you want to post links to your blog yourself, unlink your website from your X account. This gives you greater control over the amount of tweets that go out in relation to your work. If you do not want to tweet new content yourself, then linking your accounts can still be the best option."
