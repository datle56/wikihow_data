I just need some assurance that we’re on the same page about our future.” Use “I” language so your partner won’t feel attacked. This means using phrases like “I feel . . . when you . . .” instead of starting with something that sounds like an accusation (“You don’t text me often enough!”). [3] X Research source"

For example, you might discuss things like: [15] X Research source How often you will call or text each other, and what times are appropriate based on your schedules. How you’ll handle sexual intimacy in the relationship. For instance, are you both comfortable with sexting or other forms of virtual sex?

For instance, if you’re going to be unable to check in at the usual time, try to let your partner know, and tell them what’s up. Ask them to do the same for you.

[18] X Research source For example, they might say something like, “I get really busy at work, and I can’t always answer your texts.

Before you get upset about something your partner is doing (or not doing), stop and ask yourself if your worries are realistic. Remind yourself to talk to them about what’s going on in a non-confrontational way before assuming anything. [19] X Research source You’ll probably feel a lot better after clearing the air with them. For instance, if they seem kind of distant and distracted next time you chat, don’t assume that they’re bored or upset with you. They might just be stressed out because of something else going on in their lives. Say something like, “You seem kind of preoccupied. Is everything okay?” Avoid “why” questions (like “Why are you so distant? What’s going on?”), because this could make them feel like they’re being interrogated."

Say something like, “Hey, why don’t you go get drinks with your friends this evening?” You can always connect with each other about things you’ve been doing individually. For example, you might tell them an exciting story about your weekend hiking trip, or ask them to share a creative project they’ve been working on."

For example, you might have heard people say things like, “Long distance relationships never work out,” or “That’s not a real relationship.” Don’t let these kinds of ideas influence how you look at your relationship. If both partners are willing to put in the work, long distance relationships can be extremely successful and fulfilling! [21] X Research source In fact, some studies show that long distance relationships have certain advantages over in-person relationships. For example, long distance partners tend to communicate on a deeper level, and as a result, often feel a closer bond than partners who live close by or together.

They can also help you identify some of the underlying causes of your doubts and figure out how to address them. If your partner isn’t willing or able to get therapy with you, you might still benefit from seeing a counselor on your own."

You feel like the two of you are drifting apart, or you don’t have much to talk about anymore. You don’t feel included in each other’s lives. You don’t get excited about seeing each other in person. You’re starting to feel like keeping things going is a chore, and not something you enjoy. Your relationship is holding you back from doing things that are important to you. It feels like your partner is constantly suspicious of you, trying to control you, or trying to pressure you into doing things you’re not comfortable with. [24] X Research source"
