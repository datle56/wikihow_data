      "content": "Learn about bisexuality. Knowing more about bisexuality will help you understand your partner. There is no single model for bisexuality, since each individual is different in their emotions and feelings. A bisexual person is sexually attracted to two genders. This individual likely also loves individuals first, often with less attention to specific gender. There are a lot of myths about bisexuality, which can be harmful to your relationship if you don’t learn how these myths are just that – myths. Your relationship will strengthen if you understand the true nature of your partner’s feelings. Some of these myths are: Myth: A person is either gay or straight, not both. Humans are complex and can have very different sexual orientations, including heterosexual (attracted to the opposite gender), homosexual (attracted to the same gender), bisexual (attracted to two or more genders), asexual (not attracted to any gender), pansexual (not limited in sexual choice), or skoliosexual (attraction to non-binary identified individuals). Myth: Bisexuals can’t be faithful. People can choose to be monogamous. People's sexual orientation does not determine their ability or desire to be in a monogamous, faithful relationship. The couple decides what it means to be monogamous. Myth: Bisexuals have more sexually transmitted diseases. The rate of STDs does not correlate to someone's sexual orientation. Rather, it has to do with the individual’s care in protecting themselves from STDs."
