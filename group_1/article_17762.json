      "title": "Consider your options.",
      "content": "Consider your options. Before you commit to replacing the charging port of your iPhone at home, consider the following: Finances: While replacing the charging port at home might save you money, you will still need to purchase specialized tools and parts to complete the job. You also may end up needing to replace your iPhone if the repair doesn't work. Time: While a professional can do this fix in under an hour, it may take you two hours or more to finish it yourself. Warranty: If you attempt to repair your own iPhone, it will void any active warranty you have. Experience: This isn't the most difficult fix, but experience repairing phones is recommended. Note: The steps in this section are more general, as each iPhone is slightly different on the inside. We recommend following along with a video tutorial for the exact iPhone model you have if you want to complete this repair at home."

      "content": "Obtain the necessary materials. To replace the charging connector on your iPhone, you'll need a few tools before you begin: Screwdrivers: You'll need a few specialty screwdriver bits to complete this repair. The iFixit Minnow Driver Kit is a good option, as it comes with all the screwdriver bit sizes you'll need. Heat source: A hairdryer or heat gun will work, but you can also purchase a heat mat specifically for phone repair if you prefer. Spudger: If you don't have a spudger, a guitar pick works as well. Another good option is the iOpener kit from iFixit , which comes with a heat source, spudger, a variety of opening tools, and a precision tweezer. Magnetic tray: A magnetic tray or dish is helpful when removing screws, so you don't misplace any of them. Isopropyl alcohol: Isopropyl alcohol will help loosen the adhesive holding your charging port in place. New charging port: Make sure you buy an official Apple OEM port. Off-brand ports can cause issues with your device. This method works for iPhones with a Lightning port or a USB-C port, as their internal components are laid out similarly."
