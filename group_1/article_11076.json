      "content": "Use the shampoo daily or every other day.

      "content": "See a doctor if the odor doesn’t improve within 2 weeks. You may notice an improvement in your scalp odor within the first few uses/treatments, or it might take a little longer. If you don’t see any improvement in the odor coming from your scalp within 2 weeks after you start using a medicated shampoo, make an appointment with your doctor or a dermatologist. They can prescribe a stronger medicated shampoo to help stop the odor. [3] X Research source Your doctor or dermatologist may also want to test a sample of your hair or take a swab of your scalp to determine what might be causing the odor."

      "content": "Condition your hair from the middle of the shaft to the ends only. Don’t apply conditioner to your scalp as this may cause smelly bacteria to build up since it creates a moist environment.

Leave the conditioner on for about 30 seconds and then rinse it off with lukewarm or cool water. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Launder your towel at least once per week. Reusing the same towel over and over again to dry your hair after a shower can reintroduce bacteria into your hair after you wash them out. If you do reuse your towel, don’t reuse the same towel for more than 1 week. Also, make sure that it is spread out on a towel bar after each use so it dries out completely.

[8] X Research source As a bonus, the baking soda will remove built-up hair product and give your hair more volume. Keep in mind that baking soda can dry out your hair and scalp, so this might not be a good option if your scalp is already dry or irritated."
