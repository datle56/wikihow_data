It makes it so that all your momentum is going forward and like I said earlier in the article you cannot change direction while in midair so you can only go forward unless someone physically touches you and if he does it should be a foul. Then when you land go up again and you should have beat the weak side defender or he should have fouled you, if he has and you are unable to take the shot just throw it up and it will seem like you have been fouled. The ref will call it and you could make it too."
