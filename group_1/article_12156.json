      "title": "Chill your cookware for 10-15 minutes.",
      "content": "Chill your cookware for 10-15 minutes. Before you start making your icing, place a large metal bowl and the metal whisk attachments from an electric mixer into the freezer to chill. Your whipped cream frosting will come together and hold its shape much easier if your cookware is chilled. If you don't have a metal bowl, it's fine to use plastic. However, it's best to use metal, as metal bowls will help insulate cold whipping cream, which makes for a more stabilized icing. Be sure your bowl is large enough to hold 2 cups of whipped cream without overflowing."

      "title": "Double the recipe if you're making a double layer cake.",
      "content": "Double the recipe if you're making a double layer cake. The following recipe makes about 2 cups of whipped cream icing, which is typically enough to frost a single layer cake. If you're making a double layer cake, and plan on using whipped cream icing to frost in between your layers, double the recipe to guarantee you wont run out of frosting."

      "title": "Dissolve the gelatin into room temperature water.",
      "content": "Dissolve the gelatin into room temperature water. While your cookware is chilling, mix ½ tsp (2.5 ml) of powdered gelatin with 1 tbsp (15 ml) of water in a small bowl. Stir the mixture with a spoon until the gelatin is dissolved, then set aside."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the remaining ingredients to the chilled metal bowl.",
      "content": "Add the remaining ingredients to the chilled metal bowl. Remove your metal bowl and whisks from the freezer, and combine 1 cup (237 ml) whipping cream, 1 tbsp (15 ml) confectioner sugar, and 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla. Do not add the dissolved gelatin at this point. Leave your whipping cream chilling in the refrigerator right until you start mixing."
    },
    {
      "title": "Mix the ingredients on medium speed.",
      "content": "Mix the ingredients on medium speed. Using your electric mixer, whisk the cream, sugar, and vanilla together on medium speed for 3 minutes, or until the mixture starts to thicken. A thickened product will appear to have a greater volume than your original ingredients due to the air you are whipping into the mixture. [1] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Add the gelatin and continue mixing for 3-5 minutes.",
      "content": "Add the gelatin and continue mixing for 3-5 minutes. Once your mixture has started to thicken, add the dissolved gelatin and continue whisking on medium speed. The gelatin will act as the stabilizing agent for your whipped cream icing, so once you add it, the mixture will continue thickening and holding its shape."
    },
    {
      "title": "Stop mixing when stiff peaks form in your icing.",
      "content": "Stop mixing when stiff peaks form in your icing. Once 3-5 minutes have passed, check to see if peaks have started to form in your mixture. Lift your whisks from the bowl, and watch what happens to your cream. If the whipped cream stands straight up at the spot where you’ve removed the whisks, then your icing is finished. If the peaks are still soft, continue mixing for 1-2 minutes before checking again. [2] X Research source Avoid over-mixing your ingredients, as they might separate and become spoiled."

      "content": "Spoon ⅓ of the cream into an icing bag and set aside (if desired). Reserve ⅓ of the mixture to decorate your cake with piped designs. Once you’ve filled the icing bag, place it in the fridge to chill while you frost the cake. If you’re not planning on decorating your cake with piped icing, skip this step."

      "title": "Transfer whipped cream icing from the bowl to the top of your cake.",
      "content": "Transfer whipped cream icing from the bowl to the top of your cake. Use a rubber spatula to scrape all of the whipped cream icing from the bowl, and plop the cream on top of your cake. At this point, you should have a large dollop of creamy topping in the center of the cake. [3] X Research source Be sure that your cake has cooled completely before you start icing. If you're icing a double layer cake, transfer half of your frosting on top of your bottom layer. Use a rubber spatula to spread the frosting evenly throughout the surface. Place the second layer on top of the frosting, and then transfer the rest of your frosting to the top of the cake."

      "title": "Spread the mound of icing evenly around the top surface of the cake.",
      "content": "Spread the mound of icing evenly around the top surface of the cake. Move your spatula in small, circular motions to push the cream out and away from the center of the cake, and distribute the icing towards the edges. The goal of this step is to cover the entire top surface with a uniform layer of icing, while moving excess icing towards the sides of the cake."
    },
    {
      "title": "Spread the rest of the icing along the sides of the cake.",
      "content": "Spread the rest of the icing along the sides of the cake. Angle your spatula down and towards yourself to spread the excess icing down from the edges of the cake. Use short strokes to spread the cream evenly around circumference of the cake. Keep spreading the cream along the sides until your entire cake is covered in the icing. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a bench scraper to level the cake before piping decorations.",
      "content": "Use a bench scraper to level the cake before piping decorations. For a crisp, uniform layer of frosting that’s perfect for layering piped designs, run a bench scraper all around your cake. Start by working the bench scraper in a circle around the edges, before running it along the top. Pull the bench scraper towards you, and remove any excess frosting that collects on the blade.

      "title": "Add piped decorations to your cake.",
      "content": "Add piped decorations to your cake. Once you’ve spread an even layer of frosting onto your cake, remove your icing bag from the fridge, and add some piped designs. Pipe around the edges of the cake to make a border, and pipe along the top to create flowers or pretty dollops. Practice piping a few designs on wax paper before icing directly onto the cake."

      "title": "Place the decorated cake in the refrigerator.",
      "content": "Place the decorated cake in the refrigerator. Before serving, allow your cake to set in the fridge for at least 30 minutes so that your decorations will hold their shape. The icing will maintain its shape for 2-3 days if left in the fridge, and for several hours if left at room temperature. [6] X Research source If you leave whipped cream frosting at room temperature for longer than 3-4 hours, it may become destabilized. It will lose its fluffy, frosting shape, and it might melt off your cake."
