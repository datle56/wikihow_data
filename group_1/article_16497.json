      "content": "Save your egg shells. When you use eggs in a meal or for a recipe, save the shells. Crack open your raw eggs, rinse the shells with warm water, and let them dry in a sunny pot. Run your finger around the inside of the shell when washing it to remove any residue, but try to preserve the membrane. Most of the nutrients are in this. For best results, plan on using 4 to 5 eggs for each plant you want to fertilize."

      "content": "Crush the eggshells or grind them into a fine powder. You can crush them into flakes using your hands or a food processor. You can also grind them into a powder using a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder instead. It is possible to use whole eggshells in your soil, but they will decompose much faster if they are crushed or ground into powder. [1] X Research source To make the crushing process easier, bake the eggshells at 350 degrees until the start to lightly brown before grinding."

[2] X Research source Once you have some eggshells in the hole, put the plant inside, and pat the soil around it. Putting eggshells directly into the hole with the plant ensures that the plant will get the nutrients from the decomposing eggshells."

      "content": "Add crushed eggshells around the base of your plant. [3] X Research source You do not need to cover the eggshells with soil. As they decompose, they will leach calcium and other nutrients into the soil. This will help your plants grow into strong, healthy plants."

      "content": "Mix crushed eggshells directly into potting soil. When you buy plants from the nursery, you will need to transplant them outside, or into a new pot. Before you do this, consider mixing a handful of crushed eggshells into the soil. Overtime, the eggshells will leach their nutrients into the soil, and help the young plants grow into healthy, strong plants. If you aren't able to use eggshells right away, you can also crush them and add them to your compost bin."

Instead, consider cracking the egg near the upper third with a spoon. Save the egg yolk and white for eating later. Don't use hardboiled eggs, as the shells would be brittle. If you already cooked the egg, save the water you cooked it in, let it cool, and use it to water your plants instead. Don't use colored or painted eggs (such as Easter eggs). The pigments in paints and markers contain dyes that can harm the delicate seedlings. [6] X Research source"

When watering the seedlings, consider using a spray bottle instead of a watering can; it will be a lot more gentle on the delicate, young plants. Depending on how dry it is in your home, you may need to water the seeds every day to every few days. Consider rotating the eggshell every few days. This will allow the plants to get equal amounts of sunlight and grow more evenly. [10] X Research source You may need to pull out the smaller/weaker seedlings so that each eggshell has one plant growing in it. This will ensure that the young seedlings enough space to grow in."

Before you plant the egg in the soil, crush it slightly in your handâ€”enough to break the shell but not so much that the soil loses its shape. This will break the shell up a little and allow the roots to poke through. Eggshells are biodegradable. As they decompose, they will release nutrients and calcium into the soil, which will help the young plant grow. [11] X Research source"
