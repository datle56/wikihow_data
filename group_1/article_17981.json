      "content": "Lay the flag out face-up on a flat surface. Find a space large enough to accommodate the full size of the flag and unfurl it. Make sure there are no wrinkles or creases in the fabric. If the flag is made of nylon, you can iron it on the lowest heat setting to get rid of any stubborn wrinkles."

Don't worry, the stars will be visible once the flag is folded!

      "content": "Fold the flag in half lengthwise. Bring the bottom horizontal edge to the top and align the edges. The flag is folded in half lengthwise, so it should like a long rectangle. Be sure to smooth the fabric out to be perfectly flat."

      "content": "Fold the flag in half lengthwise one more time. Fold it in half by taking the bottom edge and aligning it with the top edge, just like you did the first time. Make sure there are no creases or wrinkles in the fabric. When working with a partner, walk away from each other to keep the material taut."

      "content": "Fold the triangle back onto the flag. The corner of the first triangle should now be pointing at you. Grab it and fold it back onto the flag, then flatten the sides and corners so they look tidy. [3] X Research source You've completed your first triangle fold."

      "content": "Keep making triangles until you run out of material. Continue making triangles using the same process until there's not enough material to make another equal fold. You should be able to fold at least 13 triangles with a large flag. For the American flag, each fold has a particular symbolic meaning. You can read about each meaning here: http://www.usflag.org/foldflag.html"

Tuck the excess material into the gaps of the triangle folds and make sure it looks tidy. [4] X Research source If you're folding an American flag, the remaining triangle should consist of only stars."
