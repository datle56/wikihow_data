      "content": "Write down the equation of the hyperbola in its standard form. We'll start with a simple example: a hyperbola with the center of its origin. For these hyperbolas, the standard form of the equation is x 2 / a 2 - y 2 / b 2 = 1 for hyperbolas that extend right and left, or y 2 / b 2 - x 2 / a 2 = 1 for hyperbolas that extend up and down. Remember, x and y are variables, while a and b are constants (ordinary numbers). [1] X Research source Example 1: x 2 / 9 - y 2 / 16 = 1 Some textbooks and teachers switch the position of a and b in these equations. Follow the equation closely so you understand what's going on. If you just memorize the equations you won't be prepared when you see a different notation."

      "content": "Factor the new equation. Factor the left hand side of the equation into two products. [3] X Research source Refresh your memory on factoring a quadratic if you need to, or follow along while we continue Example 1: We'll end up with an equation in the form (__ ± __)(__ ± __) = 0. The first two terms need to multiply together to make x 2 / 9 , so take the square root and write it in those spaces: ( x / 3 ± __)( x / 3 ± __) = 0 Similarly, take the square root of y 2 / 16 and place it in the two remaining spaces: ( x / 3 ± y / 4 )( x / 3 ± y / 4 ) = 0 Since there are no other terms, write one plus sign and one minus sign so the other terms cancel when multiplied: ( x / 3 + y / 4 )( x / 3 - y / 4 ) = 0"

[4] X Research source Example 1: Since ( x / 3 + y / 4 )( x / 3 - y / 4 ) = 0 , we know x / 3 + y / 4 = 0 and x / 3 - y / 4 = 0 Rewrite x / 3 + y / 4 = 0 → y / 4 = - x / 3 → y = - 4x / 3 Rewrite x / 3 - y / 4 = 0 → - y / 4 = - x / 3 → y = 4x / 3"

      "title": "Try the same process with a harder equation.",
      "content": "Try the same process with a harder equation. We've just found the asymptotes for a hyperbola centered at the origin. A hyperbola centered at (h,k) has an equation in the form (x - h) 2 / a 2 - (y - k) 2 / b 2 = 1 , or in the form (y - k) 2 / b 2 - (x - h) 2 / a 2 = 1 . You can solve these with exactly the same factoring method described above. Just leave the (x - h) and (y - k) terms intact until the last step. Example 2 : (x - 3) 2 / 4 - (y + 1) 2 / 25 = 1 Set this equal to 0 and factor to get: ( (x - 3) / 2 + (y + 1) / 5 )( (x - 3) / 2 - (y + 1) / 5 ) = 0 Separate each factor and solve to find the equations of the asymptotes: (x - 3) / 2 + (y + 1) / 5 = 0 → y = - 5 / 2 x + 13 / 2 ( (x - 3) / 2 - (y + 1) / 5 ) = 0 → y = 5 / 2 x - 17 / 2"

Even if it's in standard form for hyperbolas, this approach can give you some insight into the nature of asymptotes. Rearrange the equation so the y 2 or (y - k) 2 term is on one side to get started. [5] X Research source Example 3: (y + 2) 2 / 16 - (x + 3) 2 / 4 = 1 Add the x term to both sides, then multiply each side by 16: (y + 2) 2 = 16(1 + (x + 3) 2 / 4 ) Simplify: (y + 2) 2 = 16 + 4(x + 3) 2"

Remember, when you take the square root, there are two possible solutions: a positive and a negative. (For example, -2 * -2 = 4, so √4 can be equal to -2 as well as 2.) Use the \"+ or -\" sign ± to keep track of both solutions. [6] X Research source √((y + 2) 2 ) = √(16 + 4(x + 3) 2 ) (y+2) = ± √(16 + 4(x + 3) 2 )"

The asymptote of a hyperbola is a line that the hyperbola gets closer and closer to as x increases.

      "content": "Adjust the equation for large values of x. Since we're trying to find the asymptote equation now, we only care about x for very large values (\"approaching infinity\"). This lets us ignore certain constants in the equation, because they contribute such a small part relative to the x term. Once x is at 99 billion (for example), adding three is so small we can ignore it. In the equation (y+2) = ± √(16 + 4(x + 3) 2 ) , as x approaches infinity, the 16 becomes irrelevant. (y+2) = approximately ± √(4(x + 3) 2 ) for large values of x"
