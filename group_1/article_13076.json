      "content": "Go to the channel or DM you want to send the bullet point list. Alternatively, you can write your message with bullet points in another location and copy the unsent message, then paste it in another location to send it. If you copy a sent Discord message with bullet points, the bullets won't copy. You'll have to edit the message to copy it with the formatting, or add the bullet points back in after you copy and paste it."

      "title": "Type a - or *.",
      "content": "Type a - or * . Discord allows some Markdown to be used in messages. Markdown is a simple markup language that can be used to format plain text. In Markdown, - and * can both be used to create bullet points if formatted correctly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add a space.",
      "content": "Add a space. After the - or * , add a single space. If a space isn't included, the hyphen or asterisk won't turn into a bullet point. You can also add spaces in front of the - or * to create an indented bullet point. Add one space to indent once, three spaces to indent twice, five spaces to indent three times, etc."

    {
      "title": "Write the text that should go behind the bullet.",
      "content": "Write the text that should go behind the bullet. Your message should look like this so far: - Example text here or * Example text here"

      "content": "Add more lines for a bulleted list, if desired. If you want to create a bulleted list, add a line break and repeat steps 2 through 4 for each line. Once you've completed your bulleted list, you can send it. Discord will automatically format the hyphens or asterisks as bullet points. [1] X Research source To do a line break on desktop, press ⇧ Shift + ↵ Enter or ⇧ Shift + ⏎ Return . To do a line break on mobile, simply tap the ↵ Enter or ⏎ Return button."

      "content": "Use an Alt code (Windows & Mac). To add a bullet point to your message without creating a bulleted list, you can type an Alt code to enter a bullet point. There are a number of Alt codes for different bullet point styles, but for a basic black bullet point, the codes are: Windows: Alt + 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 Mac: ⌥ Option + 8"

      "content": "Copy and paste a bullet point symbol. If you want a fancy bullet point symbol, try searching \"bullet point symbol\", \"bullet point unicode\", \"bullet point ascii\", or \"bullet point typography\" in Google or your favorite search engine to find different bullet points. Once you find one you like, copy and paste it into your Discord message."

      "content": "Use an emoji. If you want to create a unique bullet point list, skip the Markdown and create your own using a cute emoji. Simply type the emoji you like first, add a space, then write your text. Continue for each line as necessary. It will have the same feel as a Markdown bulleted list with a more personal touch."
