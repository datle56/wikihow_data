      "title": "Calculate your maximum release date.",
      "content": "Calculate your maximum release date. Any release prior to your maximum release date will be an early release. To calculate your maximum release date, start with the length of your sentence. Then subtract any day for which the judge already gave you credit. For example, you might have received credit for days served in jail prior to sentencing, any days after sentencing before you were transferred to prison, and credit for good behavior during your jail term. This is the maximum time you can serve if you stay out of trouble but do not earn any additional credit during your prison term. For example, if you were sentenced to three years (1,095 days) in prison, but received 120 days of credit for time served prior to sentencing, 60 days for good behavior, and 20 days after sentencing, then you can subtract 200 days from your 1,095 day sentence, setting your maximum release date 895 days into the future."

[1] X Research source Ask your counselor if you are eligible to participate in a credit-earning program. These programs are educational and career-based programs that reward you with time off your sentence for your participation. For example, in California, you can earn up to six weeks off your sentence each year. Your prison counselor can help you sign up for a program that would be a good fit for your skills and interests."

      "content": "Keep up your good behavior. If you break prison rules or commit an offense in prison, you could lose some of your earned credit as part of your punishment. You might even lose the opportunity to participate in credit-earning assignments, forfeiting the opportunity to earn back the credit you lost in the disciplinary process. In federal prison, you can get “time off for good behavior.” If you are found to be in “exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations,” you can earn up to 54 days off your sentence each year. [2] X Research source Stated simply, obey all the rules and make yourself a model prisoner. For example, Arizona defines a model prisoner as someone who has had little to no disciplinary action taken against him or her, has helped stop criminal activity by others, has improved his or her own education (earning a high school diploma or equivalent in prison weighs in favor of time off for good behavior. [3] X Research source ), has found religion or spirituality, and who voices new positive goals for the future. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Wait to become eligible for a parole hearing. Inmates serving indeterminate life sentences (as opposed to fixed-length “determinate” sentences) are eligible for parole unless their sentences state that they are to serve life without parole. Parole is a supervised release subject to restrictions and conditions, similar to probation. If you are serving a life sentence, your sentence should specify when you become eligible for a parole hearing. For example, in California, you are eligible for a parole hearing one year before the date upon which you can first potentially be paroled. [5] X Research source"

In addition, you can look for opportunities to take on additional responsibility or self-improvement through work and education programs offered through the prison."

      "title": "Know what parole boards look for.",
      "content": "Know what parole boards look for. In deciding whether to grant parole, parole boards consider factors in favor of and against granting parole. Positive factors include stable life outside of prison, showings of remorse, your motivation for committing the crime, your age, your stated plans for the future, and your behavior in prison. Negative factors include a prior criminal or juvenile record, any history of mental illness, the severity of the crime, and any misconduct in prison. [7] X Research source As you prepare for your hearing, be prepared to discuss your feelings of remorse and your plans to find stable housing and work upon release. Give the names of friends and family members who support you, where you will live, where you want to work, and whether or not you will have a job offer open upon your release. Although you cannot change the circumstances of the crime you committed, you can explain and reframe those circumstances for the parole board. For example, if you robbed someone to support your drug addiction, that addiction does not excuse or justify the crime. Still, you can ask the board to consider that you have kicked your habit, learned to appreciate how your addiction harmed you, your family, and others, and that you intend to stay clean and become financially independent."

Depending upon the laws of your state, you may or may not be entitled to have an attorney represent you. [8] X Research source If you are permitted to have an attorney, you should strongly consider hiring one to help you prepare for the hearing and to assist you in answering the parole board’s questions. The parole board will notify you of its decision at a later date, usually within a period of several months. [9] X Research source"
