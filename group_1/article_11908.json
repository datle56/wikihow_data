Although it seems odd that he would annoy you for that reason, perhaps he does not know how to approach you. If he is your brother, he might miss spending time with you. Some boys also think making fun of you is funny. They expect that you will find their behavior to be a good joke. [4] X Research source Ask yourself these questions: Do I want to be his friend? If so, think about ways to interact with him more positively. Is he mean to other people around me? If he is mean to others or annoys them intentionally, he might be a bully. In this case, talking to your teacher is a good idea. Has your relationship changed? This is often the case with little brothers. Did you use to spend time with him? Have you stopped now? Could he be feeling left out?"

If you need something from me, please ask me nicely.\" If there is a boy who wants to be your friend but you don't like him, you could say: \"Hi, William. I appreciate the fact that you want to hang out with me. I think you are a nice person but our interests don't match well. Please stop calling my house every day.\" If the boy is your brother, he likely looks up to you. You and he will have a relationship the rest of your lives. Schedule time to hang out on a specific day. Ask him, though, to respect your need for time alone or with your friends. By showing him you care, he will less likely annoy you at other times. You could say, \"Hi, Logan. I love you very much. I need some time alone, though. Can we plan to take a bike ride on Saturday morning?\" You do not have to play or be friends with anyone. You are free to choose your friends and others must respect that."
