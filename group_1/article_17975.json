      "content": "Lay your sports coat facedown on a flat surface. Make sure it is unbuttoned so that you will be able to fold the shoulders back. Spread the arms out flat and straight. [1] X Research source You can start with the coat face up and then gently flip it over to make sure that everything is laying flat with no creases or folds."

      "content": "Fold the left shoulder back first and turn the right shoulder inside out. Tuck the left shoulder underneath the right one. Make sure that the sleeves don't get wrinkled during this process. [2] X Research source When you fold the right shoulder back, try to make sure the entire inside-out panel of the coat lays flat. When you tuck the left shoulder under the right shoulder, keep an eye on the collar to make sure it is not creasing."

      "title": "Flip over the coat and fold it in half once, horizontally, from bottom to top.",
      "content": "Flip over the coat and fold it in half once, horizontally, from bottom to top. You should now have a neatly folded sports coat or blazer ready to pack away! [3] X Research source Avoid packing your coat on the bottom of your suitcase or storage box and don’t put any heavy items such as shoes on top of it. You should store sports coats or blazers like this only for short amounts of time and hang them whenever possible."

      "title": "Lay your coat on a flat surface with the arms spread out and front side up.",
      "content": "Lay your coat on a flat surface with the arms spread out and front side up. Zip up or button up the coat to make it easier to fold. Remember to check your coat pockets before storing it away! [4] X Research source Laying the coat out on a flat surface like a bed or the floor will make it easier to fold. If your coat has a detachable hood, you can take it off and stuff it into a pocket of the coat. If you’re planning on storing your coat away for an extended period of time, consider running it through the washer and dryer before folding it to keep dirt and moisture from building up while it is packed away."

      "title": "Fold the sleeves across the front of the coat to make a rectangle.",
      "content": "Fold the sleeves across the front of the coat to make a rectangle. Start with one sleeve and fold it onto the front side of the jacket. Fold in the second arm, overlapping it with the first, so that you have a neat rectangle to work with. [5] X Research source Alternatively you can fold the sleeves to the back of the jacket. Use whichever method is easiest for you to make the coat into a tidy rectangle to roll up."

    {
      "title": "Fold the lower half of the coat onto the upper half and roll it up.",
      "content": "Fold the lower half of the coat onto the upper half and roll it up. Make one horizontal fold in the middle of the body of the coat, then roll the rest of the body up as tight as you can from bottom to top. Start from the folded side to achieve the tightest roll. Keep holding the rolled-up coat tightly in place so you can finish packing it up. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Pack the coat into the hood of your coat or use rubber bands to hold it in place.",
      "content": "Pack the coat into the hood of your coat or use rubber bands to hold it in place. If your coat has a hood, hold it open and pack the rolled-up body of the coat into it. If not, put an appropriately-sized rubber band on each end of the roll to keep it tight. [7] X Research source Even if your coat has a hood, consider using rubber bands to keep everything in place when you store it. If you don’t have rubber bands handy you could also use string to tie it up or pack your coat into a plastic Ziploc bag."

      "title": "Tuck the collar of your sports coat under your chin while standing up.",
      "content": "Tuck the collar of your sports coat under your chin while standing up. The blazer should be unbuttoned before folding it. Put the front side of the coat against your chest and stomach. [8] X Research source You could also lay the coat facedown on a flat surface if this is easier for you."

    {
      "title": "Fold the sleeves and shoulders so one side overlaps the other behind the back.",
      "content": "Fold the sleeves and shoulders so one side overlaps the other behind the back. While this is a more standard fold, it doesn't actually matter what side you fold over first. You just need to make sure that they overlap in such a way that the blazer becomes a rectangle. [9] X Research source Pinch the shoulders and sleeves where they overlap at the top or tuck them under your chin to hold them in place while you finish folding the coat."

      "title": "Fold the coat lengthwise from bottom to top and tuck the hem under the collar.",
      "content": "Fold the coat lengthwise from bottom to top and tuck the hem under the collar. Slightly lift the back of the collar and slide the hem under to keep the coat neatly folded together. This is the last fold you need to make and you should now have a coat bundle that resembles a folded dress shirt. [10] X Research source Once you master this method it’s one of the quickest and easiest ways to fold a sports jacket or blazer, ideal if you’re packing in a rush! Remember that you should not keep the coat folded up like this for extended periods of time because it can retain creases in the multiple horizontal and vertical folds that you made."
