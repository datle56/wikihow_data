[2] X Research source For example: to create an ISO file named \"blueberry\" from files in a folder called \"pie\", you would type in mkisofs -o blueberry.iso /home/username/pie . [3] X Research source File names and folder names are case-sensitive, so make sure you capitalize anything that needs to be capitalized. To create a multiple-word name, place underscores between words (e.g., \"blueberry pie\" becomes \"blueberry_pie\")."
