      "content": "Split your SUPREP into a nightly and morning dose. Although you need to take both bottles of SUPREP, you should not take them close together. Instead, you’ll take one the night before your exam, and the other the morning of your exam. Taking them at the same time increases the risk of vomiting. Ask your doctor for a recommended time frame for taking the medication. It’s best to take it well before bedtime, as you’ll need to use the restroom often for the next several hours. However, everyone’s experience is different. If your colonoscopy is scheduled before 11:00 a.m., then you’ll likely take your first dose between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. If your appointment is after 11:00 a.m., then you’ll likely take the first dose between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Then, finish your morning dose and accompanying water at least 4 hours before your appointment.

      "content": "Mix your SUPREP with water according to your label’s instructions. SUPREP must be diluted with water. Do not simply sip from the bottle, which increases the likelihood you’ll experience nausea or vomiting. The medicine must be diluted before you consume it. Your packaging will give you the proper ratio of water to SUPEP. In most cases, you’ll add 10 fluid ounces (300 mL) of water to 6 fluid ounces (180 mL) of SUPREP. Your SUPREP kit should come with a mixing bottle that has a line at the 16 fl oz (470 mL) point. This allows you to pour your SUPREP into the bottle, then add water up to the mark. It's best to use bottled water to dilute your SUPREP."

      "content": "Drink the SUPREP slowly. You might experience nausea and vomiting because you’re intaking too much SUPREP at one time. Your body may start to reject the medicine, causing you to vomit. You can avoid this by slowing your pace. [2] X Research source Sip rather than taking big gulps. If you feel a little nauseous, take a break before drinking more."

      "content": "Drink 32 fluid ounces (950 mL) of cold water over the next hour. It’s best to rinse out your SUPREP mixing container and use it to measure out two 16 fl oz (470 mL) glasses of water. Although this is a lot of water to drink at one time, it’s essential for ensuring the medication doesn’t make you become dehydrated. [3] X Research source You might become dehydrated because the SUPREP causes you to have diarrhea so your colon will be empty for your test. When you have diarrhea, your body loses fluids. You need to drink more fluids to replace what's being lost. Drinking cold water after the SUPREP can also help you avoid nausea and vomiting. It washes away the flavor of the medicine and helps soothe you."

      "content": "Chill your SUPREP in the refrigerator before use. While you can store it at room temperature, drinking it cold can make it go down easier. Place your bottle in the refrigerator for at least an hour before you drink it. [4] X Research source It’s also a good idea to use cold water to dilute your SUPREP. Even if the medication is at room temperature, cold water can make the mixture more palatable. Only add flavoring to your SUPREP if your doctor provided it in your kit or approved it. Some flavor packets may be okay, but it's possible to mess up your test results. For example, don't use anything with red coloring, as it might look like blood on your test. [5] X Research source"

      "content": "Sip your SUPREP through a straw. Using a straw helps you drink the medicine slowly. Also, it helps you minimize how much you taste it because it doesn’t wash over your entire mouth. [6] X Research source Your kit won’t come with a straw, so you’ll need to get one from somewhere else. You can find one at a local fast food joint, or you could buy a pack of straws."

      "content": "Brush your teeth or use mouthwash to remove the taste. Some people react to the flavor of the SUPREP. It can even make some people feel nauseous. If this is the case for you, it helps to brush your teeth or wash your mouth out with an antiseptic mouthwash right after you drink the SUPREP. When brushing, don’t go too far back, as this can trigger a vomiting reaction."

      "title": "Suck on hard candy to disguise the taste.",
      "content": "Suck on hard candy to disguise the taste. Put the candy in your mouth before you take the SUPREP, then remove it to take sips. You can place the candy in your mouth before each sip if this helps you keep the medicine down. Choose candies that don’t have red dyes or soft centers in them. Good options include lemon drops, butterscotch candies, and yellow or white Lifesavers or Jolly Ranchers. If you're in doubt, talk to your doctor or pharmacist."

      "title": "Avoid eating solid foods while taking SUPREP.",
      "content": "Avoid eating solid foods while taking SUPREP. While you’re preparing for a colonoscopy, you aren’t supposed to eat solid foods. Not only will eating interfere with your test results, it will also likely cause you to throw up. Stick to clear liquids only. To check if a liquid is clear, see if you can read through it. For example, apple juice has a slight color to it, but you can still read or see through it. However, orange juice is completely opaque. You can drink apple juice, but not orange juice. In addition to water, good options for clear liquids include Sprite, lemonade, and broth."

If you've experienced nausea in the past, you can discuss anti-nausea medicine with your doctor before your start SUPREP. Common anti-nausea medications include prochlorperazine (Compazine), ondansetron (Zofran), promethazine (Phenergan), metoclopramide (Reglan). [7] X Research source If you take an anti-nausea medication, only take one. Always follow the instructions on the label and don't combine multiple medications. Ask your doctor if an anti-nausea medication is right for you. They may prescribe one or recommend an over-the-counter option."

Place the unused portion of your medicine in the refrigerator to keep it cool and sip on some cold water. After your break, drink the SUPREP slowly, taking longer rests between sips.

The medicine is causing your body to produce diarrhea to clean out your system, so you need to drink more fluids to replace the ones you're losing. If you cannot keep any fluids down, you are at risk for dehydration. Dehydration can be serious, so don’t hesitate to call your doctor."
