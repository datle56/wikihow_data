      "content": "Move a stud finder along the wall and listen for a beep to reveal wires. Stud finders put out a magnetic field to detect changes in density, and some also detect metal objects or electrical currents. To use a stud finder , hold it to the wall and move it slowly back and forth until you hear it beep, indicating that there’s an object. As you work, lightly mark any spot the stud finder detects, so that you know to avoid it in the future. Note that since stud finders detect many objects, it may beep for something other than a wire, so this method works best if you’re just trying to find out where not to drill. Check the stud finder’s packaging or user manual to ensure that it can detect electrical currents as well as density. Wire detectors are similar to stud finders, but are specialized to search for wires. Their operation is often identical."

      "content": "Attach the tracer’s cable to the end of an exposed wire. Check the manufacturer’s instructions to find a way to plug in and connect your wire tracer to the electrical circuit. If a cable is sticking out of the wall, choose a connector bit that will plug into the cable. If your device comes with a traditional electrical plug, connect it to a socket at the base of the wall. If your device has clamps, attach the red clamp to a visible wire, and the green clamp to a nearby metallic object, like a pipe. [2] X Research source The transmitter is often larger than the receiver, which is usually thinner and smaller with a pointed tip on one end."

      "title": "Move the receiver in a slow line across the wall until you hear a beep.",
      "content": "Move the receiver in a slow line across the wall until you hear a beep. Power on both the transmitter and receiver. Place the pointed end of the receiver against the wall and move it slowly back and forth, horizontally or vertically. When the receiver detects an electrical current or a wire, it’ll beep to let you know. [3] X Research source Test the receiver on a spot where you know there are wires, like an outlet. Listen for the beep to ensure it’s working correctly. Adjust the tracer’s sensitivity until the signal strength is between 50% and 75%. Once the signal bar on your receiver is fully expanded, you’ve found your wire. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Plug a remote lead into another wall’s socket for a stronger signal. If possible, insert your transmitter’s remote lead (a cord with a single prong) into an electrical socket of a different wall. This boosts the signal and makes wires easier to find. [5] X Research source Avoid plugging both ends of the remote lead into sockets attached to the same wall. Some wire tracers are also equipped with a tone generator that emits different sounds for different wires, allowing you to trace individual wires within a bundle."

      "content": "Mark where the receiver beeps with a pencil or tape. Continue dragging the device slowly along the wall. [6] X Research source Any time it beeps and finds a wire, lightly mark the spot with a pencil or bit of tape. Continue following the beeps to trace the wire to its opposite terminal."

      "content": "Touch a wireless detector to the wall and listen for a beep. Or, touch the tip of the detector to the outlet where the wire originates. If the detector makes a sound and lights up, the wire is live, so practice caution. [7] X Research source A wireless detector can sometimes give phantom readings, so always follow up with a contact tester."

      "title": "Touch the prongs of a contact tester to the wire or outlet.",
      "content": "Touch the prongs of a contact tester to the wire or outlet. Contact testers, or multimeters , have 2 prongs. Use the multimeter by placing either prong into the slots of an outlet. The multimeter then tells you if the outlet, and therefore its wires, have a charge, by lighting up. [8] X Research source A plug-in tester works similarly, but in the form of a wall plug."
