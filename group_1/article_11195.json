      "content": "Measure the room and cut large pieces to fit the area. Measure the length and width of the room to determine the size of the carpet you’ll need. Cut the pieces about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) larger than you’ll need, then lay them in place. From there, you can make smaller, more precise cuts for the final carpet installation. It can be tricky to seam a carpet, so it’s better to work with as few sections as possible.

      "content": "Make long sizing cuts on the backside of the carpet. When you’re cutting large pieces of carpet to size, fold the carpet roll over and run a standard utility knife directly over the backing. [1] X Research source Press the tip of the knife down just enough to pierce the carpet’s tough backing—try not to cut through the carpet fibers, as this will make the edges of the carpet look messy. Mark the backing with a pencil or permanent marker to indicate where you need to cut, or simply use the intersecting seams as a handy visual reference. By cutting from the back of the carpet, you’ll achieve a cleaner cut with less struggle or guesswork, and you won’t have to fight your way through the thick piling. Folding the carpet will also create a more secure cutting surface, preventing you from scarring the flooring underneath."

      "title": "Cut away small sections to trim the carpet to fit against walls.",
      "content": "Cut away small sections to trim the carpet to fit against walls. Kneel down next to the wall and make a slit in the excess carpet perpendicular to the wall, running from the edge of the carpet down to where you need to cut the carpet to size. Move down about 8–12 in (20–30 cm) and make another vertical cut. Fold over the section of carpet you just cut, then run your utility knife sideways from the bottom of one cut to the bottom of the next to cut away a small rectangle of carpet. [2] X Research source For instance, if you have a 3 in (7.6 cm) overhang, you’d make two vertical slits in the carpet, each 3 in (7.6 cm) long and spaced about 8 in (20 cm) apart. You’d then remove an 8 in × 3 in (20.3 cm × 7.6 cm) section of carpet. This approach is a little slower than cutting down the whole length of the wall at once, but it will help you be more precise. Leave an extra 1 ⁄ 4 in (0.64 cm) of carpet so you can tuck it under the skirting. Be careful not to cut into the wall when you’re cutting the carpet."

      "title": "Use slow, smooth motions as you cut.",
      "content": "Use slow, smooth motions as you cut. Drag the blade along the carpet in a straight line. Once you’ve got the tip through the carpet, pull back on the knife using a slow, smooth motion. You should be able to feel the backing give way beneath the blade. If you’re making a long cut, work in small sections so you can reposition your blade as needed. [3] X Research source Keep your wrist fixed to avoid making sloppy or uneven cuts. It may help to place a straight edge cutting guide on the carpet to help hold it in place and to give you a straight line to work from. If you don’t have one, use one of the seams on the backing as a guide. If you’re cutting carpet off the roll, you can use the roll itself as a convenient reference for tracing straight lines."

      "title": "Replace your utility knife blade frequently.",
      "content": "Replace your utility knife blade frequently. Your original blade will quickly lose its edge after slicing through multiple feet of tough backing material. To keep the project moving along, be sure to have a new blade on standby. Working with a dull blade will only slow you down. [4] X Research source It may seem like a hassle to have to keep stopping to change blades, but it will save you considerable time and labor in the long run."

      "title": "Connect separate pieces of carpet together by seaming them.",
      "content": "Connect separate pieces of carpet together by seaming them. If you need to use more than one piece of carpet in a room, cut them so they overlap by about 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm). Draw a line in chalk on the top piece of carpet where you want the final seam to be and carefully cut along that line with your utility knife. Then, cut the bottom piece of carpet in 2 in (5.1 cm) sections, ensuring they line up perfectly. You can then seam the carpet —meaning you attach the pieces. The most secure way to do it is to apply carpet seam tape under the seam, then run a seaming iron over the tape (but under the carpet) to melt the adhesive. Then, press the edges of the carpet down into the tape to attach it. [5] X Research source It can be difficult to seam a carpet so it won’t show, so try to put your seam in a low-traffic area that’s not highly visible. Don’t try to seam the factory edge of a carpet—it won’t look good. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Use the tip of a utility knife to open up a hole in the carpet.",
      "content": "Use the tip of a utility knife to open up a hole in the carpet. Begin with a section a few feet away from the wall. Make a slit approximately 4–5 in (10–13 cm) long—it should be big enough to easily slip your hand into. Cutting the carpet every few feet will be useful for large or oddly-shaped rooms where you’re unable to remove it in one piece."

      "title": "Pull up on the loose carpet with your free hand.",
      "content": "Pull up on the loose carpet with your free hand. Reach into the slit you just cut and lift the carpet away from the floor. You can now finish cutting without your knife ever coming into contact with the flooring. If your carpet is tacked down with staples or adhesive, it may take a little effort to get it started by hand. Use a putty knife to chip away at one edge until there’s enough to grab hold of."

      "title": "Continue cutting the carpet as you pull it up.",
      "content": "Continue cutting the carpet as you pull it up. The combined action of lifting and slashing should allow you to cut away large strips in very little time. After every few feet, move back and take a new grip on the loose edge. When you’ve cut all the way across a given section, peel it back, roll it up and set it aside somewhere out of the way. Since you’ll be throwing the old carpet out, there’s no need for precision or delicacy here. Don’t get into too big of a hurry—that’s how accidents happen."

      "title": "Pry up the outer edge of the carpet.",
      "content": "Pry up the outer edge of the carpet. Pull the carpet free from walls and corners using a claw hammer , pry bar , or pair of pliers . That way, it won't snag on anything or provide resistance when it comes time to carry it away. Once you've gotten the edges started, go around the perimeter of the room and loosen the rest of the carpet by hand. [7] X Research source If you're having trouble, use your utility knife to separate the carpet where it connects to the baseboards. Once the carpet has been cut and unfastened, you can simply roll it up, carry it out and dispose of it."

      "content": "Clean your floors and dispose of any remaining materials. Before you call it a day, inspect the flooring beneath the carpet closely. Use a floor scraper to dig out any staples or dried clumps of adhesive, then use a shop vacuum to collect dust, stray threads and other materials that are left lying around after removal. After you’ve cleaned up, you can go on to install new carpet, hardwood, tile or laminate. [8] X Research source Unless you’re planning on repurposing your old carpet, it can simply be thrown away once the project is complete. Check with your local waste management company for guidelines on how to dispose of old carpet in your area."

DIY expert Sarah Fogle says that “while there are tools designed for cutting carpet, a standard utility knife is surprisingly efficient.” [9] X Expert Source Sarah Fogle DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. Something like an X-Acto knife or razor can also do the trick. Whatever you use, make sure the edge of the blade is nice and sharp. [10] X Research source If you’re using a utility knife with a removable blade, take a minute to carefully insert a new one before you get started, and change the blade frequently while you work. Fogle also says that you can “use a multi-tool with a cutting blade if you want to use a power tool to cut carpet.” [11] X Expert Source Sarah Fogle DIY Specialist Expert Interview. 27 July 2021. These tools feature durable edges and automated cutting action, which can help you sidestep the difficulty of doing it manually."

      "title": "Measure your work area and use the dimensions to calculate your carpet needs.",
      "content": "Measure your work area and use the dimensions to calculate your carpet needs. Measure the length and width of the room you’re carpeting, then map out how many pieces of carpet you’ll need. Most rolls of carpet come in widths of 12 ft (3.7 m), so if you have any measurements that are longer than that, you’ll need more than one piece of carpet. Measure carefully around corners, contours and openings. It may be helpful to perform a mockup of the cuts you intend to make on a scrap piece of cardboard first. And complex cutouts may be best left to the professionals. Add an extra 2–3 in (5.1–7.6 cm) to your measurements—you can make more precise cuts once the carpet is in place, but you can’t add back carpet if you cut too much. If you’re carpeting a room that’s 10 ft × 10 ft (3.0 m × 3.0 m), you may only need one piece of carpet. But if your room is 10 ft × 15 ft (3.0 m × 4.6 m), you’ll need two pieces—most likely one that’s 10 ft × 12 ft (3.0 m × 3.7 m) plus a few inches and one that’s 10 ft × 3 ft (3.05 m × 0.91 m) plus a few inches, although you may need to adjust it based on the layout of the room, the pile direction, and where you want the seam to fall."

      "content": "Call a pro if your room has complicated dimensions or seaming. Laying carpet can be difficult for a beginner, and while it’s not so bad if your room is a fairly regular rectangle shape, it’s especially tricky if you have a lot of cutouts or doorways to work around. Similarly, if your seams are going to fall in a visible area, it’s probably best to leave the installation to a professional."
