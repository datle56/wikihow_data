      "title": "Freeze the Oreos.",
      "content": "Freeze the Oreos. While you can crush the Oreos while they're at room temperature, the filling may gum up the blades of your blender or food processor. To quickly crush the Oreos, freeze them first. Simply lay the whole Oreos on a baking sheet and stick them in the freezer for at least 30 minutes."

      "title": "Place the Oreos in a blender or food processor.",
      "content": "Place the Oreos in a blender or food processor. Put the frozen cookies right into a blender or food processor. Keep in mind that you'll probably need to blend more cookies than you think to get the amount of crumbs you'll need for a recipe. For example, if you need 1 cup (100 g) of crushed Oreos, place 1 cup (or about 12 whole cookies) of whole Oreos in the food processor. Depending on how much crushed Oreos you'll need, you may need to crush the cookies in batches so they'll fit in your food processor."

      "title": "Pulse the Oreos until they're crushed.",
      "content": "Pulse the Oreos until they're crushed. Put the lid on the blender or food processor and pulse the cookies 5 to 10 times. Depending on how powerful your blender or food processor is, the Oreos should become crumbs. If your blender is deep, the cookies may become stuck underneath the blade. Stop the machine and either push the cookies closer to the blades or use a wooden spoon to stir and dislodge any stuck cookies before you continue to crush them."

      "title": "Consider freezing the Oreos.",
      "content": "Consider freezing the Oreos. If your Oreos are warm and the cream filling is becoming really soft, you may want to freeze the cookies before you crush them. Lay the whole Oreos on a baking sheet. Put the cookies in the freezer for at least 30 minutes or until the filling is hardened."

      "title": "Put the cookies in a bag.",
      "content": "Put the cookies in a bag. Get out a seal-able plastic bag and place about 12 Oreo cookies in it. Squeeze the bag to remove excess air and seal the bag shut. Lay a cloth down on your work surface and place the bag of cookies on top of the cloth. The cloth will just keep the bag from sliding around as you crush the cookies. [1] X Research source You can crush the cookies on any hard surface (such as a kitchen table, countertop, or even the floor). Avoid using an unstable surface or one that can't handle extra weight (such as a small coffee table)."

      "title": "Crush the cookies in the bag with a rolling pin.",
      "content": "Crush the cookies in the bag with a rolling pin. Take a heavy rolling pin and bang down on the bag of cookies. You can tap, whack, or roll the pin over the cookies. Keep doing this until the Oreos are as crushed as you'd like. You should get about 1 cup (100 g) of crushed Oreos. [2] X Research source If you don't have a rolling pin, you can use any heavy bottle. For example, use an empty wine bottle to roll over the bag. Ensure that you're only rolling over the cookies because whacking the bottle over the cookies could break the bottle."

      "content": "Make cookie balls or truffles . To create a truly decadent cookie dessert, combine about 3 cups (300 g) of crushed Oreos with 8 ounces (226 g) of softened cream cheese. You can then roll the mixture and cut it into cookie shapes or roll the mixture into small balls. Dip the balls in melted chocolate to make Oreo truffles. [3] X Research source Keep the cookie balls or truffles refrigerated until you're almost ready to serve them."

      "content": "Use crushed Oreos in pie crust . Instead of using graham cracker crumbs in your favorite pie crust, replace them with crushed Oreos. Once you've pressed the crust into the pie plate, you can refrigerate it for at least an hour before you use it or briefly bake the crust so it becomes crisp. Consider using an Oreo crust for one of these desserts: [4] X Research source Chocolate peanut butter. Cheesecake. French silk pie. Chocolate pudding pie."

      "content": "Sprinkle the crushed Oreos as a garnish. You can always make a dessert look a little fancier by sprinkling some crushed Oreos over it. Scatter a few tablespoons of the crushed cookies over cupcakes, cakes, whipped cream, ice cream, brownies, or hot cocoa."

      "title": "Mix crushed Oreos into ice cream.",
      "content": "Mix crushed Oreos into ice cream . You can make your own homemade ice cream and churn it in a machine. Add the crushed Oreos during the last few minutes of mixing. Or buy a carton of ice cream and let it soften a little. Stir in as much of the crushed Oreos as you like. You can eat the ice cream soft or return it to the freezer to harden a little. You can easily make Oreo milkshakes by combining 3 scoops of your favorite flavor of ice cream with 1 cup (240 ml) of milk and about 1/2 cup (50 g) of crushed Oreos."
