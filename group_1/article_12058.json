That way, your partner won't feel ambushed with what you have to say. Additionally, it gives you both a chance to pick a good time together. [3] X Research source For example, you could say, \"I'd like to have a discussion about the way we argue, particularly the way I feel like I always end up being in the wrong. When's a good time for you?\" If your situation differs a bit, you could say something like, \"I'd like to have a discussion with you about how I feel my opinion is often not valued.

That is, talk about what's wrong starting with \"I,\" focusing on your feelings, rather than starting with \"you,\" which sounds like you're blaming the other person. Using \"I\" statements is generally more effective at opening a dialogue. [4] X Research source For instance, you might say, \"I feel like that most of the time I end up being 'wrong' in an argument or discussion. I get upset because you're insistent that you're correct, and I end up giving up on the issue.\" Alternatively, you could say, \"I feel like you don't respect my opinion or expertise in most situations. It makes me upset to always be in the wrong.\" On the other hand, \"You always think you're right and I'm wrong\" isn't a good way to start the conversation. Reader Poll: We asked 214 wikiHow readers, and 57% agreed that the best way to handle your partner saying something hurtful to you is to defend yourself in a respectful but firm way so they know they can't talk to you like that .

Once you realize that you both feel that way, you can work towards having better communication in the future. To get your partner talking, make sure to give them an opening in the conversation.

[6] X Research source For instance, if your partner says, \"Well, that's just stupid. You are wrong most of the time,\" that's not a very supportive or open response. On the other hand, a response such as, \"I hadn't realized that I made you feel that way. That is a problem.

If they do that consistently, it's likely emotional abuse, and you need to think about whether you should stay in the relationship or not. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Business Review Online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices Go to source If you decide to stay, you need to start to stand up for yourself by asserting yourself in the relationship. That is, think about whether your partner uses tactics like thinking and telling you that you're always wrong to change the way you act or to gaslight you (convince you that what you know to be true is wrong). In other words, say you go to a movie, and you think that the main character was rude. Afterwards, your partner tries to convince you that you're wrong, saying things like, \"The character wasn't rude; he was just standing up for himself. You just don't know how to stand up for yourself. You're weak, which is why you couldn't get along without me.\" Your partner is using emotional abuse to convince you that what you think or feel is wrong, with the intention of gaining control over you. In this situation, you could say, \"I disagree, and I have a right to my opinion. That character called his wife a dirty name with no remorse. That's rude.\""

That is, your partner may be trying to bend you to fulfill their needs. [10] X Research source Just identifying the ways your partner manipulates you can help you to start changing the relationship. However, once you identify those times, you can start resisting that manipulation. For example, your partner may make you feel guilty, even about things you should be enjoying. If you decide what movie to go see, your partner might say, afterwards, \"Well, I'm glad you're happy, but that wouldn't have been my first choice. I mean, obviously that other movie would've been better, but you had to see that one, so I guess it's okay.\" You could reply, \"You're not going to make me feel bad about seeing that movie. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad we went.\" They may also make you feel bad because of the insecurities they hold. Maybe you decide to go out one night with your friends, and your partner doesn't like it, saying, \"I'm sorry, but I don't like you going out with your friends. I should be enough for you, right?\" You could say in return, \"It sounds like you're feeling a bit insecure about my other relationships.
