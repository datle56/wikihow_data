      "content": "Look for micro-expressions. Micro-expressions are facial expressions that flash on a person's face for a fraction of a second and reveal the person's true emotion, underneath the lie. Some people may be naturally sensitive to them, but almost anybody can train themselves to detect these micro-expressions. Typically, in a person who is lying, their micro-expression will be an emotion of distress, characterized by the eyebrows being drawn upwards towards the middle of the forehead, causing short lines to appear across the skin of the forehead."

[1] X Research source Martin Soorjoo, <i>The Black Book of Lie Detection</i> This might be due to a rush of adrenaline to the capillaries in the nose, causing the nose to itch. [2] X Research source A lying person is more likely to cover their mouth with a hand or to place the hands near the mouth, as if they're covering up the lies. If the mouth appears tense and the lips are pursed, this can indicate distress. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 [4] X Research source Listen for sniffles. Sometimes, touching the nose a lot just means that the person is having allergies, or fighting a cold."

      "title": "Notice the person's eye movements.",
      "content": "Notice the person's eye movements. Sometimes you can tell if a person is remembering something or making something up based on eye movements. When people remember details, their eyes move up and to the left if they are left-handed. When right-handed people make something up, their eyes move up and to the right. People also tend to blink more rapidly (\"eye flutter\") as they're telling a lie. People (especially men) might rub their eyes more when they're lying. [1] X Research source Martin Soorjoo, <i>The Black Book of Lie Detection</i> Watch the eyelids. These tend to close longer than the usual blink when a person sees or hears something they don't agree with. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 However, this can be a very minute change, so you will need to know how the person blinks normally during a non-stressful situation for accurate comparison. If the hands or fingers also go to the eyes, this may be another indicator of trying to \"block out\" the truth. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 Be careful about relying on eye movements to catch a liar . Recent scientific studies have cast doubt on the idea that looking a certain direction can help pinpoint someone who is lying. [5] X Research source [6] X Research source Many scientists believe that eye directionality is a statistically poor indicator of truthfulness."

[1] X Research source Martin Soorjoo, <i>The Black Book of Lie Detection</i> They may naturally break eye contact and look at non-moving objects to help them focus and remember. Liars may deliberately make eye contact to seem more sincere; this can be practiced to overcome any discomfort, as a way of \"proving\" that truth is being told. Some liars tend to make more eye contact, because they think it might make them look sincere. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 Lack of eye contact is sometimes a sign of stress. For example, if you ask a person a question and they look away, it might be a sign that the question is stressing them out.

It's either because the person in question has rehearsed their answer (or is expecting to be questioned) or rattles off something, anything, in order to fill the silence. If you ask someone a question and the person responds right away, it might be a lie. This can be because the liar has rehearsed the answer or is already thinking about the answer just to get it over with. Another tell can be omission of relevant time facts, such as saying \"I went to work at 5 AM and when I got home at 5 PM, he was not there.\" In this glib example, what happened in between has been all too conveniently glided over.

Someone who hasn't told the truth needs to compensate for their lie by perhaps going on the offensive, deflecting, or another stalling tactic. If you question their story, a truthful person will often give you more details. A liar is more likely to just repeat what they already said, because they don't want to make their story even more complicated. [4] X Research source Listen for a subtle delay in responses to questions. An honest answer comes quickly from memory. Lies require a quick mental review of what they have told others to avoid inconsistency and to make up new details as needed.

Someone might try to change the subject in this clever way: \"I was going — Hey, did you get a new haircut this weekend?\" Be especially cautious of compliments from the subject in question.

Fidgeting can also be a sign of awkwardness, restlessness, discomfort, or a need to use the toilet. People with disabilities like ADHD or autism may fidget a lot. This doesn't mean anything about honesty; it's just how they stay comfortable. Stillness doesn't always mean honesty. Some liars stand or sit very still because they are so focused on their lie."

Some examples of failed mirroring that might alert you that something's not right: Look at leaning. Leaning away is a sign of discomfort, dislike, or disinterest. A liar may lean away from you, not wanting to give out any more information than they need to. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 An honest person is more likely to lean toward you (unless you're making them uncomfortable).

      "content": "Watch the person's throat. A person may constantly be trying to lubricate their throat when they lie by swallowing, gulping or clearing their throat. Lying causes their body to increase production of adrenaline, which gets their saliva pumping and then creates very little. While the saliva is surging, the subject might be gulping it down.

In a non-stressful situation, people tend to be comfortable and take up space by being expansive in hand and arm movements, perhaps sprawling their legs comfortably. In a lying person, these parts of the body will tend to be limited, stiff, and self-directed. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 The person's hands may touch his or her face, ear, or the back of the neck. Folded arms, interlocked legs and lack of hand movements can be a sign of not wanting to give away information. Liars tend to avoid hand gestures that we consider a normal part of discussion or conversation. With some caveats, most liars will avoid finger pointing, open palm gestures, steepling (fingertips touching each other in a triangle shape often associated with thinking out loud), etc. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 Check the knuckles. Liars who stay motionless may grip the sides of a chair or other object until the knuckles turn white, not even noticing what's happening. [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 Grooming behaviors are common in liars, such as playing with hair, adjusting a tie, or fidgeting with a shirt cuff. [4] X Research source [11] X Research source Two caveats to remember: Liars can deliberately slouch to appear \"at ease\". [3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 Yawning and bored behavior may be a sign of trying to act just a little casual about the situation so as to cover up deception. Just because they're at ease doesn't mean they're not lying. Keep in mind that these signals may be a sign of nervousness and not a sign of deceit.

This may indicate that they're lying or trying to conceal something from you. If asked \"Did you ever hit your wife?\", a liar might say \"I love my wife.

[3] X Research source Joe Navarro and John R Schafer, <i>Detecting Deception</i>, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, July 2001 They want you to believe the lies being woven; silence gives no feedback on whether or not you've bought the story. By being patient and remaining silent, many deceitful people will keep talking to fill that silence, embellishing and possibly slipping up in the process, without even being asked anything! Liars try to read you to see if you've bought the tale. [4] X Research source If you don't show any signs of something to monitor, many liars will feel uncomfortable. If you're a good listener, you'll already be avoiding interruptions, which in itself is a great technique to let the story unfold.
