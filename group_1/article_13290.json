The whole number becomes the numerator and 1 becomes the denominator of the fraction. Saying 4/1 is really the same as saying 4, since you're just showing that the number includes \"1\" 4 times. The problem should read 2/3 รท 4/1. [2] X Research source"

Therefore, the next step is to multiply the numerators and denominators of the fraction to get the new numerator and denominator of the final answer. [6] X Research source To multiply the numerators, just multiply 2 x 1 to get 2. To multiply the denominators, just multiply 3 x 4 to get 12. 2/3 x 1/4 = 2/12"

      "title": "Simplify the fraction",
      "content": "Simplify the fraction . To simply the fraction, you need to find the lowest common denominator , which means that you should divide both the numerator and denominator by any number that divides evenly into both numbers. Since 2 is the numerator, you should see if 2 divides evenly into 12 -- it does because 12 is even. Then, divide both the numerator and denominator by 2 to get the new numerator and denominator to get a simplified answer. [7] X Research source 2 รท 2 = 1 12 รท 2 = 6 The fraction 2/12 can be simplified to 1/6. This is your final answer."
