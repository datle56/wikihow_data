      "content": "Choose a base lotion or oil with SPF 15 or 30. To get tan quickly, you'll need to apply a lotion or oil with a low SPF, but you still want to make sure you have some protection from the sun's powerful rays. Choose between rub-on lotions , aerosol sprays , and oil rubs that all contain some SPF. [1] X Trustworthy Source American Cancer Society Nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research, education, and support Go to source Ideally, choose an SPF 30 for a good balance of protection and sun exposure. Wear a lip balm with at least SPF 15. You don't need your lips to be tan, and getting a sunburn on your lips is downright painful. Put on sunscreen at least 20 minutes before you lay out to give it time to soak in. [2] X Expert Source Margareth Pierre-Louis, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 May 2020."

A good rule of thumb is to turn in 1/4 revolutions every half hour. Start on your back, then turn to your left side, then your stomach, and lastly your right side. [3] X Research source Make sure to change the position of your arms and legs frequently to avoid awkward tan lines."

      "content": "Position yourself in direct sunlight. As the sun moves across the sky, move your towel or lounge chair so that you can always be in direct sunlight. If you don't want to lay around all day, you can also do something active outside, wearing as little clothing as possible to allow the sun to hit your skin. [4] X Research source You can get tan in the shade, but it may take longer. To target areas on your body even more, use a tanning reflector (basically a shiny piece of fabric) to point the sun at specific parts of your body."

Find a nude beach or a private (fenced) area of your backyard and let the sun work its magic! [6] X Research source If you can’t strip down all the way, consider wearing a strapless top or bathing suit. This will help you avoid pesky tan lines while getting an all-over glow."

Since you'll be spreading the lotion all around your body with your hands, they will absorb much more of the lotion or oil than the rest of your body. Buy disposable gloves and wear them when applying self-tanner to avoid having hands darker than the rest of your body. [13] X Research source Throw the gloves away after use and use a new pair each time you apply. Make sure to rub some lotion or oil into your hands after you finish applying it to the rest of your body. You want them to be the same color of the rest of your body, just not darker."

      "content": "Exfoliate your skin before getting sprayed. Make sure to get rid of all of the dead and rough skin on the outer layer of your body before getting sprayed. Choose an exfoliating scrub that is oil-free and contains some sort of rough beads or granules that will polish your skin. Use a loofah or a washcloth in the shower to scrub your body.
