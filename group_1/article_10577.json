      "content": "Gather your materials. To make a lemon battery you will need a copper penny, a galvanized nail, a lemon (10 total), a knife, and a voltmeter. Adult supervision is recommended, especially while handling the knife. Rinse the penny with a light detergent to ensure you are working with a clean surface. [2] X Research source Any lemon will do, but a lemon with a thinner rind will make a better battery. If you have one, a strip of copper will work better than just a penny. Galvanized nails have a zinc coating that is important to this experiment. [3] X Research source They can be found in any standard hardware or home improvement store. Aluminum foil can be substituted for the nail if you don’t have one. A voltmeter can be purchased at a hardware or home improvement store."

      "content": "Squeeze the lemon without breaking its skin. You can roll the lemon on a table applying a small amount of downward pressure. The squeezing action releases the juices inside the lemon needed for the battery to work. The acidity of the juice in a lemon makes it ideal for this sort of chemical reaction. It contains the solution of molecules necessary to carry electric current between the two metal ends of a battery. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Cut a small slit through the rind in the middle of the lemon.",
      "content": "Cut a small slit through the rind in the middle of the lemon. The slit needs to be large enough to insert the copper penny about halfway into the lemon. Adult supervision is recommended for this step. You want the penny to stay firmly in place so don’t cut the slit too large. [5] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Insert the penny and the nail into the lemon.",
      "content": "Insert the penny and the nail into the lemon. The penny should fit nicely into the slit you’ve already made. The nail should be pushed into the lemon about 2 centimeters away from the penny. These items will serve as the positive and negative ends of your battery. The metals need to be close to each other in order for the necessary chemical reaction to take place. [6] X Research source Be careful not to have the nail and penny touch within each lemon. If they touch, the battery will short circuit and you won’t get any voltage. Make sure the penny and the nail are deep enough to be in contact with the juice of the lemon."

      "title": "Attach the voltmeter clips to the nail and penny.",
      "content": "Attach the voltmeter clips to the nail and penny. Using the end clips of the voltmeter, attach one clip to the nail and the other clip to the penny. You should see a small increase in voltage on the voltmeter. If the voltmeter is reading a negative value, simply switch the clips on the nail and penny and it should change to a positive voltage. If the voltage is very low, try moving the nail closer to the penny."

      "content": "Gather your tools. A multi-cell battery is when you connect multiple batteries together. In this case, you will link multiple lemon batteries together. To make a multi-cell lemon battery you will need four copper pennies, four galvanized nails, four lemons, a knife, 15 inches of copper wire, wire cutters, a ruler, and a voltmeter. Any lemon will do, but a lemon with a thinner rind will make a better battery. Adult supervision is strongly recommended, particularly when using the knife. Clean the penny with a light detergent to maintain a clean working surface. [7] X Research source If you have one, a lobster claw will do. Galvanized nails have a zinc coating that is important to this experiment [8] X Research source and can be found at a local hardware or home improvement store. Aluminum foil can be substituted for the nail if you don’t have one. You can link as many lemons together as you’d like to increase the voltage."

      "content": "Cut the copper wire into five 3-inch pieces. Adult supervision is recommended for this step. Measure out 3-inch pieces of wire and snip them using the wire cutters. They don’t have to be exactly 3 inches, you just need enough wire to wrap around a penny and a nail."

      "title": "Connect a penny and a nail with one piece of wire.",
      "content": "Connect a penny and a nail with one piece of wire. You are going to make copper-wrapped nail and penny pairs. Take a bit of wire and wrap it a few times around the penny and then take the other end and wrap it around the top of the nail. The penny and nail will be inserted into separate lemons so be sure to leave enough space (about 1.5 inches) between them. [10] X Research source Ensure the wire is wrapped tightly around each piece. The battery will not function as well without proper contact between each connection. You should have three penny and nail pairs when you are finished."

      "content": "Wrap a piece of wire around just one penny and one nail. The battery will begin with a single copper-wrapped penny and end with a single copper-wrapped nail. Just as you did before, take a piece of wire and wrap it a few times around a penny. Using a separate piece of wire, wrap that a few times around the top of the nail. [11] X Research source Again, wrap the wire tightly around each piece to make good connections."

Stick the copper-wrapped penny into the slit you cut into the top of the first lemon in the chain. Insert the copper-wrapped nail into the last lemon in the chain. It is not super important that all of your lemons stay lined up as long as the single penny and nail are stuck into separate lemons."

The first lemon in the chain will already have a penny, so stick the nail end of a pair into the first lemon. The second lemon will get the penny from that pair. The second lemon will also get the nail from the second pair of copper-wrapped pennies and nails. [13] X Research source Continue alternating between pennies and nails until you reach the last lemon which will already have a single copper-wrapped nail. Be careful not to have the nail and penny touch within each lemon. If they touch, the battery will short and you won’t get any voltage."

You should see an increase in the voltage reading on the voltmeter. If the voltmeter is reading a negative value, simply switch the clips between the nail and the penny and it should change to a positive voltage. If the voltage is very low, try moving the nails closer to the pennies in each lemon and make sure all of the wires are in contact with each penny and nail."
