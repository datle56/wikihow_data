Place meditation cushions in the area, so that you have a comfortable place to sit when you meditate. Create an extra peaceful vibe by placing candles and healing crystals around. You can also include a vase of fresh flowers, or pictures of beautiful places. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source"

      "content": "Choose a comfortable position. While many people meditate in lotus position (sitting with your legs crossed), there’s more than one way to meditate. You can stand, sit on the floor or in a chair, or even lie down. Experiment with different positions to find what feels natural to you. You’ll be stationary for several minutes, so it’s important to feel relaxed and at ease in whichever position you pick! While lying down is quite comfortable, make sure you don’t fall asleep! It’s quite common to begin meditation and then float off into dreamland. To further ensure your comfort, make sure the temperature isn’t too hot or too cold in the room, and wear comfortable clothing that won’t bother or distract you."
