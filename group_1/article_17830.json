      "content": "Snap a cute, playful selfie and send it only to your crush. Spend the extra few minutes getting your lighting right, throwing on a cute outfit, and fixing your hair. Take a few selfies and choose the cutest one to send to your crush. [1] X Research source Include a caption like, “So bored 😆 wyd?” or, “Feeling super extra today 🤪.” Don’t put the selfie on your story, no matter how cute it is! If your crush thinks your selfie isn’t just for them, they may assume you aren’t flirting with them. You can go with a cuter, smiling vibe for a coy look, or raise an eyebrow and purse your lips out to go for a more seductive vibe."

      "content": "Be a little forward and provocative to elicit a response. Want to get their blood pumping a bit? Don’t hesitate to be mess with your crush a bit. If you send them a cute selfie, you might say, “No way you can handle me today 😜.” If you respond to a snap of theirs, you might say something like, “Oh, so you think you’re bad huh? Just how bad are you? 😉” [2] X Research source Don’t get mean! The trick here is to make it clear that you’re just goofing around. Teasing gets to the core of that playground flirting everyone used to do as a kid. It sends the signal that you’re fun, easygoing, and maybe a little naughty in the best ways possible."

      "content": "Give your crush something to respond to in your snaps. It is totally okay to send your crush an occasional snap with no caption or intuitive way to respond, but the occasional question gives your crush something to respond to. It also opens the door for conversation to develop over Snapchat! You might: [3] X Research source Take a snap of the night sky and ask, “Do you believe in aliens? Space is so big and scary.” Snap a photo of your dog and say, “Are you a dog or a cat person? Don’t worry, Rufus won’t judge you.” Shoot a photo of the book you’re reading and go, “You ever read this? I’m halfway in and I’m not sure if it’s worth finishing.”"

      "title": "Use playful, energetic, and funny captions to draw your crush in.",
      "content": "Use playful, energetic, and funny captions to draw your crush in. Whether you’re snapping your boo privately or posting on your story, get creative with the captions. You may be cute as a button, but the caption is the material your crush is most likely to reply to. [4] X Research source You might: Take a selfie and write, “If I was a fruit, I’d totally be a FINEapple.” Shoot a short video of your dog, then turn the camera on yourself and write, “Cute < Cuter.” Take an ironic vid of your hair blowing dramatically in front of a table fan and say, “This is my biggest fan.” Snap a photo of your lunch and write, “Who will be my bae-ritto?”"

      "title": "Emojis are fun, inviting, and can help convey your interest quickly.",
      "content": "Emojis are fun, inviting, and can help convey your interest quickly. Flirting with emojis can be a cute way to convey your interest in someone without putting yourself too out there early on. You can drop a cute emoji into a DM convo, or rely on them heavily in the snaps you send. [5] X Research source A sweet, loving emoji conveys closeness. You might say, “You’re the best 🥰” or, “I can’t wait to see you 🙈.” The “I’m up to no good” emojis are a fun way to hint at your sensual side. You could say, “I’m up for anything 😏” or, “What are you trying to get into tonight? 😈” Be careful with the explicitly sexual emojis (🍆, 💦, 🍑, etc.), especially if you don’t know them super well. If you two are getting really flirty and you’re comfortable, go for it!"

      "content": "Give yourself puppy ears or put hearts around you to convey cuteness. Snapchat filters that add some cute visuals or make you look more attractive can be a great way to entice your crush to flirt back. Pick fun filters , but don’t overdo it by using them in every snap you send. [6] X Research source Unless the two of you have a super ironic and self-deprecating sense of humor you’ve been bonding over, avoid the filters that make you look unappealing, like the one that makes you look like a senior citizen."

      "content": "Snapchat shares who watches your stories, so show them you’re paying attention. If your crush is into you, seeing your name pop up early and often on their stories is a great way to let them know you’re paying attention. It’s also a good way to give you two something to talk about, since people use their stories to share what they’re doing throughout the day. [7] X Research source Comment on their story periodically to publicly show your interest and show you’re serious about them. [8] X Research source Just be friendly and playful in the comments. You might say things like, “Looks like you had a blast 😊” or, “What a cool experience!” Reader Poll: We asked 241 wikiHow readers, and 59% agreed that the best way to start a conversation with your crush on Snapchat is to reply to their Story . [Take Poll] If you want a flirty, natural way to start chatting, try responding to your crush's story with a question or a compliment."

      "content": "Your Snapchat streak is a big sign you’re both interested. When you and another person snap each other every single day, you start a streak and get a little 🔥 next to their name in your contacts. The streak is a subtle little sign that there might be something going on between you two! [9] X Research source This is also a great excuse to send them a snap and talk every day!"

      "title": "After a few weeks of snapping back and forth, message them!",
      "content": "After a few weeks of snapping back and forth, message them! The transition from Snapchat photos/videos to the DMs is a huge sign you two are developing something here. Shoot your shot by messaging them directly. You could reference something from their recent snaps or simply ask them how they’re doing. [10] X Research source You might say: “Hey! How’s it going stranger? I thought it might just be faster to chat here.” “I really loved that snap you sent earlier today. You’ve got such a snazzy sense of style.” “What’s up? What are you doing tonight?” Give your crush time to reply to you without pushing too hard. Take things slow and play it cool by only sending your crush one snap at a time."

      "content": "Make them feel special by keeping snaps you send your crush private. Don’t share any snaps you send them on your story. This is a great way to subtly communicate that you’re really invested in your crush without actually saying anything. If you share all of your private snaps with other friends or on your story, they may think they aren’t special to you. [11] X Research source Skip the nudes unless you’re both over 18 and you’re absolutely positive you want to establish that kind of relationship with one another."

If the energy feels right and you’ve got a good sense that they’re into you just as much as you’re into them, ask them on a date . [12] X Research source You could say: “Are you interesting in getting a coffee or something this weekend?” “Sorry if this is super forward, but I really like you. Do you want to catch a movie?” “Hey, I know you’re into punk music. I’ve got an extra ticket to a show this weekend. Want to be my date?”"
