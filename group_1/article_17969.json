If you use your stroller frequently, store it in the trunk of your car, your garage, your front hallway, or a closet when you’re not using it. For long-term storage, place your stroller in UPPAbaby’s Travel Bag and keep it in a cool, dry room, like your garage. If you have limited floor space, hang your stroller on a stroller hanger . Just ensure the hanger can support the weight of your stroller. Keeping your stroller in a cool, dry place helps prevent it from growing mold and mildew and getting damaged by the elements."

It is not compatible with Vista models made before 2015."

The stroller is designed to grow up with your baby with easy-to-use attachments that allow you to change out the bassinet with a front or rear-facing toddler seat. The UPPAbaby Vista can accommodate up to 3 children at a time with optional attachments, so it can also grow with your family. The base stroller comes with several attachments, including the bassinet, toddler seat, bug shield, rain shield, and storage bag."

      "content": "Cons: Pricey, large, and heavy. The UPPAbaby Vista costs around $1,000 due to its high-quality design, which puts it on the pricier end of strollers. It is also larger and bulkier than other strollers, so it takes up more space in your car and home. The stroller is also pretty heavy and can be difficult to carry. Most optional attachments cost at least $50, so upgrading your UPPAbaby Vista can be costly, too."
