      "content": "Be cautious about using the results you get from these services. For privacy concerns, many online search sites are unlikely to provide as much information as you want. Most VIN searches, especially the free ones, let you know if a car has a history of being stolen or damaged, but they won’t give you personal names or contact information. For an additional fee, you may be able to receive names of prior owners but be wary of the results. These search engines are only as accurate as the information fed into public databases. The ones that claim to be able to give you personal information about prior owners are usually less reputable. In fact, in the \"small print\" on some search sites, the company warns you to \"independently verify\" any information you recover."
