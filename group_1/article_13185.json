      "content": "Toss your lighter in the garbage if it’s required by law where you live. Look up the phone number for your local sanitation or waste management department. Call them and ask about the regulations surrounding lighter disposal in your area. In many cities and states, you are required by law to throw lighters out since it’s impossible to recycle them. If this is the case where you live, you have no choice but to throw the lighter out. [1] X Research source Even when they’ve been emptied out, lighters will ruin recyclable materials. The gas residue will make it impossible for a recycling plant to safely process the metal or plastic. Additionally, if the gas gets on other items, they won’t be recycled. You may be able to find this information on your local government’s website, but many states don’t list information about lighter disposal online. This process applies to disposable and refillable lighters alike. It doesn’t matter if your lighter uses butane or lighter fluid."

      "content": "Empty your lighter by burning off the excess fuel. Do this outdoors in a safe area, at least 4 feet (1.2 m) away from any flammable materials. Turn your lighter on and let it burn until the flame goes out. Depending on how much fuel you have left in the lighter, this may take anywhere from 2 seconds to 10 minutes. However, if you’re throwing your lighter out because it is empty, this shouldn’t take long. [2] X Research source Do not pour lighter fluid or butane down the drain. Even if you can physically access the fuel or butane, the gas will erode septic tanks and sewer lines. It may also damage the environment, even after the gas is filtered at a water treatment facility. [3] X Research source"

      "content": "Bring your lighter to a household hazardous waste site if required. In many cities and states, it is illegal to throw a lighter out in the trash. Contact your local sanitation or waste management department to find out if you can take your lighter to a household hazardous waste site. If you can, this is the ideal way to dispose of a lighter since the gas won’t interfere with other items at the landfill as they’re processed. [5] X Research source A household hazardous waste site, often abbreviated HHW, is a dedicated waste facility that disposes of items one at a time to ensure that local laws are followed and safety standards are upheld. Items at these sites are typically incinerated or destroyed, but it’s still safer than throwing your lighter in the trash."
