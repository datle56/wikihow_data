      "content": "Use a public waste collection point for most household WEEE.

      "content": "Find a nearby collection point that will accept your WEEE. Stiftung EAR (elektro-altger√§te register), the government organization in charge of enforcing WEEE regulations, has a directory of registered and authorized collection points available at https://www.ear-system.de/ear-verzeichnis/sammel-und-ruecknahmestellen . Search using your postcode or the name of the city and state where you live to find collection points near you. [3] X Research source Since the information appears in the directory exactly as it was originally provided to Stiftung EAR, you might want to contact the facility you find and double-check that they'll accept your WEEE before you make a trip there. If you're a business owner or manufacturer, sign a contract with a recycling center to come and take your WEEE on your schedule. You can also ship most waste to the recycling center using common shipping carriers. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Take your WEEE back to the store where you originally purchased it. Larger retail stores with an EEE sales area 400 square meters or larger are required by law to take back WEEE. Smaller stores may also accept WEEE voluntarily. [5] X Research source Retail stores will take smaller WEEE, such as used batteries, regardless of where you originally purchased them. If you are purchasing a new device to upgrade or replace an old device, you're required to turn in your old device when you purchase the new one. Online retailers are also required to take back WEEE. Typically, you can ship your WEEE back for free, although you may be required to cover some or all of the shipping charges in some instances. The specific retailer will have more information.

      "content": "Erase any files on old electronics before getting rid of them. If you're planning on selling or donating your used electronics, particularly smartphones or computers, make sure no personal data remains. You can take your device to a tech and have them do it for you or you can do it yourself. If you're doing it yourself, buying hard drive eraser software is typically the most efficient way to ensure that you've removed all personal data from the device. [7] X Research source Some of these programs are free, while others have a small download fee. Search online and choose the program that will work for your device and has the capacity to erase all the types of files you need."

      "content": "Contact local charities to find out what they take. Depending on where in Germany you live, there might be several nonprofit or charity organizations available that would be willing to take your electronic waste. Typically, it must be functional and in working order. [8] X Research source If you live in a larger city, such as Berlin, you can use a charity collection point to drop off all goods you want to donate, including electronics. You might even be able to get the WEEE you want to donate picked up free of charge. Search online to find out what charitable resources are available in your area if you want to donate used electronics or appliances."

      "content": "Place a listing online to sell or give away your items to the public. If your electronics are still in good working order and you think someone would be willing to pay for them, you might also try selling them online. Auction websites are good for this, or you could try more local resources, such as local groups on social media. [9] X Research source There are many active local groups on Facebook Marketplace in Germany where you can sell items or give them away. If you're selling items online and need to meet a local buyer in person, arrange the meeting in a safe public place."
