Squeeze your butt muscles as you lift your leg and try to keep your abdominals firm. Slowly lower your leg back to the starting position, then repeat eight to 10 more times before switching to the other leg. You can wear ankle weights around your knees to increase the resistance and make this exercise more challenging."
