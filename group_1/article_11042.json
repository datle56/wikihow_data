      "content": "Examine your risk factors to see if an HPV infection is likely. Some behaviors and physiological traits put you at a higher risk for an HPV infection. Ask yourself the following questions to see if your risk of infection is elevated. Your doctor will most likely ask the same questions when you go in for testing: [3] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source How many sexual partners do you have? The more partners, the more likely you can acquire the virus. Do you use condoms? This barrier helps reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HPV. How old are you? Genital warts are most prevalent among adolescents, teenagers, and young adults. Do you have a severe infection or cancer, or are you taking drugs that damage your immune system? Infections such as HIV/AIDS reduce the body's ability to fight infections. Blood cancers such as leukemia alter our immune cells and cause them to be dysfunctional. Drugs such as steroids reduce our immune system over time. Did you notice any skin damage to your genitals? Breaks in your skins such as cuts give the virus an opportunity to enter your body. Do you have an uncircumcised penis? Men who have not had the foreskin of their penis removed are more likely to acquire HPV and pass it along to their partners. Do you smoke? Tobacco use increases your risk of infection from any type of HPV. The correlation is strongest for men smoking 10 or more cigarettes a day."

      "content": "Look for flesh-colored lesions and other symptoms of HPV genital warts. It’s possible to confuse warts for other conditions that cause genital bumps or sores, like herpes or syphilis. Schedule an appointment with your doctor for a fast and proper diagnosis. In the meantime, look for the following characteristics of HPV to help you distinguish genital warts from other conditions at home: [4] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. [5] X Research source HPV warts are flesh-colored lesions and may be flat or raised. Redder, fluid-filled blisters are more likely genital herpes. [6] X Expert Source Heather Richmond, MD Board Certified Dermatologist Expert Interview. 15 September 2020. HPV warts are not fluid-filled and do not burst open. Genital herpes blisters are painful and can open into a sore, spilling fluid before healing. An ulcer (open skin lesion) on your penis can also signify the first stage of syphilis. Lesions caused by syphilis are usually painless. HPV warts are not usually painful. Though not always painless, pain and itchiness are more associated with herpes than genital warts. HPV warts are not dimpled. A dimple on the top of the wart can indicate a viral infection known as mulluscum contagiosum. Mulluscum can be a sign of HIV infection as well. Other symptoms—including a red rash on the palms and soles, white patches in the mouth and genitals, fever, hair loss, and sore throat—in addition to genital warts may be secondary stage syphilis. Multiple small bumps around the base or tip of the penis that are either flesh colored, red, yellow, pink, or translucent could be a condition known as pearly penile papules and are completely harmless. This is considered a normal variant of penile skin and is not contagious."
