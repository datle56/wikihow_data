      "content": "Look for activities that suit their personality and interests. When looking for an activity a shy or uninterested child will enjoy, consider what their interests are and what personality traits may make them more inclined to enjoy certain activities. If the child is particularly outgoing, for example, you may want to sign them up for a social activity like a soccer team, rather than a solitary activity like cross-country running.

      "content": "Introduce them to a wide variety of activities to find what they enjoy. While it takes some time and effort, introducing the child to a number of different activities will help you both narrow down what they like and don’t like. Once they find an activity they’re interested in, they’ll be much more likely to get out there and be active and engaged. [4] X Research source For example, take them to both a football game and a yoga class. If they seem bored in the yoga class but attentive during the game, try signing them up for a competitive group sport. While this is particularly important for young children, it can also be helpful for older children as well. By encouraging them to try out a wide variety of new activities, you’ll show them it’s never too late to start participating in something that’s both fun and good for their physical and mental well-being."

      "content": "Let them preview the activity before they get started. If you know a child is shy and nervous to try a new activity, try taking them to watch it first so they’ll have a better idea of what to expect. Shy children may need more time to get accustomed to new places, people, and activities. By taking them to watch the activity beforehand, they’ll likely feel more comfortable when it’s time for them to participate. [5] X Research source If you aren’t able to go to the activity location beforehand, show them pictures or videos of the activity online. [6] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to encourage your shy middle schooler to play ice hockey, taking them to watch a practice at the rink may help them feel more comfortable and confident ahead of their first practice."

      "content": "Choose small group activities so they won’t feel overwhelmed. To help a shy child feel more comfortable with new activities, sign them up for activities that take place in small group settings. While joining the football team may be overwhelming for some shy kids, for example, small group tennis lessons may be a less intimidating environment. [7] X Research source Activities that are more individualized and have an easier pace are another good option. Yoga classes, for example, are a great option for shy children because they can participate in their own way and move at their own pace."

      "title": "Urge them to try an activity more than once.",
      "content": "Urge them to try an activity more than once. Trying a new activity can be stressful and intimidating for shy children, which might make them want to dismiss an activity after the first try. In many cases, though, they might just need another attempt to gain a bit more confidence. Urge them to try it one more time to see if they like it better once they know what to expect. [8] X Research source The exception is if the child experienced physical, mental, or emotional harm the first time they tried the activity. In that case, reassure your child that they don’t have to return or participate again."

      "title": "Schedule time to participate in activities with them.",
      "content": "Schedule time to participate in activities with them. If you’re finding it hard to motivate a child to be more active, try making time to do activities with them. If you want them to spend more time being creative, sign up for a parent-and-child art class. If you want them to exercise more, go for bike rides together. Leading by example shows them the benefits of these activities and allows you to spend some quality time together.

Going for bike rides, shooting hoops at the park, and rollerblading are all great activities that encourage your children to be more active and confident."

      "title": "Let the child know you’re proud of them.",
      "content": "Let the child know you’re proud of them. Whether the child excels at an activity or not, it’s important that you use positive reinforcement to show them that you’re proud of them for participating. Giving them a hug, a high five, or complimenting something they did well will go a long way in helping your shy child feel more confident. This in turn motivates them to continue participating in the activity and improving. [11] X Trustworthy Source Child Mind Institute Nonprofit organization providing evidence-based care for children with mental health and learning disorders and their families Go to source For example, if your daughter recently joined the school orchestra and had her first concert, try telling her afterward, “You sounded amazing during that last song!” Even if they made several mistakes throughout the concert, focusing on what they did well helps boost their confidence and feel more inclined to stick with it. In addition, it can be helpful to use rewards occasionally to encourage your child to participate. For example, if they’ve been hesitant to participate in classroom activities at school, offer extra dessert as a reward for a positive report from their teacher."

Not only does it lessen the cost for you if they decide to quit, but it gives them a chance to participate in a potential new activity without pressure.

      "title": "Explain why they should participate in an activity.",
      "content": "Explain why they should participate in an activity. There will inevitably be situations where older kids need to participate in activities they don’t like. Explain why it’s important they participate, and what they’ll gain by doing so—whether it’s new friends or something to put on college applications. They’ll be more inclined to participate if they understand the benefits. [14] X Research source For example, if your child is in high school and wants to quit working on the school paper, try making it clear to them why they should continue to participate. Instead of telling them, “Because I said so,” take time to explain how honoring their commitment to the paper is respectful to their peers and good for their college applications."

      "title": "Describe the variety of ways they can participate.",
      "content": "Describe the variety of ways they can participate. If a child is reluctant to participate in an activity they’ve never done before, they may have a narrow idea of what that activity entails. If they’re not interested in participating in the most obvious sense, try encouraging them to participate in some capacity, even if it’s not how they originally envisioned. [15] X Research source For example, some students participate in classroom activities by raising their hand a lot. Others participate by answering questions and taking diligent notes. By explaining the variety of ways a child can participate in school, they’ll be more likely to figure out what works best for them. If you’re trying to encourage your son to get involved in more extracurricular activities but he’s not interested in joining a sports team, for example, try encouraging him to participate by becoming the team’s student manager."

      "title": "Apply what motivates them in other areas to this activity.",
      "content": "Apply what motivates them in other areas to this activity. To encourage an older child to participate in an activity they don’t want to do, try first asking them why they enjoy an activity they’re already involved in. If you can assess what motivates them to participate in that activity, you may be able to find ways to apply that to the new activity as well. [16] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to get your daughter to read more and watch TV less, try first asking her, “You’re so committed to your bowling league. What do you like about it so much?” If she tells you that she loves bowling because it’s fun and she gets to hang out with her friends, try suggesting she start a book club with her friends. By adding in the social aspect that she loves about bowling, she may be more motivated to read."

      "content": "Don’t force them into an extracurricular activity if it’s not a good fit. It can be frustrating if your child doesn’t show interest in something that you think would be good for them. While it’s important that you encourage them to give it a fair chance, if they aren’t enjoying it, they likely won’t be motivated to participate. [17] X Research source In addition, if you try to force them to participate in something that they’re really just not feeling, they could end up feeling resentful towards you and the activity."

      "content": "Pair shy children up with outgoing children when possible. When you sense that a shy child is reluctant to participate, try putting them in a pair or small group with a few outgoing children that you know will be welcoming and encouraging. In a small group setting, outgoing children may pick up on the child’s reluctance and help them open up and feel more comfortable with the activity. [18] X Research source Similarly, try getting them involved in activities with their friends or children they know so they’ll feel more comfortable from the get-go."

      "content": "Give students a role that encourages them to interact with others. In many cases, shy children are reluctant to participate in activities because they’re intimidated by the social aspects. To help them move past this, try giving them a role in the activity that requires them to interact with other kids. Interacting in a structured setting can help them feel more comfortable being social with others and participating on their own over time. [19] X Research source For instance, if you’re teaching a middle or high school debate class, try assigning a shy child to serve as the debate moderator or timekeeper. They’ll be able to participate and interact with other kids without the pressure of debating on a team themselves."

      "content": "Get them involved in activities where others depend on them. If you notice that a child isn’t self-motivated, try encouraging them to get involved in group activities where other people will depend on them to do their part. Like adults, older children are often motivated to honor their commitments because they know others are depending on them. Finding a group activity helps hold them accountable while giving them a strong sense of purpose. [20] X Research source If you’re a high school teacher and you’ve noticed that one or more of your students isn’t participating much in class, try giving the class a group project. Assign each group member a specific role. Students who are usually reluctant to participate may feel the pressure to contribute more since their group members are relying on them."

      "content": "Ask them why they don’t want to participate. Get to the root cause of their refusal to take part in the activity. Do they feel shy and nervous about meeting new people? Did they find the coach or teacher too intense? It’s important to learn why the child doesn’t want to participate so you can address any fears, insecurities, bullying, or other obstacles they’re facing. [22] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The child may be scared or embarrassed to open up at first because they think their reasoning is silly or they don’t want to disappoint you. Reassure them that you want to help them participate and have fun, and that you’re there to help them with any concerns they have."

      "title": "Validate their concerns.",
      "content": "Validate their concerns. If a child shares that they’re worried about trying a new activity because they’re shy, bored, or uncomfortable, acknowledge their feelings. Don’t shut them down by trying to explain why their feelings are incorrect. Instead, take time to talk about why they might feel that way and what you can do to support them as they try a new activity. [23] X Research source"

If a child seems reluctant to participate in an activity, it can be helpful to take some time to talk to them about the aspects you know they’ll enjoy. By focusing on how much fun they’ll have, you’ll be able to get them excited to get started. [24] X Research source For example, if you’re trying to get a middle school child to be more physically active, sign them up for their school’s rowing team and emphasize how much fun they’ll have with their teammates. You may say, “You’ll have so much fun being on the water every afternoon at practice, and you’ll get to hang out with your best friend even more!”"

After a failed attempt to participate, they may be nervous about jumping into a new activity again. Plus, during the break, they can think about what they want to try next."

      "title": "Give them time to become confident with participating.",
      "content": "Give them time to become confident with participating. Every child is different. Some are naturally confident and curious about new things, while others take a long time to warm up to activities. What’s important is that you’re patient and supportive of the child every step of the way. Eventually, they’ll find what they enjoy and be eager to participate in an activity without needing your encouragement anymore."

      "content": "Yes, it’s normal for children to resist participation sometimes. Like adults, children get scared about trying new things, meeting new people, and entering new environments where they don’t know what to expect. Unlike adults, they don’t always understand why they should participate or that it won’t be as bad as they fear. By encouraging them and supporting them, you help them become more comfortable with participation over time. [25] X Research source As a parent, relative, or educator, help a shy or uninterested child by validating their resistance to participate in an activity. Let them verbalize their feelings and concerns. Encourage them to try anyway, validate their successes, and reward them when they do participate."
