      "title": "Place your palms flat on the floor while kneeling.",
      "content": "Place your palms flat on the floor while kneeling. Ensure the palms are aligned directly under the shoulders. If hand placement is too wide or narrow, you’ll be engaging other muscles too much and minimizing not only the stability, but also the effect on the muscles being worked by the pike up.

      "content": "Move into a plank position by straightening your body. The plank should look like the starting position for a pushup, where your palms are on the ground, arms are straight, and the body (i.e. legs, torso, neck) is aligned. This move will work your abdominal muscles, lower back, triceps, and all major leg muscles. [2] X Research source Your body should be entirely straight, from head to toe. This may be difficult at first, and your muscles may fatigue enough to start quivering. [3] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Stabilize your body.",
      "content": "Stabilize your body. By pushing your toes into the ground and squeezing the buttocks muscles, the strain is taken off the abs somewhat. Without locking out your knees, tighten your leg muscles. Finally, locate a spot approximately 1 foot in front your hands to ensure proper neck alignment. [4] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Raise your hips.",
      "content": "Raise your hips. The initial part of the movement out of the plank should be a matter of weight distribution. As you raise your hips into the pike, which will resemble an inverted-V shape when completed, the weight will shift some from your arms muscles to your leg muscles. Your hips should be as high as possible, with your hamstrings fully extended. It is similar in form to the downward facing dog position in yoga, but with less emphasis on stretching and breathing, and more focus on the muscular repetitions. Push your palms down flat into the floor to ensure you’re not moving back too far. Do not bend your knees. You may need to walk your feet in a step or 2 to achieve the inverted-V shape. Make sure to keep your back straight for the entire exercise. Do not round it."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower your head.",
      "content": "Lower your head. While the weight is shifting backward, you should begin lowering your head. If you keep your neck in a static position, there will be a considerable amount of strain on the back of the neck muscles. [5] X Research source Once you reach the top of the pike position, you should no longer be looking at the spot in front of your palms. Instead, you should be looking somewhere near the ground directly under your waist."

    {
      "title": "Hold the pike up position.",
      "content": "Hold the pike up position. Depending on your strength and conditioning, even holding the position for a second could be challenging. However, with more practice, you’ll be able to extend the length of time you can hold the pike up. Try holding the position for 1 second to start. Ensure the abdominal muscles are being kept tight while moving upward. Otherwise, there may be unnecessary strain on the back or other muscles. [6] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Return to the initial plank position.",
      "content": "Return to the initial plank position. Slowly straighten your hips back out, keeping your core engaged. Correspond the movement of your neck so that your vision moves forward as you’re straightening out your body. This return to plank is the completion of 1 repetition."
    },
    {
      "title": "Complete multiple reps.",
      "content": "Complete multiple reps. Depending on fitness level, it may be difficult to accomplish more than a few reps. For beginners, do minimal sets with minimal repetitions. Go until you feel some fatigue in the arms, abs, and back. Once you've built up endurance, strive for 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps."
    },
    {
      "title": "Start from your knees.",
      "content": "Start from your knees. Instead of keeping the full plank position, start on all-fours. Once you start your hip shift backward and upward, straighten your legs at the same time. This will delay the amount of time where pressure and tension are on your core."
    },
    {
      "title": "Walk your feet forward.",
      "content": "Walk your feet forward. If you find the top of the V to be difficult, particularly on the abs, try repositioning your feet. At the top of the V, when you are experiencing the most stress, shuffle your feet forward towards your hands just a few inches at a time. Continue moving forward until you feel like you can hold the V a little easier. Moving the feet forward adds extra load to the front of your body, and will increase the weight your shoulders and triceps have to hold steady."
    },
    {
      "title": "Add in a pushup.",
      "content": "Add in a pushup. Once you’re at the top of the V, make it a bit more difficult by adding a pushup to the process. Instead of a 2-count movement, it will now be a 4-count movement. Raise from the plank into the inverted-V, then bend your elbows and slowly lower your head towards the ground while maintaining the inverted-V angle. The top of the head will get close to the ground; so, be careful. Then engage your triceps and shoulders, pushing back into the inverted-V. Finally, return to the plank position."

      "title": "Get into a raised plank position with a Swiss ball under your feet.",
      "content": "Get into a raised plank position with a Swiss ball under your feet. A Swiss ball (a.k.a. stability ball, yoga ball, gym ball, or Pilates ball) is an inflatable, rubbery ball that can be used to improve balance and stability. By adding it to the pike up, your upper and lower bodies are forced to work together to stabilize, and all the work comes from the core. This makes it an excellent variation if you're trying to strengthen your abdominals beyond the usual crunches. Your toes should be pointed so that the top, or laces, of your sneakers are resting on the ball. Keep your back flat and straight — not sagging or rounded. Your arms should be in push-up position, under your shoulders and straight (though not locked). Be careful when attempting this exercise. It's extremely challenging and requires balance, and you could harm yourself if your arms give out or you fall off the ball."

    {
      "title": "Lift your hips into the inverted V-shape.",
      "content": "Lift your hips into the inverted V-shape. As you raise your hips, the ball will roll forward. Do not roll the ball so far forward that you fall off — your toes should maintain contact with the ball while you are in the pike position. Keep your abs very tight, your hips square with the ground."
    },
    {
      "title": "Hold the position.",
      "content": "Hold the position. You may only be able to hold this position for a moment. Start with 1 second and, as you improve, hold for longer. Again, make sure your abs are tight, which will help keep your balance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lower your hips and return to the starting position.",
      "content": "Lower your hips and return to the starting position. Using your core for stability, slowly lower your hips back down, rolling the ball backward, until you are in the raised plank position. This return to plank is the completion of 1 repetition. You may only be able to do a couple of reps at first. That's okay. Work your way up to doing 8 or 10 reps."
