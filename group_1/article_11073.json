Always follow your doctor's and pharmacist's instructions exactly when using the cream. Permethrin is topically applied and has a few side effects such as burning/stinging and itching. [11] X Research source Permethrin only kills mites and not ova (eggs), so a second application is necessary for treatment. Two applications at least one week apart (this is how long it takes an egg to hatch) is the minimum treatment required to make sure it is eradicated. For people with a severe infestation and weakened immune system, doctors may prescribe Ivermectin as an oral treatment. Ivermectin is an oral medication. It is generally used for crusted scabies and taken as a single one-time dose. Some doctors may prescribe a second dose after one week. Side effects of Ivermectin include fever/chills, headache, loss of appetite, joint pain and rash. [12] X Trustworthy Source American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities Go to source Your doctor may prescribe other creams instead of the Permethrin. These include Crotamiton 10%, Lindane 1%, or sulfur 6%. These are less common, and are used if a patient has failed treatment with Permethrin or Ivermectin. Treatment failure is frequent with Crotamiton. Side effects of Crotamiton include rash and itching. Lindane is toxic if overused or misused. Side effects of Lindane include seizures, and rash.
