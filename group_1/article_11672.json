      "title": "Agree to plans when you’re in a great mood.",
      "content": "Agree to plans when you’re in a great mood. If your friend calls you up and wants to include you in a fun outing, like a trip to the bowling alley or the movies, check in with yourself. See if you’re up to that type of hangout and if it sounds like a good time. If you’re excited by the idea, then plan to meet up—see the opportunity as a way to unwind instead of as someone else’s date. [1] X Research source While you’re out, bond over common interests instead of your romantic lives. For example, if you try out mini golf, then swap tips about techniques and how to keep your score low."
    },
    {
      "title": "Invite another friend along.",
      "content": "Invite another friend along. When your buddy who’s in a relationship reaches out, float the idea of bringing someone else into the mix. Tell them that you think that this new person would add to the dynamic and that they’re always down for a good time. If you put together a whole crowd, there’s no chance you’d be a third wheel. [2] X Research source If everyone hits it off, then you might be able to plan more get-togethers with your friend. That way, it’ll be more natural for them to talk about group outings instead of dates."

    {
      "title": "Get to know your friend’s partner.",
      "content": "Get to know your friend’s partner. If you find that you are spending a lot of time with a couple, invest some effort in learning about whoever your friend is dating. You may find that you really enjoy their company as well. Once you've had enough conversations with this new person, you may feel excited that your buddy is dating them because you have more opportunities to see them. If it feels right, try hanging out with just your friend’s partner. You two might develop a strong friendship on your own."
    },
    {
      "title": "Include your friend and their date in your own plans.",
      "content": "Include your friend and their date in your own plans. Turn the tables and reach out to the couple. Take the lead and suggest a spot that you’ll all love. For example, if you’re all really adventurous, bring up a few rounds of laser tag or an escape room. When you’re assertive, fun-loving, and energetic, it’ll seem like you’re the life of the party instead of a sidekick. [3] X Research source Reach out regularly and share lots of events with your friend and their date. When you’re outgoing and creative, it won’t seem like they’re the ones including you in their dynamic."

    {
      "title": "Suggest that you all check out some festivals or parties.",
      "content": "Suggest that you all check out some festivals or parties. If you invite the couple to an event that's really crowded, like a concert or an amusement park, then it'll seem a lot less like an intimate date. The spotlight won't shine on just the two of them anymore, and the three of you can even make some new friends. [4] X Research source Be on the lookout for activities that require group participation. A round of beach volleyball, for example, doesn't exactly scream romance."
    },
    {
      "title": "Act positively.",
      "content": "Act positively. With the right mental framework, you can make someone else’s date a positive experience. Shift the mood from romance to friendly fun. Be chatty and engaging or try buying a round of drinks. If you put all your effort into keeping everything light, you’ll probably look back on the night as a good time and forget it was even a date. [5] X Research source Take charge right away and bring up ways to entertain everyone. For example, challenge your friend's date to a game of pool. You'll draw attention to how spontaneous you are. Smile, laugh, and crack jokes. When you're lively and sociable all night, you'll make anyone feel like they're lucky to spend time with you."

    {
      "title": "Give your friend and their date space if they need it.",
      "content": "Give your friend and their date space if they need it. If the couple wants to enjoy a lot of PDA, like cuddling or kissing, then let them do their thing and entertain yourself. Check your phone, text a friend, or see if you can occupy yourself some other way, like playing darts at a bar. You’ll send the message that you’re really independent, and the happy couple will probably respect how understanding you are. [6] X Research source If they also need some privacy to talk, excuse yourself and say you’ll give them a moment. If you’re polite and cheerful, the couple might realize that they should be more inclusive if they’re inviting you to spend time with them."

      "title": "Make sure you have reliable transportation.",
      "content": "Make sure you have reliable transportation. Sometimes, a couple might get a little hot and heavy or just a bit too sappy. If the two lovebirds only have eyes for each other, it’s totally fine to just hitch a ride or drive back to your place. Give a polite goodbye, then treat yourself. For example, play some video games with your friends. [7] X Research source Ultimately, it’s important to make sure your social needs are met and that you enjoy yourself."

      "content": "Arrange times to hang out with your friend one-on-one. If your best friend is in a romantic relationship, it may be hard to see them as much as you would like. Plus, when you do catch up, they might be with their partner. If you feel like you could use a little one-on-one time, talk to your friend and set up a time to hang out, just the two of you. [8] X Research source Try to call or text and find room in your schedules for lunch or coffee. If you plan a day in advance, it'll be easier to commit to it."

      "title": "Enjoy your independence.",
      "content": "Enjoy your independence. Your friend’s relationship might be a great time to do your own thing. Instead of spending all your free time with your friend and their partner, focus on what excites you and makes you happy. Prioritize your hobbies or pick up new skills. You might end up feeling relieved that your friend is busy with their love life so you can pursue your own passions. [9] X Research source Take some classes on your own, like cooking or karate. Enjoy peace and relaxation, like meditation or yoga. Pursue a fun challenge, like training for a race with some other friends."

      "content": "Encourage your friend's relationship. Let your friend know that you are there for them and that you have their best interests at heart. This will help strengthen your friendship and make things feel really natural when you hang out with the couple.

One easy way to deal with being a third wheel is to move on and discover your own \"special someone.\" Look at your friend’s relationship as an opportunity to find some romance. Try dating around a little and see what happens. You might just end up arranging some whirlwind double dates. [11] X Research source Your friend or their partner might even be able to set you up with someone. If you're not looking for a romantic relationship, try developing some of your other friendships.

They may not realize that they are excluding you and impacting how you feel. When you're open and honest about your perspective, you can all handle any miscommunication and make room for everyone. [12] X Research source Stay calm when you interact with everyone to keep the mood friendly. For example, say, \"Hey! I just wanted to catch up and check in about last week's party.\" Then, share your concerns and offer a solution. You might say, \"I feel like I just don't see everyone as much as I'd like to. Why don't we hop on a group chat tonight and plan something we can all do?\""

      "content": "Introduce your friends to some of your other buddies. Bring some new people into the mix and broaden your friend group. If you manage to get a whole crowd together, you'll have other people to hang out with, and your buddies might realize that they don't need to stick with just each other. This might change the dynamics so your friends are more inclusive and less focused on one-on-one hangouts.
