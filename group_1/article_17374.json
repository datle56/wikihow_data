Ideally, there should be a three inch overhang between the edge of the hood and the edge of the cooking space. [2] X Research source"

Determine from which direction the wiring will come and which direction the duct will go (either from above or behind the hood), based on how the old hood was installed. The new hood should have pre-cut areas that can be knocked out with a hammer and screwdriver to accommodate whichever side the holes need to be on. Work carefully so as not to damage the metal of the hood as you remove the knockouts. The wiring knockout should create a small, round hole in the hood."

One way to do this is to lift the hood up to where you will install it and have someone else create an outline by tracing inside the holes with a pencil. [7] X Research source Alternatively, you can measure the holes, then measure the space, find the center point of the wall, and align your holes accordingly. This method works well if you don't have a helper to trace the holes for you. The instructions that came with your hood should provide further guidelines on creating outlines for the holes via this method. [8] X Research source Make certain to plan for both duct and wiring holes. If the duct and wiring holes in your new hood match up exactly with the old one, you may not need to mark or cut your wall. In this case, you can skip parts 2 and 3 altogether and work with the existing holes and ducting."

Drill all the way through the interior wall and out through the exterior wall of your house. [9] X Research source These holes in the outside wall should line up exactly with the ones inside, allowing you to install a duct cap outside that will line up perfectly with your interior ductwork. If your stove is positioned against an interior wall, you will need to install additional ducting to create a vent to the outside. The duct can go up through the cabinets and between ceiling joists, and then out through the nearest exterior wall. However you position your duct, make certain it ultimately leads outdoors. Never create a ventilation duct that ends in your attic or anywhere else inside your home. This can create serious mold problems. [10] X Research source"
