      "content": "Pick the shrimp meat from the shells. Cooked shrimp keeps best if it's been shelled before freezing. Pull off the shells and tails with your hands and snap off the head, if you didn't remove it while cooking. [1] X Research source Avoid leaving cooked shrimp out on the counter for more than 2 hours. If you don't have time to shell all the shrimp at once, put them in the fridge between breaks. You can also remove the large vein along the shrimp's back if you prefer, but it's not necessary for freezing."

      "title": "Place the cooked shrimp on a baking sheet and put it in the freezer.",
      "content": "Place the cooked shrimp on a baking sheet and put it in the freezer. Remove the shrimp from the pot and line them evenly along a baking sheet. Leave them in the freezer until they become firm and hard to the touch. This will prevent the cooked shrimp from clumping together, as cooked shrimp is best preserved separately. [2] X Research source Freeze the shrimp within 1-2 days after boiling them to keep them from spoiling. If you don't have enough space to keep cookie sheets in the fridge long-term, don't worryâ€”you will store them in smaller containers after they've frozen."

      "title": "Pack the shrimp in large freezer bags.",
      "content": "Pack the shrimp in large freezer bags. When you've frozen the shrimp, remove the cookie sheet from the freezer and transfer them to sealable bags. As you close the bags shut, squeeze out as much air as possible before putting them in the freezer. [3] X Research source Label the bags with the date before you put them in the freezer. That way, you know how long you have until they expire."

      "title": "Remove the shrimp heads",
      "content": "Remove the shrimp heads before freezing them. Pull off the heads of the shrimp with your hands or chop them off with a knife. Unlike freezing cooked shrimp, do not take off the shells or veins. Raw shrimp stays preserved best if it's left in its shell while frozen. [6] X Research source Do not leave raw shrimp on the counter for more than 2 hours to prevent spoilage. Although you can remove the shrimp shells to conserve space, they may not retain as fresh of a flavor."

      "title": "Wash the shrimp under running water.",
      "content": "Wash the shrimp under running water. Place the shrimp in a bowl and place them under your sink's faucet. Turn on the water and rinse them thoroughly, removing any visible debris if you notice any. Getting the shrimp wet before freezing them creates an icy glaze that helps them stay preserved longer."

      "title": "Pack the shrimp in rigid containers.",
      "content": "Pack the shrimp in rigid containers. Take the shrimp out from the sink and place them in a tupperware container or similarly rigid container (like a yogurt tub). Leave as little room between the shrimp as possible to limit how much air is in the container. [7] X Research source Freeze the packed shrimp within 1-2 days, as raw shrimp can only last up to 2 days in the fridge."

      "title": "Pour a brine solution into the container.",
      "content": "Pour a brine solution into the container. Mix a brine solution of 2 tablespoons of salt per 1 US qt (0.95 L) of water. Fill the container with the brine, leaving about an inch or several centimeters at the top for the water to expand, and set it in the fridge to store it. Until the brine freezes, leave the container in a spot where it can stay upright to prevent spilling. [8] X Research source Label the container with the date to help you remember how much time you have until it expires. You can buy brine from some seafood specialty shops as an alternative."
