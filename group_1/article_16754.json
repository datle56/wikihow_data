      "content": "A horizontal asymptote (HA) is a line that shows the end behavior of a rational function. When you look at a graph, the HA is the horizontal dashed or dotted line. When you plot the function, the graphed line might approach or cross the HA if it becomes infinitely large or infinitely small. [1] X Research source Horizontal asymptotes can occur on both sides of the y-axis, so don't forget to look at both sides of your graph."

      "content": "Remove all terms but the terms with the biggest exponents of x {\\displaystyle x} . Since you're not actually solving an equation, you're simply comparing the leading terms in your rational function. [2] X Research source For example, if your equation is f ( x ) = x 2 + x + 3 3 x 2 + 5 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {x^{2}+x+3}{3x^{2}+5}}} , remove all but the leading terms to get x 2 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {x^{2}}{3x^{2}}}} . As another example, your equation might be f ( x ) = 2 + 5 x 2 + 4 x 3 x 4 + 6 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {2+5x^{2}+4x^{3}}{x^{4}+6}}} . After you remove all but the leading terms, you'll have 4 x 3 x 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4x^{3}}{x^{4}}}} . To give you another example, if you have f ( x ) = x 3 − 1 4 + x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {x^{3}-1}{4+x^{2}}}} , ignore the constants to get f ( x ) = x 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {x^{3}}{x^{2}}}} ."

Remember, you're not solving the equation—you're simplifying the leading terms in order to see the limits of the function. [3] X Research source To go with the previous example of x 2 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {x^{2}}{3x^{2}}}} , cancel out both of the x 2 {\\displaystyle {x^{2}}} to get 1 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{3}}} , which shows you the horizontal asymptote. For the other previous example of 4 x 3 x 4 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4x^{3}}{x^{4}}}} , cancel out the top x 3 {\\displaystyle {x^{3}}} and take away x 3 {\\displaystyle {x^{3}}} from the denominator to get 4 x {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{x}}} which becomes 0 {\\displaystyle 0} . For the last example of f ( x ) = x 3 x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {x^{3}}{x^{2}}}} , remove x 2 {\\displaystyle {x^{2}}} from the numerator and denominator to get x {\\displaystyle x} ."

If the polynomials in the numerator and denominator cancel each other out, you're left with the coefficients. Use the ratio of the coefficients to find the HA. [4] X Research source Going back to our first example of f ( x ) = x 2 + x + 3 3 x 2 + 5 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {x^{2}+x+3}{3x^{2}+5}}} , you ended up with 1 3 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{3}}} .

      "content": "If the numerator is at a lower degree, then the HA is located at y=0. This can be put another way—N<D means y = 0 {\\displaystyle y=0} or the numerator is less than the denominator so y = 0 {\\displaystyle y=0} . For our previous example of f ( x ) = 2 + 5 x 2 + 4 x 3 x 4 + 6 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {2+5x^{2}+4x^{3}}{x^{4}+6}}} , you ended up with 0 {\\displaystyle 0} , so the horizontal asymptote is 0 {\\displaystyle 0} , which is also the x-axis."

      "content": "If the degree of the numerator is higher, there is no horizontal asymptote. It might help to remember this rule as N>D=no HA. When the numerator is greater than the denominator, it's not possible to have a horizontal asymptote. [5] X Research source In the previous example that started with f ( x ) = x 3 − 1 4 + x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\frac {x^{3}-1}{4+x^{2}}}} , you were left with x {\\displaystyle x} . Since x {\\displaystyle x} is larger than a nonexistent denominator, no HA is possible with this equation."
