[1] X Research source Leave about 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) of yarn extending below your finger and let the rest of the yarn fall behind your finger. Press your thumb on the same hand against your fingertip to hold the yarn in place. Your pattern will recommend a yarn weight and hook size, but worsted (or aran) weight yarn and a size H-8 (5 mm) hook in any material are good choices for beginners."

[2] X Research source Now, adjust the second loop you made so that it goes over the top of the first loop, forming a slanted X shape. Once you've formed this X shape, hold the slack from the rest of the yarn in your middle and ring fingers on the same hand."

It’s on the left if you made the loop on your right hand and the right if you made it on your left hand. Pinch this arm with your free hand and pull on it to make it slack."

Pull the back arm under and through the front arm of the X to form another loop above your finger. [3] X Research source Once it's about as big as the loop on your finger, slide the whole thing off of your finger carefully. Try again if you don’t end up with a clear loop and a very open, loose beginning of a knot."

      "content": "Pull on the yarn to adjust your loop. Hold the loop and pull the short end of the yarn to tighten the knot. Maintain a tail length of 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm). Once the knot is tightened, slide it to create a bigger or smaller loop if necessary. Insert your crochet hook into the loop and pull the yarn to a comfortable tightness. [4] X Research source This is called a slipknot and is the basis for starting most crochet projects."

[5] X Research source The knot should remain below the hook, with the rest of the yarn in front of the hook. In a crochet pattern yarn over is often abbreviated to YO. DIY Specialist and Maker Sarah Stearns recommends holding the yarn tight enough to keep its tension but loose enough to let it slide through your fingers while you crochet."

This makes your first chain stitch . [6] X Research source Make the loop larger by gently pulling it with the hook. Make it smaller by tugging the long end of the yarn in the opposite direction. Crochet patterns often abbreviate chain as ch ."

      "content": "Repeat as many chain stitches as you need for the pattern. Continue yarning over and pulling it through the loop. Count each stitch until you have as many chains as you need for your project. If you follow a crochet pattern, the first line usually tells you the number of chain stitches you need. If you forgot to keep count as you went, lay the chain flat. You’ll see a series of V shapes. Each V is a single chain stitch. Count them to see how many stitches you made."

      "content": "Tie off your chain to finish it. If you just want a crocheted chain, such as when you're making a bracelet, tie off your chain when it reaches the desired length. Simply clip the yarn at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your last stitch, catch the last remaining end with the hook, and pull it all the way through the loop. Give it a good tug to secure the end."

      "title": "Change direction to start a new row.",
      "content": "Change direction to start a new row. Each time you reach the end of a row, you must flip your crochet piece to start the next row. Flip your chain so you can work in the opposite direction. Before you start this new row, make a couple of extra chains (the number varies depending on the type of stitches in the new row). Chain these extra stitches, and then work your next row in the last chain stitch before the extras. As you make your way down the new row, work your stitches into the loops of the chain you made. Whether you work into the back hump or top loops of the chain depends on your project, so you'll have to follow your pattern . You’ll most commonly single crochet (abbreviated to sc) or double crochet (abbreviated to dc). Stearns advises that it’s best for beginners to start with small projects that are worked in flat rows."

      "content": "Make a circle or loop to crochet in the round. After making your initial chain (usually 4 stitches), join the ends using a slip stitch (abbreviated to sl st). With the last loop of your chain on your hook, make a slip stitch by pushing the head of the hook into the very first stitch on your chain, making two \"loops\" on the hook. Grab the yarn with your hook, just as if you were chaining normally, and pull it through both loops. This will leave you with one loop on the hook, and you'll be ready to start your next \"row.\" This forms the beginning of your circle. Work your stitches into the center of the loop to crochet a circle ."
