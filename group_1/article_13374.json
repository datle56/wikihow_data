[2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see whether there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire, if possible. However, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or coat underneath their back and dragging it."

If he or she responds agreement \"Yeah\" or such, CPR is not required. Instead, undertake basic first aid and take measures to prevent or treat shock [1] X Research source , and assess whether you need to contact emergency services. If the victim does not respond, rub their sternum or pinch their earlobe to see if they respond. If they still don’t react, check for a pulse on their neck or under their thumb on the wrist."
