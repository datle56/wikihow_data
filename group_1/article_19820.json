Apply enough pressure that the scratch comes off the sink, but not so much that you end up damaging the sink by rubbing the grit in too deep. A powdered scratch remover should be mixed with water first. Mix 2 tablespoons of the powder with 4 or 5 drops of water, then rub it on the scratch with a damp microfiber cloth."
