[7] X Research source Carefully apply the wax strip over your eye and leave it for at least 30 seconds to let it set. Pull outwards firmly to remove the hairs and repeat on the other eye. Apply warm water to remove any left over wax, then apply cold water and moisturiser to soothe the skin."

[8] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hold the string up to your eyebrow, as you make one circle larger and the other smaller, that middle part that is wound will grab hairs that is passes and remove them. Be very careful and practice slowly to get the hang of it. It's easy to slide the thread quickly and tear out a lot of hair, and do so in the wrong direction. Use the thread to keep \"brushing\" the brow while you work, just swiping in an up-and-out direction. Use a moisturizing face wash afterwards to care for your skin."

Keep your eyebrows 1-2 shades lighter than your hair if you have dark hair such as black or brown, and 1-2 shades darker for blonde/ or light hair.

Use a pigmented white cream and a spoolie to neutralize your darker hair color. It may take a few coats. Powder with transparent or translucent powder, and then apply your new color."

Don't go out of your eyebrow shape, you are just trying to darken it so work on darkening from the thickest part to the thinnest. Definitely work in the color at thinner spots, but not too much.
