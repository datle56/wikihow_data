      "content": "Use the bus’s WiFi or bring your own if needed. Some buses provide WiFi, so if you need an internet connection, check ahead of time to see if your bus has that option. If it is not provided, you can purchase a wireless broadband router or a hotspot unit. If your phone has this option, you could also enable a hotspot using your phone. [1] X Research source Hotspot units access a cellular network and are generally small enough to fit in a pocket. [2] X Research source"

    {
      "title": "Listen to music, podcasts or audiobooks.",
      "content": "Listen to music, podcasts or audiobooks. Bring some headphones and an electronic device such as your phone, laptop, or tablet with some listening material. This is a great option if you get carsick from reading on the bus."

    {
      "title": "Bring chargers for all of your electronic devices.",
      "content": "Bring chargers for all of your electronic devices. Using your devices to keep you occupied on the trip will use up quite a bit of battery life, so be sure bring chargers for any electronic devices you bring, such as your laptop, phone, tablet, Kindle, or gaming devices."

      "title": "Wear comfortable, layered clothing.",
      "content": "Wear comfortable, layered clothing. When dressing for a long trip, make comfort your number one priority. Dress in soft, loose clothing that will let you stretch and move around easily. Layers will help keep comfortable in any temperature—from hot sun through the window to cold air conditioning inside the bus."

    {
      "title": "Stretch once in a while to relieve tension and stiffness.",
      "content": "Stretch once in a while to relieve tension and stiffness. You can either get up and walk around to stretch your legs, or stretch every hour or so while sitting. This will help you stay comfortable during the trip and stimulate blood flow. When sitting, stretch your hamstrings by straightening one leg out in front of you while sitting up straight and arching your back. Hold this pose for thirty seconds, then switch legs. Repeat three times for each leg."

      "title": "Get some sleep.",
      "content": "Get some sleep. It can be difficult to fall asleep on a jostling bus, but to help yourself fall asleep more easily, bring some earplugs or headphones as well as an eye mask to block out sound and light. This will help you create the illusion of a quiet, dark environment. You should also bring a travel pillow to support your neck and keep you comfortable as you sleep. [3] X Research source If you have difficulty sleeping while traveling, try sleeping aids like lavender essential oil, melatonin, or drowsy-inducing medication. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Bring your own water and snacks.",
      "content": "Bring your own water and snacks. Since the bus driver will probably only stop at gas stores and convenience stations at scheduled points along the trip, make sure to bring your own water bottle and snacks. When packing, look for snacks that will keep your energy up and won’t make a mess. Fresh fruit, string cheese, and individually wrapped sandwiches are great options, as they’re filling and energizing. Kettle chips will also satisfy any salt cravings and still keep your fingers clean. Avoid bringing nuts in case anyone around you has a nut allergy. You should also avoid anything perishable, like mayonnaise or milk, as well as messy snacks, like Cheetos or anything powder-coated. Bringing your own snacks is especially important for those with specific diets, such as vegans and vegetarians, or dietary restrictions, such as intolerances to gluten or dairy."

      "title": "Get to know fellow passengers.",
      "content": "Get to know fellow passengers. Talk to the people around you to pass the time. If you’re traveling with family and friends, talk about what you’re excited about for this trip or tell stories. If you’re traveling alone, try talking to the people around you. Ask them about their trip, where they’re from, or if they’ve traveled through this area before. If you'd prefer not to have an extended conversation, stick to small talk. If you're interested in a more in-depth conversation, keep asking them questions as long as they seem engaged."

      "title": "People-watch on the bus.",
      "content": "People-watch on the bus. Bus travel can be a great way to people-watch and just observe the travelers around you. A bus can hold such a large cross-section of the population, letting you observe people from all walks of life. Observe interactions between those around you without being obvious or intrusive."

    {
      "title": "Look out the window and enjoy the scenery.",
      "content": "Look out the window and enjoy the scenery. One of the best parts about traveling by bus is getting to watch the scenery. Try to claim a window seat so you’ll be able to easily watch through the window during the trip. If the route is particularly scenic, ask ahead of time which side of the bus will give you the best views. To capture the scenery and enjoy it later as well, take some pictures of particularly beautiful areas. Having a window seat will make this much easier as well."

    {
      "title": "Think and reflect.",
      "content": "Think and reflect. Reflection can be a relaxing and affirming practice, and getting lost in your thoughts can help pass the time. Take this time to let your mind wander and think about your past experiences, who you are as a person, and the trip ahead of you. To fully immerse yourself in your thoughts, be still and block out the noise around you as much as possible. Headphones—particularly noise-cancelling headphones—are perfect for this."
