      "content": "Brush out your dry hair thoroughly. You don’t need to dampen your hair for this super simple technique, but it's fine to spray a little detangler on your hair if it's difficult to brush out or knots up easily. Run a comb or paddle brush from root to tip until your wavy hair is smooth and tangle-free. [1] X Research source Using detangler is okay, but your hair needs to be clean and otherwise product-free. This technique works for chin-length or longer hairstyles. If you're cutting wavy hair into a short or pixie style for the first time, you may want to have a stylist do the initial cut. Then, you can try keeping up with maintenance trims at home!"

      "content": "Part your hair down the middle with a comb. Place the tip of a comb at the center of your front hairline. Drag the comb to the nape of your neck to create the center part. Brush or comb down the hair on each side of the part so that you have 2 smooth, even sections of hair. [2] X Research source It's best to part your hair down the center when you're doing a simple, one-length trim, even if you normally style your hair in a side part. This helps prevent uneven sides."

      "title": "Grab a section of hair and braid or twist it.",
      "content": "Grab a section of hair and braid or twist it. Separate a 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) section of hair with your fingers, starting on 1 side of your head. Braid or twist the section of hair almost all the way to the end until you get to where you want to take off length. [3] X Research source A good trim usually takes off 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 inch (0.64–1.27 cm) of lengths. The smaller and tighter you make the braids or twists, the more precise your trim will be."

      "content": "Braid and twist the remaining sections of hair the same way. Continue the same process for the remaining sections of hair, working systematically to the other side. Be sure to wrap the elastic at the same length for each braid or twist. If you need to, use the previous braid as a point of comparison. [5] X Research source Be consistent and do all braid or all twists."

      "content": "Cut straight across the end of each braid or twist beneath the elastic. Pick up the first braid or twist and make a straight snip across the bottom, directly below the hair elastic. Start on 1 side of your head and work systematically to the other side so you don't accidentally skip or miss any braids. [6] X Research source Don't use regular scissors or kitchen shears for this! It's best to use stylist shears, which you can pick up at most drug and big-box stores. [7] X Research source Also, avoid using thinning shears or razors on your hair—these tends to make wavy hair frizzy.

Then, run a paddle brush or wide-tooth comb through all of your hair from root to tip to get rid of any knots or tangles. [10] X Research source Try applying a detangling spray if your wavy hair is thick or tends to tangle a lot. This technique works best for medium and long hair. The process is similar if you want to cut a layered bob, but there are a few key differences ."

      "content": "Run the tip of a comb from forehead to nape to create a middle part. Identify the center of your front hairline and position the tip of a comb against your scalp. Pull the comb through the crown and all the way down to the nape of your neck. Comb the sectioned hair down on each side to smooth the hair and complete your center part. [11] X Research source Be sure to smooth the hair down on both sides so your layers will be even. Parting your hair in the center before cutting layers offers the most styling flexibility. However, if you always style your hair the same way, you can comb your hair into your usual side part before cutting layers. [12] X Research source"

Run the comb through the hair to the top of your right ear to section off the back part. Comb this section straight out in the back. [13] X Research source At this point, you should have 3 sections: a top left section, top right section, and back section.

Twist the top section and clip it out of the way with a plastic hair clip. [14] X Research source You don’t have to do this if your hair is thin, but it's generally a good idea so you aren’t working with too much hair at a time."

[15] X Research source The exact amount of length you cut off is up to you, but a good trim usually takes about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off. Err on the side of caution if you aren’t sure!
