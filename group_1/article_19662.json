If you find a tick crawling around your house or remove one from yourself, your kids, or your pet, pick it up with a pair of tweezers and drop it into a container filled with rubbing alcohol.

      "content": "Wash your clothes and bedding in hot water. Unfortunately, ticks like to burrow in your bed just as much as you do, and they can also hitch a ride on your clothes. If you see a tick on your bedding or clothes, wash them with hot water to kill the ticks. Be sure to wash all parts of your bedding if you see a tick there, including your mattress cover, sheets, comforter, and pillowcases. [7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source If you notice ticks on your clothing after coming inside from the outdoors, throw them into the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes. The dry heat will kill the ticks. However, if your clothes are wet, throw them in the washer with hot water first before drying. If you suspect any clothes or linens might have ticks, do not put them in the laundry hamper, because this will contaminate the other clothes. Put them straight into the washing machine or dryer."

The most common places where you’ll find ticks on your pet include around their tail, between their toes, between their back legs, in and around their ears, underneath their collar, under their front legs, and around their eyelids."

Mix 4 oz (118 ml) of purified or distilled water with 20 drops of eucalyptus essential oil in a spray bottle, then spray it on your exposed skin, clothes, or around your house. Other essential oils such as citronella, tea tree, peppermint, almond, jojoba, and neem oil repel ticks as well. Place 1 or 2 drops of neem oil on a tick that’s attached to a person or animal to get it to detach. A study also found that balsam fir essential oil was effective in killing ticks quickly.

Sweep and mop your floors, dust your shelves, and seal any cracks or crevices in your walls or floors where ticks can lay eggs. [13] X Research source Ticks prefer to be in spots where it’s warm and dry, so pay close attention to spots that may be creating this kind of environment, such as near your heater in the winter.
