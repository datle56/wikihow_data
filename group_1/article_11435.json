If you plan to cut and paste text from elsewhere into an email, make sure to open up a draft into which you can paste the text. If you are cutting and pasting within a single email to rearrange the wording, make sure that you open that email. When you cut text, you don't need to worry about pasting it immediately. Your computer automatically saves the most recent thing that you cut or copied to a temporary \"clipboard\". You will still be able to paste that swatch of text until you restart your computer or cut/copy something else. If you have Microsoft Word open when you cut and copy, your clipboard can hold multiple swatches of text at once."

      "content": "Decide where you want to paste the text. Before you cut or paste anything, examine both the words you want to cut and the space where you want to paste them. Read the email for flow, and ask yourself where this text will best fit. If you are pasting the text of another email into a text-heavy message, for instance, you probably don't want to drop it at the top of the email with no introduction, and you probably don't want to leave it in the middle of a sentence. Think about where this new text will be most effective, and consider which words/tenses you will need to edit in order to make the pasted words flow well within the existing document.

To highlight text: left-click at the beginning of the section of text that you want to select, then hold and drag the cursor to the end of the section. Dragging the cursor should highlight the text with a blue background. Release the cursor when you have highlighted all of the text that you want to select.

To activate the shortcut, press the Control key (labeled Ctrl and the X key at the same time. The highlighted words will disappear. [2] X Research source There are two Ctrl buttons on the bottom row of the keyboard – look for each button several spots to the right and left of the space bar. Similarly, there are two [command] buttons directly flanking the space bar on an Apple keyboard. If you are using a smartphone, hold your fingertip against the words you want to highlight. Once you've selected those words, you should be able to cut, copy, and paste them."

If you want to leave a section of text where it is, but you still want to save it to the clipboard for pasting, use Ctrl + C to copy the text. Bear in mind that you can almost always copy text, but you can only cut text if you are working within a text editor: any box or application in which you can write and delete words. For instance, you cannot cut text from a read-only document or webpage. Keep the copy function in mind for when you cannot cut. [3] X Research source"

If you're working within a text editor, this method will cut and paste the text; if you're dragging something from a read-only document or webpage into an email editor, then this method will only copy and paste the text. First, highlight the text that you want to move. Then left-click on the highlighted portion, hold the button down (in the same motion as the left-click), and drag the highlighted text across the page to where you want it.

You should not be able to select the Paste option yet unless you already have something saved to your clipboard. You can only paste the most recent phrase that you have cut or copied. If you have more than one thing to do, either lump the text together and cut/paste it all at once, or cut and paste the text-patches one at a time."

When you are working in a text editor—whether it's Word or your email editor—you will see a blinking vertical line amid the text on the page.

Pasting text works on the same principle: when you paste something into a text editor, the pasted content will appear where the vertical line is blinking. This is especially important if you are using keyboard shortcuts. If you are right-clicking and selecting \"Paste\", however, you can simply right-click where you want the text.
