      "content": "Fill in your base colors. Use the fill tool to fill in your base colors into your entire drawing. You'll want to zoom in in order to catch all of the little gaps that can be created. The fill tool looks like a paint bucket being poured out."

      "title": "Make your fill shading lines.",
      "content": "Make your fill shading lines. Use the pencil tool to draw a line that makes up the edge of your shading area. It's okay if it overlaps your black edges a little bit. This is easy to go over and fix later. The color that you use to draw your line should be the same color that you will use to create the shadows and highlights."

      "title": "Work in a good file size.",
      "content": "Work in a good file size. Since MS Paint works with very basic pixels, if you want to make your drawing really nice you'll need to increase the canvas size. Do this by clicking the resize button and set the dimensions somewhere above 2000 pixels."

      "title": "Sketch your picture and upload it to your computer.",
      "content": "Sketch your picture and upload it to your computer. This process will be much faster if you do a real-life sketch and scan it or photograph it in order to get it on your computer. You can also sketch the picture in MS Paint, but you will need to sketch it in very light gray. If you do scan your drawing, just open the file in MS Paint in order to start turning it into a beautiful drawing, but be sure you have the original sketch saved separately somewhere else too (in case you make mistakes and need to start over)."

    {
      "title": "Create your main lines.",
      "content": "Create your main lines. Using the curve tool, create the main lines of your drawing in black. Find a single continuous line (like the upper arch of the eye) and click on the beginning and then then end of the line. Then, use your mouse to grab the straight line that was created and pull it into the curve to match your sketch. Do this until all your drawing is recreated in black. The black is important. You can always change the color of these outline lines later, but for now do them in black."

Then switch the color to strict black and white by clicking File â†’ Properties. Click OK, let it make the switch, and then switch it back into color the same way. Invert the picture again and you'll have clean art. Saving a copy of just your plain black lines can be really helpful, especially if you make a mistake and need to restore them."

      "content": "Add highlights, shadows, and midtones. Now for the fun part. Select all and copy your drawing as it is now. Then, choose an area that you want to shade (say, the hair). Select that base color and set it to color 2. Then, make color 1 your shading color. Use any of the tools to do the shading however you like. Don't worry about going over your black lines! Just do one area (with the same base color) at a time."

Then click transparent selection. Ta-da!"

      "content": "Work with the limitations of the program. What you have to keep in mind is that MS Paint is not Photoshop. Don't expect to be able to get a Photoshop look with your drawings. You can make nice pictures but they have a very particular look to them. Embrace it. You should also keep in mind that the files save with poorer quality than programs like Photoshop, so don't expect them to print well at high resolutions."

MS Paint isn't Photoshop, but some basic tweaks can be achieved using the program. You can do things like: Crop images . Cropping in MS paint can actually be easier than in some other programs, since all you have to do is drag around the corners of the image. Cover small problems. Copying and pasting small selections that can band-aid small problems with an image is pretty easy with MS Paint, as long as you're patient. Correct red eye. If you have some dark pixels you can copy and paste or if you feel like you can use the freehand tools, then fixing red eye is very doable in a program like MS Paint."

Be sure to check out these alternatives to help you on your road to digital art mastery: One program that you might find useful is a free program called Oekaki. This is similar in look to MS Paint but has many more features. You don't even have to download anything. Many websites have Oekaki as an app within a web browser. This program allows some actual layers, much like Photoshop, which means you can make much nicer pictures. If you want to use a program that is more powerful but you don't want to spend the money on Photoshop, know that there are alternatives. Paint Tool Sai, Manga Studio, and many other programs which are similar to Photoshop can be purchased for $20-50."
