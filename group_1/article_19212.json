      "content": "Pick clothes you think look cool. In Roblox, there are many items of clothing to choose from the catalog. Some items depend on gender, personalities, interests, age, etc. Find something that suits your personality, as long as it's not inappropriate or racially/sexually offensive. Gear is available and can be found in the catalog also. Some items cost Robux, while some are free. If you want to look cool yet don't want to buy Robux for items, feel free to mix and match the free items you have, and make all sorts of outfits with them!"

      "content": "Earn rewards and items by playing games. Roblox provides a lot of items you can earn, and it's always good to have a few of these items! You can earn certain awards on several games, such as story games and lobbies; you can also get plenty of items from different games, such as Adopt Me and Work at a Pizza Place."

      "title": "This allows you to access more features.",
      "content": "This allows you to access more features. If you're interested in Roblox and would like to explore more, Builders' Club is recommended to purchase. For new purchasers, BC (Basic/normal builders club) or TBC (Turbo builders club/medium builders club) would be preferable. OBC, however, is geared more towards veterans, as a player may get bored of Roblox and would feel as if he wasted his money on OBC. BC is the cheapest, TBC is in the middle, and OBC is the most expensive one of the three. (BC/TBC/OBC cost real money). If you're interested in buying one of these, make sure you have your parents'/guardians' permission before you make a purchase. You can earn daily Robux with each club. (BC=15 daily, TBC=35 daily, OBC=60 daily)."
