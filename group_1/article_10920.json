[1] X Research source You can find these yarn ratings on the yarn wrapper. Most craft stores carry special types of yarn for knitting baby projects such as blankets and booties. Select the yarn type and color that will fit your vision for the booties and that will make the booties feel nice and soft as well."

      "title": "Check your gauge.",
      "content": "Check your gauge. Gauge refers to the number of stitches that is required to make a certain type of yarn reach a specific measurement. The gauge also relies on the needle size. Gauge is important to make sure that the garment you create will be the right size. [2] X Research source The combination of yarn and hook should yield a half double chain of 15 stitches that is about four inches (10 centimeters) long. If your gauge is off, adjust as needed with a lighter or heavier yarn or by changing the size of your hook."
