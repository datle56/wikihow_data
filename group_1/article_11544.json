      "content": "Assess why it didn't work before. There was a reason (or reasons) why you rejected them in the first place. It can be easy to ignore these issues if you haven't seen them for a while, or if you're just feeling lonely. But it is really important to acknowledge the concerns you had before, and determine if you can overcome them. Otherwise, you are likely to hurt them again. [2] X Research source Did you find them unattractive or annoying? If so, has this changed? Did they hurt you or lose your trust? If so, will you be able to get past it? Were you going through a rough time in your life when you rejected them? Have things changed? Were you simply incompatible? If so, do you think you'll be able to compromise and find balance?"

This can help you determine whether or not it's worth it to put yourself out there. Spend some time objectively evaluating how they act when you're around. You might also ask for the opinion of a close friend. [3] X Research source Negative signs include: changing their phone number, not responding to your texts, avoiding you. Positive signs include: lighting up when you come into the room, making time for you when you ask, standing close to you when you're out with friends."

If you previously rejected this person, you are approaching the situation at a bit of a disadvantage, as they may still have hurt feelings, and this can affect their attraction toward you. You can compensate for this by making some self-improvements! First, brainstorm some ways to make yourself more desirable.

[5] X Research source If you are trying to become a better listener, practice with your friends and family. You can also ask them for feedback to see if you've improved. If you are trying to look better, break this down into different parts. Make a plan to have your hair done. Ask a stylist friend to help you pick out some new clothes. Join a gym. If you'd like to be more in touch with your emotions, schedule some time each day to reflect on how you feel. Start a gratitude journal. Speak with a close friend, family member, or therapist. If you'd like to improve your living space, start by cleaning your space and clearing out clutter. Then move on to organizing your things and adding some decorative pieces."

If they respond within a few hours, and if their tone matches yours, it is probably a good idea to keep pursuing them. Try not to make it seem like you're looking for a booty call. You could say, \"It's been so long since we've hung out. I hope you're well.\" Opt for a text rather than a call, which can put more pressure on this person to give you an immediate answer.

I really miss spending time with you.\" Do not send another text until they have responded to your last one. Avoid sending more than a couple of texts per day. It is OK to take a day off between communications. Respond to any texts from them within 2 hours."

I was selfish and scared, and I'm sorry.\" You could follow up with, \"I have really tried to change and improve myself. I like to think I'm a better person this time around.\" Avoid rehashing every detail of the past. This should be a chance to start fresh."
