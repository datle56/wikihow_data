      "title": "Start your search for a yellow jacket nest after 10 am.",
      "content": "Start your search for a yellow jacket nest after 10 am. Yellow jackets are most active between 10 am and 4 pm. So it’s easier to find them flying between their food sources and nests at this time. If it’s very hot or very cold, keep in mind this timeframe might be shorter, as yellow jackets tend to be less active during extreme temperatures. [1] X Research source"

      "title": "Look for yellow jackets flying in a straight path.",
      "content": "Look for yellow jackets flying in a straight path. Regardless of where their nests are located, wasps will fly in a straight line from their nest to their food sources, says Downs. [2] X Expert Source Steve Downs Live Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 22 February 2021. Stand still near where you’ve seen the yellow jackets, and look across the part of that area in full sun. Look for any insects flying quickly by in a straight line – they should stand out in the direct sun. Keep looking if you see one – if you see more, you’re probably seeing them come and go from their nest, and you can track the nest that way."

      "title": "Lure the yellow jackets with sugary food or beverages.",
      "content": "Lure the yellow jackets with sugary food or beverages. If you can’t spot any yellow jackets flying, try luring them with food. They love sugary foods like fruits or soda. [3] X Research source Place the food in a shallow dish near where you think nests might be, and then watch the food trap. Yellow jackets should eventually show up near the food. Once they do, follow their path back to their nests. Protein-based baits, including tuna-flavored canned cat food, chicken skin, cold cuts, and ground meat also work. In the summer, sugar baits might work better. Try fruit juice, grenadine, ice cream, or a bit of fruit jelly."

      "title": "Search for holes in the ground of your property.",
      "content": "Search for holes in the ground of your property. Yellow jackets build nests partially underground, usually in old gopher holes. [4] X Research source They can also build nests in wood piles and dense vegetation. “You can cautiously look around the lawn area and hillsides on the property from a distance. Often, yellow jackets will nest in the ground, in dry soil areas and ivy,” says Downs. [5] X Expert Source Steve Downs Live Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 22 February 2021. If you see yellow jackets flying near such areas or a large number of yellow jackets crawling around protecting a certain area, you’ve probably found a nest."

      "title": "Yellow jackets build underground or hanging nests.",
      "content": "Yellow jackets build underground or hanging nests. Ground yellow jackets usually build their underground nests in animal burrows. Aerial yellow jackets prefer to build the familiar papier-mâché-style nests that hang from trees or other tall structures. [6] X Research source The only hint that a hole on your property houses a yellow jacket nest is yellow jackets coming and going or staying near the opening. An aerial nest is a greyish color with a rounded shape similar to a football. It looks like it’s wrapped in a paper-like covering called an envelope. [7] X Research source Downs says, “A wasp nest is much smaller than a beehive. They are usually attached to overhang structures and are approximately a few inches to a foot round in size.” [8] X Expert Source Steve Downs Live Bee Removal Specialist Expert Interview. 22 February 2021. As you track yellow jackets to their nests, watch for both aerial and ground nests."

      "title": "Treat nests at night to avoid getting stung.",
      "content": "Treat nests at night to avoid getting stung. Most worker yellow jackets return to the nest at sunset, so treating the nest after that should kill the most yellow jackets. Yellow jackets are also less active at night, making them less likely to sting. Plan to treat the nest about 45 minutes after sunset. If you have to treat during the day, remember that you may have to treat the nest multiple times. [9] X Research source"

      "title": "Use insecticide dust on ground nests.",
      "content": "Use insecticide dust on ground nests. A spray won’t completely saturate a partially underground nest. Use a dust insecticide to get rid of ground nests . The yellow jackets track the insecticide deep inside the nest to kill the most wasps. Sprinkle an insecticide dust labeled for use on wasps at the entrance to kill any yellow jackets that try to leave or return to the nest. [10] X Research source After you’ve treated the nest, you can leave insecticide dust at the nest's entrance. That should kill any returning yellow jackets that weren’t already in the nest."

      "title": "Use a quick freeze wasp spray on aerial nests.",
      "content": "Use a quick freeze wasp spray on aerial nests. Aerial yellow jacket nests are the easiest to spot – they usually hang from the eaves of houses or garages, trees, or electric poles. Standing as far away as possible, point the quick freeze spray at the nest and saturate the nest with spray. Make sure to get the nest opening as well. The nest should be completely coated. [11] X Research source You can find these quick freeze sprays that kill yellow jackets in most home improvement stores or in your grocery store's \"home\" section. Most quick freeze sprays work 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) away, so you shouldn’t need a ladder unless you’ve found a nest that’s very, very high up."

[14] X Research source While it’s impossible to completely prevent yellow jackets from building a nest in your home or yard, there are several things you can do to make your property seem like less of a good place to settle. [15] X Research source Seal cracks around your home to prevent wasps from building a nest. Keep garbage cans clean and tightly closed to avoid drawing the attention of yellow jackets. When you eat outside, don’t leave food sitting out, and clean up spills right away. Plant fruit trees and crops away from the house or other structures. Pick up fallen fruit and vegetables right away. Use natural deterrents like peppermint, clove, glove geranium, and lemongrass oils.

      "content": "Remain calm and walk away slowly with your hands covering your face. If you disturb a yellow jacket nest, they may swarm you. If that happens, try to remain as calm as possible – if you run or flail, it can increase the yellow jackets' aggressiveness. As calmly as possible, walk away from the place where you were swarmed, and get inside somewhere if you can. [17] X Trustworthy Source US National Park Service Agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments Go to source If you aren’t near a building or car you can get into, walk toward dense vegetation. Swift movements attract more yellow jackets, so don’t wave or flail your arms."
