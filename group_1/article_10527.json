Skip this step if you're going to make the pivot table using an external source of data. Make sure your data is formatted correctly. To create a pivot table, you'll need a dataset that is organized in columns. It should have a single header row. Optionally, formatting your original data as a table using Insert > Table will help make sure the formatting is correct."
