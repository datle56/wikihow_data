      "content": "\"Diaper butt\" is a rude description of someone whose bottom looks saggy. A person with a diaper butt (also known as a diaper booty) looks like they're wearing a full diaper underneath their pants, shorts, or leggings. They may actually be wearing an adult-sized diaper, or their saggy bottom could be caused by other reasons, like oversized clothing. It isn't polite to say about or directly to someone unless you're a close, well-meaning friend or family member. Even then, you'll want to take them aside and let them know in private so they're not embarrassed in front of other people."

      "content": "Botched BBL A Brazilian butt lift (BBL) is a common cosmetic surgery where the surgeon takes fat from other parts of the body and injects it into the buttocks to make them look bigger and rounder. [1] X Research source A BBL can look great to start, but if the person who got it gains or loses weight, the fat deposits can shift or sink and make that signature \"diaper butt\" effect. A bad or unlicensed surgeon can also do a poor job of choosing where to inject the fat and cause it to look more misshapen than before. In addition to fat deposits, some surgeons also put silicone-filled implants into the buttocks to change their shape and size even more dramatically. This is called a buttocks augmentation and sometimes goes hand-in-hand with a BBL. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Adult diaper You or someone you know may look like you have a diaper butt if you wear adult diapers. Adults of all ages wear diapers for real medical reasons, such as incontinence (which is when you have trouble holding in your pee long enough to make it to the toilet) and diarrhea. Women who have just given birth to a baby also wear diapers while they heal from the delivery."

      "title": "Saggy, oversized bottoms",
      "content": "Saggy, oversized bottoms If you wear bigger pants, shorts, or leggings, the extra fabric can pool around your buttocks. Sometimes, this makes your bottom look like it’s full of something (the way a diaper might when it’s full), which some people refer to as \"diaper booty.\" However, not all oversized clothing gives you this look, and even if it does, it's perfectly okay to love it anyway!"

      "content": "Ensure your plastic surgeon is properly licensed to give BBLs. To save money, some people go to a foreign country or hire someone off the black market to do their BBL for cheaper than a real plastic surgeon. In some of these cases, women have been injected with liquid silicone, concrete, and even motor oil! [3] X Research source Not only are these substances never supposed to enter the human body, but they're also sure to cause a sinking, saggy-looking diaper butt – not to mention health complications and even death!"

      "content": "Avoid getting a BBL and try living a healthier lifestyle instead. There are other ways to make your buttocks bigger and rounder , including exercising your glutes and eating a more balanced diet. You can also wear leggings or pants with pads inside the buttocks area. Finally, remember that enlarged and perfectly round, symmetrical buttocks are unrealistic body standards. Instead of spending thousands of dollars on unnecessary surgery, embrace your body and work on improving it in natural, healthy ways."

      "content": "Wear disposable underwear instead of a diaper. Disposable underwear fits your body like regular cloth underwear and won't sag (as long as you get the right size). Change it every time you \"use\" it to prevent the waste from weighing it down and giving you an obvious diaper booty."

      "content": "Shop for bottoms in your size or alter them to fit better. First, take clothing measurements for your waist, hips, in-seam, and leg length to find your ideal size in bottoms. Then, when you're shopping for bottoms and find a pair you like, try them on before you buy them. Notice if there's any extra fabric bunching or sagging around your buttocks. If so, go down a size. Alternatively, if they fit everywhere else (i.e., your legs and waist), alter them or hire a tailor to do it for you. If you plan on ordering bottoms online, keep the tags on them when they arrive and save the invoice so you can return them if they don't fit."

      "content": "Talk to a plastic surgeon about reversing your BBL. Sometimes, a BBL can be reversed (at least partially) by taking out some of the excess fat the surgeon put in to do your BBL in the first place. For this to happen, the fat has to have been injected above the muscle layer. Any fat that was injected into your glutes can't be removed. If fat removal (called liposuction) won't work, your doctor may recommend a different procedure that will give you the look you want. [4] X Research source Your doctor may also want to combine or replace liposuction with a butt lift or get rid of excess skin to prevent your buttocks from looking even saggier afterward."

      "content": "You generally shouldn't tell someone they have diaper butt, with rare exceptions. One exception might be if you're their close friend or family member and you can be honest with them. Even if you have a good personal relationship with them, though, think carefully about how they might react before letting them know. It's possible they already know they have diaper butt, in which case you would only make them feel worse by bringing it up. If you suspect your friend or family member doesn't know what they look like from behind, pull them aside in private and kindly tell them about their wardrobe faux pas. You may also want to avoid the term \"diaper butt\" or \"diaper booty\" and use kinder language, like, \"Your bottom looks like it's full of something.\" If you're a stranger, an acquaintance, their co-worker, or their boss, avoid mentioning their diaper butt at all or you might cause them a lot of embarrassment. Just be polite and don't look at it!"
