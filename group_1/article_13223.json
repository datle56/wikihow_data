      "title": "Take your grill apart for easier disposal.",
      "content": "Take your grill apart for easier disposal. Start by removing the top of your grill. Use a screwdriver to loosen any hinges connecting the top or any doors. Continue to take off anything else removable, such as wheels, racks, knobs, and handles. With less bulk, you won’t have to schedule any special pick-ups. [5] X Research source Before dismantling your grill, clean up any leftover food residue, charcoal, ash, or wood pellets. Throw away this debris with regular trash far from anything that may ignite. Be sure to wrap charcoal briquettes in foil and a metal container to prevent any additives from seeping out. For gas-powered grills, cut off the fuel supply before doing anything. Check for gas leaks and keep a fire extinguisher ready, just in case. Separate the components by what they’re made out of, such as metal, plastic, and any other materials."

      "title": "Scrap the metal parts of your grill.",
      "content": "Scrap the metal parts of your grill. Grills are often made with aluminum, stainless steel, and brass that can still be useful even if you no longer have a need for it. Contact a local scrap dealer to see if they can take the metal from your grill. You can also make some extra cash if they pay for successful trades. [6] X Research source The parts of your grill that are fully metal, such as lids, racks, and bodies, are more likely to be accepted. Parts that are a mixture of metal and plastic, like knobs or handles, may need to be tossed directly in the trash. If you have a small portable grill made of mostly metal, such as a tabletop charcoal grill, the scrap yard may take the entire thing."

Residual fuel or fumes inside make it highly flammable, meaning extra steps may need to be taken to get rid of it. [7] X Research source To dispose of your tank, contact the manufacturer and see if they take trade-ins. Propane dealers near you may also take your tank, as will some Home Depot and Ace Hardware locations. Call your local hazardous waste collection site to see if they can also help you dispose of your propane tank ."

      "content": "Recycle plastic parts of your grill. If your grill has plastic parts, check them for a recycling symbol. This may include doors or handles, depending on your grill. Then, drop off acceptable pieces at your recycling center. [8] X Research source Even with a recycling symbol, your local program may not take your parts. Look online or call directly to be sure what the center will and will not take."

[11] X Research source If you schedule a bulk item pick-up, the workers will know what to expect and bring any necessary equipment to haul your grill away. You can be fined for improperly disposing of your grill on the curb or in an alleyway."

      "content": "Some dumps may take grills, but not all. Grills can include a lot of components that make trashing it difficult. Taking your grill to a landfill may be a simple fix, but some will not take them due to their size, electronic parts, etc. [12] X Research source If you would like to take your grill to a local dump, call ahead to make sure you can. Some communities also have convenient drop-off locations for bulk items. You may need to place your grill in a dumpster for it to be accepted, so take a friend to make lifting easier. Both landfills and drop-off locations may charge a fee for taking your grill or other bulk items."
