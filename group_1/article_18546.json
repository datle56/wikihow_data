If the sun is in the southern half of the sky, you’re in the northern hemisphere. If the sun is in the northern part, you’re in the southern hemisphere. [1] X Research source Additionally, look at the plants and climate to see which part of the world you might be in. If you’re in the southern hemisphere with reddish soil and desert plants, you may be in Australia. [2] X Research source"

      "content": "Look at which side of the road that cars are driving on. Only 30% of countries in the world use left-hand traffic rules. [3] X Research source If the camera or the other cars are driving along the left side of the road, you can limit your guess to countries captured by Google Street View that use left-hand traffic rules. These countries include: [4] X Research source Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Botswana, Christmas Island, Eswatini, India, Indonesia, Japan, Jersey, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, Malta, South Africa, Uganda, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Ireland, Isle of Man, United Kingdom, Virgin Islands, and New Zealand."

      "content": "Use the compass to find the directions of landmarks. If you notice a mountain range, coastline, river, city skyline, or any other landmark that might appear on a map, turn towards it and take note of the direction. When plotting your guess, this allows you to find where you are based on the direction of other landmarks around you. For example, if you see an ocean south of you and a river to the east, look at the map and find a spot where the ocean is just south and the river is slightly east."

      "content": "Look at the type of Google Street View car and camera used. Most Google Street View vehicles are blurred out, but when you move your camera downwards you might see the vehicle’s color, shape, or shadow. [5] X Research source From this blur, you can narrow down the country you might be in. [6] X Research source For example, if the camera is mounted low with a large vehicle blur, you’re in India, Japan, Sri Lanka, or Switzerland. If the car is black with an antenna on the back, you’re probably in Russia, Donetsk, Israel, or Palestine. If the car is red, you’re in Ukraine, Belgium, or Russia. [7] X Research source Use this tool to identify the country you’re in by looking at the shape and color of the Google Street View car."

If the camera resolution is super low-quality, there’s a good chance you’re probably in Japan, Monaco, France, Italy, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, or Mexico. [8] X Research source Use this tool to identify the generation of camera used and what country you might be in."

      "content": "Eliminate the countries that aren’t available to guess. While you can find unofficial street view pictures in every country, some don’t have official coverage or rarely appear in Geoguessr. When choosing the country you’re in, try to avoid the countries that don’t have official coverage unless you’re playing a map that includes them. [9] X Research source Uncommon countries: Costa Rica, China, Cocos Islands, Lebanon, Qatar, Midway Atoll Rare countries: Antarctica, Vanuatu, British Indian Ocean Territory, Nepal, Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, Falkland Islands, Pitcairn Islands, Belarus Unavailable countries: Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, Myanmar, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Omen, Yemen, Syria, Moldova, Kosovo, Bosnia, Paraguay, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. In Africa, the only countries available are Botswana, Eswatini, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, and Uganda."

      "content": "Identify the language written on street signs. Knowing what alphabets look like in different countries can help you narrow down where you are just based on the writing on street signs and advertisements. [10] X Research source Use Geomastr’s alphabet tool to identify what language you see. This tool identifies key features that differ from similar languages. It also allows you to sort the languages by country and continent."

Most license plates are blurred out in the game, but you may see their general shape and colors, like yellow or white, that indicate the country. [11] X Research source Compare the sign you see to GeoHint’s list of street signs to narrow down the country you’re in. For example, Portugal uses an EU-style long plate with a yellow bar on the right-hand side. Canada, the United States, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Samoa, Virgin Islands, Guam, North Mariana Islands, Bolivia, Ecuador, Columbia, and Peru have taller plates than other countries.

Many extensions abbreviate the name of the country you’re in, which can give you a pretty good idea of where you are. [13] X Research source For example, Botswana is .bw, Kenya is .ke, Uganda is .ug, Italy is .it, and Canada is .ca. For a full list of the abbreviations, see GeoHint’s domain tool ."

Each country has its own bollard design with different materials and colors. Look at the bollards in GeoHint’s list to find which country you’re currently in. For example, Mongolia is the only country with white bowling-pin-shaped bollards with two red stripes along the top portion."

If you’re playing a game mode that allows you to move, go in the opposite direction that the car is traveling to find the highway or major road. [14] X Research source Similarly, if you’re on a hill or mountain, try to travel downhill to find nearby settlements and cities. If you aren’t moving, look for signs that tell you the direction of the nearest highway or major road. Then, guess a position along a road that branches off from that highway. [15] X Research source"

Look at the map and find a section where the angle of the road matches the angle of a section on the map. [16] X Research source Click on the gear in the lower right-hand corner and toggle the “Classic Compass” button off.

You might be getting subconscious clues that the rational side of your mind can’t quite place, which can help you beat the game faster than if you tried to gather evidence to support them.

Guesses below 25 m (82 ft) always count as a perfect score. The map you play also impacts the score—choosing the wrong location on a world map tends to cost you more than choosing the same distance away on a country’s map. The highest score you can get per round is 5,000 points. A perfect game of Geoguessr is 25,000 points. [28] X Research source"
