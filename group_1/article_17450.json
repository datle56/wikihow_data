      "title": "Stick electrical tape over the exposed wire and wrap it around once.",
      "content": "Stick electrical tape over the exposed wire and wrap it around once. Peel up the end from a roll of electrical tape and center it over the area of the cable with the exposed wire. Press it down on top of the exposed section and wrap it tightly around the damaged area. [1] X Research source This method works to repair minor damage in any type of electrical cable. Warning: Do not use duct tape or any other type of tape to cover exposed wire. Electrical tape is insulated and specially made for electrical applications. Electrical tape comes in different colors, so you can try to find a color that most closely matches the cable you want to repair if you care about the aesthetics. Keep in mind that the electrical tape can get worn out and torn over time, so you might have to replace it eventually with a fresh layer."

      "title": "Wrap the tape tightly around the wire 2-3 more times and cut it.",
      "content": "Wrap the tape tightly around the wire 2-3 more times and cut it. Continue to wrap the tape around the damaged area, directly on top of the first revolution you made. Loop the tape over itself so that each layer you add has no gaps. Cut the tape when you complete 2-3 more full wraps and press the end down. [2] X Research source Wrapping the tape more than once will help this quick fix last longer and help prevent further damage to the cable."

      "title": "Add additional layers of tape for added security, as needed.",
      "content": "Add additional layers of tape for added security, as needed. Stick the end of the electrical tape on the cable just to the side of the damaged area you already taped around, overlapping it slightly with the first section of tape. Wrap it around the cable 3-4 times, then cut or tear it. Repeat this for the other side of the first taped area. [3] X Research source Covering the undamaged areas of the cable to the side of the area with the exposed wire that you wrapped first will strengthen the cable and help prevent further damage to the area."

      "content": "Open a packet of Sugru and knead the putty for about 30 seconds. Rip open a pack of single-use Sugru and pull out the silicone rubber putty. Squish it back and forth between your fingers for about 30 seconds to warm it up and make it more moldable. [4] X Research source Sugru is a moldable, adhesive silicone rubber putty that hardens into a rubber-like outer jacket when it cures."

      "title": "Roll the putty out into a long, thin rectangular shape.",
      "content": "Roll the putty out into a long, thin rectangular shape. Place the putty on a flat surface and roll it back and forth with your fingers until it becomes long and thin. Press it down with your hand until it flattens into more of a rectangle so that you can wrap it around your cable. [6] X Research source"

      "title": "Wrap the Sugru putty around the damaged area and smooth it out.",
      "content": "Wrap the Sugru putty around the damaged area and smooth it out. Center the Sugru over the section of cable with the exposed wire and wrap it around the cable tightly. Press the edges of the putty together where they meet and firmly rub the Sugru with your fingertips to smooth out the seam and remove any fingerprints. [7] X Research source If the area you’re repairing is close to the wall adapter or power adapter end of the cable, make sure to press the Sugru right up against the power block or the charger plug to create a smooth-looking repair."

    {
      "title": "Leave the putty to cure for at least 24 hours.",
      "content": "Leave the putty to cure for at least 24 hours. Hang the cable up or lay it out on a flat surface somewhere out of the way. Leave it alone for a full 24 hours so the Sugru has time to cure completely. [8] X Research source The putty will turn into a strong, flexible protective casing around the exposed wire. The casing will help to prevent further damage to the area."

      "title": "Choose 2:1 ratio heat-shrink tubing for frayed wires.",
      "content": "Choose 2:1 ratio heat-shrink tubing for frayed wires. Heat-shrink tubing with a ratio of 2:1 means it will shrink to half its diameter when you heat it up. Heat-shrink tubing that is twice the diameter of your cable and has a 2:1 ratio will shrink to the exact same diameter as your cable to seal and repair the damaged area. [9] X Research source Heat-shrink tubing is a type of shrinkable plastic tubing that you can use to cover and insulate wires. You can use a hair dryer or heat gun to heat it up and shrink it. You can use this method to repair any type of electrical cable with exposed wires. Heat-shrink tubing can be used to repair long sections of exposed electrical wire as well. Note that heat-shrink tubing won’t work for cables that have ends that are larger than the cable itself, like chargers, because you won’t be able to get the tubing over the large ends. This method works best if the electrical cable has 1 end that is the same diameter as the cable itself."

      "title": "Cut the heat-shrink tubing to be slightly longer than your wire.",
      "content": "Cut the heat-shrink tubing to be slightly longer than your wire. Licensed electrician Marvin Woo explains that, “generally, the tubing should be just slightly larger in diameter than the wiring so that it can easily slip on and shrink tight enough when heated.” [10] X Expert Source Marvin Woo Licensed Electrician Expert Interview. 1 December 2021. Measure the damaged area and double the measurement just to give yourself plenty of material to work with. Cut the shrink wrap to size with scissors. [11] X Research source"

      "title": "Slide the heat-shrink tubing over the damaged spot and heat it.",
      "content": "Slide the heat-shrink tubing over the damaged spot and heat it. Woo instructs to “place the section of heat shrink over your wiring. Once in place, center yourself over the splice and apply heat using a heat gun to all sides of the tubing to evenly shrink it.” [12] X Expert Source Marvin Woo Licensed Electrician Expert Interview. 1 December 2021. If you don’t have a heat gun , you can probably use a hair dryer set to the highest heat setting."

      "title": "Continue heating the tubing until the shrink wrap is taut.",
      "content": "Continue heating the tubing until the shrink wrap is taut. Keep moving the heat gun or hair dryer back and forth along the tubing to shrink it. Once the shrink tubing is fully shrunk around the damaged area and there’s no give in the material, you’re good to go. Let the wire cool for a few minutes before you finish [13] X Research source This will stiffen the damaged area and protect the exposed wire to prevent further wear and tear. The tubing will start to shrink almost right away. Depending on how long the section of heat-shrink tubing you are heating up is, you will probably be able to shrink the whole piece in 30 seconds or less. Don’t ever use an open flame to shrink heat-shrink tubing because you can easily melt it and damage your cable even more."

      "content": "Wear protective gloves and eyewear to avoid dangerous shocks. Any exposed wire represents a potential health and fire risk, so do not mess with any wires without taking the proper precautions. Wear protective gloves with electrical insulation and throw on some safety goggles to prevent potential sparks from blinding you. [14] X Research source"

      "title": "Use a multimeter to determine if the wires are safe to touch.",
      "content": "Use a multimeter to determine if the wires are safe to touch. Plug the black probe into the COM port and the red probe into the voltage/resistance port. Set the multimeter to the highest AC voltage and touch the red probe to any positive exposed wire and the black probe to any neutral or ground. [15] X Research source If you get no reaction: The wire is not live and you can safely touch it. If the multimeter dial or reading moves: Your wire is live and you cannot safely touch the wire. Do not tempt fate. While the current is unlikely to be strong enough to harm you, it’s not worth risking your health by messing with a live wire."

      "title": "Flip the circuit breaker to shut off any live wires and re-test them.",
      "content": "Flip the circuit breaker to shut off any live wires and re-test them. If the wire is live (or could potentially become live), shut off the circuit for the wire at your fuse box. Locate the switch that corresponds specifically to the room or system where your wire is located and flip that circuit off. Re-test the wire when you’re done to confirm it’s off. Not sure which switch corresponds to your wire? No worries! You can simply shut the main power off using the master circuit breaker switch. That will shut off power for the entire home."

      "content": "Contact an electrician if you cannot confirm the wire is dead. If you don’t have a multimeter, you can’t seem to shut the current off, or anything about this process seems overwhelming to you, just contact an electrician. It isn’t worth risking your health to fix a bad wire, and an electrician will have no problem fixing the issue for you."

      "title": "No, frayed chargers are a serious fire risk.",
      "content": "No, frayed chargers are a serious fire risk. While phone and tablet chargers don’t put out a lot of voltage, a frayed charger can still overheat and spark an electrical fire. On top of that, a frayed charger is way more likely to overcharge a phone or tablet battery, which can also cause a fire. Do not put your life or home at risk by using a frayed charger—replace the cord immediately. [16] X Research source Why do charger wires fray so often? You just use charger cables a lot—that’s really it. The wear and tear eventually leads to fraying. Apple chargers, in particular are more likely to fray, too—they don’t use the standard strain relievers that prevent fraying you’d find on other products. [17] X Research source"
