      "content": "Remove the lid from the pot and leave the rice to rest for 10 minutes. This process allows the steam to dissipate and helps the rice to have an even texture. Remove the pot of cooked rice from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes or until it reaches your desired consistency. If there are flies in the kitchen, place a cotton tea towel over the pot to avoid any contamination. [1] X Research source This method works for all varieties of rice, including basmati, brown, jasmine, and short grain white rice. If you want to add flavor to rice, put a little chicken stock in the pan instead of only water while cooking. [2] X Research source Or saute garlic and onions and add the rice until the rice gets coated. Then add water. [3] X Research source Or add scallions, coconut milk, and fish sauce. You can even sweeten it with some palm sugar or brown sugar. [4] X Research source"

      "content": "Mix the rice gently with a carving fork for 1 minute. Use a carving fork to gently stir the rice and break up any obvious lumps. A carving fork is an effective stirring utensil as it easily breaks up the grains of rice without mashing them together. This process gives the rice a fluffy consistency. [5] X Research source Avoid using a spoon to mix the rice as this can make it mushy. Try not to stir the rice for longer than 1 minute as this can squish the grains."

      "content": "Enjoy the rice hot or keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days. Freshly cooked fluffy rice is delicious! Eat it with a curry, stir-fry, or your favourite sauce. If you have leftover rice, transfer it into an airtight container and place it into the fridge. [6] X Research source If you don’t have an airtight container, use a resealable bag instead. If you want to keep the rice for longer, place the airtight container in the freezer for up to 6 months."

      "title": "Leave the rice to rest for 10 minutes with the lid on.",
      "content": "Leave the rice to rest for 10 minutes with the lid on. This steams the rice and helps to ensure that the grains are fully cooked and have a fluffy consistency. Avoid the temptation to remove the lid as this lets the steam out of the cooker. This technique can be used for all types of rice, including brown, jasmine, basmati, and long grain rice."

      "title": "Stir the grains with a rice paddle for 1 minute.",
      "content": "Stir the grains with a rice paddle for 1 minute. Use the rice paddle to slowly mix the rice and break up any lumps. Rice paddles are designed to stir the grains without making them mushy — this helps to create light and fluffy rice. [7] X Research source Rice cookers have a non-stick coating that stops the rice from baking onto the bottom of the pot. Rice paddles are made from plastic, making them a good non-abrasive choice to use with the cooker. Most rice cookers come with a rice paddle. If you don’t have a paddle, purchase one from a speciality kitchen store. Alternatively, use a plastic fork or a plastic salad server. Avoid mixing the rice for over a minute as this can make it mushy."

If you want to use the rice at a later date, place the air-tight container in the freezer for up to 6 months. [8] X Research source If you are pregnant, avoid eating rice that isn’t freshly cooked."
