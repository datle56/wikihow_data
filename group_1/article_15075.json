      "title": "Spray paint your object and then let dry for 5 minutes.",
      "content": "Spray paint your object and then let dry for 5 minutes. You can use any type of spray paint. Coat your object in paint in the patterns or colors that you want. You can layer paint as well, depending on the design you want. [1] X Research source If you're spray-painting wood, you might need more than one coat."

    {
      "title": "Coat the object with wax-based furniture polish.",
      "content": "Coat the object with wax-based furniture polish. Letting the paint dry slightly will prevent the furniture polish from streaking your paint. Hold the can of furniture polish a few inches (7 or 8 cm) from the object. Spray the entire area that's been spray-painted with the polish. If you have areas that have multiple layers of paint, let the first layer of polish dry and then spray again. [2] X Research source You can use a wax-based furniture polish, as long as it's in spray form."
    },
    {
      "title": "Wipe off the excess furniture polish after you spray the object.",
      "content": "Wipe off the excess furniture polish after you spray the object. Use a soft, clean rag to gently wipe the area you sprayed with furniture polish. Be careful not to apply too much pressure. It won't take your spray paint off, but it might remove a lot of the polish and leave wet paint exposed. [3] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Test the object to make sure it's dry.",
      "content": "Test the object to make sure it's dry. Your object should be dry pretty much immediately after you coat it with furniture polish. Using the pad of your pinky finger, gently pat your object. If your finger comes away clean and dry, you're all set. If your finger doesn't come away dry, let it sit for about 5 minutes. You'll leave the furniture polish on the object permanently - it acts as a sealant. It shouldn't create a film on your object, but it might look matte, rather than shiny."
    },
    {
      "title": "Apply a thin coat of paint.",
      "content": "Apply a thin coat of paint. The less paint that's on the object you're painting, the more quickly it will dry. Use as thin a layer of paint as you can when you're painting. If you don't get enough coverage from one thin layer, let the first one dry and then apply a second."
    },
    {
      "title": "Run a heater near the object.",
      "content": "Run a heater near the object. The higher the temperature in the room where you're painting, the more quickly the paint will dry. You can turn up the heat in your house or use a small space heater. Set up the space heater so it's pointing at the object you spray painted. Running a heater won't necessarily reduce the dry time by a lot, but it should shave off a couple of hours (it normally takes spray paint about 24 hours to dry)."
    },
    {
      "title": "Decrease humidity.",
      "content": "Decrease humidity. If you're painting inside and it's humid outside, make sure the windows where your objects are drying are closed. You should also avoid letting spray-painted objects dry outside if it's humid. Bring them inside to a cool, dry room. You can run a dehumidifier in the room where your paint is drying."

    {
      "title": "Paint outside at the beginning of a warm, dry day.",
      "content": "Paint outside at the beginning of a warm, dry day. If you're doing a lot of painting and need to be outside, plan your day of painting carefully. Plan to paint on a warm, dry day, and begin first thing in the morning. That gives you the most time to take advantage of the weather to dry your paint more quickly. [4] X Research source"

      "title": "Circulate air by turning on a fan.",
      "content": "Circulate air by turning on a fan. Circulating the air where your paint is drying will increase the rate of evaporation for the water in the paint. Turn on ceiling or floor fans to a medium speed in the room where your paint is drying. Make sure the room is clean before you turn the fan on. If there's a lot of dust, dirt, or other debris in the room, the fan might kick it up and it can end up sticking in your paint."
