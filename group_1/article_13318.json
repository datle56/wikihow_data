You want alimony. A U.S. court might not be able to force someone outside the country to pay alimony. For that reason, you should have a lawyer represent you. Your spouse is contesting the divorce."

This means that you must have lived in the state for a certain amount of time before a court in that state will issue a divorce decree. You do not have to return to the state that married you in order to get divorced. Every state has its own residency requirements. For example, New Jersey requires that you be a resident of the state for 12 consecutive months before filing for divorce. If you have recently moved, it's possible that you don't yet satisfy the residency requirements in your state. In this situation, you may have to wait to file for divorce."

In this situation, you might need to serve a subpoena on the bank using the service of process you used to serve a copy of the petition.
