      "content": "Decide on a rep and set range. A rep range is how many times you will do each exercise and a set is one revolution of reps. [1] X Research source If you aren't experienced at lifting and exercising, start out with a low number of reps and sets. Fitness experts recommend starting a new exercise on a lower rep and set number: 1-5 reps and 1-2 sets. A medium rep range is considered to be 8-12 reps and a high rep range is considered to be 15+ reps. If you don't know where to start, start at a low rep and set number with a low weight (5-10 lbs). You will need to increase the number of reps and sets you do as you build muscle mass. As your muscles increase in size, they will need more exercise to get bigger. Before you increase reps, you will want to increase the amount of weight you are lifting. Low reps with higher weight tends to build muscle size and mass."

[2] X Research source Place a bench or table behind your back, perpendicular to your body. It should be at about knee height or just higher. Get into starting position. Hold onto the bench with your hands fully extended and shoulder width apart. Your legs should be extended forward and bent at the waist, perpendicular to your torso. Slowly lower your body as you inhale. Bend the elbows until you lower yourself to where there is 90 degrees between your upper arm and forearm. Keep your elbows inwards towards your body throughout the exercise. Use your triceps muscles to lift your torso back into starting position. This is one rep.

      "content": "Try body tricep presses. This exercise will target your triceps using your own body as weight. This movement resembles a pushup, but in an upright position using a bar. To start, position a bar in a rack at chest height. Get into starting position. Grasp the bar, hands shoulder width apart. Step a yard or two back from the bar with your feet together and legs extended. To begin the exercise, flex the elbow and lower yourself towards the bar. Keep your elbows oriented towards your body rather than angled outwards. Pause, then reverse the motion by extending the elbows. Once you find this kind of exercise easy, you can add muscle mass by using chains as added weight."

These should be side by side at roughly waist height. The bars are usually set at shoulder width distance. Hold your body at arms length with your elbows locked above the bars. Start the exercise by inhaling and lowering yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your upper body. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle between the upper arm and forearm. Use your upper arm muscles to lift yourself up to starting position. Repeat according to your rep range."

      "content": "Choose your rep range, set range, and weight. You may want to increase or decrease reps and sets based on your experience and fitness level. Remember, a lower rep range for a more inexperienced body builder is 1-5 reps. Medium rep range is 8-12 reps. Higher rep range is 15+ reps. The higher the weight you use, the bigger your muscles will get. However, you will want to increase reps and weights gradually so you don't injure yourself. A good rule for muscle building is to start at a lower rep and increase the weight before increasing reps. Beginners should try using lighter weights with lower reps to get started, then gradually increase."

Place your feet on the floor on either side of the bench and tuck them back so they are under your knees. Lift your shoulders off of the bench and retract them by squeezing your shoulder blades together. Use your feet to anchor your back muscles into the bench and tighten your abs.

On your rest days, you might consider incorporating foam rolling, stretching, and light cardio into your routine. [4] X Expert Source Julian Arana, M.S.eD., NCSF-CPT Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview. 16 March 2020. Without recovery days, your musculoskeletal system, nervous system, and immune system will become compromised because of the stress that weightlifting puts on your body. This puts you are greater risk for injury, illness, muscle weakness, and mood changes. Working out without recovery puts your body into stress and it releases certain hormones, such as cortisol. These can have negative effects on your body With recovery, your body compensates and repairs from the stress of weight training. On your rest day, drink plenty of water and eat healthy meals. If you must workout, do a simple cardiovascular workout and toning exercises without weights."

This ratio is said to promote muscle and bone health. Nutritional studies have shown that you should get at least 15% of your diet from protein. There are both animal and plant based sources of protein. Go for lean sources of protein such as seafood, poultry with no skin, lean beef and pork cuts. Other lean sources of protein are skim milk and low fat cheeses. Plant based sources of protein are soy and nuts.

[6] X Research source Have a protein rich food 20 minutes before each workout. Have another protein rich food just after a workout as well. For example, drinking 8 ounces of skim milk and having a yogurt afterwards is a good way to get protein in before and after. Current research suggests that protein is more viable as a nutrition source if it is split up into small quantities throughout the day. Women should opt for 80 grams of protein split up over 4 meals. Men should try to get at least 100 grams of protein a day, split up over 4 meals."

[7] X Research source Melons such as cantaloupe are fast digesting because they are low in fructose (the sugar found naturally in fruit). This is good for body builders because slow digesting carbohydrates are not as optimal for muscle building. Spinach is very rich in nutrients such as iron and other vitamins. Spinach also contains glutamine, which helps to grow lean muscle. Specific types of polyphenols in apples can help to initiate lean muscle growth as well as prevent muscle fatigue. Apples are also a great fat burning source, so they are a good type of carbohydrate to eat before a workout."

Other grains like quinoa are also good for body building and general nutrition. Quinoa is packed with nutrients including protein and carbohydrates. It is associated with release of insulin related factors which promote healthy muscle growth and fat loss. Quinoa is also a slow burning carb. In small quantities, it can provide lasting energy throughout the day."
