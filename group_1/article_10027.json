      "title": "Put the white rice, broth, salt, and pepper into a saucepan.",
      "content": "Put the white rice, broth, salt, and pepper into a saucepan. Set a 2 US qt (1.9 L) saucepan on the stove and put 1 1/2 cups (286 g) of long-grain white rice into it along with 2 1 ⁄ 2 cups (0.59 L) of chicken broth. Then, add as much salt and pepper as you like. To add a richer flavor, sauté 1 chopped shallot in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) (28 g) of butter over medium heat before you put the rice in the pan."
    },
    {
      "title": "Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.",
      "content": "Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Turn the burner up to medium-high so the broth begins to bubble. Keep the lid off of the saucepan so you can see when the broth begins to boil. Then, turn the burner down to medium so it bubbles gently. [2] X Research source"
    },
    {
      "title": "Cover the pan and cook the rice for 15 to 17 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the pan and cook the rice for 15 to 17 minutes. Put a tight-fitting lid on the saucepan and cook the rice without lifting the lid off. This ensures that the rice absorbs the chicken broth and finishes steaming without moisture escaping. [3] X Research source If there's still broth visible in the pan after 17 minutes, put the lid back on and cook the rice for another 2 to 3 minutes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish it with fresh parsley.",
      "content": "Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish it with fresh parsley. Turn off the burner and remove the lid. If you used thyme or garlic, use tongs or a fork to remove them. Then, fluff the rice with the tines of the fork and sprinkle 1 tablespoon (3 g) of freshly chopped parsley on the rice before serving it. [4] X Research source Refrigerate leftover rice in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Keep in mind that the rice will dry out the longer it's stored."
    },
    {
      "title": "Toast the brown rice for 5 minutes if you want it to have a nutty flavor.",
      "content": "Toast the brown rice for 5 minutes if you want it to have a nutty flavor. Pour 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of olive oil into a saucepan and turn the burner to medium. Carefully tilt the pan so the oil coats the bottom. Then, add 1 cup (190 g) of long-grain brown rice and cook it for 5 minutes to add a rich, nutty flavor. [5] X Research source Shake the pan occasionally to help the rice toast evenly. If you don't want to toast the rice, skip this step."

    {
      "title": "Add chicken broth, water, and salt to the pan.",
      "content": "Add chicken broth, water, and salt to the pan. Stir in 1 1 ⁄ 2 cups (350 ml) of chicken broth, 1 cup (240 ml) of water, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of kosher salt. If you prefer a much stronger chicken flavor, you could replace the water with more chicken broth. Use homemade or storebought chicken broth."

    {
      "title": "Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat.",
      "content": "Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat. Keep the lid off of the saucepan so you can see when the liquid comes to a vigorous boil. There's no need to stir the mixture at this point."

    {
      "title": "Cover the pan and simmer the rice over medium-low for 40 minutes.",
      "content": "Cover the pan and simmer the rice over medium-low for 40 minutes. Put a tight-fitting lid on the saucepan and turn the burner down so the liquid bubbles gently. Cook the rice for 40 minutes without lifting the lid. If you lift the lid as the rice is cooking, steam will escape and the rice won't become tender."
    },
    {
      "title": "Turn off the burner and let the rice rest for 10 minutes.",
      "content": "Turn off the burner and let the rice rest for 10 minutes. Once the rice has swollen and absorbed all of the liquid, turn off the burner. Keep the lid on the pan and let the rice sit for 10 minutes. The rice will finish cooking as it sits. If you skip this step, your rice might be gummy or sticky."

    {
      "title": "Fluff the rice with a fork and scatter parsley over it.",
      "content": "Fluff the rice with a fork and scatter parsley over it. Wear oven mitts to remove the lid and break up the rice with the tines of a fork. If you'd like the rice to have a fresher flavor, sprinkle ¼ cup (5 g) of freshly chopped parsley over it before serving. Store the leftover rice in an airtight container for up to 4 days."
