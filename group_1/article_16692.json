      "title": "Try to be as stealthy as possible.",
      "content": "Try to be as stealthy as possible. The first rule of present-peeking is that you search only when you’re sure your parents won't catch you. Preferably, search while they’re not home. If that’s not an option, search while they’re busy elsewhere in the house. It helps to have a quick place to hide if you hear someone coming. You can also search at night if you think you could do so without getting caught. However, be extremely careful. Don't do this if anyone you live with has violent reactions or owns a gun. You could be mistaken for a burglar. If you have siblings, try to do this while they're outside the house as well. Many siblings would be more than willing to snitch on you."

      "title": "Do your homework.",
      "content": "Do your homework. No, not your math (but make sure to get that done as well ), your sleuthing homework. Take photos before you search an area, using either a camera or cell phone. Snap a few pictures of how everything is arranged before you touch any of it. Make sure you capture every angle, because if even one small thing is out of place, your hard work will be for nothing. When you’re done snooping, use the pictures to put everything back in its right place. It’ll be like you were never there. Be sure to delete the photos when you’re finished! Especially if this isn't your own camera, or your parents or siblings have access to it, this is definitely foolproof evidence if you're caught."

      "title": "Start with the obvious places.",
      "content": "Start with the obvious places. Your parents’ bedroom is the most likely candidate, so start in the closet and under the bed (some parents are careless like this). Then move on to hall closets, high shelves, or anything that’s out of reach. [1] X Research source Check inside bags. If your presents aren’t wrapped yet (or your parents are sneaky), there might be goodies inside plain paper and plastic bags. Look inside rooms that are suddenly locked around Christmas. Look through the keys on your parents’ key chains. Indoor locks (the kind with just the small hole in the knob) are just privacy locks, and can usually be opened with a tiny screwdriver. [2] X Research source If your parents like spy movies, make sure they haven't put a piece of tape or something in the door so they can tell if somebody opens the door."

      "title": "Move on to the other rooms, no matter how innocent they may appear.",
      "content": "Move on to the other rooms, no matter how innocent they may appear. A really crafty parent might even hide things in your own bedroom! Search all nooks and crannies, including cabinets, closets, vents, suitcases, and the spaces between sofa pillows. Don’t disregard anything if you really want to find those presents! Try looking in \"off the beaten path\" places, like laundry baskets and under the bathroom sink. You never know what you'll find. Look through every box you find. Especially devious parents may even hide your gifts in a box with something unsuspecting like 'tax returns' or 'spare bedding' written on it."

      "title": "Search areas that aren't part of the main house.",
      "content": "Search areas that aren't part of the main house. Look in the storage room, basement, garage, sun-room, attic, shed, or storm cellar if you have one. Look under the deck or patio as well."

    {
      "title": "Look inside your parents’ cars.",
      "content": "Look inside your parents’ cars. Your parents might be keeping gifts there until they think it’s safe to bring them inside. Don’t forget to check the glove box. Also look in roof or bike storage units. They may be locked, but the key is easy to find if you know where your parents usually keep their keys."

      "content": "Search your parents’ workplace, especially if they own their own business. Only do this if your parents bring you to work for some reason. Be very careful not to get into important documents or any of their coworkers' belongings; this might get you into serious trouble ."

      "title": "Check your relative or neighbor’s house.",
      "content": "Check your relative or neighbor’s house. If your family is very close with friends or family members who live nearby, your parents might have kept your presents with them for safekeeping. Only try this if you’re going to be over there anyway; never try to sneak in uninvited. Again, don’t search any 'personal' areas that might get you into trouble (such as bedrooms or home offices). Be warned that some gifts you find at a relative's house may not be for you, especially if they have any children of their own."

      "title": "Search for receipts if all else fails.",
      "content": "Search for receipts if all else fails. These could be in the dresser, the car, mom’s purse, or dad’s wallet. You might also find a product description or purchase confirmation in your parents' email inbox or internet history if they bought your presents online. Also try to look for plastic bags that may reveal where they went shopping. Unless you're extremely careful, looking for receipts in mom’s purse or dad’s wallet is a bad idea. If you're caught you'll be in huge trouble. It's almost impossible to put papers and receipts back exactly as they were. Be extra careful if you decide to snoop on your parent’s computer. This is a serious violation of privacy and can ruin your entire family’s Christmas."

    {
      "title": "Check out the box.",
      "content": "Check out the box. If it's sealed tight, don't try to open it—wrapping paper can tear very easily, and if the wrapping paper tears, you will probably be caught. If there is any gap in the paper, you might be able to see the color of the box, and at least figure out where they were shopping. If it's almost square and about 5-inches (140 mm) long, it's obviously a CD. Just think about saying anything to your parents about your favorite CD that you want, and that's probably what it is. If it's slim, rigid and rectangular, it's most likely a DVD or video game, especially if you hear a distinctive disc rattling sound when you shake it. A similarly shaped present that dips inwards on all but one of the edges is a hardback book, and if it's slightly bendy it's a paperback book. If it's a long, soft rectangle that's not too deep, it might be clothes. Soft and roughly cylindrical presents could be socks. If a squishy present is unusually round or otherwise oddly shaped, it's likely a stuffed toy. A box that is larger on the bottom, and has a really skinny top, is usually either two similar gifts wrapped together or a game of some sort. If there's a second, smaller box taped to the the outside, it's probably batteries for the game. If the box is about the size of a shoe box, feel around the sides of the box, near the top. If there's a lip, you can be pretty certain you have new shoes! If it's a very long and thin cuboid, try not to drool; you've probably got some candy. Long, very light cylinders are surely posters, and square flat ones usually turn out to be calendars."

    {
      "title": "Shake the box.",
      "content": "Shake the box. Does it make any rattling noises, or can you feel something move inside when you shake? If it does, try to describe what you hear. If you hear chime sounds, it might be a music box; if you hear thumps, it could be something inside something else. If you hear broken glass, put the box down! If you hear broken glass, you may have already broken something inside. Take a quick peek inside the box if you hear this, and if something is broken, go apologize to your parents. It's better to tell the truth now and face the consequences than lying your way out of it later."
    },
    {
      "title": "Smell the box.",
      "content": "Smell the box. Some presents, especially candy and bath bombs, can be identified by their scent wafting through the wrapping paper. Take a sniff at the corners of the box, where there might be tiny gaps in the paper that allow smells to escape."

    {
      "title": "Beware the large box.",
      "content": "Beware the large box. Parents are tricky—often times, they will put a small box inside a larger box, especially if the shape of the small box would give up the secret of what's inside. [3] X Research source If the box is large, but is not very heavy, you can be pretty sure it's not packed with clothing, books, or other heavier things. Some parents booby-trap presents that are already wrapped by putting them inside bigger boxes stuffed with paper, packing peanuts or other things to reduce sound when you shake them. If you can’t guess what a large present is based on its size, this might be why. Truly clever parents will nest smaller boxes inside larger boxes if they catch you snooping. You'll open one box, and find another and then another. Your Big Present may actually turn out to be a gag gift, like a magic decoder ring, or some other silly stocking stuffer. [4] X Research source Never dismiss a small box. It could turn out to be something valuable such as a mobile phone, jewelry, gift cards or even concert tickets."

      "title": "Dig deeper",
      "content": "Dig deeper . If the paper wrapping the present is slick and shiny, you can try peeling off the taped ends. Take great caution with this, because wrapping paper tears easily. Unless you have more of the same wrapping paper, you could ruin your sleuthing expedition. Peel off one end only, if you can. If you manage to loosen up one end, you'll be able to get a peek at the sides of your present. Beware of bows and ribbons. Never remove a bow from a wrapped present, as these are practically impossible to put back on looking pristine."

      "content": "Plan present peeking around your life, not the other way around. If 90% of your activities around the holidays are you disappearing to the basement with a flashlight, someone will definitely get suspicious. Remember to only search when you are sure no one is watching and you won't get caught. Similarly, don't search in one of your parents' or siblings' favorite spots, such as their rooms or offices, when they are home. They could go there at any time and you will have great difficulty being stealthy."

      "content": "Keep your tools or supplies at inconspicuous places where they won't be seen by anyone else. If you have a notebook full of your notes about what you've found, your brother or sister could easily find it and have a ton of reasons to snitch on you. Keep it somewhere safe like under your mattress, or keep it digital, such as in a text editor. Be careful keeping a digital log if you use a shared computer."

      "content": "Keep your grades up. If you bring home an F on a test or a D on a project because you avoided studying or working in favor of snooping, you will likely be punished, which could even mean getting one of your presents taken away. If you can, try to get even better grades around the holidays. This way, even if you get caught peeking at presents, your parents may punish you less or even not at all because of your good grades. Similarly, be on your best overall behavior and stay out of trouble."

      "content": "Try to hide. If you hear someone coming, you've got to think quick - and the best first step would be to find somewhere to hide. You may not be able to get out for a few minutes, so don't choose an overly uncomfortable or creepy spot. For example, if you were hiding in the living room, hide behind the couch or the armchair."

      "content": "Try to act like you're doing something normal. Quickly put your supplies in an inconspicuous place, and pretend to be playing on your phone or something normal. Make sure it's something your parents will believe that you are doing; if you are in the laundry room and you say you are taking a nap, it is highly unlikely your story will convince them."

If your excuses don't work, you may get in even more trouble for lying to them. Say something like this: \"Mom, I'm sorry that I went looking for my Christmas presents. I know you like surprising me with gifts at Christmastime and I ruined it for you. I promise I won't go snooping around again.\""

Thus, if you were caught, you are accepting that you took a large gamble and are accepting the ramifications. This includes any punishments your parents want to give you. This could be as simple as a verbal warning, or as severe as taking away all of your presents. However, if you apologize sincerely, say you won't snoop again, and not talk back while your parents lecture you, they may punish you less. If your parents say they will take away presents, don't argue. By snooping, you are ruining the surprise, so you may actually be happier not having any spoilers."

      "content": "Try not to snoop again. Once you get caught, your parents will probably be keeping an extra close watch on you to make sure you don't snoop again. If you suspect your parents are watching, don't snoop or do anything related to snooping. If they have relaxed their rules after you getting caught, you would likely be okay trying to hunt for presents a little bit more. Just remember to do this at your own risk only."
