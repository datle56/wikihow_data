      "content": "Purchase your plane ticket in advance. This can be done either online or through your airline. This will save you time at the airport since you won't have to buy your ticket there. If the online ticket purchase gives you the option to print out your boarding pass, this is recommended, especially if you are not checking bags."

      "content": "Pack your bags, keeping in mind that you can only have one piece of luggage and a smaller, carry-on item with you on board the plane. Make your bag identifiable by tying a ribbon on it or putting a tag on it, or you can use a colorful/unique bag. This can save you time and confusion if your bag ends up looking similar to someone else's. When you pack any liquid items in your carry-on, such as lotion, shampoo, body oils, etc., make sure they are 3 oz. or less. Keep them together in a plastic Ziploc bag, and remember the rule 3-1-1, containers must be 3.4 ounces or less, stored in a 1 quart/liter zip-top bag and only 1 zip-top bag per person.

These should be indicated by signs outside the terminal building on the departures roadway, as well as their logos on the wall and above the counters. Get in line and wait until you are asked to come forward. There is usually a bin that allows you to see if your luggage is small enough to go on the plane or if you have to check it. Also, keep in mind you may only have one piece of luggage and one smaller carry-on item. Have your ID on hand."

The agent will tag it, and either place it on the conveyor belt behind the counter, or tell you to carry it over to a scanner. If not, tell them you have nothing to check. In either case, they will then hand you your boarding pass unless you printed it online. If you do not have bags to check and checked in online, you can skip this step entirely. You can get your boarding pass on the airline's website and print it. Pull it up on your phone in the airline's app. Or print it at the airport."

If you have a Ziploc bag of liquids in your bag, remove it to be screened on its own. If you have any objects that would show up on the x-ray as a box, such as a laptop, tablet or video game system, remove it and send it through separately. Take off any jackets or sweatshirts, as those need to be screened as well. Remove all metal objects, including keys, jewelry, belts, etc. Then, remove your shoes and place them on the belt. If you get confused, just ask a security worker politely and they should be able to help you."
