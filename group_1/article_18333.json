I lost them here 5 months ago!” “Welcome home from prison! We knew you didn’t kill and eat those people.” “We don’t like you at all. Go home!” “Welcome, sister wife!” “[Name], will you marry me?” “Innocent! Congrats! We knew it was self-defense.” “Welcome home! I have the imodium you asked for.” “Welcome back! I hope your colonoscopy went well!” “Welcome to your new home! Our polygamy community is eager to meet you.” “Welcome home! Congrats on escaping that cult!” “Welcome home!
