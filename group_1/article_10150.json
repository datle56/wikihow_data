      "content": "Break your problems up into small steps to make them less overwhelming. While it can be appealing to hide from your problems and pretend that they don't exist, it's much better to face them head on if you can. Dealing with your problems , whether it is having a hard conversation or changing a problematic behavior, will serve you much better in the long run than making you problems bigger by ignoring them. Do a little work at a time. Build up your tolerance to the feelings brought up by working on your problems by addressing the problems gradually. For instance, perhaps you are unemployed and need a job. Don't expect to write your resume, get references, find the perfect job, and get the job all in one week. Instead, focus just on one piece of that at a time, so that each step is a victory."

If you can not get help or support from your family, then your best course of action is to create friendships that can serve this function.
