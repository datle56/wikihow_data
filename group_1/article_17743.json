      "content": "In a healthy relationship, both partners should get back what they give. In an emotionally draining relationship, though, you might be investing tons of effort without actually having your basic needs met. Before either of you can take care of each other's needs, you need to communicate them with each other. [4] X Research source Come up with a list of basic requirements that you need in order to be happy in the relationship. This may be loyalty, a certain level of physical affection, mutual independence, and maybe a bit of reassurance. Encourage your partner to come up with their own list. Share your lists with each other. Together, you can brainstorm how to meet each other's needs in an emotionally sustainable way. This way, the two of you are more likely to put in effort that has positive effects on the relationship."

      "content": "At the end of the day, a draining relationship needs fixing on both sides. If during a fight, you're both only focused on your own individual interests, it’s going to be really tough to get things resolved. When you’re fighting or falling into a negative pattern, try to center your relationship’s goals first. Encourage your partner to do the same. [5] X Research source If you’re fighting about who will unload the dishwasher, don’t think of your interests as competing. One of you might insist that their day was more tiring, and so they shouldn’t have to. The other might say that they did it last time, so they shouldn’t have to. Combine your interests and focus on compromise. For instance, you could say, “The dishwasher needs to be unloaded regardless. I get you’re tired, so I’ll do it. But next time, I’d like you to, so we’re sharing an equal load.”"

To start a conversation about both partners’ perceptions of your relationship, try this exercise below. [6] X Research source Consider six core parts of your relationship: communication, connection, investment, enjoyment, growth, trust. You and your partner should take time to reflect. Then, assign each category a score, 1-10, depending on how well your relationship does in that area. Use your scores' similarities and differences to start a conversation about your relationship's strengths and weaknesses. Commit to working on one area of weakness each week and check in on how you both feel you did."

      "content": "Mismatched attachment styles can cause emotional drain. Attachment styles can be secure, anxious, or avoidant. Combinations of two of the three styles exist as well, though they’re uncommon. A person’s attachment style comes from their experiences early in life, but they can be altered with therapy and hard work. [7] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Secure attachment style refers to an individual’s ability to feel connected to partners, secure in those connections, and still capable of independence. Anxious attachment styles indicate a person’s insecurity and emotional hunger in relationships. They can become clingy, demanding, or possessive. Avoidant attachment styles refer to a fear of closeness with their partners. They ignore relationships' significance, shut down emotionally, and avoid intimacy. Other combinations exist, and you can identify your style through online quizzes, research, and reflection. Attachment styles can be excellent tools to talk about patterns in your relationship. They can also help you reflect on your own needs."

Constant spats don't need to be the end of the world, but if you can't find a way to de-escalate your arguments, that could cause major emotional drain. If every little disagreement ends up being a giant, hurtful argument, both of you will end up feeling deflated. Try out these helpful tips and tricks below to defuse your fights. [8] X Research source Use humor. When a fight pops up, try using a little silliness to keep things light. For example, if you do an impression that makes your partner laugh, respond to a question in that voice. Try touching. Go in for a hug, reach for your partner’s hand, or throw an arm around their shoulder. Take a break. If you feel things escalating, spend a minute cooling off in separate rooms. Even just a quick pause can make a huge different!"

Sometimes, when you and your partner are in the thick of an argument, the last thing you’ll want to do is admit you were wrong. In that moment, it may feel more like admitting defeat. But in reality, to end your fight (and emotional drain) in a healthy way, letting your guard down is the key. [9] X Research source First, tell your partner that you understand what you did to hurt them. Next, let your partner know that you are sympathetic to how they feel. The more fights that you can end quickly and positively, the less emotional drain you and your partner will feel."

      "content": "Too much complaining can harm an otherwise healthy relationship. It’s great to know your partner can rely on you as a sounding board, but too much negativity can leave one of you feeling drained and the other, unheard. When complaints from one partner wear out the patience, energy, or attention span on the other, the listening ear can end up feeling totally emotionally burnt out. [10] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source If you tend to be the complainer, try screening some of your worries out. Ask yourself if you need support, or if you're complaining to complain. If you really need help, you should be able to share with your partner. If not, find a positive spin to your comment instead. If you’re the listening ear, try to be there when you sense that your partner really needs it. On the other hand, don't make a big deal out of every little complaint. Offer a simple, supportive remark without opening up an entire discussion."

Reach out to your primary care doctor to get a referral for a great therapist in your area or try asking friends and family for a recommendation.
