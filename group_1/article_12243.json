Do not take this literally - if you would rather the situation closed peacefully without you having to fight, you there are a range of techniques you could try in attempt to end the fight before it has even started. Grab the phone nearest to you. Dial for the police, but do not call yet. Place the phone to your ear. Tell the intruder that if he does not leave in peace, you will call. Do this, no matter whether they leave or not. But giving the fugitive a chance to leave without your possessions is more productive, as it cannot be guaranteed that the police will capture the criminal. Take a photo of the intruder, if they are not disguised. Say you will leak it to the police, the media, and the Internet, if they do not drop any weapons and leave at that instant."

Use your common sense, and only do what's necessary in the emergency situation. If the intruder has a weapon, an unsuccessful physical attack is likely to put yourself in more danger; be smart, and only use these techniques as a last resort."

Use this with caution, as if you lose your balance it is possible that they could ruin you in an instant. [4] X Research source First, straighten your left leg and bring your right leg up to the height of your left thigh. Secondly, swivel the right leg (still standing on your left) from right to left. This is to block a punch or to hook in their arm. Bring your right leg higher, preparing for the maximum power. Propel your leg forwards with as much force as you can muster. You should now be powerfully kicking the hand holding the blade, and with luck, if performed correctly, the weapon will fly from their hand."

It is difficult to master, but should protect your face and stomach from being injured in combat. Start off with your right fist near your jaw and right elbow resting on your chest. Your left elbow should rest on your hip, the fist protecting your navel. Bring the left arm up to protect your forehead, and your right arm should move further to your right, and complete a full circle of the outside area. As you finish the circle with your right arm, bring your left back down to protect your right shoulder, and overlap your right arm to create a cross shape. Bring your right fist down to point towards your feet, relaxing your elbow, and move the left fist up to protect your jawline."

Try to find this if you own one. It is not advisable to shoot unless the other party, also, are armed, due to the legal implications. The damage you do in self-defence must be thought appropriate for the situation - for example, if you are up against an unarmed intruder who lacks in muscle, then yes the law still protects you, but your plea of self defence would be compromised by the fact that a gun would not have been necessary to conquer your opponent. Any damage you do must be enough to protect you, no more than this, so strongly evaluate the situation before jumping right in and firing shots . [8] X Research source"

This should be out of the way, but somewhere you genuinely think they'll walk past. As they walk past, you have to make an extremely bold move that would not be suggested unless your situation was life-threatening, or you were being pursued. Wait until they're just about to walk past your hiding place, and put them in a headlock from behind. Use two hands - this is not usual, but they might be able to escape if your grip is not secure. Then, wrestle the gun from them. You don't necessarily have to pull the trigger if this troubles you greatly, but keeping the gun safely out of your opponent's way should make you feel safer."

Sneak up on them as stealthily as possible, holding your breath, and hit their head from behind. This should alarm them, and buy you time to wrestle the gun from them and run."

Gouging, poking or scratching your opponent's eyes is very effective as not only does it hurt them but it impairs their vision, giving you an escape opportunity. Do this if you are extremely close to your partner - it is not a move worth performing if there is a gap between the two of you. The nose. Contrary to popular belief, the best time to target the nose is when you are directly in front of or diagonal to your partner, no gap between you. Go for a smack aimed upwards, throwing your entire body into the move. This will force an opponent to loosen their grip on you, and cause immense discomfort. If you are being pursued by an opponent (so they are behind you), elbow their nose or strike a side punch. The neck. The side of the neck is a perfect target if you want to hurt the opposition, but not cause too much damage. Stunning the attacker with a knife-hand strike (whereby your hand is flat as if to slap them, but horizontal) to the throat or even elbow the throat of the assailant for maximum damage. The knee. The knee is an easy target because it cannot be defended with fists and is vulnerable from every angle. Kick the side of the knee with vigor to harm and cause your partner to stagger. A kick to the front of the knee would also do the trick, but is less likely to cause an imbalance. Below the ear. A strike to the area just below the ear will cause severe damage when performed correctly. This can cause death to the partner if executed too strongly, so be very wary. The throat. Take your palm upwards to their nose, which will push their head backwards. This leaves their throat exposed. You can use this opportunity to punch their adam's apple or bash in their neck."

A side kick to the stomach of someone harming you might be your last hope. To execute it right, simply bring up the leg on the side of the person you plan on kicking, jab them whilst sliding your opposite foot back slightly, and aim as high as possible.
