      "title": "Check the syllabus for the answer first.",
      "content": "Check the syllabus for the answer first. Often, the question you would like to ask has already been answered in the material the professor has provided at the beginning of class. Asking a professor to go over this again makes you look like you are not a serious student, and it frustrates the professor because it wastes their time. [1] X Research source Your syllabus may contain information about course assignments, deadlines, class policies, and assignment formatting. If your professor only gives you a list of readings, it's fine to email them with a question that isn't answered in the syllabus."

      "title": "Use your academic account.",
      "content": "Use your academic account. Professors are deluged with emails every day. By using your school account, you'll have a better chance of avoiding the spam filter. Plus, your school email looks more professional. It also lets the professor know who's actually sending the email, as school emails are usually based on your name. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Include a strong subject line.",
      "content": "Include a strong subject line. A subject line clues your professor in to what the email is about before they open it. That can be helpful because they can set aside an appropriate amount of time to deal with it. Make sure the subject line is clear and to the point.

    {
      "title": "Start",
      "content": "Start with a greeting using the professor's title and surname. It can be tempting to just plunge into your request. However, when you're writing to a professor, you need to treat it more like you would a formal letter. Begin with \"Dear Dr. Jones,\" followed by a comma. Make sure to use the professor's last name. [4] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA Academic & School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. If you're not sure if the professor has a doctorate, you can address them as \"Professor Jones.\" You can use a bit more informal greeting, such as \"Hello Dr. Jones,\" if you've had personal interactions with the professor."

      "title": "Remind the professor who you are.",
      "content": "Remind the professor who you are. Professors have many students to keep track of, and they'll need to be reminded of who you are.

      "title": "Stick to the point.",
      "content": "Stick to the point. Professors are busy people, so you don't want to drag out your email. Say what you need to say as briefly as possible, leaving out any extraneous details. For instance, if you have a question about an assignment, get to the point: \"I have a question about the assignment you gave us last Tuesday. Do you want us to work in groups or alone?\""

      "title": "Write in complete sentences.",

That means you need to use complete sentences when writing to your professor, as anything less does not look professional.

      "content": "Work on tone. When you're first contacting a professor, keep your tone and language very professional. That means no emojis! If you develop a correspondence with your professor, you may find that you can get a bit more relaxed as the semester goes on. That's particularly true if your professor initiates a bit of informality (such as by sending an emoji in an email to you). [8] X Research source"

      "content": "Make requests politely. Many students try to demand things from their professors. That will get you nowhere. Instead, phrase your issue as a request that the professor can grant or not. [9] X Expert Source Ashley Pritchard, MA Academic & School Counselor Expert Interview. 4 November 2019. For instance, you may want the professor to give you an extension on a paper . Don't say, \"My grandmother died.

      "title": "Spell out words.",
      "content": "Spell out words. As much as text language is taking over the internet, professional emails are one place where you should leave it behind.

If necessary, write a more extensive email using these same guidelines to keep it professional. If your problem or question is not being adequately resolved by email, ask for an appointment to meet in person. For instance, you could say, \"Thank you for addressing my question. I'll see you in class.\" If you'd like to meet, you could write, \"I appreciate your thoughts on this issue. Would you mind if we met in person to discuss it in more detail?\""
