      "content": "Use coconut oil for an easy, lightweight oil treatment for all hair types. Coconut oil is a popular choice for hot oil treatments because it’s lightweight and absorbs easily. This means it will help moisturize and protect your hair without leaving a greasy film. Choose coconut oil if you want extra moisture or aren’t sure which oil is right for you. [1] X Research source It’s normal for coconut oil to be solid at room temperature. However, it will melt when it’s heated, making it easy to apply to your hair."

      "content": "Try avocado oil if your hair is dry. Avocado oil will add extra moisture to your hair and may improve the texture of your hair, as well. It’s a great option if your hair is really dry because it adds more moisture than lightweight oils but isn’t so thick that it sits on your hair shaft. Pick avocado oil as a treatment for dry or very dry hair. [2] X Research source Avocado oil retains its nutrients even when it’s heated to high temperatures, so it’s easy to use for hot oil treatments."

      "content": "Choose olive oil if you want to protect your ends from splitting. Olive oil is packed with vitamins, so it’s great for at-home beauty treatments. [6] X Research source However, it’s also a heavier oil, so it may not absorb as well as other lightweight oils, like coconut oil. [7] X Research source Because it coats your shaft, it will help protect your ends. Use it if you’d like to prevent split ends. Don’t use a lot of olive oil on your hair, as it will weigh your hair down and might cause it to look greasy. Apply just enough to create a thin layer on your hair. When using olive oil, apply more oil to the ends of your hair than to your roots so your hair won’t look greasy."

Next, divide your hair from ear-to-ear to create a total of 4 sections. Use hair clips to secure each section in place until you’re ready to apply the oil. If your hair is thick, divide your hair along your temples and from ear-to-ear to create 6 total sections."

      "content": "Sit under a hooded dryer or wear a heat cap to help the oil absorb. Heat helps open your hair shaft so the oil can penetrate your hair. The hot oil will already open your hair shaft some, but applying additional heat will help your treatment work better. Use a hooded dryer on a low setting or a heat cap if you have one. [12] X Research source As another option, steam your hair by draping a hot, moist face cloth over your shower cap. Seal in the steam by placing a second shower cap over the face cloth to trap in the moisture."
