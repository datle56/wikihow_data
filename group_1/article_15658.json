      "title": "😴 can mean someone’s going to bed soon.",
      "content": "😴 can mean someone’s going to bed soon. When someone’s right on the brink of falling asleep and going to dreamland, they might send you 😴 to let you know. The sender is probably just barely awake and sending you this cute emoji to wish you a good night. [1] X Research source “I’m soooo tired 🥱 I think I’m gonna go to bed soon 😴” “It’s only 9 and I’m literally already in bed ready to sleep 😴🛌” “If I don’t reply to you it’s probably because I already fell asleep 😴” “Good night 😴 I’ll be up in about 15 hours lol.”"

      "title": "Someone might send 😴 if they’re exhausted from the day.",
      "content": "Someone might send 😴 if they’re exhausted from the day. 😴 is also a good emoji to send when you’ve had a really long and tiring day. Even if the day isn’t over yet, someone might still send 😴 to let you know that they’re exhausted. Maybe they had a lot of work to do or it’s just been a really long week. Whatever the case may be, 😴 will likely perfectly express their feelings. “I’m literally about to pass out 😴 This week has been sooo long and it’s only Wednesday 😫” “😴😴 Wake me up when it’s the weekend.” “This project is seriously taking it out of me 😴😭” “I have so much homework to do 😢 I need a nap before I can even think about starting 😴”"

      "title": "Someone might send 😴 when they're bored.",
      "content": "Someone might send 😴 when they're bored. Have you ever been so bored that you could’ve just fallen asleep? That might be exactly what someone texting you is feeling when they send you 😴. It might also be their way of saying whatever they’re currently doing or talking about doesn’t particularly interest them. “This lecture is so boring I’m literally about to fall asleep 😴” “Hopefully I don’t fall asleep behind the wheel waiting for traffic to clear up 😴🚗🚙🚕” “I’ve been waiting for customer service for like an hour already 😠😴” “I’m zoning out so much right now lol. I have no idea what my family is talking about 😴”"

      "title": "Wish them a good night.",
      "content": "Wish them a good night. Send them a nice good night message and tell them to have plenty of sweet dreams. Even if they fall asleep before they actually read your message, they’ll definitely appreciate the thought! “Sleep tight! Don’t let the bed bugs bite 😊❤️” “Good night then! 🌙💤 I’ll text you tomorrow!” “Get good sleep! 😴 You’ll need lots of energy tomorrow.”"

      "content": "Encourage them to get through the day. If someone is sending 😴 along with a message about how exhausted they are, send them some supportive and encouraging words to motivate them. Throw in some other lovely emojis as well, like smiley faces and hearts, to give them extra positive energy. “You got this! 💜💪” “The day will be over before you know it. Then you can go home and relax 😊” “Let me know if you need any help 🥰”"

If the other person is on the brink of dozing off due to boredom or disinterest, send them something funny or interesting to keep them entertained. Text them a joke or a silly question to keep them alert and a bit more energized. “Want me to tell you this funny story about my coworker to keep you entertained? 😆” “To pass the time, think about this: Does a straw have 1 hole or 2? 🤔🤔” “Here’s a joke to make you laugh. Knock knock 🚪🚪 (Who’s there?) Water 💦 (Water who?) Water you doing on your phone? Pay attention to your class!”"

Use these 2 emojis together to really get the point across that you’re feeling sleepy, exhausted, or bored. “I really want to take a nap right about now 😪😴” “I have a feeling this meeting is going to go on for at least another 2 hours 😪😭”"

Or maybe you’re super bored and need someone to entertain you. Either way, 🥱 is the perfect emoji to add. “The person I’m talking to is not interesting in the slightest 🥱” “I hate having to wake up early on a Monday morning 🥱😞”"
