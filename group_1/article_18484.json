      "content": "A yellow light usually means the sensors aren’t communicating properly. Garage doors have sensors located on both sides of the door to make sure the door can close safely. On most models, the sensor light is green when everything is functioning properly, but turns yellow if the sensors aren’t communicating. The most common reasons a sensor light might be yellow are: [1] X Research source The lens is dirty and the debris is preventing the sensors from communicating. The sensors aren’t facing each other directly and have become misaligned. An object is in between the sensors and blocking them from communicating. The sensor’s wires are frayed or it isn’t receiving power. Check your owner’s manual to determine what a yellow light means for your make and model. It may differ depending on if you have a Liftmaster , Chamberlain , Craftsman, or other brand of garage door. In most cases, if one sensor light is green and the other is yellow, the issue is only with the sensor that’s yellow."

      "content": "On some models, a yellow light means everything is working properly. While a yellow light usually indicates that something is wrong with the sensor, some garage door models intentionally have both a green and a yellow light. When both of these lights are on, everything is functioning as it should (the yellow light typically sends a signal that the green light receives). Consult your owner’s manual to see what the light colors mean for your specific make and model. [2] X Research source"

      "title": "Clean the sensor lens.",
      "content": "Clean the sensor lens. Because the sensors are located so close to the ground, it’s easy for them to collect dirt and debris, which can prevent the sensors from connecting with each other. Examine your sensors to see if they have any visible debris, then use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe the lenses clean. [3] X Research source On most makes and models, the yellow light will turn green when the issue is fixed. If it remains yellow, continue troubleshooting to find the problem."

      "title": "Make sure nothing is blocking the sensors.",
      "content": "Make sure nothing is blocking the sensors. Garage door sensors send an infrared beam across the door to each other, ensuring that nothing is blocking the door. If you store things in your garage, make sure nothing is blocking this beam. Move things like bikes, sports equipment, and other belongings a few feet away from the sensors to see if this fixes the problem. [4] X Research source Sensors can be blocked by small items that don’t appear to be in the way, as well, which is why it’s best to keep everything at least a few feet away."

    {
      "title": "Realign the sensors.",
      "content": "Realign the sensors. Garage door sensors need to face each other directly in order to send out the infrared beam. If a sensor gets bumped, it could become misaligned and need to be readjusted. [5] X Research source Turn off the power to the sensors (or garage, in general) and loosen the sensors’ screws. Then, tie a piece of string around the mounting bracket and stretch it across to the opposite side of the garage to properly align the sensors. When the sensors are aligned properly, tighten the screws and turn the power back on to see if your problem is fixed."

      "title": "Make sure the wires aren’t frayed or damaged.",
      "content": "Make sure the wires aren’t frayed or damaged. If nothing else seems to work, it’s possible the sensor’s wires are damaged. Turn off the power to the garage, then closely examine the wires for any damage and make sure they’re connected properly. If you notice any issues, contact a garage door repair specialist, as attempting to fix the problem yourself could be dangerous. [6] X Research source It’s possible the sensors will need to be replaced entirely. If so, the repair specialist should be able to do this, as well."

      "title": "A sensor ensures your garage door closes safely.",
      "content": "A sensor ensures your garage door closes safely. Garage doors have sensors located on both sides of the door, just a few inches above the ground. These sensors shoot an infrared beam from one side to the other to make sure nothing is blocking the door. If something is blocking the door, the beam will be disrupted and the door won’t close. This ensures the garage door won’t accidentally close on someone or something. [7] X Research source"

      "title": "A green light lets you know everything is working properly.",
      "content": "A green light lets you know everything is working properly. Most garage door sensors have a green light to show that the sensor is powered on, correctly aligned, and functioning properly. Unless your sensor’s manual says otherwise, there is usually nothing you need to do if the green light is on. [8] X Research source"

      "title": "A red light means the sensor isn’t functioning properly.",
      "content": "A red light means the sensor isn’t functioning properly. In most cases, a red light means your attention is needed immediately. A red light can indicate several different issues, similar to a yellow light; the sensors may be misaligned, something could be blocking them, or the sensor could have failed altogether. Take the following steps to begin troubleshooting: [9] X Research source Do not attempt to close the door manually or forcefully, as this could be dangerous. Look for any obstacles or blockages that could be interrupting the sensor’s beam. Gently clean the sensor’s lens with a soft, clean cloth to remove any dirt or debris. Make sure the sensors are directly facing each other in perfect alignment. Check your manual for specific instructions for your make and model."

      "content": "An orange light indicates the same issues as a yellow light. In most cases, orange, yellow, and amber sensor lights are used interchangeably, though the meaning may vary depending on the make and model. Check your manual to determine what steps to take, though in general, try the following to troubleshoot: [10] X Research source Clean the sensor lens with a soft, clean cloth to remove dirt and debris. Remove any obstructions that may be blocking the sensor’s beam. Ensure the sensors are in perfect alignment and facing each other directly."

      "content": "Flashing lights often indicate a connection issue. Again, the exact meaning depends on your make and model, so note which color the light is flashing and check your manual for instructions. In general, flashing lights often indicate connection issues, dirty sensors, interference, or faulty sensors. [11] X Research source"

If you’ve already tried everything to fix your garage door sensor and nothing seems to be working, it may be time to call a garage door repair specialist. They can assess the problem and determine if you need to replace the sensor altogether. It’s also a good idea to call a pro if the sensor’s wires are frayed or otherwise damaged, as this can be dangerous to attempt to fix yourself. [12] X Research source"
