Consider how will you achieve your goal. Be as specific as possible to know what is exactly the right course for you. Your goal could be, for example, to lose 5 pounds. Include information on how are you going to do it and by what type of diet. A good example of a goal is: \"My goal is to lose five pounds in two weeks by sticking to a balanced 1,200 calorie-a-day diet and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day.\""

      "content": "Set up a daily calorie limit. If you want to lose five pounds, you'll need to cut out a significant amount of calories each day. To lose 1 – 2 pounds per week, you'll need to burn 500 – 1,000 calories every day. This can be done through cutting calories and adding in exercise. [1] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source When cutting out calories, you must be extremely careful to make sure you are still getting enough nutrients and vitamins from your diet. Working with a dietitian can ensure you get adequate nutrition while dieting. Cutting more calories results in more weight loss. Experts do not recommend consuming fewer than 1,200 calories per day except in medically supervised weight loss programs."

      "content": "Stay motivated. This is probably the hardest part — just sticking to it. If you're severely limiting yourself, it'll be even harder. That's why it's important to not only make efforts to reach your goal, but to make efforts to stick to it. Start a food journal. Make yourself write down everything you eat, drink, and how much exercise you do. Your weak points will stick out and you'll be able to see where you can improve to maximize your results. [2] X Research source Employ a friend. Just having another opinion helps build your confidence. If you have someone else keeping an eye on you (and your journal), you'll be more likely to stay on track.

Think about rewards. Have one set out for when you hit the halfway mark and for when you complete your goal.This could be anything — a mini vacation, a shopping spree, a movie. Just don't make your reward food-related."

      "content": "Be aware of the risks. Losing weight quickly is all about the short-term. The weight a person loses very rarely stays off (especially when they cut carbs for a period of time and then reintroduce them to their diet) — it is often regained rapidly, which is known as \"yo-yo dieting.\" This can lead to coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death in post-menopausal women. [4] X Research source Weight loss should be treated as a long-term commitment and should be the result of lifestyle changes if you want to stay healthy and keep it off."

[5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Lean protein helps fuel your metabolism and can help you feel more satisfied throughout the day. Include a minimum of one to two servings of lean protein at each meal. Measure out at least 3 – 4 oz of protein per serving.

Both fruits and vegetables are fairly low in calorie but also high in fiber, vitamins and minerals. They can add bulk to your meals and keep you feeling more satisfied with lower calories.

Cutting out grains can help you lose weight quickly, but it comes with some serious risks. Instead of cutting them out completely, avoid white or processed grains and stick with whole wheat. Studies have shown that low-carb diets help you lose weight the quickest; however, if you go back to eating carbs after your diet is over, it is extremely likely you will gain the weight right back, which leads to dangerous yo-yo dieting. Focus only on your lean protein and non-starchy vegetables most of the time. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Grains, especially whole grains, can be a part of a healthy diet and are a major source of energy for most people.

Drink two glasses before each meal to reduce your appetite. When your stomach is more full of water, you may be less likely to overeat and be satisfied with less food. Also, when you're dehydrated you may feel hungry, when you're actually just thirsty.

Many promise quick weight loss without much effort on the part of the dieter. Most health professionals recommend not following these types of diet plans.
